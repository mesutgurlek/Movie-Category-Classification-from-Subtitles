1
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,607
You got him! You got him!

2
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,240
Sit down. Get down.

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,154
We ain't never going to find
that damn little redskin.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,122
When I do, I'm going to scalp him.

5
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,180
Go.

6
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,225
The little Injun's somewhere.

7
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,854
Get down.

8
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,389
There's the Reid place.
Come on, we're missing it.

9
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,436
The ranch.

10
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,629
The ranch!

11
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,331
Dad!

12
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,567
Ma! Dad!

13
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,754
Dad!

14
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,814
Ma!

15
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,389
No!

16
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,991
Ma! Ma!

17
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,669
Ma!

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,234
Ma!

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,238
Ma! Ma!

20
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,681
Ma!

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,742
Ma! Ma!

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,425
Ma.

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,857
Ma.

24
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,055
Ma.

25
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,665
Oh, Ma. Why did you...

26
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,263
Why did you have to die?

27
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,439
Though we cannot see
those that are dear to us

28
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,908
does not mean that they
are no longer with us.

29
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,605
Keep your parents alive within you,

30
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,148
and their spirits will never die.

31
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,409
While you are here,

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,216
do not stand apart.

33
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,053
Follow the Indian way.

34
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,093
Be one of us.

35
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,653
Tonto will teach you.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,791
<i>The legend started simply,</i>

37
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,770
<i>just a boy without a home.</i>

38
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,601
<i>Taken in by Indians,</i>

39
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,768
<i>but still pretty much alone.</i>

40
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,812
<i>He had to struggle with strange customs</i>

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,747
<i>and his own fears from within.</i>

42
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,944
<i>He learned the wisdom of the forest.</i>

43
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,045
<i>He learned the ways of the wind.</i>

44
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,154
I recognize my familiar voice

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,496
as a truth bearer that tells me what to do

46
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,501
and what is just

47
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,901
and which trail to follow...

48
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,005
the trail of justice.

49
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,241
Dan? Dan!

50
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,472
Hey, John. Johnny.

51
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,115
Oh, I knew you'd come.

52
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,379
Anyway, Johnny, it's all arranged.

53
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,516
You're gonna go stay
with Aunt Martha in Detroit.

54
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,154
Please, Dan, let me
stay with you, please.

55
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,863
I belong here.

56
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,326
From this moment,

57
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,295
wherever you go,

58
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,991
whatever you do,

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,967
you will always be <i>kemo sabe.</i>

60
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,334
Trusted friend.

61
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,507
Whoa!

62
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,333
Damn dust.

63
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,936
10 to 1 we don't make Del Rio tonight.

64
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,106
Where you want these at?

65
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,779
Wait for what?

66
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,927
That's worth waiting for, all right.

67
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,603
Are you going to Del Rio?

68
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,079
Sure going to try, ma'am.

69
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,378
Need help?

70
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,111
Thank you. I'll manage.

71
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,318
Get on up the road! Come on, boys!

72
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,861
You manage very well.

73
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,128
Would one of you gentlemen
please change places with me?

74
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,464
I can't read riding backwards.

75
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:01,132
I've been in this seat
for three days now, lady.

76
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,607
It's warm and lucky.

77
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,644
I beg your pardon.

78
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,635
Here.

79
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,880
Thank you.

80
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,049
John. John Reid.

81
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,682
Thank you, Mr. Reid.

82
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,271
She's a wonderful writer, isn't she?

83
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,570
Are you familiar with her?

84
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,975
Well, actually,
I prefer <i>Century of Dishonor.</i>

85
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,673
I haven't read it.

86
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,476
Well, you should.

87
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,652
You don't ever go blind. Never.

88
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,220
Dark eyeglasses.

89
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,129
Solar spectacles!

90
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
This is why I came out west.

91
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,932
To manufacture, you know?

92
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,234
You're a man of vision, sir.

93
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,432
Vision?

94
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,974
Very good.

95
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,737
So how about you, young man?

96
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,076
I'm an attorney. I'm starting my practice.

97
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,375
A lawyer.

98
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,380
If we didn't have lawyers,
we wouldn't have crooks.

99
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,920
You know, I think you're
gonna sell a pair of these

100
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,322
to everybody in Texas.

101
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,984
<i>Jal</i> I will. I will.

102
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,994
American opportunity, Mr. Reid.

103
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,529
Take advantage.

104
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,826
What the hell was that?

105
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,889
Indians?

106
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,663
Road agents!

107
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,329
Here's what we're getting paid for, kid!

108
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,499
Get the horse!

109
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,836
Get up in there!

110
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,899
- I can't!
- Get their goddamn horse!

111
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,037
Indians! Indiana!

112
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,548
Get on up the road!

113
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,923
What the hell is he doing?

114
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,754
- He can't outrun them.
- But he's gonna try.

115
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,487
He could get us killed.

116
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,366
Get up!

117
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,531
Up!

118
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,788
Giddyup!

119
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,699
Get on, boy!

120
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,292
Do any of you gentlemen have a gun?

121
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,352
Yes, ma'am. I do.

122
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,058
Well, use it, then!

123
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,033
It's not my fight, lady.

124
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,332
But it's mine. Give it to me!

125
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,393
I'm not a coward.

126
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,236
So much for American opportunity.

127
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,563
Jump on it and stop it!

128
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,101
Get up in there!

129
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,800
Whoa!

130
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,236
Whoa.

131
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,173
Whoa! Whoa.

132
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,641
Let's have the pouch.

133
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,177
We ain't got no gold.

134
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,837
We ain't got no cash box.

135
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,312
The pouch!

136
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,576
Hell, all I got is letters and packages.

137
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,642
They ain't worth it.
Them's government papers.

138
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,483
- Let's go.
- What? Just leave them here?

139
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,580
- Them's our orders.
- Who's going to tell?

140
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,057
- Well, make it fast.
- All right.

141
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,232
- Come on!
- I'm hurrying.

142
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,202
What the hell are you doing in there?

143
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,795
Nothing, nothing! Nothing.

144
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,272
Nothing don't take that long.

145
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,072
But she might.

146
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,565
Kill him! Kill the bandit!

147
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,897
- No!
- Do it!

148
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,230
No!

149
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,178
I would like to thank you.

150
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,286
Well, you can thank me
by telling me your name.

151
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,191
Amy. Amy Striker.

152
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,866
They held up the Overland!

153
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,808
They held up the Overland!

154
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,675
They held up the Overland!

155
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,647
Everybody's been killed! They're all dead!

156
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,378
<i>Del Rio was a town in trouble,</i>

157
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,977
<i>a town with a gun in its back,</i>

158
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,955
<i>plagued by crimes</i>
<i>that just wouldn't stop</i>

159
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,117
<i>and cursed with a sheriff</i>
<i>who wore black.</i>

160
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,753
<i>So you'd think they'd be suspicious,</i>

161
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,354
<i>but simple folks rarely are.</i>

162
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,366
<i>They're willing to trust their law</i>

163
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,402
<i>to just about any man who wears a star.</i>

164
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,868
Whoa.

165
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,098
Here's the sheriff.

166
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,839
They killed Shotgun
and one of the passengers.

167
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,676
Amy! Amy!

168
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,216
There was five of 'em.
This is what's left.

169
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,945
Oh, Amy. Thank God.

170
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,748
Two of them, huh?

171
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,948
Well, they'll each hang twice.

172
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,617
They wore the gray hoods, Sheriff.

173
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,592
Cavendish gang.

174
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,492
They's after these land grants.

175
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,225
Come on.

176
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,893
What's going to happen
to those two outlaws?

177
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,300
They're gonna take them
to San Anton'

178
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,339
Do you need a deposition?

179
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,737
I don't know.

180
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,901
You got one you want to get rid of?

181
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,712
Oh, Mr. Reid. I'm Lucas Striker.

182
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,773
My uncle.

183
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,686
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

184
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,984
Amy told me what you did.

185
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,922
I just can't thank you enough.

186
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,790
Why, if anything happened to her...

187
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,329
Well, uh, you know,

188
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,888
your niece was very
courageous, sir.

189
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,158
She never compromised an inch.

190
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:22,503
Perhaps you might join us
for supper tonight?

191
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,940
Thank you. I'd like to, but I can't.

192
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,002
I have to be at the ranger
post before dark.

193
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,707
Oh, are you joining the rangers?

194
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,147
No, sir. My brother.

195
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,274
I see.

196
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,023
You shouldn't have come.

197
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,683
You've got an education.

198
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,628
You're a lawyer, for Christ's sakes!

199
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,961
You got a chance
to make something out of your life,

200
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,660
but this is not the place.

201
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,599
Dan, what's happened?
I mean, what's wrong?

202
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,082
You just don't understand.

203
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,742
These are tough times.

204
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,720
John, I got enough hurt in my life

205
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,814
without having to worry about you, too.

206
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,225
When I was 10 years old,

207
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,424
you sent me away to learn,

208
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,989
and I learned.

209
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,094
But the most important thing I learned
was that I belong here.

210
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,867
You don't understand.

211
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,704
It's still a frontier.

212
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,506
It forces you to make sacrifices,

213
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,740
to make choices.

214
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,839
Your heart can't tell you what to do.

215
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,008
Your gut tells you.

216
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,152
Dan...

217
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,025
we're the last of the Reids.

218
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,924
You're my brother.

219
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,164
Can't you understand
that you don't belong here?

220
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,113
Dan, I've come home,

221
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,017
and my gut tells me that I'm going to stay.

222
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,693
John.

223
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,771
One day she just packed up,
took Danny back to Richmond.

224
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,372
Well, maybe she'll change her mind.

225
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,882
No.

226
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,886
Not till we make it safe out here.

227
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,390
Safe so a man can raise a family

228
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,857
and provide for them.

229
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,360
But I don't know.

230
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,295
This territory is endless.

231
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,924
That just may be impossible.

232
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,936
Bastards come out of nowhere, strike...

233
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,370
and just disappear.

234
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,068
I don't even know where they hole up.

235
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,111
Who's that?

236
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,406
The Cavendish gang.

237
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,037
Cavendish?

238
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,015
They're the ones who robbed the stage.

239
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,415
Cavendish don't rob stages.

240
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,885
Cavendish robs ranches.

241
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:27,289
They've been grabbing land,
driving the owners off,

242
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,659
robbing, killing, burning.

243
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,220
Who is this Cavendish?

244
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,528
Butch Cavendish.

245
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,159
Butch for butcher.

246
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,694
Major in the Union Army,
dishonorably discharged.

247
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,765
Grant court-martialed him
right after the Battle of Chattanooga.

248
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,676
Now he's heading
an outlaw army in Texas.

249
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,045
Well...

250
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,674
you know you'll get him.

251
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,050
You going to see him
when he comes out here?

252
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,247
Cavendish?

253
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,381
Grant.

254
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,358
Grant's coming out here.

255
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,223
He's going to hunt buffalo,

256
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,286
make speeches.

257
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,697
Everybody in the whole town's
going to turn out there

258
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,325
and wave little flags at him.

259
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,303
Me?

260
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,431
I'd like to piss on him.

261
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,840
He's the President of the United States.

262
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,470
He's a liar and a drunk.

263
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,606
Piss on the President.
Piss on the Cabinet.

264
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,517
They ain't going to help
us out here, you know.

265
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,020
In Texas,

266
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,556
robbers are outlaws.

267
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,525
In Washington...

268
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,255
robbers are elected.

269
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,626
Ain't that right?

270
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,530
Huh, little brother?

271
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,860
John?

272
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,769
Well, it is.

273
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,238
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

274
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,510
<i>Butch Cavendish lived undisturbed,</i>

275
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,613
<i>waging his private war,</i>

276
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,682
<i>and men who made mistakes</i>

277
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,557
<i>were simply men he could not afford.</i>

278
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,189
<i>Some say he was a monster,</i>

279
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,132
<i>and others called him mad.</i>

280
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,601
<i>Let's just say Butch Cavendish</i>

281
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,730
<i>was everything that's bad.</i>

282
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,012
About-face!

283
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,079
Dale Wesley Stillwell

284
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,921
and Robert Edward Gattlin,

285
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,928
it is the finding of this military tribunal

286
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,658
that you are in violation
of the articles of war,

287
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,293
and your undisciplinary conduct

288
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,634
resulted in the failure
of a military objective.

289
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,437
Therefore,

290
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,308
it is the pronouncement
of this tribunal

291
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,339
that you be executed
by firing squad forthwith.

292
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,920
- Mr. Perlmutter.
- Sir?

293
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,253
Carry out the orders of the tribunal.

294
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,259
Yes, sir.

295
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,799
Lock.

296
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,510
And load.

297
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,382
Major Cavendish, sir.

298
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,456
What is it?

299
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,055
Well, sir, it seems to me, sir,

300
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:58,159
that they just did
what most men would've done.

301
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,865
I have no room for
ordinary men, Mr. Wiatt.

302
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,999
We are on a course that will alter

303
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,599
the history of this country.

304
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,440
Men who do not obey orders

305
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,878
for the sake of their
own personal gains...

306
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,818
are a clear and present
danger to my plan.

307
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,652
Do I make myself understood?

308
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,187
Yes, sir, you do.

309
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,658
Proceed, Mr. Perlmutter.

310
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,291
Yes, sir.

311
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,664
Stevens.

312
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,329
Assume the firing position!

313
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,434
Ready.

314
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,345
Aim.

315
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,675
Fire!

316
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,751
<i>¡Mira, miral</i>

317
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:34,732
It's really exciting, isn't it?

318
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,230
Dan, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

319
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,931
Come on.

320
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,440
- Lucas.
- Hello, Captain.

321
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,640
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

322
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,114
Good evening, Mr. Reid.

323
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,048
Captain, this is my niece Amy.

324
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,676
She's on her way to San Francisco.

325
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,777
How do you do?

326
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,118
Well, John's told me a lot about you.

327
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
I read your article
in the paper this morning.

328
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,387
Oh, did you like it?

329
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,954
Well, it made me sound like a hero.

330
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,060
I enjoyed your editorial
about Cavendish, Mr. Striker.

331
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,296
Thank you.

332
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,396
If more folks laid it on the table like you,

333
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,565
we could put an end to him.

334
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,767
We'll stop him, Captain.

335
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,104
Which reminds me, I've got to get

336
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,407
tomorrow's edition out.
So if you'll excuse me?

337
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,468
Do you need me to help?

338
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,412
Oh, no, Amy. Stay here
and have a good time.

339
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,178
Gentlemen, good night.

340
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,787
Nice party.

341
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,291
Yes.

342
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,953
Isn't it?

343
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,463
Uh, yeah... yes, ma'am.

344
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,056
All this talking makes me dry.

345
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,726
It was very nice
to have met you, Miss Amy.

346
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,793
Oh, it was my pleasure, Captain.

347
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,180
Nice party.

348
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,478
You said that already.

349
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,745
I did, didn't I?

350
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,566
I have a feeling

351
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,871
you're going to be a very important lawyer.

352
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,774
I just want to make sure

353
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,405
the West has an honest
system of justice.

354
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,678
Oh, you sound just like my uncle.

355
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,418
Here.

356
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,189
Oh, you remembered.

357
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,958
<i>A Century of Dishonor.</i>

358
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,966
Thank you.

359
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,937
I'd like you to keep it.

360
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,667
I will.

361
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,539
Will you write me and tell me
how you like San Francisco?

362
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,475
Yes, of course.

363
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,912
Maybe you could...

364
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:41,281
send some articles or stories
that you've written.

365
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,149
Of course.

366
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,157
So I guess this is good-bye.

367
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,717
For now.

368
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,141
Maybe we should go back.

369
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,242
Amy, l...

370
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,116
I think we should go back.

371
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,231
Captain Reid! Captain Reid!

372
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,393
Captain Reid!

373
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,609
Hidalgo!

374
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,870
What happened?

375
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,438
<i>El periodico.</i>

376
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,950
The <i>Dispatch.</i>

377
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,213
Get the horses.

378
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,311
<i>¡Ai, carambal</i>

379
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,264
Amy, wait here.

380
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,547
Uncle Lucas.

381
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,643
Uncle Lucas!

382
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,220
No. No.

383
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,024
- Please, no.
- Amy, Amy.

384
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,257
Uncle Lucas.

385
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:39,565
All he lived for was his newspaper.

386
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,070
- Collins!
- There's tracks, sir!

387
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,631
Six riders, heading north.

388
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,733
Mount up.

389
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,278
I wish I had an answer for you, Amy.

390
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,985
John, where the hell are you going?

391
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,150
With you.

392
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,751
Well, let's get 'em.

393
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,492
Please come back.

394
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,800
Well, this is about right.

395
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,345
I got my best party shirt on
for something like this?

396
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,347
Look at Lopez. Don't hear him griping.

397
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,406
He had every swirling
<i>chiquita</i> in the place

398
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,781
wanting to marry him.

399
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,816
Now he's out here riding with us
for glory and God and Texas.

400
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,420
Hey, Stephenson,

401
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,827
why don't you swallow
that damn stinking cigar?

402
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,831
Yeah, I could,

403
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,560
but it sure keeps my nose warm.

404
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,465
I'm beginning to strongly dislike

405
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,094
this Cavendish fellow.

406
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,036
Yeah. I wonder if he knows

407
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,597
the rangers are riding right up his ass.

408
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,664
A great place for a picnic.

409
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,599
Where the hell are we?

410
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,075
Bryant's Gap.

411
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,079
Captain, you want
I should ride up ahead,

412
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,614
take a look?

413
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,149
Yeah, okay, Collins,

414
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,980
but you watch yourself.

415
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,747
Always do, Captain.

416
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,701
Get over there, Tex.

417
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,898
Good boy.

418
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,685
Wait till you meet my kid.

419
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,488
You're going to love him.

420
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,654
Not if he's anything like you.

421
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,197
Well, he is.

422
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,425
Spitting damn image.

423
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,488
Jerky?

424
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,535
No, thanks.

425
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,467
You don't know what you're missing.

426
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,971
His mother's gonna let him

427
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,768
come out and visit for Christmas.

428
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,069
You really miss him, don't you?

429
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,037
Yeah.

430
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,876
Look, uh...

431
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,384
if anything was ever to happen to me...

432
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,910
I want you to check on him for me.

433
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,353
Nothing's going to happen to you.

434
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,721
If it was gonna happen, it would have
happened a long time ago.

435
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,123
Yeah.

436
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,222
Yeah, I suppose.

437
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,628
But just the same, you know,
would you? In case?

438
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,294
Sure.

439
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,401
You know how a boy needs a father.

440
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,523
Here.

441
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,902
What's this for?

442
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,268
It's for you.

443
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,671
You can't be shooting
outlaws without it.

444
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,676
You should know that.

445
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,269
There's Collins.

446
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,684
Mount up.

447
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,415
Where is he now?

448
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,493
Let's get the hell out of here.

449
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,377
Ain't no pass here now!

450
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,683
Go back!

451
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,087
We got to get out the other way!

452
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,681
The other way!

453
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,957
Come on!

454
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,769
John!

455
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,211
Hi, kid.

456
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,749
How do you like being a ranger?

457
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,350
More than anything.

458
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,793
Yeah, great life, ain't it?

459
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,630
Homer!

460
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,725
Homer!

461
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,633
I've been a ranger longer
than you've been alive.

462
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,202
Been in San Anton' with big Sam Houston.

463
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,838
Fought alongside McCullough
in the Mexican War.

464
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,439
Rode with Kit Carson and John Coffee Hays.

465
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,041
All those years, kid, I learned one thing.

466
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,211
What was that?

467
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,482
It ain't the bullet that gets you.

468
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,191
It's the fall.

469
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,856
John! John!

470
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,461
Dan!

471
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,769
- Dan!
- Stay down, John!

472
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,482
Dan.

473
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,545
Dan.

474
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,883
Dan.

475
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,119
Dan.

476
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,596
Oh. Oh, Dan.

477
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:06,203
At least this time we were together.

478
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,259
No.

479
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,705
Weren't we?

480
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,866
Dan.

481
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,431
Weren't we, little brother?

482
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,273
No, Dan.

483
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,441
No!

484
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,984
No!

485
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,491
Pick up the hymn books, boys.

486
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,227
It's all over.

487
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,539
Collins.

488
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,205
Yes, sir.

489
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,049
Go down and check the bodies.

490
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,648
Sir, couldn't you send
somebody else, sir?

491
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,124
You rode with them.

492
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,889
Well, yes, sir, I did, but...

493
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,193
Sir.

494
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,888
<i>One thing about that Cavendish,</i>

495
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,589
<i>he knew how to set a trap.</i>

496
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,654
<i>And he finished off the rangers</i>

497
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,757
<i>that day in Bryant's Gap.</i>

498
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,333
<i>And Collins had to check them all</i>

499
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,271
<i>till Butch was satisfied.</i>

500
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,011
<i>Dead men lying everywhere,</i>

501
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,379
<i>and bloody brothers side by side.</i>

502
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,898
It'd seem too coincidental

503
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,840
if the only survivor wasn't wounded.

504
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,402
Yes, sir, Major.

505
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,381
Maybe they'll give you a medal.

506
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,936
Dan. Dan!

507
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,650
Rest.

508
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,429
<i>Kemo sabe.</i>

509
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,665
What?

510
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,932
<i>Kemo sabe.</i>

511
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,470
Tonto?

512
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,413
Yes.

513
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,418
<i>And Tonto recognized John Reid</i>

514
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,613
<i>by the amulet he wore.</i>

515
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,680
<i>But John had once saved Tonto's life,</i>

516
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,249
<i>so this evened up the score.</i>

517
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,291
<i>Tonto had to hide his friend</i>

518
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,527
<i>and keep him out of town</i>

519
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,661
<i>'cause if Butch had known</i>
<i>that one ranger lived,</i>

520
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,707
<i>he was sure to hunt him down.</i>

521
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,504
The white man has made
many promises to us,

522
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,547
yet they keep only one.

523
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,048
They promised to take
our land from us,

524
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,108
and they took it.

525
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,620
You see the suffering and the misery

526
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,451
they bring to your people,

527
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:10,619
yet you bring one to us
to nurse back to health.

528
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,683
Tonto, why?

529
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,296
Nobody has reason to fill
their hearts with hatred

530
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,892
for the white man more than I.

531
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,461
He's taken from me
my wife and my child,

532
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,975
but the man I brought here
is my brother.

533
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,069
And I will protect his life
with my own if I have to.

534
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,540
And if I'm wrong

535
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:35,073
and he proves to be an enemy,

536
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,315
then I, Tonto, will decorate my lance

537
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,685
with his white man's hair.

538
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,625
But until that day comes,

539
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,527
let him not be judged by his color,

540
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,224
but by his heart

541
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,892
as a man and a friend.

542
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,318
<i>What is it that brings</i>
<i>two friends together</i>

543
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,524
<i>or sends the waves to the sand?</i>

544
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,033
<i>And what is it that drives</i>
<i>a creature of nature</i>

545
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,560
<i>to reach out to the world of man?</i>

546
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,574
<i>Just such a creature was</i>
<i>this great white horse,</i>

547
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,372
<i>as wise and as wild as a runaway,</i>

548
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,607
<i>and the moment John</i>
<i>first laid eyes on him,</i>

549
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,115
<i>he swore he'd ride him someday.</i>

550
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,063
Maybe you need a bigger target,

551
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,295
like a sleeping buffalo.

552
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,293
Try this.

553
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,900
A silver bullet.

554
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,774
It's more accurate.

555
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,284
Tribal chiefs first used
silver on their arrows.

556
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:03,060
It makes them fly longer and straighter.

557
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,691
Silver is pure.

558
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,066
It's been a symbol of justice and purity

559
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,900
since the year of the sun.

560
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,384
Well, good morning.

561
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,549
Look at him.

562
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,663
He shines like the moon.

563
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,758
Like silver.

564
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,208
Silver.

565
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,487
Easy, boy.

566
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,063
Silver.

567
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,801
Whoa.

568
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,397
Easy, boy.

569
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,943
That's a boy.

570
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,241
Easy, Silver.

571
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,811
Whoa.

572
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,623
Easy.

573
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,419
Easy, boy.

574
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,348
Whoa!

575
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,074
Good boy.

576
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,166
Whoa!

577
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,978
When I found you,

578
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,447
I was searching for the men
that raided my village.

579
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:27,778
I seek right.

580
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:32,185
I will not be herded like soldier's sheep
from pen to pen

581
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,747
or issued my food and clothing
by government agents.

582
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,790
I am man and am free
to die for what I feel.

583
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,425
And the day might not be
many winter counts away

584
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,026
when all men will be brothers.

585
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,504
A new Indian nation
will come out of this time of change,

586
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,804
strong and proud and united.

587
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,946
Well, then, let brother
ride with brother.

588
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,921
If I am to find Cavendish,

589
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:11,393
I can no longer appear as John Reid.

590
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,656
Cavendish and his men must think

591
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,427
that all the rangers were
killed in the massacre,

592
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,301
and only then will I be free
to avenge my brother's death.

593
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,975
We will go back to Bryant's Gap

594
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:32,139
and dig one more grave.

595
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,115
John Reid will...

596
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:39,179
be buried with his brother
and the rangers forever.

597
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,987
I swear to you, Dan,

598
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,657
no matter how long it takes,

599
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,859
no matter where they are,

600
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,562
I will find them.

601
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:59,072
What Cavendish
and men like him owe you,

602
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,110
they will pay in full.

603
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,543
There will be justice in the West.

604
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:10,143
To this, my brother, I pledge my life.

605
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,673
Hi-yo, Silver!

606
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,729
<i>Now John Reid was just a memory.</i>

607
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,397
<i>The masked man</i>
<i>had taken his place.</i>

608
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,305
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>his heart wasn't touched</i>

609
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,741
<i>when he saw Amy Striker's face.</i>

610
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,608
<i>Amy had stayed to do her uncle's work</i>

611
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,114
<i>and to keep his dreams alive,</i>

612
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:49,310
<i>but unless the masked man</i>
<i>could find Cavendish,</i>

613
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,877
<i>true justice would never survive.</i>

614
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,821
You're too late, mister.

615
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,291
Some old bar dog got all of my money.

616
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,886
The brave survivor of Bryant's Gap.

617
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,430
That's right.

618
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,988
What was it like?

619
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,897
It was like hell.

620
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,940
Cavendish?

621
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,442
I don't know who it was.

622
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,481
Why are you wearing a mask?

623
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,779
Because I'm in hiding...

624
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,251
like you are.

625
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,652
What are you getting at, mister?

626
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,350
I want you to take me to Cavendish.

627
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,120
How would I know Cavendish?

628
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,161
You led the rangers to him.

629
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,459
And now you're going
to lead me to him.

630
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,762
No, see, you got it all wrong.

631
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,461
I'm a big hero around here.

632
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,367
Isn't that right?

633
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:18,236
What did they promise you?

634
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,070
Was it money? Land?

635
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,873
What was worth having
your friends slaughtered?

636
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,383
You're crazy.

637
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,579
And I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

638
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,487
You know what I'm talking about.

639
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,024
Where is he?

640
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,223
I don't know Cavendish.

641
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,764
Why did he set up the rangers?

642
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,914
I know what happened there.

643
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:04,009
For Christ's sake, mister.
L... I can't.

644
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,387
You can, and you will.

645
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,952
Collins, tell me.

646
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,563
The train.

647
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,156
What train?

648
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,395
The train. He wants the train.

649
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,686
The masked man.

650
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,790
Looks like you're going to hang alone.

651
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,675
Coal tender...

652
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,544
soldier's car,

653
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,084
club car,

654
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,245
presidential car.

655
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,547
Are we clear, gentlemen?

656
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,091
Yes, sir.

657
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,189
Whitloff and Richardson.

658
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,459
Yes, sir.

659
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,043
Westlake.

660
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,916
Eastman and Neeley.

661
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,248
Yes, sir.

662
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,912
Gentlemen,

663
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,819
the President.

664
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,919
- String him up!
- He was a hero!

665
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,694
That's no way for him to die
after what he went through!

666
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,599
Well, he's civilized for an Indian!

667
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,035
What kind of law do they understand?

668
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,572
Swift, short, and certain!

669
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,471
Let's string him up!

670
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,213
Wald's bringing them here.

671
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,043
Just like he said.

672
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,286
Hey, Crazy Horse, you're on your way
to the Happy Hunting Grounds.

673
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,016
They look like a herd of buffalo.

674
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,991
They're going to be tough to control.

675
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,130
Order! Order!

676
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,931
Don't get in the way, Wiatt.
We're taking the Indian.

677
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,835
- Now just step aside.
- Now, you listen to me.

678
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:40,137
Two or three of you want to go in there
and get him, that's all right.

679
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,700
I don't want the rest of you
dirtying up the place.

680
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:47,544
You, you, and you, go get him.

681
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,958
There's only one kind of good Indian.

682
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,602
<i>I don't guess anyone stopped to ask</i>

683
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,940
<i>what Tonto was guilty of.</i>

684
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,139
<i>That didn't stop them</i>
<i>from wanting to see him</i>

685
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,512
<i>swinging high above.</i>

686
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,949
<i>But Tonto showed no sign of fear,</i>

687
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,011
<i>and he held onto a fervent hope</i>

688
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,453
<i>that the masked man</i>

689
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,014
<i>wouldn't let his blood brother hang</i>

690
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,287
<i>from the end of a rope.</i>

691
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,896
This is for Eddie Collins.

692
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,539
<i>Those Cavendish boys</i>
<i>had been working real hard</i>

693
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,481
<i>going over each step of their plan.</i>

694
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:32,612
<i>Meanwhile, old Butch</i>
<i>was mighty disturbed</i>

695
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,555
<i>by reports of a strange masked man.</i>

696
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:40,152
<i>But he wouldn't let rumors</i>
<i>mess up his scheme.</i>

697
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,527
<i>So he set out on his final campaign.</i>

698
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,431
<i>He and his boys</i>
<i>rode to the rendezvous</i>

699
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,527
<i>with President Grant's private train.</i>

700
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,433
Miss Striker!
Miss Striker!

701
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,067
Yes, Manuel?

702
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,510
There's a padre wants to see you
in the church right away.

703
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,514
Father Monteleone?

704
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:00,708
No! Another padre.

705
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,909
He said it was very important,

706
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,747
and I promised that I would bring you.

707
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,844
Well...

708
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,980
in that case, I'd best
go see what he wants.

709
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,891
You must have done
something real bad, Miss Striker.

710
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,964
More coffee, sir?

711
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,637
Thank you. Thank you.

712
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,009
You're welcome.

713
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,809
Oh! General. Come in, come in!

714
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,248
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet

715
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,114
our new guest,
General Aurelio Rodriguez.

716
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,346
He's joining us for the hunt.

717
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,321
- Mr. President.
- General.

718
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,415
I'd like to introduce
the legendary Wild Bill Hickok!

719
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:44,857
Oh, Señor Hickok.

720
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,724
How do you do, sir?

721
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,696
Right there is the famous
Buffalo Bill Cody.

722
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,026
Howdy, General.

723
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,033
Señor Buffalo.

724
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,227
And you know, of course,

725
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,896
Brigadier George Armstrong Custer.

726
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,165
Brigadier.

727
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,467
General.

728
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,906
Sit down, General.

729
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,237
Armstrong, move over there.

730
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,939
Let the general sit,
or I'll send you up to Montana.

731
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,412
You sent for me, Father?

732
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,424
Yes, my child.

733
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:22,226
Your writings, they are very brave
but dangerous.

734
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,357
What do you mean, Father?

735
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:29,268
In my travels, I have met
a man who wears a mask

736
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:33,399
but is dedicated to law and order.

737
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:37,173
He wants you to know
that he will not stop

738
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:41,683
until he has brought Cavendish
and his men to justice.

739
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,583
Well, until he finds Cavendish,

740
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,087
I shall simply continue
with my writings.

741
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,316
No, you must not.

742
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,824
You will be hurt.

743
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:54,351
In here, quickly. Please.

744
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,001
You see, Father,
I cannot stop my writing.

745
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,132
It is my only weapon.

746
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:09,234
It is all I have.

747
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,973
I understand.

748
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,605
Thank you, Father.

749
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,617
I am most grateful for your concern.

750
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:20,177
Now, with respect,
you must excuse me.

751
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,783
I'm on my way to a meeting
for President Grant's arrival.

752
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,258
The President?

753
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:29,127
Yes. He's arriving here
on the afternoon train.

754
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,460
Today?

755
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,727
Yes.

756
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,665
Although I suspect
the children are more eager

757
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,670
to see Buffalo Bill than
they are to see the President.

758
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,831
My God!

759
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,704
What is the matter, Father?

760
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,710
You should have gone
to San Francisco.

761
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,712
What did you say?

762
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,145
I must go.

763
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,706
Wait!

764
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,685
The masked man?

765
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,278
Trust him.

766
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,919
Father!

767
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,426
Father.

768
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,595
Father.

769
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,053
The Del Rio is the
next stop, Mr. President.

770
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,591
I want to be there and gone
in three minutes, not a breath more.

771
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,183
Yes, Mr. President.

772
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,751
Where the hell is Del Rio?

773
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:37,856
Gentlemen,
look what I have to put up with.

774
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:39,298
Well, I'll leave you on your own.

775
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,302
I have to rewrite that speech

776
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,168
for whatever the name
of that town is.

777
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,270
Whoa.

778
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,787
Right turnabout.

779
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,191
Which way?

780
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,292
Through the gorge. We'll save hours.

781
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,802
Let's go, Silver.

782
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,235
Come on, Scout.

783
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,713
The next time we play
poker in Mexico, yes?

784
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,121
No, I don't think so.

785
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,827
Ah, gentlemen. Come in, come in.

786
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,523
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

787
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,997
Now listen to this, see how you like it.

788
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,672
"And I, as your president,

789
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,876
"am ready to defend the lives

790
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,442
of American citizens at any cost."

791
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,748
How do you like it?

792
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,585
Sounds damn good, sir.

793
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,429
Look, when I was out here
three years ago,

794
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,529
these hills were black with buffalo.

795
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:01,303
I've been here three days,
I haven't seen a single one.

796
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,242
Cody, what happened to them?

797
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:04,472
I shot 'em.

798
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,848
Now, here, here, gentlemen.

799
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,783
The plight of the buffalo
and the American Indian,

800
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:13,617
in these times,

801
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,088
is no laughing matter.

802
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,320
Now, with that, you'll excuse me.

803
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,385
I think I'll take a short nap.

804
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,056
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

805
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,929
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

806
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,057
Major.

807
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,882
Whoa.

808
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:01,955
The train.

809
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,066
Let's go, Silver.

810
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,444
Switch it.

811
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,932
I am Major Bartholomew Cavendish,

812
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,370
and you, Mr. President,
are my prisoner.

813
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,741
<i>So Cavendish had pulled it off</i>

814
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,302
<i>and vanished without firing a shot.</i>

815
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,145
<i>The masked man and Tonto</i>
<i>had to move fast</i>

816
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:38,118
<i>and ride while his trail was still hot.</i>

817
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,086
<i>They didn't know what he intended to do,</i>

818
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,988
<i>but the life at stake</i>
<i>was President Grant's.</i>

819
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,049
<i>Perhaps Butch would hold him.</i>

820
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,322
<i>Perhaps Butch would kill him.</i>

821
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:50,024
<i>They just couldn't take that chance.</i>

822
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,380
Tell me one thing.

823
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:19,757
Are you here to rescue Grant
or to get Cavendish?

824
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,888
I signed your court-martial?

825
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,262
I don't remember.

826
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,425
What happened wasn't my fault.

827
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,162
Never is.

828
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,300
I got that at Shiloh.

829
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,239
Cavalry Major's.

830
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:38,040
It was his last glorious charge.

831
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,081
Poor bastard.

832
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,350
Look around you, sir.

833
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:03,295
Do you see chaos, discontent?

834
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,390
Or do you see respect and order?

835
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,367
I hadn't really noticed.

836
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:09,335
You and the United States

837
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,372
will notice my country,

838
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,840
the Republic of New Texas.

839
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,344
The manifest destiny of the United States

840
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,347
will be impaired only slightly.

841
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,440
Major Cavendish,

842
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,883
you are a diseased son of a bitch.

843
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,090
I'd like your opinion.

844
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,894
Yes.

845
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,992
No, thank you.

846
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,936
"To Mr. Hamilton Fish,
Secretary of State.

847
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,132
"Dear sir,

848
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,005
"Whereas the government
of the United States

849
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,805
"has failed to provide proper protection

850
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:59,540
"for American citizens,

851
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,708
"and whereas it has failed
to provide honest leadership

852
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:03,773
and moral courage..."

853
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,678
"Therefore,

854
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,452
"let it be known that I,
Major Bartholomew Cavendish,

855
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,550
"firmly resolve to hold the President

856
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,424
"of the United States as my prisoner

857
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,794
"until I am deeded
sovereign right of ownership

858
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:20,824
"to the lands of Texas
specified in this document.

859
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:24,429
"Furthermore, I demand that
these lands be granted to me

860
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,066
"by an irrevocable act
of the Congress of the United States

861
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:30,908
"no later than 30 days
after the date set above,

862
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:34,176
or the life of Ulysses S. Grant
shall be forfeit."

863
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:39,820
Sign as witness, please.

864
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,321
Very good.

865
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:43,323
You think so?

866
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,552
Yes, marvelous.

867
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,528
But 30 days is too long to give 'em.

868
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,860
I'd change that.

869
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,231
They'll dicker and debate
and scratch their indecisive asses,

870
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,066
and by the time they sober up,
I'll be dead.

871
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,834
You may be right.

872
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,812
Well...

873
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,179
it'll be interesting to see.

874
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,383
Wake up, Sheriff.

875
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,860
Where's the President?

876
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:31,262
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

877
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,963
He's in the next room.

878
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,975
I don't know how in
the hell you got in here,

879
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:46,070
but you...

880
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:14,000
Mr. President.

881
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,770
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

882
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,812
Eh, Christ! Now what?

883
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:19,005
We're here to help.

884
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,446
You don't look like
someone who could help me,

885
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:24,041
and neither does he.

886
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,314
Here's a gun.

887
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:30,118
Trust us, sir.

888
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:32,022
We're going to get you out of here.

889
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:54,681
Follow me, sir.

890
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,828
This way.

891
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,960
Light the fuses.

892
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,719
Damn me! The horses!

893
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,229
The horses are loose!

894
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,696
The horses!

895
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:20,063
Soak up lead, you sons of bitches!

896
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,932
The horses! The horses!

897
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,976
- Jesus, what was that?
- What's going on?

898
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:40,486
Let me get my pants on. We'll see.

899
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,022
Come on! Let's go see!

900
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:01,965
- How'd they get in here?
- Where's my horse?

901
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,123
Hey, where the hell
you going and leaving me?

902
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,125
You're safer here, Mr. President.

903
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,627
Yeah, but I can help ya!
I've been in a few battles myself, son!

904
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,187
Now you're President,
so keep your head down.

905
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,922
Charge!

906
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:45,737
Come on, boys! Go get them!

907
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,110
Come on!

908
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:57,316
Get 'em all! Every one!

909
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,297
Let's get the hell out of here.

910
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:32,350
Come on, boys!

911
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:14,187
Do it!

912
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:42,007
Your sins will be paid for
in the fires of hell.

913
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:45,977
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

914
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:55,492
May I know, sir,
to whom am I so indebted?

915
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:59,260
Mr. President, please allow me
to remain anonymous.

916
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,267
I hope you'll understand.

917
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:06,204
Well, I respect your dedication,
and I will honor your request.

918
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:11,142
Tonto, I thank you and I salute you.

919
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:14,545
Thank me by honoring your treaties
with my people.

920
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:18,244
Yes. We will try. You have my word.

921
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:21,013
Mr. President.

922
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:22,715
May God ride with you.

923
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:41,230
Who is that masked man?

924
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:43,742
Hi-yo, Silver!

925
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,506
Away!

926
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:40,594
Hi-yo, Silver!

927
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,465
Away!

928
