2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,540
Leaden rainstorms

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,540
Bring disasters upon us.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,540
We carry on our shoulders

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,540
war and hardship.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,540
The civil war is raging

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,540
all day long.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,540
There are many paths in the fields,

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,540
But the truth is only one.

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,540
The Civil war is raging all day long.

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,540
There are many paths in the fields,

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,540
But the truth is only one.

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,540
To young heroes of the Civil war

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,838
Do you want to say anything?
Or ask for something?

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,159
Red dog.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,631
Dad!

17
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:45,420
The Uncatchable Avengers :-)

18
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,550
- Chieftain, protect us... The cow...

19
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,160
Robbers took the last cow!

20
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,990
- What did you think, you dumbhead?
That your freedom can be gained for free?

21
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,150
She suffered when she bore her children,
And now a new world is born,

22
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,740
and she wants it without pain.

23
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,036
You want it without pain?
 - I have children, the last cow...

24
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,531
"Last"! And do you know, you stupid,
that today they took one cow from you,

25
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,351
and tomorrow they will return back ten?
 - How can it be?
 - Exactly so!

26
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,549
Whose cows were they? Whose?

27
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,716
The lords', the landowners'.
and now they will be yours.

28
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,900
All. Bulls, cows, chicken, pigs - 
all will be yours.

29
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,010
- Give me back my cow!

30
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,300
- Wait, sister, we'll give it back.
We'll give everything back.

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A free woman.

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,500
A citizen.

33
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,356
- So he was buried.
And in the morning they came there and saw:

34
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,000
The grave is dug up and the coffin is empty.

35
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,500
Since then whoever goes past 
that cursed cemetery - a trouble happens.

36
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,232
- But people go there?
- No, only in daytime.

37
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
- But how did Petro go there at night?

38
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,471
*cuckoo!*
 - Did you hear?

39
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,351
Chief, look there!

40
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,180
*Avengers*

41
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,275
- Oh my God, is that true?
- Of course!

42
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,956
- Ilyuha is lying!
- I couldn't believe myself,

43
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:42,190
but then looked around: the coffin 
with the dead was flying above the gravestones,

44
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,071
and along the road were standing corpses with scythes.

45
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,340
And silence...

46
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
- Stop. Today you are doing better.

47
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,140
Only when you hit and throw, 
push harder with your foot.

48
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,140
- Clear?
 - Yes.

49
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,140
The last performance of an actor, lead singer
of the Emperor's Drama and Comedy Theatre!

50
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,140
Here were some clamorous markets,
in these lavish lands! And now...

51
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,140
Freedom. With our chieftain: 
cheer up, folks! Gather in your bellies!

52
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,140
Everyone is trading and having fun!
No one is sleeping!

53
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,140
I will tell you, my dear: get everything from 
your cellars, or they'll take it for free!

54
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,140
Hey, granny, look! This is the last 
performance, I am only passing by.

55
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,140
Today I take the night horse and go
to my beloved city - Odessa.

56
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,140
The city of chestnuts and performers.

57
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,640
I am Buba Kastorsky, 
the original performer,

58
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,140
I am singing patter songs,
And I sing them pretty good.

59
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,840
I am singing to my left,
I am singing to my right,

60
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,000
And nodody can sing it the way I do.

61
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,111
And why?
Because I am...

62
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,790
Buba Kastorsky, original performer!

63
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,277
There are gossips going around,
And I've heard from one old woman,

64
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,150
That early in the morning
you hear here and there: cuckoo!

65
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,634
And I am Buba Kastorsky, original performer!
I sing patters, and I sing them pretty well...

66
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,056
- And I see: my Nurka stands there,
and a paper on her horn, and it says:

67
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,040
"We give you back the cow, aunt Darya.
Don't be afraid of robbers,

68
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,000
and if they mess in again - they'll be dead."

69
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,070
- It is their sign: a cuckoo cries and
a rooster answers.

70
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,500
They say, Budenny himself invented that sign.
I swear by God.

71
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,669
They are coming...

72
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,000
And now, the blonde Josie!

73
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,760
This night will stay

74
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,758
forever in our memory.

75
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:45,355
This night of tamed and 
burning heart.

76
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,473
You whispered me until dawn

77
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,916
So passionately and tenderly

78
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,779
that you will marry me.

79
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,510
The night passed, 
and grey morning started again.

80
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:41,195
Again, the rain, 
bad weather and fog.

81
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,478
The night passed,

82
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,911
And I can't believe

83
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:11,476
that my last romance ended this way.

84
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,833
More, more!

85
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,956
- What are you laughing at, stallions?
You've hit the boy and you're happy?

86
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
- Your father was more agile!
Are you hurt?

87
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, let's go, lad, 
have some kvass.

88
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you think, lad, that Sidor the Terrible 
does not feel sorry

89
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,671
for each orphaned child?
I do.

90
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,116
But this time is such 
that we can't help it.

91
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,079
Do you know, how many of my friends
were killed by your father?

92
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,830
I know!

93
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:31,434
I would hang him even after he's dead!
Your father was such a bastard, lad.

94
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,596
Here, drink.

95
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,349
- Danka is late.
- Don't worry for him!

96
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,798
- Wait, Valerka!
Listen, they are shooting in the village!

97
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,391
- So what?
- Maybe something happened with Danka!

98
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,553
And I think that you are a bad psychologist,
Yashka.

99
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,877
They shoot at random.

100
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,869
So to say, to reassure themselves.
You understand? Cranky.

101
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,951
Why so long, Danka?

102
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,989
- What happened?
 - I hit my back. 
Burnash's people are in Zbruevka.

103
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,515
- Are there many of them?
- Looks like many.

104
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,109
- For how long?
- I don't know.

105
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,550
- Why did you come back?
- I couldn't stay.

106
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,235
The Terrible recognized me.

107
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,919
- What do we do now?
- We'll find out.

108
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,433
- I'll go, have a look.
- Where will you go?

109
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,359
There are 40 families in Zbruevka, and no guys.
Ones are with Budenny, others with Burnash.

110
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,350
If one of us appears there - they'll find us out.

111
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,792
Ksanka has to go.

112
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,269
Ksan, Ksanka!
Dress up, you'll go to Zbruevka.

113
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,353
Maybe we shouldn't let her go
alone, Dan?

114
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,316
Find out, how many of them are there
and for how long are they staying.

115
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,635
Yashka, bring her to other bank and back.
Understood?

116
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,193
You'll go to auntie Darya.

117
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,030
Good luck, Jeanne D'Arc.

118
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,758
Why does he call you Jeanna Darca?
What for a word is it?

119
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,318
He is kinda psychologist.
Knows different foreign words.

120
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,031
No, Valerka said that she was burned.

121
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,189
Рe would not scruple to tell a lie.

122
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,356
- Ksan, you look better with a scarf.
- Yeah right!

123
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,237
- Certainly.

124
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,236
- What's with you?
- I won't let you alone. We'll go together.

125
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,712
What, do you want to give me away?
There is nothing to discuss, go!

126
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,877
Ksan, wait, wait!

127
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,116
- Did you hear what Danka told?
- It's not that.

128
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,155
- Why is it?
- It is my grandpa's cross, it draws the trouble away.

129
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,113
- I'll go.
 - Go!

130
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,838
Cuckoo...

131
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,035
You left her.
Do you hear? You were a coward.

132
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,397
Why do you keep silent?
Well, tell me, you chickened out!

133
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,433
- Don't make noise.
- It comes out, everyone is for himself?

134
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,279
- Yashka couldn't help.
- And you would leave her? - And what's the use?

135
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,636
I wouldn't save Ksanka
and would go for nothing.

136
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,512
Wait for me here. If I don't come back
before night, you go, Valerka.

137
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,514
- Who is there?
- It's me, father Mokey.

138
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,517
Danka, goeie genade.
And I thought that you were... with your father.

139
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,676
I'm alive.

140
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,838
They became angry.
Threw a bell ringer from the church tower.

141
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,836
The bell is silent since Christmas. 
Silent.

142
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,592
- Why did you come?
- I am looking for my sister.

143
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,918
Why look for her?
She is in the bar. As a servant.

144
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,920
The Terrible is staying there 
with his gang.

145
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,910
Hide my freedom behind a grate,
I will steal it with a grate.

146
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,913
A moon went out and 
hid behind clouds again.

147
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,035
Lock a black horse with five locks,
I will steal it together with the locks!

148
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,471
I knew God and Devil,
I was devil and god.

149
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,277
Hide a girl behind a high fence,
I will steal her withthe fence.

150
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,839
Hide a girl behind a high fence,
I will steal her withthe fence.

151
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,435
Dance!
Give him a guitar.

152
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,156
We are weak, for we are men...

153
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,238
Give me gorilka!

154
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,873
You are a trickster, a rascal.

155
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,398
An unhandled mare, but of good blood.

156
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,751
- How do you know?
- From the teeth.

157
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,520
I looked to the side: a coffin with the dead is flying
above the gravestones,

158
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,354
And along the road - 
corpses with scythes.

159
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,038
And silence...

160
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,719
Drink, culprit, get used to our food.

161
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,949
Drink, scrounge, you can't hold
in your hands anything except a guitar.

162
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,793
How are you going to fight with it?

163
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,318
His horse will hold a sabre for him.

164
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,429
Give me gorilka in a mug!

165
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,799
Hey, brothers, hold my hands!

166
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,151
Why are you breaking my dishes, brat?

167
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,348
Why do you interrupt our fun, God-seller?

168
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,636
More gorilka!

169
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,072
A, Ksusha, come here, daughter.

170
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,552
- Hello, uncle Sidor.
- Do they trouble you? - No, not at all.

171
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,510
- I brought you a present, You like it?
- Yes.

172
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,918
- Good, take it.
- Thanks for present.

173
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,590
- Any visitors?
- Not a soul.

174
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,991
- Did she go anywhere?
- Not once.

175
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,836
If something happens - I'll tear your skin off.

176
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,115
She acts as a fool. I feel that
she is together with them.

177
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,031
Any day now they will crow.
If you notice anything, let me know.

178
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,117
So I can't hold anything except a guitar?

179
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,192
Brothers, friends, don't bring me to ruin...

180
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,354
- Maybe it's time, Danka?
- He must give a sign.

181
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,957
- Give me a bullet!
- No bullets!

182
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,518
Father-philosopher, the last bullet.

183
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,469
That's right!

184
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,517
Drink... drink... everybody drink.

185
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:55,380
*Avengers*

186
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,075
Ksushenka, daughter, do you 
want to kill me?

187
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,392
Yashka!

188
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,439
Burnash's people!
Quickly, behind a stand!

189
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,429
Korney, pour a glass for us!

190
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,476
Mikola...

191
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,630
Don't beat him, he is an actor!

192
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,475
black eyes, burning eyes...
Passionate and beautiful.

193
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,229
How much I love you...

194
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,549
Good evening!

195
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,876
Korney!

196
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,316
Where is Terrible?

197
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,710
- Does it hurt? - It's OK.
- Darn you!

198
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,869
What? I am really...
I would walk wounded for all my life.

199
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,035
Sit still, don't move.

200
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,312
- So?
- I killed the bastard.

201
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,348
Comrade Danil, what shall we
do with them?

202
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,792
Go to the church tower, call the people.
The people will judge.

203
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,315
Once the satan walked,
the satan was bored,

204
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:23,833
He knocked on the door of one soldier girl.
He said: I won't say a word,

205
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,958
He said: I just sit for a while.

206
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,075
I will rest, he said, won't say a word,
I will just sit next to you.

207
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,188
And a girl lives alone for many years.

208
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,635
Satan rested at her place,

209
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,955
And a year later, next to stove, 
are banging with spoons

210
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,593
maybe five or maybe seven baby satans.

211
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,272
I would go back to my dearest long ago,

212
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,678
But devil Mahno is standing on the way.

213
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,069
And while I am there in the war,

214
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,254
you, Marusia, don't trust the satan.

215
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,340
Comrade commander!

216
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,078
An urgent message,
comrade commander.

217
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,636
Village Zbruevka is freed
by a squad of some avengers.

218
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,509
- Some... who are they?
- We don't know exactly.

219
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,598
- Do you have any connections with them?
- It is impossible.

220
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,797
- Why?
- They are not there.

221
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,079
- Who? - Avengers.
- And Zbruevka? - Zbruevka is there.

222
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,433
I don't understand.

223
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,718
*cuckoo*

224
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,030
Avengers...
Red avengers!

225
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,420
*To Chieftain Gnat Burnash.*

226
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,420
Valera, have a look.

227
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,637
"Hey, godfather Gnat. 
I send you my son Grigory.

228
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,073
I feel that he will be a good cossack.
Don't think that he's too young.

229
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,715
He will cut red robbers,
just like me.

230
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,635
If you knew, how I sometimes want 
to ride a horse,

231
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,119
but my arms lost their strength,
and my legs don't walk as before.

232
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,918
Farewell, friend chieftain. Your old
cossack Semyon Kandyba".

233
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,068
- And that Grigory, he is as high as me.
- What do you mean?

234
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,152
I mean, it is a good time to pay a visit 
to chief Burnash!

235
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,669
- It is too risky, Danka!
- With this letter there's nothing to be afraid of.

236
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,110
- And if they recognize?
- Who?

237
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,353
Terrible is dead,
And no one else knows me.

238
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:35,200
With great love and joy
People meet their liberators -

239
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,117
the free army of chief Burnash.

240
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,670
In their impotent rage red comissars
send their hirelings,

241
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,836
to trouble people.

242
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,830
And thus I declare

243
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,356
...that for capture of "red avengers" gang

244
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,076
from chief's own funds will be given: 
Money...

245
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,036
Is it Sidor came back?

246
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,753
...in Tsar "katenkas" - 100 roubles,
in "kerenks" - 1,5 meters...

247
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,670
In soviet roubles - 2 thousands
and 5 thousands in cheque from chief himself.

248
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,672
This will be announced over all
villages in two days.

249
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,313
Chieftain Gnat Burnash, 
Year 1920, month of May.

250
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,790
You must be mistaken, Sidor.
I know his dad, good cossack Semka Kandyba,
 for 10 years.

251
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,550
Did you ask that son of your friend
for any papers?

252
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,629
Put his shirt up and read yourself.

253
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,354
His back is all written over with a whip.

254
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,100
He will carry that "paper" for a long time.

255
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,751
I did it, Gnat, you understand, I did it!

256
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,753
If you want more, chief, I have a full pot.

257
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,392
- Grinya! - What, chief?
- Nothing, go.

258
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,031
And if you need anothe paper, there is 
a letter from his father.

259
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,070
You became suspicious, Sidor. 
Even me you don't believe.

260
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,550
- I believe my own eyes!
 - Sidor!

261
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,910
How long does this cossack stay here?
two weeks?

262
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,998
And now think, 
what happened in these two weeks?

263
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,828
A squad of Ilyuha was ambushed.
You will say that this is an accident?

264
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,159
We sent people for bread in the old village - 
not a grain, as if there was a secret deal.

265
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,153
And that plaque among the horses - 
their water was poisoned.

266
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,709
Your cossackling is planted.
He is a spy.

267
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,468
You are tired from the road, that's why 
you see enemies everywhere.
Go have a rest.

268
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,195
Good, doog, chieftain...

269
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,236
And you, lad, thought that you'd buried me?

270
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,835
What are you talking about, uncle Sidor?
You mistook me for someone.

271
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,388
Maybe I mistook.

272
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,313
Ignat!

273
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,395
Saddle my horse.

274
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,872
And keep an eye on this cossack.
if he disappears, I will tear your skin off!

275
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:36,595
- Why would he disappear?
- They might steal our Grinya.

276
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,636
- Who?
- Red bastards. Understood, fellow?

277
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,316
I couldn't believe myself!
And then looked -

278
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,558
A coffin with the dead flies over gravestones,

279
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,154
And along the road stand corpses with scythes.

280
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,156
And silence...

281
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,560
Watch out!

282
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,592
Horses went mad!

283
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,997
Go!

284
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,190
Grinya, are you hurt?
Goodness.

285
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,116
Bastard, your yeys, parasite.
I'll tell the Terrible...

286
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:16,039
Uncle Ignat! Come here! What a joy!
Our cossack's father came here!

287
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,838
He's waiting in the headquarters.

288
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,829
Grinya...

289
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,920
- What?
- Chief is calling.

290
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,273
- Something happened?
- Yes, happened. Go!

291
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,675
Grinya, treat is on you!

292
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,951
Go, you'll see yourself.

293
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,072
Go, go.

294
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,398
Birthday child.

295
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,271
You called, chief?

296
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,675
Called.

297
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,274
What are you waiting for, fool?
Hug your dad.

298
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,190
Where is Grinya?

299
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,912
Where is my son?

300
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,750
Grinya!

301
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,397
Don't touch!

302
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,473
That was smart.
Order to guard him properly.

303
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,156
And now I believe. I swear, I believe.

304
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,109
- We have to attack at once.
- No, too much noise.

305
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,511
- And if it won't do, we'll die together.
- Wait with dying.

306
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,875
Maybe we'll think of something better.

307
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,795
- And what if he won't fit?
- He should, if only the rope is strong enough.

308
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,398
- Lies.
- Wait, you. What was next?

309
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,432
And along the road stand corpses with scythes. 
And silence...

310
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,836
Lies.

311
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,837
...lies.

312
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,796
- Run, Ksanka is waiting in the ravine.
- Wait, I have a debt here.

313
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,911
It has to be returned.

314
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,351
Lie down!

315
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,477
A chief's cossack, and appears
to be planted.

316
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:41,631
Throw a lad some potatoes,
what is he dies from hunger.

317
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,837
Unclean... unclean... brothers!

318
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,273
Unclean!

319
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,390
Unclean force here!

320
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,356
He ran!
Ran away!

321
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,278
Unclean! Run for your life!

322
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,439
Brothers... he ran away!

323
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,235
- Ride towards crossroad.
- I'll catch up with you.

324
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,748
- The Reds! - He ran away... - A gun!

325
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,276
Get on your horses, quick, you dogs!

326
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,594
There is he, bastard! Get him!

327
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,678
A horse, give me a horse!
Get him, take him alive!

328
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,000
- Hey, good man,
What is happening here?

329
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,340
- I don't know myself, wait!
 - Where are you going? What's happening?

330
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,000
- Fire!

331
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,300
- Run, brothers! Save your lives!

332
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,072
- The Red squads!

333
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,117
- Where do they shoot from?
 - Aim!

334
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,197
- Treason!
 - He ran! He ran!

335
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,394
Get him! Take him alive!

336
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,198
Go!

337
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,679
Dogs, they rob Budenny's train!
What if we swipe it?

338
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,637
- How?
 - I don't know yet.

339
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,792
Wait. It's Grinya, chief's cossack.

340
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,591
Put your gun.

341
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,198
- Throw the bags back!
- Why is it?

342
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,030
Are you waiting for death?
The Reds are just behind us.

343
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,759
The Reds are coming.

344
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,835
In the carriages, quick, fellows!
Set the defence. Machine gun in the cave.

345
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,310
Well, cossack, go in the cave.

346
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,356
Treason!

347
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,078
Burnash's are on the roof!
 - Let them get closer.

348
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,273
Yashka!

349
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,032
We'll get to the bridge.
They won't go further. There are our people.

350
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,280
The bridge burns!

351
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,951
Burnash's set it on fire!

352
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,700
- Can we make it?
- We'll try, son.

353
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,951
Fire! The bridge is on fire!
Fellows, jump!

354
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,036
So, guys, let's get acquainted.

355
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,914
- Commander Budenny.
- Danka Shus.

356
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,800
- Sister.
 - Ksanka Shus.

357
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,758
Valerka Mesherakov.

358
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,796
- Yashka the gypsy. No surname.
- How can it be? Did you hear, no surname.

359
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,033
Gypsy. Yakov Gypsy,
Do you mind?

360
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,435
He don't mind.

361
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,356
I won't ask about your deeds.
I've heard about them.

362
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:22,117
You will tell them later, 
in peaceful times.

363
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,516
You'll dramatize a little bit, as you should.

364
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,030
If you don't lie a single bit - you won't 
tell a story. But later with that.

365
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,193
For now you are soldiers of the regular Red Army.

366
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:51,596
Let the sinister raven
not hover over the heaths.

367
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,474
Because we are going
to live for a whole eternity.

368
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,193
And if a disaster falls over the world again,

369
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,553
and the sky bursts with fire,

370
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,392
Just whisper us a word,

371
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,995
We'll come to help.

372
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:48,095
If a disaster falls upon the world,
And the sky bursts with fire,
Just whisper a word to us, we'll come to help.

373
01:13:00,195 --> 01:13:05,195
