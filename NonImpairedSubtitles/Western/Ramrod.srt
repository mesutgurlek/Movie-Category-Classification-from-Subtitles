1
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:18,173
Ramrod

2
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:46,188
Mr. Dickason, your daughter is with him.

3
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:31,252
-You'll be around, won't you?
-Sure

4
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:33,969
...I'll be around.

5
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:36,135
Thanks.

6
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,269
Hello, son...

7
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:20,472
Hello, sherrif.

8
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:31,119
You weren't quite so steady on your fins
the last time I saw you.

9
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,713
Took me about a week to rope
that hangover.

10
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,613
Speaking of drinks, I owe you one.

11
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,302
Alright...

12
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,844
<i>Back for more punishment, I see...</i>

13
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:56,714
Two.

14
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,820
I've turned over a new leaf
since the sherrif got me a job.

15
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:06,079
Is Shipley really leaving on the stage
tonight?

16
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:07,914
So he says.

17
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,753
Seen Ivey around?
-No.

18
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,022
He plays his cards smart.

19
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,316
Any chance of getting Connie
out of town?

20
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:18,670
No.

21
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,721
A dangerous set-up... you stay out of it.

22
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:25,987
I work for Walt.

23
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,845
For three weeks? What do you owe
that fool? Your life?

24
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,099
Maybe.

25
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,614
Thanks for the drink, son.

26
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,782
Make it two.

27
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,296
Hey, Dave...

28
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,019
Where you been?

29
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:18,045
I though you'd run out
-No.

30
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:22,327
Dave.... If our plan works,
you'll be the foreman.

31
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,779
The ramrod of the whole outfit.

32
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:31,229
Ivey's not here. He won't be either.

33
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,034
You think he'll show?

34
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,365
Yeah.
-What makes you so sure?

35
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,378
Frank Ivey

36
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:54,163
Connie wants to see you... upstairs.

37
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,758
Why?

38
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:58,723
She's got a notion I'll need help.

39
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,439
<i>Come in.</i>

40
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:49,290
Sit down.
-Walt said you wanted me.

41
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:50,386
Yes.

42
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,414
Walt thinks Ivey's only bluffing...

43
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:58,917
...they won't stop him from taking
the stage. -But you think he meant it.

44
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:02,702
My own father's with Ivey against
the man I'm going to marry.

45
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:05,433
Don't you understand
what I'm up against?

46
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:07,165
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,762
The valley is public grazing land.

48
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,132
Walt has as much right there as anyone.

49
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:15,808
But he threatened to bring in sheep.
This is cattle country.

50
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,803
You know how sheep ruin
a country for cattle

51
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:23,032
How many men will be there when
the stage comes?  -I don't know.

52
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:26,444
You saw you father and his hands
at the blacksmith shop.

53
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:30,763
I told Dad if his men step in, I'll
never set foot in his house again.

54
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,844
There's still Frank Ivey.

55
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,287
Will you stick by Walt?

56
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,585
He helped me when I needed it.

57
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,827
Thanks.

58
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:55,131
What if Walt takes the stage?
He does bring in sheep?

59
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,504
He won't even bring them in...

60
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:01,234
If he makes the stage tonight,
he'll control the valley.

61
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,953
Goodnight Ms. Connie.
-Wait!

62
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,986
I'll go downstairs with you.

63
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:20,437
No, you won't.

64
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:23,130
The whole town knows Ivey
wanted to marry you.

65
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,155
If you're there, they'll say he's
hiding behind your skirt.

66
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:28,908
That's one sure way of ruining it.

67
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,883
This is Shipley's bag.
-Stage ready! Get aboard!

68
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:44,687
Made up your mind, sheep-man?

69
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:48,398
I'm going.

70
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,131
Are you?

71
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,048
I see you, drunk.
-Listen Ivey...

72
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:05,964
You're not god. You can't
keep a man off a stage.

73
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:20,248
Throw down his valise, Harry.
He's not going.

74
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,426
Is that you, Dave?

75
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,442
It's your father, Connie.

76
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,158
I've come to take you home.

77
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,455
-I suppose Ivey sent you.
-No

78
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:19,129
I just thought, on account of tonight,
you might want to come home.

79
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,829
Connie, are you hurt about
Walt throwing you over?

80
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,389
You have such a thoughtful
way of putting it.

81
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,941
Walt didn't throw me over.

82
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:34,323
He just decided he didn't love
me enough to die for me.

83
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,058
-Now...
-It's the truth!

84
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,417
He gave you a wonderful excuse
with his threat of sheep.

85
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,693
Now you and Frank are right back where
you started, hoping I'll be impressed.

86
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,798
Well, I'm not and I'm clearing out!

87
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,739
I don't understand you.

88
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:50,871
At first, I thought you were
just headstrong.

89
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,103
When you were little, I'd get a kick
out of seeing you stand up and fight.

90
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:57,336
But...

91
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,649
Tonight, men could have been
killed because of you.

92
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:05,305
Could have... but they weren't.

93
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,948
From now on, I'm gonna
make a life of my own.

94
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,981
And being a woman, I won't
have to use guns.

95
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,070
There's something else...

96
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:18,473
This isn't just a fight between
father and daughter.

97
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,450
You've pushed Ivey on me
since I can remember.

98
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,125
For years, I've watched him run things.

99
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:26,347
The town, the valley, you, now me!

100
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:29,840
No ones ever had the nerve to
stand up to him. Well, I have!

101
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:33,570
I'm warning you, don't get in my
way! And that goes for Ivey!

102
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,232
Now, get out!

103
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,546
Get out!

104
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,669
-Evening, Rose.
-Come on in, Dave.

105
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,572
Have you eaten?
-Yes.

106
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,228
Come on, we'll have a cup of coffee.

107
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,343
I heard what happened.

108
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,374
What are you going to do now?
-Drift.

109
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,854
Where's Bill?

110
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,417
You know Bill.

111
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,394
He'll hang around town
for a week, raising cain.

112
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,831
Then, all of a sudden, he's gone.

113
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,638
Present for you.

114
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,049
It's lovely!

115
00:14:52,478 --> 00:14:54,173
It was sweet of you, but...

116
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:58,789
Martin Bondurant already told his wife
about the expensive silks just in.

117
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:02,544
If I appeared in a dress
of the same material...

118
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:05,207
-I never thought of that.
-Of course.

119
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,010
What's the matter?

120
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,349
Why don't you get it off your chest?

121
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:26,507
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

122
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,499
You're not, Rose.

123
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,557
I lost my wife when our son was born.

124
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,975
He would have been six
just three weeks ago.

125
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,914
-Would have been?
-Yeah...

126
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,791
I was buying cattle in a small
way and had to travel

127
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,669
So I left him with friends.

128
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:55,269
While I was gone, their house burned.
He was in it, sleeping.

129
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,749
They died trying to save him.
-Liquor didn't help.

130
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,821
Bill Schell's crazy talk didn't
help, either.

131
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:09,527
It was you, Rose. Putting up with us,
cheerful, not asking questions.

132
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,310
That's why I wanted to thank you.

133
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:18,141
If you don't mind, I'll like to
keep this, afterall.

134
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,814
If you don't mind, I think I'll
have that supper, afterall.

135
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,361
I thought you would.

136
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:38,535
-Morning, Ms. Connie.
-Morning.

137
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,601
I suppose you know Walt's gone.

138
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:55,113
<i>"Connie... This is the kind of
a beating I can not take. </i>

139
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:59,629
<i>I have signed my ranch over
to you. Good Luck, Walt."</i>

140
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:01,547
Well...

141
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,446
-What did you expect him to do?
-Marry me and stay and fight.

142
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,570
Not stick a note under my door and run.

143
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:12,069
He just wasn't strong enough, was he?
-No.

144
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:17,160
Well, I am. Strong enough to be both
Dad and Ivey at their own business.

145
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,049
They broke Walt and I'm going
to fight back.

146
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,917
I'll make Circle 66 an outfit
they'll respect.

147
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,708
I want you to run it.

148
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,460
No, ma'am.

149
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:29,605
Why not?

150
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:34,842
They didn't break Walt. They were just
fighting sheep, like any cattleman.

151
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,797
They'd break any man I wanted.

152
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:40,749
They'd find a reason. Like they made
sheep the reason for breaking Walt.

153
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,954
But I'll never turn to Frank Ivey.

154
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,197
A little money of my own. Enough to
buy some cattle and hire a crew.

155
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,678
They won't break anybody when
I get through with them.

156
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,071
Connie...

157
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:57,250
Better let Link drive you home now that
your sheep-herder's thrown you over.

158
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,373
Thanks, Link. But I'm not going home.

159
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:04,802
Walt left me his ranch, and I'm moving
in on valley grass. All I can hold.

160
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:09,877
Wait, you're just excited.  You don't
think we'd let you steal our grass.

161
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,893
It's a free range.

162
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:15,158
I warn you. They'll be gunplay.
Men will get hurt.

163
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,825
Your men, too.  -What's come over you?
You've changed?

164
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:22,872
You're so hard?
-Coming from you, that's a compliment.

165
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:34,327
Looks like we won the first round.
-Not we. This is your fight.

166
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,305
You afraid?

167
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:39,156
When I take the count, it'll
be for my own mistakes.

168
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,016
If I can draw my wages, I'm drifting.
-I'll leave it over at the Special Saloon.

169
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,880
You change your mind, come back.

170
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,044
You'll always have a job as
long as I have a ranch.

171
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:51,702
Thanks.

172
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:58,834
Howdy, Dave...

173
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,149
Ms. Dickason sent this over for ya.

174
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,190
Hello, Jim...
-I hear your boss ran out on ya.

175
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:12,094
Now you'll have to get a new sucker
to pay for your drinks, boozehead.

176
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,425
I'd go careful, Red.

177
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,022
Sounds like Shipley, don't he?

178
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,567
He just talked.

179
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,671
So do you.

180
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,384
That's enough!

181
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:01,734
-A man would never do that to me.
-Or me.

182
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:07,219
Too bad you joined up with the
wrong outfit. Now, you're drifiting

183
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,557
-Am I?
-Yeah

184
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,098
When I'm ready.

185
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,878
I warned you it was a tough set-up.

186
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,421
I didn't stay out of it.

187
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:37,792
Well, there are other places.

188
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,428
You, too?

189
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:45,817
Sometimes it's hard to choose
between friendship and duty.

190
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,258
And you've been sherrif a long time.

191
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:09,181
Hello, Dave.

192
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:14,738
-How many hands you think you'll need?
-All you can get.

193
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:20,227
Afraid that won't be many. Ivey scared
all the spare hands out of the valley.

194
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:23,058
There's one I think I can get.
He may know of others.

195
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,229
Stick close by the house
'till I get back.

196
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,252
Howdy.

197
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:05,996
I'm looking for Bill Schell.

198
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,997
Have you seen him?

199
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:10,504
Nope.

200
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,140
I'll have a look around.

201
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,234
Go ahead.

202
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:24,549
Thanks.

203
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,067


204
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,517
How are you kid?

205
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,504
It's alright. He's a friend of mine.

206
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:07,639
You look fine, kid.

207
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:10,351
Why'd you wanna go to work for?
I miss you.

208
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,189
How's Rose?

209
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:16,975
She's fine.

210
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,243
You on the dodge?

211
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:25,268
I kissed a fella's girl last night.
George thought you'd might be him.

212
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:30,731
-How'd you like to go to work?
-Work? What for?

213
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,287
I still got some money.

214
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,452
How do you stack up with Frank Ivey?

215
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:40,144
I worry him. I have too much
fun to suit him.

216
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:43,849
I don't like him either. He makes
too big of tracks.

217
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,541
Walt Shipley gave Connie Dickason
his ranch last night.

218
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:50,513
She's out to get Ben and Frank.
I'm hiring an outfit.

219
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:54,005
You're not like me, kid. You don't fight for pay.

220
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,109
Ivey ordered me out of town.

221
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,349
Count me in.

222
00:24:01,994 --> 00:24:03,463
Under my orders, Bill.

223
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:07,247
That's the way it's gotta be, or
don't take the job.  -Sure.

224
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,320
That's the way it'll be, kid.

225
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,120
We oughta have three or four more men.

226
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:16,946
I can get fifty men to work for
nothing. Just for one crack at Ivey.

227
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,282
Want 'em with grudges?
-I don't care.

228
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:22,806
But they've gotta pass with Jim Crew.

229
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,302
Jim Crew? What's he gotta do with it?

230
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:31,297
The sheriff's on blue chip. Anything
we do against Ivey has to be legal.

231
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:36,145
It's a deal.

232
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,531
Where's Ms. Connie?

233
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,012
Ms. Connie went back home to get her
trunk. Then this happened.

234
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:48,915
Who did it?

235
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:54,317
We know who did it. I said before,
Frank Ivey leaves pretty big tracks.

236
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:58,518
-None we can show the sherrif.
-Who cares? We know who we're fighting!

237
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,666
Now's the time to take him apart.

238
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:05,896
I give the orders around here and we're
playing this on the square. Remember?

239
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:11,058
Alright... Alright, kid.

240
00:26:12,502 --> 00:26:13,952
You're the ramrod of this outfit.

241
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:16,985
Wait here until I get back.

242
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,443
If you're so set on a running a ranch,
you can have mine.

243
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:34,492
Anytime you want it
-You and I would get along a lot better...

244
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,018
...if you pulled back to your
side of American Creek.

245
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,028
And let you grab half the grass?

246
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:42,419
What if I won't?
-Then, I'll have to take it.

247
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:47,250
That kind of fight is supposed to be
from men. Think you're tough enough.

248
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:52,108
-She thinks Dave Nash is pretty tough.
-He'll be drunk when she needs him.

249
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,766
That's my risk.

250
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:59,274
You've heard my proposition.
Do I get the grass or not?

251
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,925
I said I'd stick by whatever
Frank says.

252
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:06,862
I've been doing it so long,
it's gotten to be a habit.

253
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,203
-Ms. Connie here?
-Yes, she is.

254
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,931
-How's your nose, Red?
-Don't worry. I can still smell with it.

255
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,392
Right now, I'm sorry.

256
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:20,878
<i>Come in, Dave.</i>

257
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:31,339
-No, thanks.
-Hello, Dave.

258
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:34,692
I came to help you.

259
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,052
Thank you. That's sweet of you.

260
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,983
-How's everything at the Circle 66?
-Just fine.

261
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:48,220
Everything's cozy and warm.

262
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,416
You still insist on leaving, huh?

263
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,805
Just what do you expect to
get out of this?

264
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:07,048
Wages.

265
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:11,513
And something Shipley said got
me curious.  -What was that?

266
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:13,415
He said Ivey wasn't God.

267
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:16,217
Ivey says he is.

268
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:19,250
I want to see who's right.

269
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,826
I'll wait for you outside, Ms. Connie.

270
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:56,143
What'll we do, Dave? We can't hold a
crew together without even a house.

271
00:28:57,187 --> 00:29:00,032
Sorry. It's my fault.

272
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:03,234
You told me not to leave the house.

273
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:07,341
Ivey's got a line camp near here.
It's built of stone.

274
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:08,622
Fireproof.

275
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,584
<i>Hello in there! I can lick anyone
in there for a meal and a bit!</i>

276
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,108
Well, if it ain't Bill Schell.

277
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,675
You wouldn't have to ask for a handout
if you'd get a job. Come in.

278
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,031
It's an idea.

279
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:51,626
Morning.

280
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,656
How many hands you got here?

281
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:04,398
Just us.

282
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,372
Makes it easy.

283
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,398
Come on in, Dave. They're all here.

284
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:23,491
Come on in.

285
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,505
Got a job, Gus. Forgot to tell you.

286
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,093
Dave, this is Ed Burma.

287
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:31,146
Ivey's tough ramrod.

288
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:33,934
I'll remember this, you saddletramp.

289
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:36,037
Get the buckboard up here.

290
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,333
Come on. Get out.

291
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,079
Come on! Get going, all of you!

292
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:52,690
Hurry it up.

293
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:59,840
Virg Lea... Try to hang him, he'd
go through the rope.

294
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:02,343
Jess More... He likes to play "injun".

295
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:05,264
-We'll be back.
-Anytime.

296
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,669
Ms. Dickason...

297
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,150
does your old man know about this?

298
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:12,607
Tell Ben and Ivey that she'll be
glad to trade houses.

299
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:15,109
Tell him it's for keeps.
-I'll tell him.

300
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,670
A sure sad bunch.

301
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:25,000
-Where do we put it?
-Oh, anywhere or there.

302
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:27,927
-After travelling all night,
I'm sure hungry.  -Me, too!

303
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:30,968
There's plenty of food here
for our outfit.

304
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,683
Hey, this ain't bad!

305
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,416
That's going to be just fine, Curley.

306
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,749
-It aint' stylish, like you're used to.
-It'll be alright when it's clean.

307
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,909
Give me a hand, Curley.
-You mean to wash this place?

308
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,651
At least, I can scold a few spiders.

309
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,881
Looks like we're going
to have visitors.

310
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,395
Good morning, Connie.

311
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:34,031
How's my little land-feed?
-I'm not your little anything.

312
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,544
Besides, this land was filed on today.

313
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:40,081
Seems you neglected that when you
built here.  -So I found out.

314
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,661
Very clever of you.
-The cleverness was my foreman's.

315
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:48,302
-Since we're busy, I'll thank you to get
off...  -Your foreman's new to this country.

316
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,618
I wonder who told him I hadn't filed.

317
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:56,976
Virg, bring Curley over.

318
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,977
We have a legal right to be here.
You can't put us off this land.

319
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,304
Oh, I can't?

320
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:18,269
I can discourage your men.

321
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:28,092
Alright, Virg.

322
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:42,934
<i>Stop it!</i>

323
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:46,438
Stop it!

324
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:49,786
Stop it, I say!

325
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:51,632
Hold it, Virg!

326
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,880
Take your dirty hands off her.

327
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:02,172
It's not the camp. It's not Curley.
I'd be through if I let you get away.

328
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:05,869
Can't play second fiddle anymore
than you. We're alike that way.

329
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,878
Nice, Connie. That's the first time
you've ever touched me.

330
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:20,790
Go ahead, Virg!

331
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:55,320
-Is the doctor here?
-He's out on a call...

332
00:34:58,602 --> 00:34:59,309
Dave!

333
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:02,441
What happened?

334
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:06,680
I couldn't stop it.

335
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,376
Two of Ivey's men held him, while
Virg...  -Don't waste time talking.

336
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:13,280
We've got to get him to bed. Take him to Rose's.

337
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,802
I'll get the doctor.

338
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,045
-Rose...?
-Hurry up, Connie!

339
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:37,910
Was he dragged by a horse?

340
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,694
No.

341
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:42,434
I'll relieve you later.

342
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:52,667
I'm sorry.

343
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:55,739
Somebody had to cry for him, I guess.

344
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,570
That's you, Rose.

345
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:04,168
I'll pay Ivey back for this if it's
the last thing I do.

346
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:07,881
Ed Burma's down there. Let's send
him back to Ivey in a basket.

347
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:10,692
-You do, and I ride out.
-They did it to Curley.

348
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,627
-Who you fighting? Ivey or Burma?
-Ivey

349
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,289
Then fight him. Get some sense into
that thick, little head of yours.

350
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,490
They want that. We make a wrong
move and Crew's on their side.

351
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,494
You won't back up your own men?

352
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,309
It's gotta be my way.

353
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,069
Jim...

354
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:55,711
Hello, Dave.

355
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:58,380
I want you to deputize me.

356
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,010
To go after Virg?

357
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,004
Lindstrom and I have already
attended to that.

358
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:06,553
Where is he?

359
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:11,334
Ben and Ivey's going his bail. Three
thousand. Ben's bringing it in.

360
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,294
I'd have done better.

361
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,486
I take my law from the book, Dave.

362
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:20,584
Virg'll go the pen for this.

363
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,047
And if Curley dies...
-Virg dies!

364
00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:27,594
...but it better be legal. Mind you that.

365
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:39,773
Hello, Burma.

366
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:45,448
Heard about Curley?

367
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,378
I had nothing to do with that.

368
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,159
I don't want no trouble, Bill.

369
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,992
You ain't got two men to hold
me like they held Curley.

370
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,306
Won't take a chance without them?

371
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:02,228
If I ever mind to fight, nobody
has to hold for me.

372
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,955
What'll take to give you a mind to?

373
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,400
Right now, an awful lot.

374
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:18,535
I won't be rawhide'd into this.
I ain't gonna draw!

375
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,297
They can all see my hands!
I ain't gonna draw!

376
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:40,127
Pokey... here.

377
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:44,655
Buy yourself a bottle and take a
vacation far from town. And quick!

378
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:53,277
Connie!

379
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:03,340
I heard two shots before
Bill could draw.

380
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:04,926
There's his gun.

381
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:07,084
This better be true.

382
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:12,552
Sure, it's been fired.

383
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,590
What were you doing all this time?

384
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:19,024
While he was shooting fast, I was
aiming careful. Ask George.

385
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:21,714
-Well, I...
-Sure. And I'll ask Pokey, too...

386
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:23,655
When we find him.

387
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,708
He sure let out quick.

388
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:30,010
Guess he was scared.  -Bill ain't the
kind to wait two shots before he moves.

389
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:34,211
How'd he get this burn on his hand?

390
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,869
Bill laid his cigar down. Maybe
Burma put his hand on it.

391
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,124
It happens to be on the back
of his hand.

392
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:44,519
He fell on his back.

393
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:48,309
It might have been under his hand.
-You two are lying.

394
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,825
George and Bill have been in
cahoots for years.

395
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,922
You put Virg on the barn. Why don't
you do the same here?

396
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:59,206
If Curley dies and Burma's been
murdered, Bill and Virg will both hang.

397
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,801
I can't hang a man for self-defense.
-Burma's dead...

398
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:05,749
And all Curley had was a poke
in the nose.  -Ben...

399
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,515
I'd like to show you what a poke
in the nose can do.

400
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,842
-I don't want to see it.
-Afraid?

401
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:13,409
Connie saw it.

402
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:17,552
Lindstrom...

403
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:25,588
I'd like to take care of Curley.

404
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:27,828
And pay all his expenses.

405
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,963
Paying his expense won't
restore his sight.

406
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,365
I don't want to fight with her, Rose.

407
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,651
She's all I've got.

408
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:47,974
She's got her pride, Ben. You
broke a man in front of her.

409
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,248
You don't know how a woman feels.
You didn't have to let Frank do that.

410
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:56,829
Maybe, but she couldn't have loved
Walt Shipley. He was trash.

411
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,397
What's Frank Ivey?

412
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:01,371
The biggest man in the valley.

413
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:05,010
I get Connie's side of it,
but I don't get yours.

414
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:08,306
Are you after Connie?

415
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:11,562
We'll just pretend you never asked that.

416
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:30,088
Hello, Bill.

417
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,359
Hello, Connie. Where is everybody?

418
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:35,666
Around.

419
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,175
Sure could do with a cup of coffee.

420
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:52,036
Bill...

421
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:55,769
Did Burma really draw first?

422
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,064
George said so, didn't he?

423
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:01,361
-Did he?
-What do you think?

424
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:08,191
I think you're not afraid
to take a chance.

425
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,257
I like that.

426
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:14,774
What are you after, Con?

427
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:18,096
Alright. I'll tell you.

428
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:20,415
I want to break Frank Ivey.

429
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,812
I want to see him crawl out of town
the same way Walt did.

430
00:42:24,268 --> 00:42:25,537
If Curley dies...

431
00:42:26,284 --> 00:42:28,019
Dave will take care of Ivey.

432
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:31,099
Dave's way is too slow.

433
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:37,796
Just what's on your mind, Connie.

434
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:41,528
I want you to stampede my herd.

435
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:43,880
Stampede?

436
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:47,754
It's the one way to make Dave
and Jim Crew more fast.

437
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:51,132
I've thought about it for a long time.

438
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,156
They'll think Frank Ivey did it.

439
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:57,414
Yeah.

440
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,026
They might.

441
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:01,532
They will.

442
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:09,508
This is something I didn't figure in.

443
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,468
What did you figure?

444
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:13,831
To tell the truth, I...

445
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:15,190
Why bother?

446
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,813
C'mon, people... push them on!

447
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,819
Keep 'em moving!

448
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:43,816
Head 'em for the cliff!

449
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:05,433
-Hello, Rose.
-Hello, Bill.

450
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:08,456
-How's Curley?
-I wouldn't go in now. He's asleep.

451
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,148
Wait a little while.

452
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,012
This is nice.

453
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:26,846
Bill... you've torn your sleeve.

454
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,589
-It's fine
-Give it to me and I'll fix it.

455
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:35,699
With two women out at the ranch,
I'd think you'd be looked after better.

456
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:37,342
No one looks after me.

457
00:44:37,864 --> 00:44:39,581
Annie looks after Connie...

458
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:41,765
And Connie looks after Dave.

459
00:44:42,494 --> 00:44:44,155
Who does Dave look after?

460
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:48,653
Who do you think?

461
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:54,875
The cattle.

462
00:45:12,314 --> 00:45:13,658
I wonder what's up.

463
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:23,506
Ivey and his crew jumped us about midnight.

464
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:26,828
Set us off of the herd and started
shooting.  -Part of them chased us...

465
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:29,646
...and the others stampeded the
whole herd off the cliffs.

466
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,736
So Ivey's really gone wild.
I'd never thought it.

467
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:35,888
He's always been wild.

468
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:41,132
Well, I've heard your evidence.

469
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,209
Remember boys, no liquor. We
got a big job ahead of us.

470
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:48,967
Your men ain't going, Dave.

471
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:52,880
Everyone of them has a grudge against
Ivey, and the law has to be immune.

472
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:56,365
-But you'll need help, Jim.
-Thanks.

473
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,211
This is my business.
-And it's my fight.

474
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:01,488
It doesn't call for shooting.

475
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:04,007
But it might if you were there.

476
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,340
You're probably right.

477
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:13,670
I know I'm right. This has been
my liftetime job, son.

478
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:20,269
You ever want to quit, I'll give
you a job on my outfit.

479
00:46:21,202 --> 00:46:22,881
Even sign you on as ramrod.

480
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:28,317
At my age, I take that as quite
a compliment.

481
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,743
Virg, watch yourself.

482
00:46:57,769 --> 00:46:59,057
Jim Crew's coming.

483
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,309
Hello, Jim.

484
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,410
Glad to see you. You look
kind of thirsty.

485
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,153
How about a little drink.

486
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:38,909
Come here for Virg?

487
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,693
No... I will be soon.

488
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,380
Doc says Curley won't last.

489
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:51,827
-Found Pokey?
-No, not yet.

490
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:53,096
Here.

491
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,066
Something wrong, Jim?

492
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,567
You coming?

493
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:04,889
Coming? Where?

494
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,831
To jail?

495
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:08,521
Jail? For what?

496
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:13,335
Stampeding Connie's cattle last
night wasn't exactly legal.

497
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:17,049
What? I wasn't off the place last night
and I can prove it. Come here!

498
00:48:19,478 --> 00:48:22,215
Where was I last night, boys?
-Right here.

499
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:23,671
All night.

500
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:27,686
He sure was. He won a months wages
off of me in the poker game.

501
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,105
You hear that?

502
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:32,962
Better put your boots on.

503
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:35,501
I told you I wasn't off the place.

504
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:38,806
You'll get a chance to prove
that before a jury.

505
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:40,149
You're lying.

506
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,191
I'm not lying when I say I'm
taking you in.

507
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:46,849
I'm warning you, Jim, get away
from here.

508
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:52,126
I'll tell you just once more.

509
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:54,048
Come along.

510
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,485
Don't do it, Jim!

511
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:02,978
Red...

512
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:12,927
-Get over to Dickason's and spread word
that Virg shot the sherrif. - Listen...

513
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:15,359
Shut your mouth! I'll take care of you.

514
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:17,854
Go on. I want Dave Nash to
hear about this.

515
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:40,116
Virg wasn't the real killer.

516
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:43,972
He just pulled the trigger.

517
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:48,209
I killed him.

518
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:53,269
I killed him by playing safe and
using the law as a weapon.

519
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:57,349
The law was just a tired old man.

520
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:01,034
Dave!

521
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,758
Don't risk everything now.

522
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:43,897
Ms. Connie...

523
00:50:44,223 --> 00:50:45,641


524
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:48,929
I hate to bother you...

525
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:52,811
...but there's something you oughta
know.  -What is it?

526
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,080
I seen what happened.

527
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:58,639
Your own men stampeded your cattle.
They done it on purpose. I seen them.

528
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,627
But nobody saw me.
-There must be some mistake.

529
00:51:01,816 --> 00:51:05,032
No, ma'am. Tom Peebles, Bailey
and Bill Schell... I seen them.

530
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:10,986
Sit down, Link.

531
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:15,838
Link...

532
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,410
You know Dad tried to force
me to marry Frank Ivey.

533
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:23,451
That's why I left home.
-So, I heard.

534
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:28,303
Frank fights dirty... and I've got
to fight the same way.

535
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:32,633
Curley's dying because of him.

536
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:37,168
I know Bill Schell stampeded the cattle.

537
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:40,471
The orders were mine.

538
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:44,838
But... on account of that, Jim
Crew is dead.

539
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,307
I know.

540
00:51:48,894 --> 00:51:51,824
It's a terrible thing to have on my conscience.

541
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:54,548
I didn't know this was going to happen.

542
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:57,952
Should I take all the blame.

543
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,468
Oh, no. Don't tell them nothing.

544
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:07,830
And you don't have to worry about me,
Ms. Connie. I'll keep my mouth shut.

545
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,528
Thanks, Link.

546
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:42,202
Dave...

547
00:54:43,564 --> 00:54:45,561
Frank Ivey killed the sherrif.

548
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:51,422
Dave...

549
00:56:52,523 --> 00:56:53,251
Dave!

550
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:56,897
You'll have to help me, Rose.

551
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:05,976
Where's Curley?

552
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:10,847
Died this afternoon.

553
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:40,859
-Fine!  -I'll find him. Bailey
and Peebles, too.

554
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:44,284
Why don't you look in Idaho or Montana?
They quit after Crew was killed.

555
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:46,667
C'mon, Nash is wounded. He
can't get far.

556
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:54,188
Head back to town!
-Out in the open, ain't it?

557
00:57:54,331 --> 00:57:55,811
Why not? I'm in it, too.

558
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:59,111
Didn't they stampede those cattle
and try to hang it on me.

559
00:58:31,593 --> 00:58:34,056
-Bill.
-Hello, Rose. How is he?

560
00:58:35,754 --> 00:58:37,154


561
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:42,247
I found out there's no passengers on
the stage. It's our only chance.

562
00:58:42,956 --> 00:58:46,745
They just been through our house.
Thank heavens Doc wasn't home.

563
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:56,027
Here they are.

564
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:59,275
You two women go out the
back way and quick.

565
00:59:04,484 --> 00:59:07,709
Where's my gun?  -You two get out
of here!  -I have an idea.

566
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:15,465
It's you. Well, I'm busy.

567
00:59:15,857 --> 00:59:18,470
We won't be long. Take a look
in the kitchen.

568
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:24,546
Just looking around.  -Look somewhere
else. Not here. I won't stand it!

569
00:59:25,385 --> 00:59:28,629
What's the matter with you?
-I want Dave Nash, that's all.

570
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,801
I haven't seen him. And if I had,
I wouldn't tell you.

571
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:35,679
Now, get out. Both of you.
-Not until I've found Dave Nash.

572
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,991
Nothing in the kitchen.

573
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,680
He isn't here!
-We'll see.

574
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,973
You're not going in. Mrs. Parks is
in for a fitting.  -I'll look anyways.

575
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:51,079
-You're not coming in! I'm undressed!
-I'm sorry. They forced their way in.

576
00:59:51,185 --> 00:59:56,416
-Better put some clothes on. I'm coming
in.  -I'm not dressing for your sake!

577
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:01,908
You think you can run this town?
Here's one person you can't run!

578
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:06,219
I know enough about this town to know
you've done one thing too many.

579
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:10,074
I never did think decency meant
anything... You listen!

580
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:14,688
They just brought in Pokey. He says
Bill rawhide'd Burma into that fight.

581
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:21,593
Bill Schell's dead. He may not
know it, but he is.

582
01:00:23,744 --> 01:00:27,346
I have some business. When I get back,
that fitting better be over.

583
01:00:27,851 --> 01:00:32,546
My fitting will be over when we get
things right and not before.

584
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:36,532
Bill Schell, turn your back!

585
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:46,404
Hey Pop, c'mon, we're going.

586
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:50,790
That's the first time you ever let a
woman bluff you out...

587
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,737
...cause she didn't have clothes on.

588
01:00:52,787 --> 01:00:55,591
She wouldn't have taken them
off if Dave was there.

589
01:01:03,653 --> 01:01:05,388
Dave, listen...

590
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:09,829
You remember what we told you?
You know what you've got to do?

591
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:10,989
C'mon...

592
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:26,853
You wait here.

593
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:00,549
C'mon...

594
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:13,127
-Ready to roll, Joe?
-Ready to roll, Harry.

595
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,947
Wait!

596
01:02:51,399 --> 01:02:53,769
-Is that all tonight?
-That's all.

597
01:03:01,892 --> 01:03:03,142
Hey there, Harry!

598
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,789
I'm looking for Dave Nash.
-Haven't seen him.

599
01:03:09,226 --> 01:03:12,884
If you do see him out on the road,
come back and let me know.  -I will.

600
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,697
-Go back to the house, honey.
I gotta get moving.  -Bill!

601
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:37,686
Yes?

602
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:45,024
Thank you.

603
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,578
I better go.

604
01:03:50,604 --> 01:03:52,657
I gotta beat Dave through the leaf.

605
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,125
-What's the matter, Bill?
-Alright, kid...

606
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:19,093
I'd have taken it easier had
I known Dave was inside.

607
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,501
Where you hiding him, Bill?

608
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:26,694
You're a friend of mine, but not that
good of friend. Another thing...

609
01:04:26,856 --> 01:04:29,773
If Frank Ivey hears of this,
I'm gonna kill you! Dead!

610
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:32,598
-Don't worry. He won't.
-I said "dead"!

611
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:46,085
Keep the bandages and medicine
separate. And see that he's warm.

612
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:55,118
-Morning, Rose.
-Morning.

613
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:56,845
Good morning, Ms. Connie.

614
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:02,927
-I'd like to talk to you?
-We'll go in the living room.

615
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,385
Sit down, Connie.

616
01:05:14,841 --> 01:05:18,032
Frank Ivey was at my place,
yesterday. Looking for Dave.

617
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:20,570
He's been hurt.

618
01:05:22,056 --> 01:05:24,109
I waited, but he didn't come home.

619
01:05:25,173 --> 01:05:27,226
-You've seen him.
-Yes.

620
01:05:28,103 --> 01:05:29,391
Bill's hiding him.

621
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:31,587
-How is he?
-Weak?

622
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:34,405
All he needs is rest and quiet.

623
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:38,324
Why didn't you send word to me?

624
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:44,276
You don't like me, do you?

625
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:47,505
I used to pity you, Connie.

626
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:50,604
You got a rough deal from Frank and Ben.

627
01:05:51,854 --> 01:05:54,336
But your fight is costing too
many lives.

628
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:57,061
It's not worth it.
-Isn't it?

629
01:05:57,223 --> 01:05:58,965
Not if Frank gets Dave.

630
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,447
He's the only thing that matters to me.

631
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:06,516
It happens I feel the same way, too.
-Not the same, Connie.

632
01:06:07,187 --> 01:06:09,898
You want him along with revenge and power.

633
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,762
You're letting him break himself
on your greed and ambition.

634
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:18,726
-You told him that, I suppose.
-You don't tell a man about a woman.

635
01:06:19,092 --> 01:06:21,443
You have to find that out for himself.

636
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:22,955
Where is he?

637
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:26,911
Frank Ivey will be watching
all of us. Especially you.

638
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:31,423
The only way you can get to Dave is by
following someone who goes to him.

639
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,070
You'll never find out from me
where he is.

640
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:45,446
Wow how. Good morning.

641
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:51,696
Sure take a lot of killing, kid.

642
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:56,843
You still hungry?

643
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:58,746
What good does it do me?

644
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:01,079
Any salt left?
-No.

645
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:04,177
But Rose is sending up some more grub.

646
01:08:04,693 --> 01:08:08,127
Some day, a man is gonna stop her
from taking in strays.  -Like us.

647
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:10,740
Yeah. Guess she won't know what to do.

648
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,249
-Has she got a man?  -She can take me
right off the Christmas tree anyday.

649
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:17,837
But she knows I'm a drifter.

650
01:08:20,532 --> 01:08:24,134
Jim Crew always said that no one
ever fools with Rose very much.

651
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,070
Just can't figure it out. I mean
Ivey cutting loose his dogs.

652
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,871
He was playing for Crew, same
as we were.

653
01:08:31,337 --> 01:08:34,120
Well, he probably got a wild streak.

654
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:39,422
No, things just don't fit. He knows a
stampede would bring Crew down on him.

655
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,893
If he wanted to kill him, there are easier ways.

656
01:08:41,943 --> 01:08:44,596
Well, he did and that's enough.
We're licked.

657
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:45,567
No.

658
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,365
There's just one load and a gun between
Connie and what she wants.

659
01:08:50,508 --> 01:08:52,195
The load that gets Ivey.

660
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:55,337
Not mine. I've seen Ivey work.

661
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:58,119
Anyway...

662
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:01,064
...when you're heading to ride
out of here...

663
01:09:01,265 --> 01:09:03,122
...it's over the hill for me.

664
01:09:10,987 --> 01:09:12,350
How about you?

665
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:13,936
I'll stay.

666
01:09:14,963 --> 01:09:16,785
What is it? Connie?

667
01:09:17,382 --> 01:09:19,883
-I don't know.
-Listen, kid.

668
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:22,757
Frank got shot at once for 
hugging a gal.

669
01:09:22,948 --> 01:09:25,958
Connie will get you killed just
working for her.

670
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:28,652
You better sleep on it, kid.

671
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:39,266
-Like just one horse.
-Probably, George.

672
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,964
I'll take a look.

673
01:10:10,843 --> 01:10:13,829
Why'd you come here? Didn't
Rose tell you you'd be followed?

674
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:16,909
I didn't know if Dave was dead or
alive. What was I suppose to do?

675
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:19,366
Wait. Same thing Rose is doing.

676
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:23,800
I was careful.

677
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,029
I wasn't followed.

678
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:30,175
Does Dave know the truth
about the stampede?

679
01:10:30,754 --> 01:10:31,892
Not from me.

680
01:10:34,878 --> 01:10:38,237
I feel the way you must feel
about killing Ed Burma.

681
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:45,519
You don't know. You're just guessing.

682
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,759
I know.

683
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:51,944
That's your secret, Bill.
The stampede's mine.

684
01:10:54,128 --> 01:10:55,509
Sounds like a deal.

685
01:10:56,143 --> 01:10:56,909
It is.

686
01:12:51,311 --> 01:12:53,234
Happy now? Ivey's after us.

687
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,745
I heard the shot.

688
01:12:55,548 --> 01:12:58,627
How do you feel?  -I'll be alright
when I get to saddle.

689
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:02,005
That's Connie's horse.
-Sure. And you're taking it.

690
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:06,165
You're riding south, alone. Connie,
you take my horse.  -Why?

691
01:13:06,371 --> 01:13:10,034
Look, kid. They followed Connie's
horse here. They know its tracks.

692
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:11,825
Ivey doesn't want her.

693
01:13:12,273 --> 01:13:14,718
-What about you two?
-We're heading north.

694
01:13:14,768 --> 01:13:18,816
They'll think it's you and me they're
trailing. Then, for a while...

695
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:22,013
...Connie will head back to town.
Then they'll chase me.

696
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:25,965
-I won't let you do that.  -Don't argue!
I can hold them off for a whole day.

697
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:28,408
They'll be out of the country by then.

698
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:41,627
Good luck, kid.

699
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:47,202
There's just one more thing.

700
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,703
Connie, I want you to hear this, too.

701
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:52,647
I braced Ed Burma, and got him cold.

702
01:13:53,506 --> 01:13:54,789
I ain't sorry.

703
01:14:00,724 --> 01:14:02,068
I figured you did.

704
01:14:16,826 --> 01:14:18,555
I came up here to help you.

705
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:21,261
But all I've done is put them
all on your trail.

706
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:25,709
You would have to come sometime. All
I'll remember is that you did come.

707
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:33,951
I'll be waiting for you. Hope
you come back.

708
01:14:34,828 --> 01:14:37,092
I will. I promise.

709
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:40,752
Connie...

710
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:44,466
You wanna be sure and get him
killed, just keep on talking.

711
01:16:26,634 --> 01:16:28,787
There it is, Connie. Head for Signal.

712
01:16:28,905 --> 01:16:32,124
-You heading for the Pass?
-No. Ivey knows we were at the mine.

713
01:16:32,174 --> 01:16:33,968
He'll have the pass blocked.

714
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,504
They'll corner you up there.

715
01:16:36,765 --> 01:16:37,555
Yeah.

716
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,288
But it'll take them plenty of time.
And Dave needs that.

717
01:16:41,709 --> 01:16:45,013
Thanks to you.  -Haven't
much for me, have you?

718
01:16:45,855 --> 01:16:48,933
You're like a horse or dog, or
a man or any other woman...

719
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:51,232
Once I understand you, you're alright.

720
01:16:53,504 --> 01:16:57,929
They stop you and you tell them you're
riding with me, they won't believe it.

721
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:24,750
Well, they parted here.

722
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:29,304
That goes back to town.
Nash wouldn't take that.

723
01:17:30,144 --> 01:17:33,057
You two better follow it anyways.
C'mon with us, Pop.

724
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,063
He must want to get himself
shot, taking this trail.

725
01:17:46,113 --> 01:17:47,557
We'll accomodate him.

726
01:19:58,267 --> 01:20:00,096
He'll never get out of there.

727
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,205
Alright, let's get her over.

728
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:28,834
Hold it!

729
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,489
Keep covered.

730
01:20:55,524 --> 01:20:57,054
We got plenty of time.

731
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,978
We'll wait.

732
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:23,394
You'll have to get mighty
close for that thing.

733
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:24,792
I'll get close.

734
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,481
Pop, take the ridge. You take
the collapsed side.

735
01:26:45,007 --> 01:26:45,870
Ben...

736
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:50,106
You'll have to stake me to a
fresh horse and some grub. 

737
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:52,999
You think you're fit to go on?

738
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:55,810
Link! Link!

739
01:26:56,687 --> 01:26:58,946
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

740
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:03,499
They got me on the run, Ben. They'll
be beating the brush for me.

741
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:05,729
I know. They are now.

742
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:06,812
Link!

743
01:27:07,838 --> 01:27:10,078
Get him a fresh horse.
-Right away, Mr. Dickason.

744
01:27:14,711 --> 01:27:17,268
Ivey shouldn't have got
Bill Schell that way.

745
01:27:21,785 --> 01:27:22,475
How?

746
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:25,709
A shotgun in the back.

747
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:48,771
Dave...

748
01:27:51,144 --> 01:27:53,346
Ms. Connie isn't blaming me, is she?

749
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:56,724
I haven't told a soul. Not
even Mr. Dickason.

750
01:27:57,911 --> 01:28:00,226
Tired, son? You'll have to talk plainly.

751
01:28:01,681 --> 01:28:05,873
Ivey didn't find out from me.
Maybe Bill Schell told him.

752
01:28:06,452 --> 01:28:07,721
Told him what?

753
01:28:08,859 --> 01:28:11,621
Don't treat me like I was
four years old.

754
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:16,280
When I told Ms. Connie I seen it,
she admitted giving the orders.

755
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:18,445
Orders for what, Link?

756
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:22,700
For her own men to stampede
her cattle out of the country.

757
01:30:24,575 --> 01:30:28,270
Listen, Frank. We've been riding for
two nights. We're all dead for sleep.

758
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,395
Go get some.

759
01:30:44,829 --> 01:30:46,098
Keep out of this.

760
01:31:03,895 --> 01:31:06,452
You gotta get awful close with that.

761
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:08,684
But you won't.

762
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,186
Dave!

763
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:45,366
I'm alright.

764
01:31:52,076 --> 01:31:54,353
It might have been you lying there.

765
01:31:55,392 --> 01:31:57,333
But it isn't.
-No.

766
01:31:57,836 --> 01:32:00,132
This is the way it was meant to be.

767
01:32:00,785 --> 01:32:02,390
It's all over now.

768
01:32:02,987 --> 01:32:06,096
You've got what you wanted.
-What we wanted!

769
01:32:06,339 --> 01:32:07,459
You and I.

770
01:32:07,888 --> 01:32:10,557
All this is ours now for
the rest of our lives.

771
01:32:10,762 --> 01:32:13,113
Don't you see what we've won, Dave?

772
01:32:14,774 --> 01:32:16,913
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

773
01:32:17,103 --> 01:32:19,697
I'm thinking of Jim Crew and Bill Schell.

774
01:32:20,406 --> 01:32:22,153
That couldn't be helped.

775
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:24,953
Link told me about the stampede.

776
01:32:27,976 --> 01:32:31,030
Would it make any difference
if I said I was sorry?

777
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:32,672
Terribly sorry.

778
01:32:35,154 --> 01:32:38,983
Funny how people fall back
on those words. "I'm sorry".

779
01:32:40,851 --> 01:32:45,628
What counts now is our happiness.
Our freedom. The way we want to live.

780
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:47,431
Not we, Connie.

781
01:32:47,767 --> 01:32:49,540
Just you. Alone.

782
01:32:52,377 --> 01:32:54,225
But we don't want it alone.

783
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:56,924
So you don't want it alone?

784
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:01,216
I guess that squares everything.

785
01:33:18,846 --> 01:33:19,723
Dave...

786
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:26,164
It sure is a pretty dress.

787
01:33:27,088 --> 01:33:28,245
You like it?

788
01:33:30,447 --> 01:33:31,194
Yeah.

789
01:33:34,594 --> 01:33:36,983
Would it do for a wedding dress?
