00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,221
My son is missing.

155
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,454
- How old is he?
- Thirty-five.

156

Your 35-year-old son
is missing?

157
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:32,293
And then I saw that television report
and I knew I had to come in...

158
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,907
...but I just couldn't make myself
come through the door.

159
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,303
Slow down, ma'am.

160
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:42,413
- Now, what's your son's name?
- Jeremy. Jeremy Thompson.

161
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,848
He hasn't returned any of my calls.
I'm afraid for him, sheriff.

162
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,646
For what he might have done.

163
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,520
Why are you worried about Jeremy?

164
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:57,190
He was a teacher's aide in Tulsa.

165
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,025
They said...

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,731
...he touched one or two of the boys.

167
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,872
He admitted to his sin.

168
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,666
He did his time.

169
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,402
And then, he moved back to live with me
about a year ago...

170
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,102
...so that I could help him.

171
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,747
Your son was a sex offender.

172
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,240
But he never registered.

I didn't want him persecuted.
He promised me.

00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,555
I wanted him to have a fresh start.

You said there were two missing
Cheyenne boys.

not even here. No note, no nothing.

- Your supervisor. Is that Ryan Shank?
- Yeah. I've tried calling. No answer.

192

Neel Cody, another Cheyenne
foster child, was abducted yesterday.

Now two more are missing.

- It's starting to look that way.

Did any of you see this man
last night?

No. We were sleeping.

What kind of car
does Ryan Shank drive?

199

A Ford Explorer. Gray.

I'll make sure Ruby updates
the AMBER Alert.

201
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,547
Would you show us Shank's office?

202
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,284
- These the boys that were taken?
COOK: Yeah, Cierre and Michael.

203
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,725
And Ryan.
He would do anything to protect them.

204
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,392
- Are the boys' case files in here?
- They should be.

Thanks for your time.

VIC: Didn't Branch say
that Ryan Shank said...

207
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,187
...he'd send Neel Cody's file as soon as
he got it back from the county?

208
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,115
That's right.

209
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,017
It was right here.
Right with the others.

210

What the hell you doing?

211
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,635
Sometimes you can learn a lot about a
person by looking at their bookshelves.

212
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,232
- Really? And what have you learned?
- A lot of science fiction. Asimov.

213
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,472
High school yearbooks,
which is odd for a man Shank's age.

214
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,873
He's either sentimental,
or living in the past.

215
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,850
For years, the county has been taking
Cheyenne children off the reservation...

216
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:46,287
...and placing them in homes run
by white men and white women.

217
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,221
But we expect that, don't we?

218
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:53,263
What we don't expect is for the county
to misplace one of these children.

219
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,560
And we don't expect
Sheriff Walt Longmire...

220
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,672
...to allow a pedophile
to roam our streets at will.

221
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,902
You think the sheriff would be doing so
little if the pedophile was a Cheyenne...

222
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,308
...or Lakota?
ALL: No!

223
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
You bet he would not.

224
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,048
Still think you want my job,
Branch?

225
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,413
That guy really doesn't seem to like you,
sheriff.

226
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,317
- You're not Facebook friends, I take it.
- I don't expect everyone to like me.

227
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,609
I expect them to leave politics out of it
when we're dealing with missing kids.

00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,427
Ryan Shank ever call you
about Neel's file?

231
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,567
Not yet. Sounded like
there was a lot of red tape.

232
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,567
He lied. The file was in his office
the entire time.

233
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,604
- Was Shank up to something?
- He's missing.

234
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,775
Along with two boys
from the group home.

235
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,775
- You think he took them?
- You talked to him.

236
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,913
You get any kind of a hit off him?

237
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,881
He was upset, but under
the circumstances, that seemed normal.

238
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,752
Dig deeper. Vic, give him a hand.

239
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,962
Contact the missing boys' biological
parents, see where they were last night.

240
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,889
I'm gonna go deal
with the bureaucracy.

241
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,528
Seems both kids
had the same social worker.

242
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,358
Maybe she knows
something worth knowing.

243
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,962
According to Mr. Shank's files...

244
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,069
...you handled all three boys' cases.
- Mm-hm.

245
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:11,107
- Is there anything else that links them?
- Abuse, neglect, malnourishment.

246
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,869
That's what links them.

247
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,775
Unfortunately,
it's also what makes them typical.

248

There are so many Native children
to help, but with our limited resources...

249
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,578
...there's only so much we can do.

250
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,783
Do you have much contact
with Ryan Shank...

251
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,619
...the group home supervisor?
- I do. Why?

252
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,494
You think Shank might have acted
inappropriately with these kids?

253
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,166
Oh, wow. I, um...

with those kinds of accusations...

Last night.

260
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,348
It was a pretty mundane conversation.
But it was weird that he called so late.

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,078
A little after 10:30.

Have you dealt
with any emotional parents lately?

No.

00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:06,160
But I did have
a Cheyenne gentleman...

265
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,824
...visit me recently
about a friend's situation.

266

I tried to explain to him
the proper guidelines for appeal...

267
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,336
...but he was not interested
in having that conversation.

268

to discuss, Cierre.

I was not enraged.

I was insistent.

- A rhetorical flourish.

274

- Henry, why were you even there?
- They took Cissy Ponson's son.

275
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,086
They claimed
she was a falling-down drunk...

276
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,794
...that her car was here at
the Red Pony morning, noon and night.

A single mother. She does not drink.

What'd the social worker say
when you told her this?

281
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,982
She said there was nothing
she could do.

282
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,248
Well, I assume you know
that Cissy's son has gone missing.

00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,083
Jacob Nighthorse told me.

284
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,187
He seems to be taking
a particular interest in this matter.

285
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,489
Good. Everyone should.

286
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,463
A pedophile's on the loose.

I wanna find these boys
as much as he does.

makes this a political issue...

...the harder it is for us to do our job.

Or maybe he's making sure
you all do your job.

arrest warrants back at the station.

Those warrants get forwarded

He tried to kill me.
And you said he killed Ryan.

578
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,451
I thought so.
I know on the night of the kidnapping...

579
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,459
...he assaulted Ryan, took the boys
around 10 p.m...

580
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,824
...right after their last bed-check.

00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,827
Here's what's confusing.

582
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:16,368
Ryan made a phone call at 10:34,
alive and well.

583
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,700
He called you.

584
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,472
- I told you we talked that night.
- Ryan had just been assaulted.

585
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,582
The boys had been kidnapped.
Why call you? Why not my deputy?

586
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,118
I don't know.

587
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,187
He called to tell you
someone had discovered your scam.

588
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,390
You take Cheyenne kids
from their families...

589
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,072
...place them in Shank's group home,
collect the federal money.

590
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,030
I don't get any extra pay
for reservation children.

591
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,689
Not up front.

592
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,529
Shank took the extra federal money
and split it with you.

593
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,228
All those children
are in better hands now.

594
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,898
I was following up on reports
of abuse or neglect.

595
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:56,637
All those reports of neglect or abuse
were made by one man.

596
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,641
He was your plant.

597
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,845
He'd call in some fake complaints
for you in exchange for a little money.

598
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,650
You stole all these children
from their homes.

599
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:12,262
I do whatever I have to do
to protect children from neglect.

600
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm betting you'd do whatever
you have to do to protect yourself.

601
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,561
I think you saw Ryan Shank
after he called you.

602
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,772
I bet he was scared
after seeing Hector.

603
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,875
I bet he wanted to come clean.

604
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,171
But you weren't ready
to turn yourself in.

605
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,441
So you ran him over, repeatedly.

606
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,882
The next night, you drove yourself
into a tree...

607
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,023
...to cover up the damage to your car.

608
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,251
Shank had described the big,
scary Indian with the scar to you.

609
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,557
So you knew exactly what to tell me
to frame Hector.

610
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,860
I've devoted my entire life
to helping children.

611
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,303
That's certainly what
a Wyoming jury will see.

They'll see an articulate,
compassionate...

613
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:03,073
...white social worker accused
with circumstantial evidence.

614
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,612
You're right.

615
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:10,982
They won't see the cynical, burned-out
sociopath who's just out for herself.

616
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,056
You'll walk free.
Legally it's the perfect crime.

617
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,659
But there's something
you're forgetting.

618
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,626
Hector.

619
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,431
He knows about your scam, Crystal.

620
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,133
Also knows you tried
to frame him for murder.

621
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,974
Right. He'll make a great witness.

622
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,580
The scar-faced Indian
who kidnapped those boys.

623
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,112
The boys said it wasn't him.

624
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,412
They say a dog soldier abducted them.

625
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:47,080
The Cheyenne believe
an avenging warrior spirit...

626
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,421
...can take on any form.
Animal, human.

627
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:54,724
- And you believe that?
- I believe in transformation.

628
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,467
I believe we become vessels...

629
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,168
...for forces
we cannot control or understand.

630
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,378
When you drove over Ryan Shank...

631
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,340
...maybe it was the spirit
of the dog soldier that guided you.

632
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:19,616
Perhaps that spirit guided me,
once upon a time, as well.

633
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,655
So congratulations.

634
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,200
Without your confession,
we have no case against you.

635
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,872
But the dog soldier knows
what you've done, Crystal.

636
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,040
And when he comes for you,
I'm just a phone call...

637
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,149
...and a 20-minute drive away.

638
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,826
I'll come as fast as I can.

639
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,807
