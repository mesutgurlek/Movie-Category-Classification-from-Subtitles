1
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,919
Don Felipe. Don Felipe.

2
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,601
-Raiders, cutting out the cattle.
-lt's the Marlows.

3
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,432
-Where are the vaqueros?
-Driving the other herd to town.

4
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,938
They are rushing them toward the Trinity.

5
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:21,414
Old Felipe Robles raises nice stock.

6
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,953
Won't do him no good.

7
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:34,424
How is he going to pay us the money
he owes us if we keep topping off his herd?

8
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:39,265
l don't buy mortgages to get paid back.
l buy them to foreclose.

9
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,170
The black soil of Dallas County
will make us rich.

10
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:46,073
We'll bleed that old buzzard broke,
huh, Cullen?

11
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:50,478
The way l say. There'll be no killing here.
Things won't be like they were in Georgia.

12
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,642
-We didn't do so bad in Georgia.
-Thanks to me.

13
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,482
Any sniping here,
l'll bust your trigger finger.

14
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,557
And that's for you, too, Bryant.
You're too quick on the draw.

15
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:04,356
That doesn't do my business any good.
So stay out of Dallas, understand?

16
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,159
Any visiting to do, l'll do it.

17
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,031
You boys hightail it.
l'll take care of them.

18
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:37,188
Raiders cutting out your cattle, Mr. Robles.
l tried to stop them.

19
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,025
They're your men, Will Marlow.

20
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,693
My men? You aren't blaming me
for all the war-bred scum in Texas?

21
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,031
lsn't my fault
Texas isn't back in the Union.

22
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,106
And there'll be lawlessness until she is.

23
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:50,641
The Marlow brothers and trouble
came here together.

24
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:55,179
l'm still willing to buy your land
and take my chances against the raids.

25
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:58,875
There would be no raids if you owned
the Hacienda del Norte.

26
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,213
Luis.

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,192
Will just got through telling you
not to do stuff like that.

28
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,227
Yeah. Yeah. Said to stay out
of Dallas, too...

29
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,456
...but l don't aim to.

30
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,427
Brave, strong...

31
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,071
...just like lizards in dark corners.

32
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,106
But your day of looting is almost done.

33
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:25,608
A marshal of the United States
is on his way.

34
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,758
Be into Springfield, Missouri
in about 1 0 minutes.

35
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,588
Folks traveling west or south
change coaches.

36
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,169
Yankee marshal?

37
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,741
United States Marshal.

38
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,037
United States?

39
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:04,616
-All who thinks we're united, say, ''Aye.''
-Aye.

40
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:13,252
l'm inviting a lady carpetbag
to set betwixt her own breed.

41
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,519
With pleasure.

42
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,994
Cold as a witch's broomstick.

43
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:28,568
l-- l'm-- l'm Butterfield,
Saint Louis.

44
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,210
Dry goods, ladies' hose, and notions.

45
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,972
l'm Martin Weatherby, Boston.

46
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,739
-Stopping in Springfield?
-Momentarily.

47
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,352
-l have business with a William Hickok.
-Wild Bill?

48
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,421
-Greatest marshal ever lived.
-Yeah, l hear Bill's retiring.

49
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,150
-Ain't got no competition left.
-You say.

50
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,261
l saw he's scared he'll meet up
with Reb Hollister.

51
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:53,991
-That desperado?
-Desperado, you say? Patriot, say l.

52
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:58,126
Maybe Lee surrendered,
but not old Georgia Reb. No, sir.

53
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,899
He's a one-man war,
still marching on.

54
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:38,676
Stage for the West leaves in 30 minutes.
Them that want vittles better hurry.

55
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,196
Great day in the morning.

56
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:59,058
lt is pleasant.

57
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:02,826
There he is, boy.
The pride of Vicksburg.

58
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:07,063
The terror of Kansas.
That's Blayde Hollister.

59
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,301
You mean to say that a common outlaw
can walk the streets like that?

60
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,812
-ls there no law enforcement here?
-There's the law, Wild Bill Hickok.

61
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:51,846
-Hickok, l have a letter to present to you--
-Duck.

62
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,229
Spoiled the party for you boys.

63
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,931
l guess that settles
who's running this town.

64
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,770
l'll take that.

65
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,003
Mister, bring his horse.

66
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,614
-Nice shooting, marshal.
-Yes, sir. Shot him dead.

67
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:25,273
Well, if he ain't,
we'll put the hemp to him.

68
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,288
Here. Take your carrion out of town.

69
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:41,024
-Well, go on. Don't stand there gawking.
-Just a minute.

70
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,169
-l had nothing to do with this.
-Get going.

71
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:46,032
-We heard you give that rebel yell.
-You're quite mistaken.

72
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:49,539
-l have a letter of introduction--
-Boys, you wanted a hanging party...

73
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,973
...here's a warm one for you.

74
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:57,678
-Good riddance.
-Just maybe the town will settle down now.

75
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:00,581
Ruined my Sunday go-to-meeting hat.

76
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,103
Keep going, blue-belly,
or l'll fry you for breakfast.

77
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:30,111
This may not be my official district...

78
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,548
...but you've fallen into the hands
of a United States Marshal.

79
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,187
You like your bacon lean or fat?

80
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:40,258
As soon as l've eaten, l intend to take you
back to Springfield, to the authorities.

81
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,629
-What's the matter?
-Like Hickok said: Duck.

82
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,796
Thieving varmint. That a way
to return a favor? Stealing my hat?

83
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,963
You dang blasted showoff,
you cost me my best six-shooter.

84
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,971
Now, hold on, Reb.

85
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,579
l wouldn't stoop to such dirty doings,
carting off your relics...

86
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:04,183
...advertising l shot them off
Reb Hollister.

87
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,983
Now, where's my hat?

88
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,264
Well, l tell you, Bill,
there's a little boy l know...

89
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,732
...who'd be mighty proud
to have Wild Bill Hickok's hat.

90
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:28,772
Well, now.
That's a real nice thought, Reb.

91
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,008
-Want me to autograph it for the kid?
-Your initials are in it. That's good enough.

92
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,308
-Have some vittles.
-No. l gotta be getting back to town.

93
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:40,145
-The fight look convincing?
-Whole town ate it up.

94
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,222
-You're dead as a doornail.
-You sure untied my hands, Bill.

95
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,882
lt'll make life a lot easier for me,
Reb Hollister being dead.

96
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:51,121
-Aren't you going to arrest him?
-Oh, forgot about you.

97
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,094
l'm sorry l had to tin-can you,
mister.

98
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:57,293
l had to move Reb out of town before those
yahoos found out we was just play-acting.

99
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,928
Besides, l was afraid that getup
you're wearing might start more shooting.

100
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:02,864
-Preposterous.
-lt sure is.

101
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,602
l'm speaking of your dereliction of duty.
l'm informed--

102
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,043
You're informed?
And who or what might you be?

103
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:12,446
-My name is Weatherby, Boston.
-He's a United States Marshal.

104
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:14,882
-lt ain't possible.
-On the contrary, l have a--

105
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:18,888
-Hit something.
-Wh--? What for?

106
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,753
Well, Bill's a man that needs convincing.

107
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:48,149
Marshal, l'm glad l met you
while you were still with us.

108
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:52,052
You're gonna be
the shortest-lived marshal on record.

109
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,864
As l tried to explain this afternoon,
l have a letter from the Attorney General.

110
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,298
You're to accompany me
to Dallas County, in Texas.

111
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,198
Brigands are terrorizing
the district.

112
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,895
-Brothers.
-What's their name?

113
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,506
ls it the Marlow brothers?

114
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,142
Well, yes. Yes, that's it.
Evidently, a poetic family.

115
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,609
There's a Bryant Marlow, a William Marlow,
and a Longfellow.

116
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,806
-Cullen?
-Yes, that's it.

117
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,450
You know them?

118
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:20,643
l've never seen them.

119
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,180
These are orders, Hickok.
Your patriotic duty demands--

120
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,156
Sonny, there are duty scars
all over my hide.

121
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,262
From now on, folks are gonna buy tickets
just to look at them...

122
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,695
...on the stage of a theater.

123
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,232
You mean you're
going to be an actor?

124
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,232
Why not?

125
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:42,135
You're what marshaling
has petered down to.

126
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:46,802
Folks will be glad to pay
to see the genuine, hairy specimen.

127
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:51,980
Happy hunting, marshal.
The law is in your purty hand.

128
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,520
Marshal, this-- This outlaw.

129
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,212
lf you don't arrest him,
l shall.

130
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,618
Outlaw?

131
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,725
Let me tell you something, son.

132
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,019
This ain't Boston.

133
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:06,461
We had a war down here. You'll find men
in high office who are thieves, cutthroats.

134
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,830
You'll find others who are branded outlaws
that are only fighting for what's their own.

135
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:15,501
There's those known as bad men
and those as are bad men.

136
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,235
You better learn to tell the difference.

137
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,755
-Hey, where are you going?
-With you.

138
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,618
What, to Dallas?

139
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,625
Well, Hickok's out of circulation,
ain't he?

140
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,620
You mean that you'd
take Mr. Hickok's place?

141
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,961
-Why not?
-Why, l don't know you, Mr. Hollister.

142
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:44,399
You're branded as an outlaw,
a Southern guerrilla.

143
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,800
Though l can see merit
in what Mr. Hickok says.

144
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,601
Heaven knows you're more capable
than l, but--

145
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:53,074
-Oh, to make you my deputy.
-You still haven't got the hang of it.

146
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,645
l beg your pardon?

147
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,045
l'm not gonna be your deputy.
You're gonna be mine.

148
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:02,551
You're not known in Dallas. Neither am l.
So l'll be Marshal Weatherby.

149
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,748
Nothing new in that idea.
A regular custom up north, l understand.

150
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,758
Hiring other people to do
your fighting for you.

151
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:13,024
l was at Chickamauga, Mr. Hollister.
My brother was at Gettysburg.

152
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,262
Well, you're something brand-new
in carpetbaggers.

153
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:19,563
Well, anyway, you can forget about
the Marlows. One of them, anyway.

154
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,367
You just swear me in,
and l'll kill off Bryant for you...

155
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,874
...all in the name
of the United States government.

156
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,740
There's to be no bloodshed.
l merely want them apprehended.

157
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:31,577
-Apprehended? Bryant Marlow?
-Yes.

158
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:35,084
You remember that little boy
l was telling Wild Bill about?

159
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,813
You're him, bub.

160
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:52,334
Boston bean.

161
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,845
l look like a Yankee cod,
but l hope l don't smell like one.

162
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,481
Might be an improvement
over a Johnny Reb.

163
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,584
Take it easy, blue-belly.
You're lucky l stomached you this far.

164
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:09,277
But that's the way it's got to be.

165
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,945
You're me, but l'm not you.

166
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:15,025
And-- And when you're talking to me,
you're talking to yourself.

167
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,162
When l'm speaking to you...

168
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:21,596
...it's not me
l'm speaking to, it's-- lt's you.

169
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,258
Well, anyhow, you get the idea.

170
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:27,300
Anyway, l hope l can pass
for a railroading Weatherby.

171
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:31,102
You look that part more than
l look like Bill Hickok's downfall.

172
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:36,371
Only a Yankee tailor would outfit a feller
this way to ride across Texas.

173
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:51,089
l may as well tell you, l got into this
only to impress my fiancée.

174
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:54,632
Well, you can write back to Boston
and tell her all about it.

175
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,564
-She lives here.
-Why?

176
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,630
She only came to Boston to visit me.

177
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,770
Her name is Antonia Robles.
She's very lovely.

178
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,416
-You ain't all Boston.
-What do you mean by that?

179
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:15,386
Codfish ain't known for warm blood.

180
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:20,854
l haven't met her family yet.
They're in cattle.

181
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,290
lt seems they're involved in a land war,
so to speak...

182
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:28,229
...harassed by those Marlow ruffians.

183
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,715
Keep your hand off that gun.
We're looking for the Robles' place.

184
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:47,341
-Robles?
-Where is it? l'm the new marshal.

185
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,356
You are there.

186
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,591
Follow me, señores.

187
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,519
Don Felipe.

188
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:53,541
-This isn't the reception l'd expected.
-You are strangers.

189
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:56,313
l hope Tonia's more pleased to see me
than her father.

190
00:17:56,489 --> 00:18:00,892
-Now, wait a minute....
-Antonia? Then you-- You are Martin?

191
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,121
Do forgive me. You would be welcome
under any circumstances.

192
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:10,228
But coming as you do,
the marshal of the United States.

193
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,099
Antonia has told us so much.

194
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:17,504
l beg your forgiveness,
and welcome to Hacienda del Norte.

195
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,621
Let me present my son, Luis.

196
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,115
Luis.

197
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,619
l apologize for my son.

198
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:40,323
lt was <i>norteños,</i> men from the North,
that crippled him.

199
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,525
Oh, l understand how he feels about
<i>norteños</i>, as you call them.

200
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,330
We call them carpetbaggers.

201
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:51,175
Oh, l forgot. Don Felipe, my brother,
Daniel Weatherby.

202
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,140
-Daniel?
-From the lion's den.

203
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,644
Father was a great Bible student.

204
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:01,011
-How do you do?
-Antonia made no mention of your brother.

205
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:05,624
Well, l didn't tell her about him, black sheep
of the family. Father kept him hidden.

206
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:12,958
-Martin.
-Tonia.

207
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,497
Tonia.

208
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,865
-Tonia, dear Tonia.
-Martin.

209
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:23,533
No, no, no. Leave them alone
<i>un momento</i> together.

210
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,510
You are Tonia, aren't you?

211
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,051
-Who are you?
-Well, l'm not Martin.

212
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,090
l know that.

213
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,428
But on the other hand, l am Martin.
Martin's my brother.

214
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,493
Hey, Daniel. Come in here.

215
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:58,773
Oh, Tonia, darling.

216
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,469
Martin, why have you brought
this crazy one with you?

217
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:05,048
Oh, Señorita Robles, Mr. Hollister.

218
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,614
You overdid that, Reb.
You didn't have to be so convincing.

219
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,278
l had to hush her up.

220
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:15,291
-Martin, answer me. Why is he here?
-To ensure success against the Marlows.

221
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:16,826
He's my deputy.

222
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,588
Or rather, l seem to be his.

223
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:22,427
Whatever he is, he needs a tight rein.

224
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,134
He needs a drink.

225
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:32,202
lt's hard to explain, but it's important
that he be known here as Martin Weatherby.

226
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:36,144
No one except you must know who he is.
He has enemies.

227
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,976
This l can understand.

228
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,480
For your information,
l'll soon have fewer.

229
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:45,146
My interest in these parts
is the Marlow brothers.

230
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:54,494
My family must be told who you are.
They can be trusted.

231
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,034
That gringo-loving brother of yours?
Don't mislead yourself, young lady.

232
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,693
No gringo could be his friend.

233
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,340
Tonia, you must trust him.
He's come here to help us.

234
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:07,343
lt won't be too long a hardship, señorita.
l promise.

235
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:11,514
l never expected a deputy fiancé.

236
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,986
Martin was right.
You are very lovely.

237
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,157
And so is the Hacienda del Norte.

238
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,668
Good green land fit for cotton.
Got a nice, easy roll to it like--

239
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,919
Like your home?

240
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,215
l have no home.

241
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,818
You are Martin's friend.
This is your home.

242
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,599
Well, let's apprehend them.

243
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:43,808
Never launch an attack, Yankee,
until you know the tactical situation.

244
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:46,342
You learn that at Vicksburg, rebel?

245
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,173
Foreigner. l'll make it simple
so you can understand.

246
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:53,477
The best place to reconnoiter
is where the barleycorn flows.

247
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,852
l'm raring.

248
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,952
l can lick any man in the place.

249
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,435
-Howdy. What's your undoing, gents?
-Straight Kentucky.

250
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,703
l never drink before 5.

251
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,437
Set that glass right-side up.

252
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,946
-Why?
-Like l told you, turn it over.

253
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:29,110
By Godfrey, another one
wanting to lick every man in town.

254
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:32,223
-l said nothing of the sort.
-You turned your glass upside down.

255
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:35,326
-Let me cool this one.
-Wait, Dan. Don't draw.

256
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:40,663
That hat my brother's wearing,
he shot it off of Bill Hickok.

257
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,701
Yes, sir. There's Wild Bill's initials
right in the sweatband.

258
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,232
Dirty Dan here, he sure
cut the map of Kansas...

259
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,705
-...through the old buffalo's hair.
-Sure enough?

260
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,106
That don't give him no call
to be so overbearing.

261
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,214
Bear with him, boys. A thing like that
goes to a young fellow's head.

262
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,441
Set them up, bartender.
The drinks are on me.

263
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:03,384
-My name's Weatherby.
-Weatherby? You're the new marshal.

264
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:07,514
Say, been expecting you.
New marshal's here.

265
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,827
New marshal's here.

266
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,326
New marshal's here.
Hey, folks. New marshal's here.

267
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,505
What'd you say your name was, marshal?

268
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:25,973
Weatherby. Why?

269
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:28,875
Seems to me l've seen you before.

270
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,412
You haven't.

271
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,312
Coulter's my name, Bar W Ranch.

272
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:37,285
Welcome, marshal. Welcome.
l'm Judge Harper of the federal district.

273
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,522
You haul in the culprits, marshal.
He'll jail them.

274
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,684
When the evidence warrants it,
Mr. Walters.

275
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,138
Evidence? Why, everybody knows
the Marlow boys...

276
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,898
...are back of all this plundering.

277
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,565
Nobody's seen them breaking the law.

278
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,143
Particular, aren't you?

279
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:03,076
Dallas will be run by federal law,
not by mob rule.

280
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,581
We're not wild Westerners.
We're facing east, and that's our future.

281
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:09,687
We intend to build industries here
and culture.

282
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,720
Dallas will raise people, not cows.

283
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,018
lf your carpetbag riffraff doesn't
choke her to death in her cradle.

284
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,219
This seems a matter
for community action.

285
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,194
Back home, when faced with any problem
we had a town meeting.

286
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,458
l suggest we call one.
Where's your town hall?

287
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:26,866
-Yes, every town should have a town hall.
-We ain't got around to building one yet.

288
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,939
Well, l'll speak to Will Marlow about it.

289
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:32,133
Your judge here seems to think
he's a model citizen.

290
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:37,538
lf you're gonna fool around over there,
you better take Dirty here with you.

291
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,741
Yeah. He ought to be marshal.

292
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,377
He sure ought to.

293
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:49,755
l told you to keep your mud tracks
out of Dallas.

294
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:54,194
Now you're here, and you even
dragged these pack rats in.

295
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,357
lt gets lonesome out there
in the barrancas.

296
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,900
Then go buy yourself a bottle.

297
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,369
l never worried about your not having
something to keep you company.

298
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,737
Which one of you is Bryant Marlow?

299
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,237
-Who are you?
-My name's Weatherby.

300
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:13,876
Marshal.

301
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,721
l told you l'm not interested
in buying any property right now.

302
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,326
You can take your deal somewheres else.
Don't bother me.

303
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:28,730
l'm Will Marlow. Sit down, marshal.

304
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,999
You ain't trailing my worthless brother,
are you, marshal?

305
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,767
l didn't say that.

306
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,775
l'm in the market
for some real estate.

307
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:44,006
l thought l might be accommodating
the new marshal with a dwelling.

308
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:46,514
l even heard they might send
Bill Hickok down here.

309
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:49,518
Bill? Oh, he's fired his last shot
for the law.

310
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:50,916
He got drilled?

311
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:53,922
Fought it out
with a fellow named Hollister.

312
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,828
Hol--?

313
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,155
Where is he?

314
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,231
Hickok? He's retired. He's on his way
east to do some play-acting.

315
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,334
No, Hollister, Reb Hollister.
Where is he?

316
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,665
-Oh, he's dead.
-Come on, we'd better get out of here.

317
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,738
-You sure?
-Hickok had it all his own way.

318
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:11,899
l just happened to be there
when Hollister was laid out cold.

319
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,637
This calls for a bottle of bonded.
We owe Wild Bill a drink.

320
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:21,081
Well, my call isn't social.
l wanna buy a building for a town hall.

321
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,245
l suppose you know a valid deed
when you see one.

322
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:30,524
Marshal, you don't need to worry where
Will Marlow and legalities are concerned.

323
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,323
Well, here's 500 on account.

324
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:36,092
l'll post the balance
of 1 0,000 at the bank...

325
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:38,759
...to be delivered by me
when you produce a deed.

326
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:41,433
Ten thousand?

327
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:45,872
-Ten thousand?
-That's a big bundle.

328
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:50,848
You happen to know of a good
ready-made hall?

329
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:00,216
Yep. Know one would make a dandy.

330
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:06,958
lf l was to manipulate Bill Walters' head
in front of that top O in ''saloon'' ...

331
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:08,997
...could you let air in it?

332
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:15,099
-Ain't nobody could make a shot like that.
-Especially not from here.

333
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:19,771
Bill Walters got some horses
l been wanting to trade for.

334
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:26,216
You know, l never expected to find
a marshal with so much civic spirit.

335
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,922
Been to Georgia lately, Mr. Marlow?

336
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,332
l've never been in Georgia.

337
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,135
-You have, Bryant.
-That ain't Bryant.

338
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:49,762
Meet Jason Trask, my handy boy.

339
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,137
-Well, here's to Bill Hickok.
-Here's to all good marshals.

340
00:28:56,748 --> 00:29:00,650
You're doing your duty when you hunt
the likes of my brother Bryant.

341
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:06,113
You know, Mr. Weatherby here's likely
to be the ruination of your job, Jason.

342
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,156
Honest citizens
don't need a bodyguard...

343
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:10,954
...when there's a marshal around,
fit to keep the law.

344
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:25,299
Looks like one of them longhorns
got Bill Walters.

345
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,106
Poor old Bill.

346
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,307
You know, l've knowed
a lot worse skunks.

347
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:36,318
Odd happenstance. Walters' place
would make a fine town hall.

348
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:39,355
-Yeah.
-Who asked you?

349
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:44,894
-Gun's still warm.
-What gu--?

350
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,224
Don't cock that hammer,
you crazy coot.

351
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,890
Why not? Works good this way.

352
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:52,570
What's your name?

353
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:57,500
lt's still cocked.

354
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,436
We're riding out. Coming?

355
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:07,748
Have you got no brains?

356
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,911
Shooting from this office,
smearing your filth on me.

357
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,386
Get out, you and your scum.

358
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,117
Take the back stairs,
and don't come back.

359
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,931
-What happened up there?
-l just spent 1 0,000 of your money.

360
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,472
Cullen, get that dude!

361
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,064
Keep a keen eye, Dirty.

362
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,561
You did this to Cullen.

363
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:01,069
You're tempting me, Bryant,
every second you're in my sight.

364
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:05,907
Come out of there, all of you,
with your fingers in your ears!

365
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:09,410
Wired trigger. Bryant Marlow's gun.

366
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,872
l should've known that.

367
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,957
My own brother Bryant...

368
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,258
...he's been a cloud on me
everywhere l tried to go.

369
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:05,767
Looks like an honest man
hasn't got a chance.

370
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,834
l tried to hold him for you, marshal...

371
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,668
...but he led Cullen wrong
and got him killed.

372
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:12,639
You done right...

373
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,301
...marshal.

374
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,606
You only followed duty.

375
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,682
l'll help Dallas
to set the noose around him.

376
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:23,882
l'll give a reward for his capture.

377
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:28,216
l'll pay my tithes
to set this county free.

378
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,658
-Marshal.
-Quiet. Don't let them know l'm shot.

379
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:42,136
Get the horses. Gotta get out of town
without advertising it.

380
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,742
Should've taken you
straight to a doctor.

381
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:56,012
That's how you lost Bull Run, Yankee:
Letting the enemy know your casualty.

382
00:32:56,187 --> 00:33:00,556
He's right. lt's best the Marlows
detect no weaknesses.

383
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:04,991
Don't worry. We are good doctors here.
We had to be.

384
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,954
What a brave one.

385
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:09,760
The <i>valiente</i> who was
to remove the Marlows.

386
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,231
You had your chance
at Will.

387
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:14,304
Why didn't you shoot first
and ask questions afterwards?

388
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:18,209
-Or is it that you're afraid?
-Luis.

389
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:21,639
-Go from this room.
-Let the little scorpion stay.

390
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,043
He's right. l was afraid.

391
00:33:24,215 --> 00:33:27,810
Afraid l'd die
and leave Bryant Marlow alive.

392
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:32,055
l can't die, not until he's dead.

393
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,987
l'd give much
to be able to believe you.

394
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:43,732
-My brother wasn't always like that.
-He has a nasty bite.

395
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:48,134
Don't blame him. You'd be bitter, too,
if you were in his place.

396
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,707
Amelia, the iron.

397
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,441
Martin.

398
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:03,842
Let's face it, Tonia...

399
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,313
...Boston was one place
but this is another.

400
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:09,416
-Are you sorry you came?
-No, l didn't say that.

401
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:13,421
But every day l realize more that l've walked
into a world of which l know nothing.

402
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:19,623
-Could go back to your world, Martin.
-And admit l'm licked?

403
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:21,925
How long would l keep your love then?

404
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,091
l came here to take care of you...

405
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:25,497
...and l'll do it.

406
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,364
Martin.

407
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,435
That's for trying.

408
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:38,446
But learning to shoot like Mr. Hickok
won't help if you get sunstroke.

409
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,083
Here.

410
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,515
Duck!

411
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:18,087
Here comes Will.

412
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,599
Welcome, brother.
You can take over now.

413
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,201
l've had me a bellyful
of this coyote music...

414
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,099
...and l ain't just a bird cooing.

415
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,866
You'll stay here and like it.
That marshal's after you...

416
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,032
...so you pull a murder
for an introduction.

417
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,644
Harper says your gun's evidence enough
to hang you.

418
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:45,010
And l had to do plenty fast-talking
to keep myself out of your mess.

419
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,416
You and your talking.

420
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:53,990
lf you'd done it my way, we'd be
living in the Robles' hacienda by now.

421
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,661
Hacienda, he says.

422
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,825
So l wind up living in a dirt-floor parlor.

423
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,336
-lt's not your first one.
-Shut his mouth for him, Bryant.

424
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:11,407
Tell him what you said.
Tell him who's gonna be boss.

425
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:13,806
Boss? So that's it.

426
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:15,878
Do you want me to take a trip?

427
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:17,309
What for?

428
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,177
l might drop by some Army post.

429
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,286
Military always been interested what
happened to the Hollisters over in Georgia.

430
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:26,813
You was guiltier than l was.

431
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,653
-You're the one--
-To cover you, you trigger-crazy....

432
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,692
You leave evidence, Bryant. l don't.

433
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:34,127
That's why l could
give evidence against you.

434
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,301
But you're the only one that could.

435
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:38,993
She can now.

436
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,630
Can you handle her?

437
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:46,141
You'd better mind, Will. We don't want
no Cains or Abels on our souls.

438
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:49,075
-No Lot's wife either.
-Take it easy.

439
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:51,875
-Nobody has to get hurt.
-Except that marshal.

440
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,347
And l'll take care of him.

441
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:56,214
Last time you tried to take care of things,
you lost a gun.

442
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,652
Leave him to me.
l still got him on the hook for $ 1 0,000.

443
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:01,052
Town hall, remember?

444
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:05,628
lf you know what's good for you, you just
keep putting the spurs to old Robles.

445
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:26,440
Martin...

446
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:32,219
...who is he?

447
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:59,249
He's a wanted criminal.

448
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,749
ls that such a blow to you, Tonia?

449
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,459
He's our friend.

450
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,161
l had to know the truth. l coded
a message to the Attorney General.

451
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:18,098
The government says he's carried on
guerrilla action but l've got his record.

452
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,171
l know who his victims were:
Carpetbaggers, men like Will Marlow.

453
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,998
l should arrest him, but how can l
when l know that if the South had won...

454
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:28,702
...and men had dug
their hobnails into us...

455
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,815
...l'd have been an outcast too.

456
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,853
l wish now l'd never laid eyes on him.

457
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,851
Why do you say that?

458
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:42,288
l'm a fool. l'm trying to arrange
a pardon for him.

459
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,427
-lf l succeed....
-Have you told him?

460
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,756
Oh, no. Nor can you.

461
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,990
Hopes can be brutal, Tonia...

462
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,128
...if they don't materialize.

463
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:42,349
How's things in Dallas?

464
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,549
l saw Señora Walters.

465
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,217
She will do as you say.

466
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,692
And Bryant Marlow?

467
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,833
Like you, he stays out of sight.

468
00:40:57,502 --> 00:40:59,163
Thanks for the loan of your horse.

469
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:14,013
-Where are you going?
-Hunting.

470
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:16,449
-You're not well enough to ride.
-l'm fine.

471
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:20,079
You can't arrest Bryant Marlow alone,
not with that pack he has around him.

472
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,488
Arresting's your idea.

473
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,787
Well, l lose my bet.

474
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:26,190
-What bet?
-With myself.

475
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:29,595
-Once you started serving your country--
-l have no country.

476
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,759
-And you call me ''foreigner.''
-You and all blue-belly.

477
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:35,064
We washed your gray
and hung it out to dry.

478
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,866
Not mine, Yankee.

479
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,272
lf you wanna try, just send
for that Gettysburg brother of yours.

480
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:42,571
He's still at Gettysburg.

481
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:49,310
Well, l guess l'm wearing a good name.
Had one of my own once.

482
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:53,947
Small pumpkins maybe, compared to
the railroading Weatherbys, but it set well.

483
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,622
lt meant ''cotton.''

484
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,360
l been talking in my sleep.

485
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:06,232
Soil around here would grow better cotton
than ever came out of Georgia.

486
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:09,840
-You ought to put a bug in Felipe's ear.
-l've got a bug in my own.

487
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,532
l want to get a railroad headed this way.

488
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:16,213
This is a big country, Reb.
You said so yourself.

489
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:20,644
Cotton, railroads.
Weatherby, Hollister.

490
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,981
Dreams, fried up, short order.

491
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:25,747
Must they be dreams?

492
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:27,686
You know what ''Texas'' means?

493
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,793
lt's an lndian word for ''friend.''

494
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,828
lt's a big land with room for everyone.

495
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,692
You could be a part of it, in time.

496
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:38,358
Time? That's for you two love-doves.

497
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:41,171
The space of a lifetime to be together.

498
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,330
l've got no time.
For me, time's running out.

499
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:57,286
-What's up?
-Señor, she says--

500
00:42:57,455 --> 00:42:59,116
l wanna talk to Marshal Weatherby.

501
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,282
-Well, who are you?
-Mrs. Walters, Mrs. Bill Walters.

502
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:04,560
l'm the marshal. What's wrong?

503
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:08,028
That Bryant Marlow, bullying
and threatening for his brother Will.

504
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,158
He's bringing a bill of sale out tonight,
made for me to sign away Bill's leavings.

505
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,396
-Where?
-At my house, right outside of Dallas.

506
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,406
-Well, l'll go with you.
-Bless you.

507
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,853
-Who was it?
-Señora Walters.

508
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:33,081
Señora Walters? lmpossible.
l just left her in Dallas.

509
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,782
-Then who...?
-l don't know.

510
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,222
Carlos.

511
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:38,862
Carlos...

512
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,156
...call the vaqueros.

513
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:42,356
Find the marshal
and tell him the woman lied.

514
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:44,662
Alberto! Manuel!

515
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,015
Higher.

516
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:05,916
Higher.

517
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:20,431
Nice work, Flo.

518
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,464
Get down off that horse.

519
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,808
Just raring to ride, huh?

520
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,881
Yeah, too much ''giddap''
and not enough ''whoa.''

521
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,812
l knew you weren't Mrs. Walters.

522
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:35,646
Figured l'd gamble on a lead.

523
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,882
Remember how you poured it into Cullen?

524
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:40,614
You're rushing me, but l'll try.

525
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,224
Just take your time.

526
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,124
l never did like to eat
my striped candy too quick.

527
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,664
Scared?

528
00:44:51,936 --> 00:44:54,131
Bumps like an alligator.

529
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,044
You shoot,
and you will draw them in here.

530
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,446
Let them chase an empty saddle.

531
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,569
Slippery as a greased hog, ain't you?

532
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,508
But it ain't gonna gain you nothing.

533
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,774
Pop that gun off, it'll cost you $ 1 0,000.

534
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:42,681
-What are you talking about?
-The town hall.

535
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:45,151
l posted my cashier's check
with the bank.

536
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:49,019
Will gets it when he comes in
with the deed, if l sign the release.

537
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:50,785
Don't you bite on that.

538
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:53,457
No Marshal Weatherby, no 1 0,000.

539
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:55,861
And Will
will just skin you alive.

540
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:58,627
-lf you don't plug him, l will.
-Let him have it, lummox.

541
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:01,033
Oh, shut up. l'm trying to think what--

542
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:03,639
What Will would do
if he was doing the thinking.

543
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:06,834
lt's a good gamble, Bryant.
My life against a wad of money.

544
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:09,803
l'll just ride out of here...

545
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:16,910
...nice and easy...

546
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:20,515
...while you're thinking.

547
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,389
Will will call down
fire and brimstone on you.

548
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:30,230
What would Will do?

549
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:36,338
Well, what am l worrying about Will for?
lt's me he's got the evidence on.

550
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:39,032
l'm worth more than $ 1 0,000 to me!

551
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:48,374
You'd get your pockets picked
in a graveyard.

552
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:50,110
Sap-sucking yahoo.

553
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,840
He won't get far in this brush
on my horse.

554
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,711
Reno. Reno, boy.

555
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:29,853
Reno.

556
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:38,959
Gerry, you and Bill
circle this thicket here.

557
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:42,758
Rest of you, fan out
but don't let him get away.

558
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,899
Reno, boy.

559
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:49,967
Reno.

560
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:59,408
Reno.

561
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:04,410
Hey, fellas, Reno throwed him!
He's afoot!

562
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:06,818
Come on, root him out!

563
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:34,350
Hey.

564
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:41,349
Hey! Help! Get over here!

565
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,083
Think you're smart, don't you?

566
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:48,431
Hey, you fellas, get over here!

567
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:50,663
Hey!

568
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:57,130
Hey, you fellas, get in here.
Come on, cut me down.

569
00:49:57,308 --> 00:50:00,675
-What happened?
-Never mind what happened. Cut me down.

570
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:26,133
Here he comes.

571
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:00,631
Where's Will Marlow now?

572
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:02,669
Matt Coulter's inside doing the honors.

573
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,638
You gotta make Will believe
you're on his side, remember.

574
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,367
Downright perjury.

575
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:09,205
ln case....

576
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,543
Don't ask me to bear witness
against myself.

577
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:18,344
A job like that takes a big-caliber man,
Mr. Marlow.

578
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:19,819
Just call me Will.

579
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,685
Evening, Matt. Evening, Mr. Marlow.

580
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,623
-Evening, judge.
-Oh, just call him Will.

581
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:27,525
l was telling Mr. Marlow about our idea.

582
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:30,132
We got to have a go-getter for mayor.

583
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,790
Oh, indubitably.

584
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:35,200
ln a city such as ours, we'll need lights...

585
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:37,101
...pavements...

586
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:40,338
...indoor water closets.

587
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:43,605
Oh, good evening, marshal.
Pour yourself some spirits.

588
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:46,579
-Good evening, marshal.
-We've been feeling Mr. Marlow out...

589
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,651
-...on running for mayor.
-Marshal won't think l'm a go-getter.

590
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,721
l been working on that deed for you,
but Mrs. Walters here--

591
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,154
Didn't she tell you?
l bought the deed from her.

592
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,520
-Evening, Mrs. Walters.
-Good evening, marshal.

593
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:01,492
l'm afraid Mr. Marlow won't be available
to run for mayor.

594
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:05,262
-Why not?
-l aim to have him behind bars.

595
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:06,664
That's a mighty poor joke.

596
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:09,738
l wouldn't advise making
irresponsible statements, marshal.

597
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:12,842
He's in cahoots with his brother.
One's guilty, so is the other.

598
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,038
Somebody's lying. Anybody says l was
ever tied up with Bryant, l'll sue for libel.

599
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:20,274
Bryant just got through ambushing me.

600
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:23,420
lt ain't possible.
He wouldn't dare to go against....

601
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:27,587
He had a .44 halfway down my gullet.

602
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:30,318
-You drilled him.
-He shot the guns right off me.

603
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,018
l had to talk my way out.

604
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,959
He let you--?

605
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,265
Praise heaven he saw the light.

606
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:40,564
No man wants his brother
to have a killing on his soul.

607
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,197
lnteresting thing is
how l talked my way out.

608
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:46,934
He didn't know l'd bought
the Chuckaway any more than you.

609
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,977
He thought if he killed me,
it'd cost you money.

610
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:53,605
Figured it better to let me walk out
than to have you on his neck.

611
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:56,744
Mr. Marlow, this is hard to believe...

612
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,582
-...that a citizen like you--
-lt's Bryant, that renegade.

613
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:01,053
He's always been against me.

614
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:04,558
Hates my law-abiding principle.
He's trying to put the blight on me.

615
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:07,993
Will's right.
Bryant pulled one on you, marshal.

616
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:10,292
Will's in the clear. Why, you were there.

617
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:13,129
He promised to post a reward
for Bryant's capture.

618
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:15,567
l'd hate to hang by my toes till you do.

619
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:19,300
Well, you know, a man hates
to put the dead mark on his brother.

620
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:21,467
You hear that?
He's making it dead or alive.

621
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:24,580
Now, any man that's big enough for that
is big enough for mayor.

622
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,114
-Yeah!
-Yeah, he's right!

623
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:29,646
You're right, Matt.

624
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,451
You're going to eat crow, marshal.

625
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:37,082
l'm authorizing you
to announce my reward:

626
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:39,759
Two thousand dollars for Bryant Marlow.

627
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:45,764
-Dead or alive.
-l guess l ought to be man enough...

628
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:48,370
...to say l'm wrong, Mr. Marlow.

629
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,302
Thank you, marshal.

630
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:52,806
Thank you, gentlemen, one and all.

631
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:54,739
Good night, Matt.

632
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,910
He's gonna make a good mayor.

633
00:53:58,348 --> 00:54:02,148
l wish it was Saturday night
so l could take a bath.

634
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,084
Hey, Bryant.

635
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:45,744
-What?
-Here's Reno.

636
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,254
Reno, boy.

637
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:51,660
-What's this?
-What?

638
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:53,725
Two thousand dollars?

639
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,297
Oh, no. Will wouldn't do that.

640
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,560
Oh, no. ''Brother Willy wouldn't do that.''

641
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:01,431
Thought it out pretty, didn't he?

642
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:04,039
Marshal will bust his buttons
trying to get you...

643
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:06,675
...and you'll curl them,
and the town will posse up...

644
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:08,572
...and no matter which way
you turn...

645
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:11,509
...they'll be pouring led at you
until they get that reward.

646
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:15,743
And brother Willy will be in the clear,
and have everything going his way.

647
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:19,151
Pete. Pete.

648
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:21,051
Marshal.

649
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,093
Bryant, marshal.

650
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:48,341
He's down behind that little rock
by the cut.

651
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:51,385
Get behind the brush and when l shoot,
let him have it.

652
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:31,290
Now, hold it.

653
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:36,660
That marshal knows where the hideout is
now and he'll be coming back with a posse.

654
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:39,165
You fellas stay covered up
inside them rocks...

655
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:41,964
...and you can pick them all off
as they come.

656
00:57:56,753 --> 00:58:00,314
Oh, Reb. Reb.

657
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:04,690
You've come back. You're safe.

658
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:12,992
-Where's Martin?
-ln town.

659
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,934
He and Luis were out all night
with Father and the vaqueros.

660
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:19,940
-They're still searching for you.
-They shouldn't have left you here alone.

661
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,203
l'm going to Dallas.
l've got to find Martin.

662
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,813
He'll come back here.

663
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:27,006
l-- l can't wait.

664
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,012
Tonight l'll finish up
my business in Texas.

665
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:32,280
l won't be back, Tonia.

666
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:33,820
Won't be back?

667
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,652
l told you, l wouldn't be here long.

668
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:38,856
Yes, l remember.

669
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:41,122
lt's what you wanted.

670
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,098
That was three weeks ago.

671
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:45,467
Nothing's changed.

672
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,139
Everything's changed, Reb.

673
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:53,704
l can't let you go.

674
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:57,142
You're engaged to Martin. He's the one
you're due to marry. What about him?

675
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:00,647
-What about you?
-Forget about me.

676
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,079
l'm a wanted criminal.

677
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:03,811
Yes, l know that.

678
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,455
Martin told you? Why?

679
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:09,785
Was he afraid l'd forget?

680
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,954
You haven't answered my question.

681
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:13,186
What about you?

682
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:15,788
l've answered it. Forget me.

683
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,525
-You don't mean that.
-l do mean it.

684
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:21,170
l have to mean it.

685
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,898
A long time ago,
it might have been different.

686
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:25,939
You wouldn't have been
engaged to Martin.

687
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:30,876
l wouldn't have to be hiding behind his
shirttails. l'd have had a name, a home.

688
00:59:32,449 --> 00:59:34,610
You have this home.

689
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:36,479
l told you that when you first came.

690
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:46,552
Martin, he's safe.

691
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,891
l heard in Dallas.

692
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:54,363
Congratulations, Reb.

693
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,001
Did you see Will Marlow?

694
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:57,366
And Trask.

695
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,737
Every time he tries to ride out to Bryant,
Coulter corners him for a drink.

696
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:06,042
-Popularity is beginning to go to his head.
-Matt Coulter? Friendly with the Marlows?

697
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:08,207
lt's a scheme of Reb's.

698
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,180
Where are you going?

699
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:14,751
He's going to Dallas.

700
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:16,085
l'm going with him.

701
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,393
You're staying here, where you belong.

702
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:29,768
Didn't expect to find you here.

703
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,238
Thought you'd be waiting in Dallas
for Bryant.

704
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:33,774
Bryant will think that too.

705
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,202
Or else he'll expect me to organize
a posse to come after him.

706
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,612
By night, his nerves will get the best of him
and he'll come in to see what l am doing.

707
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:44,583
You stay here too.
l don't want you underfoot.

708
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:48,920
Reb, what are you going to do about her?

709
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:50,889
l came here gunning for Bryant.

710
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:52,653
When that's done, l'll move on.

711
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:55,024
You don't have to move on.

712
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:58,599
l do have to, you know that.
You even told her.

713
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:01,293
You're willing enough to keep it quiet
everywhere else.

714
01:01:01,471 --> 01:01:03,063
What if you weren't a wanted man...

715
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:05,332
...free to go or stay?
What would you do then?

716
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:08,505
l'd sink my roots in Dallas
and take her away from you.

717
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:10,043
Any way l could.

718
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:13,649
Glad you said that. Makes it all right
for me to play that way too.

719
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:16,612
You'd be a fool if you didn't.

720
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,342
-Where's Reb?
-He's gone.

721
01:01:46,516 --> 01:01:49,314
-He wants you to stay here with me.
-l heard him.

722
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:51,681
But you still want to go with him?

723
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:53,717
You wouldn't want me to pretend.

724
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,656
No, l wouldn't want that,
but l don't want you to go either.

725
01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:01,661
-l must--
-Tonia, he has it the way he wants it.

726
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:03,628
What do you mean?

727
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,835
Remember what l said about
the brutality of hope?

728
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:08,470
There's to be no pardon.

729
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:11,072
He's still a wanted man.

730
01:02:57,087 --> 01:02:59,351
Maybe l'm not as smart as l figured.

731
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:02,116
Maybe Bryant's not coming in.

732
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:05,220
Will's not gone to him.

733
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,789
l've been thinking.

734
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:10,423
We ain't the kind to get
quite so popular--

735
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,898
Any fool could see the marshal
had rigged me.

736
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:15,833
Now the town's standing against
my getting word to Bryant.

737
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:18,030
Any moment
he'll come roaring in and....

738
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,544
Haven't they got homes to go to?

739
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:36,284
A month ago, there wouldn't have been
one of them there.

740
01:03:36,459 --> 01:03:38,984
Now you ain't asked them...

741
01:03:39,162 --> 01:03:40,720
...and they're all here...

742
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,957
...expecting that maybe you'll want to send
a posse after Bryant.

743
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:47,734
lf they rode out there,
half of them would never ride back.

744
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:49,201
They know that.

745
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:51,033
They're still willing.

746
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:11,326
You gave us more than
a town hall, marshal.

747
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:13,519
You gave us the grit
to get our town back.

748
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:16,130
We're willing to fight for it again.

749
01:04:16,299 --> 01:04:18,096
Worth fighting for.

750
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:37,951
There's a lot of the history of Dallas
standing over there.

751
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:39,850
One fella settled at Trinity Forks...

752
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:43,652
...when old Johnny Brian
was still chinking at his log house.

753
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:46,693
New settlers from the East and South.

754
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:49,696
They're all just Dallas now.

755
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:53,196
l guess that old Scotsman knew what
he was writing about when he said:

756
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,860
''Breathes there a man
with soul so dead--''

757
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:57,529
l know the rest.

758
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,265
Glad you do, marshal.

759
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:03,776
We'd be pleased if you'd
make this your native land too.

760
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:06,882
You're not talking about me.
You're talking about a tin badge...

761
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,779
...and the Weatherby checkbook.

762
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:12,251
Besides, l'm sitting on a short fuse.

763
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,181
Hear you all got cotton dirt
around here.

764
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,083
Pick your half-section, settler. Come far?

765
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:22,622
Through corn lands and cow lands...

766
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:26,250
...and land oozing filthy grease
that dang-near ruined my wagon.

767
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:31,623
Keep that wagon out of there.

768
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:35,904
Great Caesar's ghost.

769
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:39,768
Betty, drive these down a bit. l--

770
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:52,052
l don't wanna roust you around,
but this smells like gunfighting weather.

771
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:56,214
Roust all you like, colonel,
and if you want a good gun hand again--

772
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:57,654
What are you talking about?

773
01:06:57,827 --> 01:06:59,624
Don't you remember me, sir?

774
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:01,457
Hillis from Macon.

775
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:03,758
l rode with your Georgia regiment.

776
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:07,127
Sergeant in Troop C.

777
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:09,635
l never been in Georgia.

778
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,712
lf that ain't Colonel Reb, this ain't Texas.

779
01:07:21,984 --> 01:07:23,952
What did you say?

780
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:26,717
l could swear that's my old colonel--

781
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:29,619
The name, man, the name.
You said Reb?

782
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,089
l sure did.

783
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,784
Colonel Hollister, sir.

784
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:35,692
Fifth Georgia Cavalry.

785
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:46,874
That settler seemed to know you.

786
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:48,203
Don't go probing, judge.

787
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,938
That short fuse is about to
blow me out of town.

788
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:18,030
How did Will Marlow get away?

789
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:20,266
Will? He's in his office.

790
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:24,607
He just passed me riding south
like the hounds of Hades was on his tail.

791
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:28,308
South? Then he's not going to Bryant.

792
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:34,755
You see a man
come out of that building?

793
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:38,325
l don't know where he come from,
but he lit out like he was turpentine...

794
01:08:38,494 --> 01:08:40,257
...when l said you was Colonel Hollister.

795
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:43,163
You and your big mouth.
You were the turpentine.

796
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:46,768
-l didn't mean--
-Anyway, you've done one thing:

797
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:50,172
You've proved they were all in it
in Georgia.

798
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:53,502
Dogs that ain't kill sheep, don't run.

799
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:58,409
We're gonna catch Will
before he sets a long trail.

800
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:03,176
-l'll be back for Bryant.
-Good luck, Reb.

801
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:15,858
You fellas stay out of this.
Get inside.

802
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:37,012
You ain't gonna talk your way out of it
this time, marshal.

803
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:38,915
You won't either, Bryant.

804
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:39,472
You can't fool me.

805
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:44,182
There ain't only one man in the whole world
can shoot like that.

806
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:46,651
Reb Hollister.

807
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:48,687
Hollister...

808
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:53,389
...get my brother, Will.

809
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:57,327
He set the fire in Georgia.

810
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:08,209
Drag out the sour mash.

811
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,470
We're drinking to old Reb.

812
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:12,739
Good idea!

813
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:34,059
-Warrant?
-Yes, it was his warrant.

814
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:39,531
Reb Hollister. This is impossible.

815
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,973
How could he
have come here as...?

816
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:44,869
Did you know this?

817
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:49,347
Sure l knew.
That's why l put my chips on Dallas.

818
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:09,623
But, judge,
how can you be so vindictive?

819
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:12,927
Yesterday he was your hero,
and today he's an outlaw.

820
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:16,970
And he's still the same man,
a man who's helped all of us.

821
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:19,130
lt's not a matter of being vindictive.

822
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:20,741
lt's a matter of the law.

823
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,969
Only facts have any bearing.

824
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:24,237
Facts?

825
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,813
What if they burned your family home
to the ground...

826
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:29,473
...so what they done
wouldn't show in the ashes?

827
01:13:29,652 --> 01:13:33,110
Reb's father and sister are still missing.

828
01:13:33,723 --> 01:13:35,657
Would you think
the war was over, judge...

829
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:39,420
...just because some fellas
signed some papers over in Virginia?

830
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:43,292
l wouldn't.
Not while the guilty ones was still alive.

831
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:47,266
Reb thought Bryant done it alone,
but he learned different.

832
01:13:47,436 --> 01:13:50,599
The one who put the torch
to the Hollisters' was Will.

833
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:53,833
But he had no right to take the law
into his own hands.

834
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:57,001
Rights? He's been drawn and quartered
by legal rights.

835
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,669
We've all been.

836
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:03,308
l respect the man as much as any of you,
but l respect the law more.

837
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:06,348
Weatherby, you've perpetrated a fraud...

838
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:08,854
...in allowing this criminal
to assume your place.

839
01:14:09,024 --> 01:14:11,117
lt must be reported
to the Attorney General.

840
01:14:11,293 --> 01:14:13,193
-Reb's no criminal.
-No criminal?

841
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:15,557
Here's direct evidence.

842
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,129
This is of later origin.

843
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,692
lt came yesterday.

844
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:25,134
Pardon?

845
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:26,706
On what grounds?

846
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:28,673
Service as a United States Marshal.

847
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:31,813
Have you forgotten he killed Cullen,
stopped the cattle raids...

848
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,141
...and now killed Bryant?

849
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,253
You had this and didn't tell him?

850
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:44,153
l hoped that Bryant would win the fight.

851
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:50,129
You can blame me that he's gone again...

852
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,563
...thinking himself a criminal.

853
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:28,201
Sure appreciate
your interest in this, Mr....

854
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:31,168
-Mr....
-Abernathy.

855
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,106
Be a feather in my cap picking up
a desperado like Reb Hollister.

856
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:40,943
Here he comes.

857
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,881
-That's him.
-Sure?

858
01:15:44,053 --> 01:15:46,248
Don't start arguing.

859
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:58,030
Go on, sheriff, jail him.

860
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,033
Keep him there until they get
a rope around his neck.

861
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:10,142
Hello, high pockets.
How's the--?

862
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:14,507
Been a long time since
we picked up anybody...

863
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:17,117
...who packed a shooting iron
in their boot.

864
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:20,848
Better put them on. Them floors get cold.

865
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:24,186
Never mind my health. Look up
that fella that gave you the word.

866
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,262
His name's not Abernathy. lt's Will Marlow.
He'll be heading back for Dallas.

867
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,693
Take it easy, fella. Judge Tomkins
will see you Monday morning.

868
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:33,232
Tell your tale of woe to him.

869
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:35,063
-Monday morning?
-Monday morning.

870
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:37,933
Well, that's four-- l can't--

871
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:43,875
Make yourself comfortable, boy.

872
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,981
You ain't gonna do nothing
on that chair nohow.

873
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,808
Miguel.

874
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:56,854
Miguel.

875
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:33,088
Wait. You stay here.

876
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,930
Who are you?

877
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:39,693
They're my boys, Felipe.

878
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:43,831
Luis.

879
01:17:48,344 --> 01:17:50,608
Take the men
and get back to your spots.

880
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:54,982
Close the doors and the shutters.

881
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,514
-Vultures.
-Get your cutthroats out.

882
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:03,487
Yelp all you like.
l've been cursed by deadbeats before.

883
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:06,719
You've got no right living like grandees
with my note coming due.

884
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:10,422
-Note's not due yet.
-lt is if l say so.

885
01:18:10,599 --> 01:18:12,191
l'm closing my accounts here.

886
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:14,802
l'm taking my rightful money
with me now.

887
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,699
You've stolen our cattle.

888
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:18,806
We haven't enough left
to raise the money.

889
01:18:18,974 --> 01:18:20,305
Get it.

890
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:22,205
Tonight? Where?

891
01:18:22,378 --> 01:18:23,572
Weatherby.

892
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:25,270
He'll give you the 25,000.

893
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:29,073
-You get nothing!
-Would you--?

894
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,845
But you don't tell Weatherby
why you want it.

895
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:34,922
You do and you'll get your pups
back in gunnysacks.

896
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,318
But what can l say?

897
01:18:36,492 --> 01:18:40,724
You didn't find any trouble thinking up
reasons when you wanted to borrow money.

898
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:44,663
lf l were you, l'd be in a hurry.

899
01:19:00,382 --> 01:19:02,077
l'll pay you.

900
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:04,811
But if you harm them, you'll pay me.

901
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:07,279
-Remember that.
-You remember it.

902
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:14,024
Tell the whole town about what--

903
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:09,781
You fool! Are you crazy?

904
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,214
Quiet!

905
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:23,088
Help! Help!

906
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:26,132
Help! Help!

907
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:32,866
Help!

908
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:44,611
Hey, open this door. Open this door.

909
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:47,846
Fire breaks out.
We'll get you out of the building.

910
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,849
Halt.

911
01:21:10,812 --> 01:21:13,645
On your horses! Hurry up!

912
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:19,216
All right, men.

913
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:04,796
Burt, Curly, pick up that wagon.
Rest of you boys follow me.

914
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:30,551
But, Mr. Robles, there isn't
$25,000 cash in the whole town.

915
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:32,785
-There must be.
-But why do you want it?

916
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:36,260
Don't ask me. Don't ask me anything.

917
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:38,695
And say nothing to those you talk to.

918
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:42,564
lt means more than my life, Martin.

919
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:45,834
You wait here.

920
01:23:08,964 --> 01:23:10,727
-Got it?
-From merchants, the banker...

921
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:12,594
...even Mrs. Walters. lt's all here.

922
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,429
-You told them nothing?
-No, nothing.

923
01:23:16,104 --> 01:23:18,664
-You've got to tell me what it's for.
-l can't tell you.

924
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,865
-Then l'll go with you.
-No, no, you mustn't.

925
01:23:21,043 --> 01:23:23,307
Does Will Marlow
have anything to do with this?

926
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,246
-Has he returned to Dallas?
-No.

927
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:30,385
Don Felipe, is Tonia all right?

928
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,713
l hope so, my boy.

929
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,882
''Hope so''?

930
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:46,762
Oh, Mr. Robles.

931
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:52,768
Keep your eyes peeled for old Robles.

932
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:56,206
lf he's not alone,
tell the men to start shooting.

933
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:12,893
-Where's Will Marlow?
-Thought you were following him.

934
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:15,586
He outfoxed me.
Got me jugged over in Fort Worth.

935
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:17,629
Means he'll double back here.

936
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:19,164
He has doubled back.

937
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:21,131
That's why Felipe
wanted the money.

938
01:24:21,303 --> 01:24:22,292
What money?

939
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,735
Well, he was here.
He made me get him $25,000.

940
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:26,737
He wouldn't say why.

941
01:24:26,908 --> 01:24:30,036
-But he said it wasn't Marlow.
-What have you got under that hat?

942
01:24:30,212 --> 01:24:33,238
Why would anybody keep silent?
Because he's got a gun in his back.

943
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:37,112
-Yes, but Marlow wasn't-- No.
-Marlow wasn't with Felipe?

944
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:41,444
Must mean he's got Tonia and Luis,
holding them as hostages.

945
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:47,094
-New gun, huh?
-Yeah.

946
01:24:52,768 --> 01:24:54,292
l'll go get a posse together.

947
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:57,836
You stay put.
l got a ready-made one coming.

948
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:02,534
-How long ago Felipe leave here?
-Too long. You can't overtake him.

949
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,542
l can try.

950
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,145
Bring them along.

951
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:18,918
Well, your pa will be back
in a minute or two.

952
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:20,425
Be a comfort to you.

953
01:25:20,595 --> 01:25:23,428
Three of you, tied up together.

954
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:27,295
You're making a noose for your neck.
This house will tell its secrets.

955
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:31,803
Ashes don't tell secrets.
Hollister learned that in Georgia.

956
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:42,382
Robles is coming!

957
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:46,654
Robles is coming.

958
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:50,485
Robles is coming.

959
01:25:56,064 --> 01:25:58,089
He's alone.

960
01:26:00,068 --> 01:26:02,366
-lt's all right. He's alone.
-Bring him inside.

961
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:13,806
lt's Hollister!

962
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,941
Here comes Weatherby and a posse!

963
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:56,486
Open up, Will.

964
01:28:17,038 --> 01:28:20,565
Use up your powder, Will,
then l'll kill you.

965
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:28,274
What will you do when
your bullets are gone, Marlow?

966
01:28:29,718 --> 01:28:32,050
You got one left.

967
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:08,787
Didn't figure you for two guns.

968
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:11,323
That leaves five.

969
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:17,531
Fool, wasn't l, Will?

970
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,929
l should've killed you weeks ago.

971
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:22,228
But you were smart.

972
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:24,966
You covered your Georgia trail.

973
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:30,410
All l had was Bryant's scent.

974
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,715
That's three left, Will.

975
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,790
And then l'll kill you.

976
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:46,283
Barehand.

977
01:29:50,165 --> 01:29:53,100
Like l dreamed of killing Bry--

978
01:29:56,404 --> 01:29:59,669
And all the time it was you
that lit the flame.

979
01:30:20,995 --> 01:30:24,021
Keep away from the window, Will.
You make too good a target.

980
01:30:46,054 --> 01:30:49,546
Did you really think the ashes
would cover for you, Will?

981
01:30:52,093 --> 01:30:54,027
That's your last bullet.

982
01:31:07,142 --> 01:31:09,610
Where's Tonia and Luis?

983
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:13,043
l didn't hurt them.
They're upstairs. l didn't hurt--

984
01:31:26,427 --> 01:31:28,486
Get up on your feet.

985
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:35,994
Let me go. You won't regret it.

986
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:38,071
l'll leave Dallas. l'll never come back.

987
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,139
Oh, no.

988
01:31:40,308 --> 01:31:42,606
Oh, no, Will. Never.

989
01:31:42,777 --> 01:31:45,803
You like to see them burn, remember?

990
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:48,073
Now it's your turn.

991
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:50,375
Your neck, Will.

992
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:53,180
Rope burn,
with the whole town looking on.

993
01:31:53,988 --> 01:31:58,152
Burn legal, Will. The way you like it.

994
01:32:04,732 --> 01:32:07,064
Here's a couple more for you, sheriff.

995
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:17,306
Why, Mr. Abernathy,
you've got him again.

996
01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:22,080
You'll like him, sheriff. Here.

997
01:32:28,723 --> 01:32:30,623
-Antonia, Luis. Where are they?
-Upstairs.

998
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:33,522
Will Marlow. He's the wanted one.

999
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:36,653
Antonia. Luis.

1000
01:32:38,566 --> 01:32:40,591
Antonia.

1001
01:32:41,603 --> 01:32:43,434
Tonia.

1002
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:45,072
Reb.

1003
01:32:46,507 --> 01:32:48,236
Oh, Reb.

1004
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:50,274
Oh, Reb.

1005
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:54,576
Well...

1006
01:32:54,749 --> 01:32:57,149
-...you won my bet for me.
-What?

1007
01:32:57,318 --> 01:33:00,754
Tin-badge bet, remember?
You couldn't finish Marlow off, could you?

1008
01:33:00,922 --> 01:33:02,981
You had your chance,
but you couldn't do it.

1009
01:33:03,157 --> 01:33:06,558
That oath you took as marshal
crowded you too much.

1010
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:11,327
Here. Free man.

1011
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:15,299
Sink your roots in Dallas.
Grow your cotton.

1012
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:16,903
Raise your kids.

1013
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:18,663
Martin....

1014
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:21,566
-l hope--
-You don't have to say it.

1015
01:33:21,743 --> 01:33:23,711
l know what your hopes are.

1016
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:25,539
Where are you going?

1017
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:28,841
Well, somebody's got
to tote that cotton.

1018
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:31,247
l got me a railroad to build.

1019
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:39,654
That Yankee foreigner's
talking American.

1020
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:44,658
So are you.
