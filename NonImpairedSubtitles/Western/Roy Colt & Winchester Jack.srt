1
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,310
Here we go again.

2
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:20,083
One day they are going
to hurt each other for reaI.

3
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,232
This time you win.

4
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,756
I won.

5
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,600
That's right, he won.
Now he is your boss.

6
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,132
I'm leaving. This gang,
doesn't make any money.

7
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,702
I'd rather look
for a honest job.

8
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,947
So long, boys!

9
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,966
Now let's see what you do.
Back to schooI, old man.

10
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,900
Don't worry.
Let it go.

11
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,384
SamueI!

12
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,289
Where's the treasure map?

13
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,657
Tell me where it is!

14
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,600
Speak up!
I want my share.

15
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,364
The gold is mine
and I'm keeping it.

16
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:50,531
I paid you well
for what you did.

17
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,336
And now,
get out of the way.

18
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,146
Speak up.

19
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,083
Give me the map
or I'll kill you, old pig.

20
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,348
Why do you treat
an old man this way?

21
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:05,479
We are friends, aren't we?

22
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:08,422
I'll give you a minute to answer.
Where did you hide it?

23
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:13,457
Hey, you. That's no way
to treat an old cripple.

24
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,923
Thank you, my boy.

25
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:48,226
I don't even know him,
and he saved my life.

26
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,926
And the rest of you didn't
even lift a finger!

27
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,332
You're just a bunch of drunks.

28
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:54,336
If I wasn't crippled,

29
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,770
I would have shown him...

30
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:04,279
Let's tell the Reverend that
Samuel has got a hidden treasure.

31
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:07,112
Yes, but who's going to make
him tell where it is?

32
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,141
The Reverend could make
the dumb speak.

33
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,345
Let's go.

34
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,014
To your health, my boy.

35
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:15,354
To your gold.

36
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:22,061
I don't believe
I've seen you before.

37
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:24,032
What's your name, stranger?

38
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,898
My name is Roy Colt.

39
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:29,063
And I'm looking
for an honest job.

40
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:34,271
I have an honest job for you.

41
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,310
"Dear Winchester,
and Jack as well,

42
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,753
since the gang couldn't get
dishonest enough

43
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,813
to make any money,

44
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:50,087
I went looking for an honest job.

45
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,959
Yesterday
I punched out a cowboy.

46
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,792
How sad!

47
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:57,527
I miss our fistfights
very much.

48
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,526
I read about your latest
train robbery in the papers.

49
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,267
I'm sorry you didn't
get anything out of it.

50
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:09,544
Nowadays, there is nothing
to score with the railroad.

51
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,104
Say hello to everybody for me.

52
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:15,276
So long.
Signed, your friend, Roy. "

53
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,618
He's getting to be
pretty funny.

54
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,985
But I wonder what he means,
by "an honest job. "

55
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,124
Hey, Jack!
Someone's coming.

56
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:34,033
Put out the fire.

57
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,511
Let's go.

58
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,737
Hey, what's up with you?
Let us go by.

59
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:18,542
Who is that Indian woman?

60
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,878
None of your business, stranger.

61
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,645
I asked you a question.

62
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,447
We're taking her to the sheriff.

63
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,714
She killed her man.

64
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,882
What do you care?
Are you the dead man's relatives?

65
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,654
No, but we want
the reward.

66
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,298
Turn your horses around
and get going.

67
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:48,373
We'll meet again, stranger.

68
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,682
Aren't you going to thank me?

69
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:07,524
Tell me.

70
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:12,058
Is it true
that you killed your man?

71
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,371
Come on.

72
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,180
Hold this.

73
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,650
Clean up around.

74
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,992
Hey, boys,
what are you looking at?

75
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,792
Come on, start working.
Get going.

76
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,094
And now...

77
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,874
You know what's next,
don't you?

78
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,913
You have to get along,

79
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,051
otherwise I lose face
with those guys.

80
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,754
Yes, I'll do it.

81
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:49,287
But for that,
I know a more comfortable place.

82
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,998
Come on, will you?

83
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,207
You know, this is
a nice little place here.

84
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,742
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

85
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,721
- Is it yours?
- No.

86
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,883
An old lady from the tribe
loaned it to me.

87
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,916
It was kind of her,
don't you think?

88
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:20,987
So, you kind of took advantage.

89
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,328
Can I do the same?

90
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,924
We'll see.

91
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,525
Why not?

92
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:54,058
- Now, take off your clothes.
- Just a minute, you go first.

93
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,758
- Go ahead, don't act so shy.
- All right.

94
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,063
But don't look, okay?

95
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,932
Okay.

96
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,838
Did you really kill a man?

97
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,470
- Don't look!
- Well, he tried to kill me first.

98
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:12,003
I just defended myself.

99
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,245
I don't even know your name.
What is it?

100
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:17,445
Manila.

101
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,613
Can I turn around?

102
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:22,852
Yeah, I'm ready.

103
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,491
Now it's your turn.

104
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,191
Are you out of your mind?

105
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,818
Now, go downstairs.

106
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:01,625
All right, but watch out...
that thing's loaded.

107
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:04,326
I'm... I'm going.
I'm going down.

108
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:08,802
Watch out.
That really puts holes in you.

109
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,965
Be quiet and keep moving.

110
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,474
Who said something?
I didn't say anything.

111
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,806
Get in there.

112
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,475
Where?

113
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,848
Me, in there?

114
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:25,410
Are you insane?

115
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,615
Go on, get in and wash up.

116
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:29,954
Why should I wash up?

117
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,657
No, I'd rather forget
the whole thing.

118
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,191
Certainly not.
Get in the tub!

119
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:43,694
What are you doing?
Taking a bath in your underwear?

120
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:46,299
Take them off, before you get
the water all dirty.

121
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,511
Come on, stop wasting time.

122
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:52,980
You're embarrassed?
I'm not a man.

123
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,015
Stay down!

124
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,077
It's freezing, damn it!

125
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,387
Rub yourself good,
it'll warm you up.

126
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:05,950
Oh, yeah.

127
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,092
Damn! Why did I have
to get with this woman?

128
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:16,036
I'm going to make you pay for this!
You'll see.

129
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,562
- And use the soap.
- Yeah, the soap.

130
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,235
Where's the damn soap?

131
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:23,745
It fell in the water.
Look for it.

132
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:28,515
Soap. Soap.
Where's the damn soap?

133
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,549
Ah, here it is.

134
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,508
Manila.

135
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,349
Manila.

136
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,855
I'm so clean
that it's disgusting.

137
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,755
So much better.

138
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,426
Well, when do we start?

139
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:19,999
We'll start
once we are married.

140
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,229
Married?

141
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,295
You don't want
to get married?

142
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,773
Then, it's... $10.

143
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,799
What? $10?

144
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:40,151
Let's make it $9.

145
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,054
Okay.

146
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,321
I'll make
a speciaI price for you.

147
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:49,490
- Well, get undressed.
- Undress?

148
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:53,194
That's another $2.

149
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,856
There you are.

150
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:21,522
This is the first time I've seen
and Indian girI with a bra.

151
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,258
Why do you wear it?

152
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,529
To get $2 more.

153
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,863
That's all I've left.

154
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,636
You're not a woman,
you're a slot machine.

155
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,814
Do you have a charge
for those too?

156
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:45,115
Well, of course.

157
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,622
But, what do we do now
that you're out of money?

158
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,489
I'll show you what we do now.

159
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,371
It just isn't fair.

160
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,741
He's having a good time with
the Indian girI while we're freezing.

161
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,144
Well, when you'll become
the boss...

162
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,658
- What's that?
- The "tab. "

163
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,192
The tab?

164
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,171
What's it for?

165
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,697
To keep track
of what's owed to me.

166
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,437
Now, I'm erasing everything,

167
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:43,536
and opening up a new account.

168
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,877
Ah, there.

169
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:48,712
If I'm right, you owe me $2.

170
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,116
You give credit?

171
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,710
Well...

172
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,813
since we're at it...

173
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:34,557
If the stagecoach is on time,
it'll be here any minute now.

174
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,188
Who do you want?

175
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,470
You go,
Bellatreccia.

176
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:46,338
Choose four men.

177
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,550
Go!

178
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,366
What's going on, a war?

179
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,469
What does it take
to stop a stagecoach?

180
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,992
I only know one man
who shoots like that.

181
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,647
Hey, Roy, come out.
I recognized you.

182
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,123
Hello, Winchester.

183
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,559
What are you doing in there?

184
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,357
I'm working,
what do you think?

185
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,421
I'm taking some gold
to the bank.

186
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,262
Some gold?
Why don't we divvy it up?

187
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,928
Like old times.

188
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,460
No, it's too little.

189
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:26,201
Besides, I have something
much bigger in mind.

190
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,766
All right,
do as you like.

191
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,142
You killed the driver!

192
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,546
Now I've got to drive too.

193
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:36,949
Well, didn't you want
an honest job?

194
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,112
Yes, but there are limits.

195
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:41,952
After you.

196
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,958
- So long, Colt.
- So long, Winchester.

197
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,791
- So long, Bellatreccia.
- Damn you.

198
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,956
See you later, boys!

199
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:59,807
Who is that?

200
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,968
Someone who'd suit you to a tee.

201
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,773
He's always got money.

202
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,574
So why didn't you rob him?

203
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,744
Because he wouldn't have
given it to me.

204
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:12,014
Hey, Jack!

205
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,988
The Reverend
and all his gang

206
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:16,217
are in Karton City.

207
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,021
The Reverend?

208
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,857
We're all going to Karton City.

209
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:44,577
Hey, blasted cripple!

210
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,815
Get down here!
Let's put an end to this.

211
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,056
Stop it!
Stop shooting!

212
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,862
If you kill him
it'll be a waste of time.

213
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,697
Someone's coming.

214
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,550
- Where's the Reverend?
- In the saloon.

215
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:22,882
Damn!
This is not whiskey!

216
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,619
It's soda pop.

217
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,652
Bring me something good.
Damn it!

218
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:28,993
Calm down, boss.

219
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,761
If I'm not calm, how can I
make good dynamite sticks?

220
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:35,336
Your mother is a slut!

221
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,640
Now, let's try this.

222
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,476
Reverend!

223
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,446
Don't move.

224
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,779
This could give you
a bellyache.

225
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:57,253
Here.
Take these away.

226
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:27,813
Why are you after SamueI?

227
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,484
By the Czar of all Russia!

228
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:33,858
20 gunmen held off
by an old cripple...

229
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,295
it's enough
to eat you inside.

230
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:38,925
So then,
he won't give it to you?

231
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,663
Give what?

232
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:44,035
What business is it of yours?

233
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,905
- Not good?
- Not good. It's disgusting.

234
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,671
Damn you!

235
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,837
I'll send you to Siberia.

236
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,444
I'll get him to talk.

237
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,042
But it will cost you half.

238
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:04,019
Oh, what is it?
What's going on?

239
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,493
Back off, you deviI!

240
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,226
Tell me, SamueI.

241
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,325
Did you like the explosion?

242
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,767
You're a bunch
of spineless cowards.

243
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,499
You're not scaring me.
Go away!

244
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,733
All right.

245
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,868
There are other bombs
placed around your house.

246
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,743
There's also a bomb
at your bank.

247
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,271
In 10 seconds
we light the fuses.

248
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,819
What's my bank
got to do with it?

249
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:34,287
- The bank, what does it matter?
- It matters.

250
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:37,689
Okay.
I'm ready to make a deaI.

251
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,660
Faithless bastards!

252
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:50,466
I'll hold onto this map,
if you don't mind.

253
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:51,972
I've done some good
things myself

254
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,237
- due to the circumstances...
- Allow me, Reverend.

255
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,407
There you are.
That's much better.

256
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,542
That's really
a good show of trust.

257
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,848
Let's go.

258
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:17,224
Today is a very important day.

259
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:19,495
And remember,
if we don't find the gold,

260
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,593
I'll skewer you like a roast.

261
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,263
Go, you wretch!

262
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:25,000
Manila, where are you?

263
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:29,008
Don't touch me.
I don't need your help.

264
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,944
What I don't understand,
Reverend,

265
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:33,038
is what are you going to do
with the gold once you get it.

266
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,072
- Me? I'll take a wife.
- No! Get married?

267
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:38,783
I'm a romantic.

268
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,118
All right, my friend.
Get your horse. Let's go.

269
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:43,624
You hear that?
You should follow his example.

270
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,520
All right, boys,
on your horses.

271
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,204
There you go,

272
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:10,377
deserting the one
who did you good.

273
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,346
I'll stop feeding you.

274
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,488
You're disgusting,
spineless cowards!

275
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:21,553
You abandoned one
of your fellow citizens

276
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,530
to the hands
of that gang of pigs.

277
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,157
You son of bitches!

278
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,827
You chased away
the mayor,

279
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:28,699
because he was
a friend of mine.

280
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,830
And now we are without defense

281
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:32,999
and without leadership.

282
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,241
Mission accomplished.

283
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:42,512
Good, young man.
How did you get through?

284
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:45,349
You'll never guess
what happened.

285
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:46,945
If you'd gotten here sooner...

286
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,183
The bandits
got the map from SamueI.

287
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,987
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

288
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:52,459
They went out of town,
to the north.

289
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:54,985
All right, let me go!
Let me get them.

290
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:58,360
No, my son, don't.

291
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,664
You must not go alone.

292
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:03,398
Hold him back.
Don't let him go.

293
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,566
Listen, you can't go
like this, as a common citizen.

294
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,405
We hereby elect you
our sheriff.

295
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,206
We'll give you the star,

296
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:13,112
and all the able men
in the village.

297
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,675
Citizens, we cannot
allow bandits

298
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:20,586
to run free over our land.

299
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:25,422
I'm going to need
at least 50 men...

300
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,327
50 brave men.

301
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,262
50 men who are
ready to die

302
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,031
in a full battle against
the vicious outlaws in this area.

303
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:39,430
I know I can count
on all of you,

304
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,075
but I want only 50 men.

305
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,706
I know none of you
is fearfuI of dying,

306
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:49,546
because we are fighting
for a just cause.

307
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,715
I'm proud of all of you.

308
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:57,316
But it is my duty
to warn you...

309
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,294
that only few
will make it back.

310
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,598
For that reason,
I will select single men.

311
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,502
I don't want
to transform this town...

312
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,165
into a place
of widows in tears.

313
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:16,404
Excuse my emotion.

314
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:26,011
The Reverend...

315
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:28,648
is a bloody-thirsty animaI.

316
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:34,459
First he tortures his prisoners,
then he blows them up.

317
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:39,733
And those who can
escape the Reverend,

318
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:43,431
won't escape
Jack Winchester.

319
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:47,373
He can kill a man
300 yards away

320
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,377
with only one shot.

321
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,983
Friends,
I know that these things

322
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:58,781
won't frighten

323
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,014
brave men like...

324
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:14,798
You're a gusty boy.

325
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,619
You're not afraid at all,
are you?

326
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,757
Yes. It's the same as
the one I gave to those two.

327
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,986
Only there's something
I didn't tell them.

328
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:41,086
This is the bridge
over Okay Creek.

329
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,530
- I know the area.
- You ride 200 miles to the red rocks.

330
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:47,057
Take Vulture Canyon

331
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,967
to the ocean, right here.

332
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:51,995
When you get to the coast,
the treasure is near.

333
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,065
Follow the coast to the left

334
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,236
back inland towards
the Scorching Sands.

335
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,939
But I warn you,
the thirst will be terrible.

336
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,538
At this point,

337
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,880
you'll go in the direction
of the Indian cemetery.

338
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,444
And you'll find the gold there,
in the place I told you before.

339
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:09,520
You've got to get it back here,

340
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:12,390
and get rid of those two gangs.

341
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:14,918
I have faith in you.

342
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,091
It won't be easy, SamueI.

343
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:21,569
But I know only someone like me
can pull this off.

344
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:25,437
I'll fight them
with everything I've got.

345
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:29,107
With God's help.

346
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:33,979
- I hope so.
- So do I.

347
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:41,384
You will defend that gold
as if it were yours, won't you?

348
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,487
As though it were mine.

349
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,333
Will you stop
shaking like that?

350
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,861
I'm trying to write.
"My darling Conchita,

351
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:00,807
soon I'll be very rich.

352
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,811
Don't worry about your husband,

353
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:11,010
I'll take care of him. "

354
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:15,716
Oh God!
Here we go again.

355
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:19,591
- Will you stop shaking?
- Stop shaking?

356
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,925
I have over 100o fever.
Malaria,

357
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:24,193
the runs, what else,
I don't know.

358
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:26,132
But you write to my Conchita.

359
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,727
- Grub's ready.
- We'll be right there.

360
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,544
Those guys only think about eating
while I'm dying.

361
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:47,043
"We will always...

362
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,921
be together... "

363
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,949
It's the same old act.

364
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:55,953
Good.

365
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:57,988
"And we will always

366
00:30:58,032 --> 00:31:01,126
be very... happy. "

367
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:05,364
Tell her of her
beautifuI features.

368
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,207
"Your...

369
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,303
huge mouth. "

370
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:14,406
BeautifuI.
You should have been a poet.

371
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:17,749
" And your eyes are brown. "

372
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:19,878
Say also she's marvelous

373
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,389
without clothes,
you understand?

374
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:29,019
Oh, I am cold,
like in Siberia.

375
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,956
" And seeing you...

376
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:36,630
looking at you all beautifuI...

377
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:38,639
looking at you

378
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,732
and kissing you.

379
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,504
Perfect!

380
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:44,306
Who can understand women?

381
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:46,313
How could a boor like you

382
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:48,372
find a woman that even reads?

383
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,714
No, she can't read.

384
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:52,879
She's illiterate, like me.

385
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:56,220
The sister at the Mission
reads the letter to her.

386
00:31:56,257 --> 00:31:58,817
You should see,
she's such a nice nun.

387
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:04,129
You are lucky.
You have found a house.

388
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:06,531
A sweet woman.

389
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:09,434
That will teach you to keep
your hands to yourself, you pig!

390
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,098
- You rotten little...
- Stop it.

391
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,250
Stop it!

392
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,724
Stop it!
That's enough.

393
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:38,087
Stop it!
That's enough.

394
00:32:55,383 --> 00:32:58,443
Enough! Enough!

395
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:05,285
My men on one side,

396
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:08,090
the Reverend's on the other.

397
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:09,528
Catch it.

398
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,395
- Throw it! Throw it!
- What?

399
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,127
Throw it, or it'll explode!
It's dynamite.

400
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,431
No, not, in my hand!

401
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:29,678
If there's one thing
I can't stand is a revolution.

402
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,743
Stop it!
That's enough!

403
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:35,945
Enough!

404
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:46,331
I'm sorry, my boy.

405
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,631
Let's go.

406
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:56,802
You go on ahead, eh, Jack?

407
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:59,938
And you'll follow
10 miles behind.

408
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,777
I still have
half of the map, eh?

409
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,317
Go, go.
Take the woman

410
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,022
and make many
little brats together.

411
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,738
Reverend, don't tell me
you're still cold.

412
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,510
I swam across
the Don River

413
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:10,881
with the Czar after me.

414
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,285
Cold to the bone.
So cold.

415
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,814
You talk like this because
you have never been in Russia.

416
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:20,623
Now only dynamite
warms me up.

417
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:24,358
I learned from
a great friend, Rasputin...

418
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,628
Reverend, someone's coming.

419
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,830
I know who it is.
Let them come.

420
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:36,941
Roy, come in.

421
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:39,310
I have recognized you.

422
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,508
Take from behind.

423
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:51,987
Well, Reverend,
I'm coming with you.

424
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,494
I know everything
about the gold.

425
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:56,326
Your map is false.

426
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,497
Stop it! Hold it.

427
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:03,731
Don't shoot him.
He's a friend.

428
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:05,238
He knows all about
the gold, eh?

429
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:08,174
Come in, Roy.
Come into my little home.

430
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,040
Very comfortable.

431
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:16,876
I shake your hand,
you shake mine.

432
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,986
Hey, lend me your ears.

433
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:25,617
What did you say
of the map?

434
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,424
Why did you say
my map is false?

435
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,791
It's false and there are
too many of us.

436
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:37,771
First, we need to get rid of Jack.
I don't want to cut it in three.

437
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:39,568
But Jack is your friend.

438
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:42,269
He was.
Besides, this is business.

439
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,211
I still have a bullet he gave me,
here in my butt.

440
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,840
I don't want to take a risk
now that I'm retiring.

441
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:49,816
Does he still have
that terrible Winchester of his?

442
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,953
No, there's absolutely
no danger.

443
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:56,616
Here's what we have to do.

444
00:36:56,657 --> 00:36:58,716
There is a shortcut.

445
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,785
If what you say is true,
it should be child's play.

446
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:05,060
But I only have
one half of the map.

447
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,398
I'll tell you something.

448
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,700
If I wanted I could arrest you.

449
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:12,899
I'm the new sheriff
of Karton City.

450
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:17,405
I'm the only one
with the reaI map.

451
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,676
I always said you are
one big son of a bitch.

452
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:45,466
Are you mad at me?

453
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:48,168
But then,
when we find that gold...

454
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,439
Gold, it's all about the gold.

455
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:53,970
Ever since you got that map,
that's all you think about.

456
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:57,212
Meanwhile, it's been days since
we've made a mark on the tab.

457
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,357
Tonight?

458
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:06,724
Okay.

459
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:09,787
But as of today
the price is doubled.

460
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,984
If you keep that up,
I'm going to go bankrupt.

461
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,741
Jack...

462
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:35,840
Jack, will you marry me?

463
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:37,578
No, never.

464
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:39,017
Well, all right.

465
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:42,079
So, that's another 10...

466
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,613
20...

467
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:46,717
30... and 40.

468
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:50,153
My tab.

469
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:51,528
Bring it back.

470
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:58,562
Jack.
You have a visitor.

471
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,945
Roy!

472
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:10,644
Son of a gun,
where are you coming from?

473
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,150
What are you doing
in these parts?

474
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:15,678
You have room
for me too?

475
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,715
- In the gang?
- No, in the sleeping bag.

476
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,557
Stay inside.

477
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,359
Greetings from the Reverend.

478
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:27,424
We spoke yesterday,

479
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,596
and we're partners again.
I know all about the treasure.

480
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,128
- You, too?
- Down, girI.

481
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,038
You know about the treasure?

482
00:40:34,074 --> 00:40:36,565
I showed the Reverend
a shortcut,

483
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,443
so that he can beat you.

484
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,845
Thanks a lot, partner.

485
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:43,372
By comparison,
Cain was an angeI.

486
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,715
As usuaI,
you understood nothing.

487
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:49,849
There, there's
a narrow passage.

488
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,222
There...

489
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,420
you could give them
a nice welcome.

490
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:57,727
Should I ambush him?

491
00:40:57,765 --> 00:41:00,359
You're an outlaw,
aren't you?

492
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:02,835
Look, I just want
to know one thing.

493
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,861
Whose side are you on?

494
00:41:04,905 --> 00:41:08,102
Well, on the side
of the law, of course.

495
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:09,439
After all,
I've been appointed sheriff.

496
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:12,844
You know,
sometimes you scare me.

497
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,007
You know...

498
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,781
sometimes I scare myself.

499
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,309
Damn!
We've been betrayed!

500
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,441
We're surrounded.

501
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:35,458
So...

502
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:37,396
what's the score?

503
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,989
11-0 for now.

504
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:42,969
As long as they shoot horses
and not men, it will never end.

505
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:46,933
Why aren't you fighting?

506
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:49,033
What kind of man are you?

507
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,445
Well, I'll show you.

508
00:43:24,845 --> 00:43:26,972
Are you one who pays?

509
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,710
I've been paying all my life.

510
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,082
But never for love.

511
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:38,984
I'll be damned.

512
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,153
Everything all right, Jack?

513
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,164
Well? Where's the reverend?

514
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:50,193
He got away
with some of his men.

515
00:43:50,237 --> 00:43:53,570
We are going to have problems,
you'll see.

516
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,527
You need Roy Colt,
but he doesn't need you.

517
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:17,723
- Don't be stupid.
- You'll see.

518
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:21,132
As soon as we get there,
he'll take both gold and woman.

519
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:26,938
Why don't you talk?

520
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,439
Jack won't let you?

521
00:44:34,281 --> 00:44:37,079
If I were you, I wouldn't
waste time with that idiot.

522
00:44:39,353 --> 00:44:41,878
You need a reaI man.

523
00:44:41,922 --> 00:44:43,787
A man...
a man like me.

524
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,658
Reverend!

525
00:44:54,702 --> 00:44:56,932
They're almost here.

526
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,598
- Please go back.
- They're coming.

527
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,131
- Boss, don't you understand?
- Just wait!

528
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:04,838
- Wait for what?
- One minute.

529
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:07,005
Either you're freezing
to death or you're...

530
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:08,742
Go! Go! Go!

531
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,838
But you don't pay.

532
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:37,040
I can't pay.

533
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:40,338
It wouldn't be right.

534
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,041
I love you.

535
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:44,209
Oh, then you'll marry me.

536
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:05,732
Four.

537
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:07,638
One by one,
they'll be all dead.

538
00:46:23,357 --> 00:46:24,915
- Let's go.
- Wait.

539
00:46:26,794 --> 00:46:28,762
But they need our help.

540
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:30,821
No, they'll take of themselves.

541
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:34,062
Where's Roy?
I want to kill that guy.

542
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:36,160
That one you don't touch.
He knows the way.

543
00:46:36,203 --> 00:46:38,364
When we get to the gold,
he will get his share.

544
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:40,965
- His share?
- Of bullet, imbecile!

545
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,474
Retreat!

546
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,253
It was a really good idea you had.

547
00:46:58,292 --> 00:47:00,123
That rotten bastard
will kill us one by one,

548
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,151
if we can't get out of here.

549
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:04,596
So what?
There'll be less to share with.

550
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:08,123
Then why
don't you kill me too?

551
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:10,762
Kill you?
That's not such a bad idea.

552
00:47:10,804 --> 00:47:12,772
It's crossed my mind.

553
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:13,932
Stop!

554
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:19,546
Don't move.

555
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,185
- No.
- Bastard.

556
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:29,553
Stay still.

557
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,271
The Reverend is getting
to be too dangerous.

558
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:48,069
We'll never get rid of him.

559
00:47:48,108 --> 00:47:50,633
We need to do something.

560
00:47:51,879 --> 00:47:53,506
We'll head south.

561
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:55,947
It's the long way around.

562
00:47:55,983 --> 00:47:58,884
That's right. The Reverend will
expect us to take the shortcut,

563
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,046
but we'll be on the longer route.

564
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:04,057
And we'll go through Wimpy City.

565
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,615
Wimpy City...

566
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,294
Wimpy City!

567
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,239
Come on, speed it up.

568
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:22,504
The customers want to have fun.

569
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:24,908
Hi! How are you?

570
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:27,971
Come on, dance.
Everybody have a good time.

571
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:35,688
Leave that alone.
Pay up first.

572
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:38,020
Mammola,
these two have not paid.

573
00:48:39,326 --> 00:48:41,453
Mammola, how am I supposed
to deaI with them?

574
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:44,692
All right, ladies, we're here!

575
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:47,131
Ah! Mammola, sweetheart!

576
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,328
Hi, boys, it's nice to see you.

577
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:51,269
No, no, come on now.
Stop it.

578
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,671
Move out of the way,
we're going to dance.

579
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:56,733
- Hey, beautifuI!
- Boys...

580
00:48:56,777 --> 00:48:59,371
Treat those girls
like ladies.

581
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:02,905
Come here.
You know the house rules.

582
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,513
You are always the most
beautifuI flower

583
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:08,350
in the garden
of this house, Mammola.

584
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:15,019
If you don't behave
I will throw you out. Understood?

585
00:49:15,062 --> 00:49:18,395
- Drink some.
- No, I don't want to drink.

586
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:20,491
And now,
let's have those guns.

587
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:23,435
This is a respectable house
and they're not allowed.

588
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:25,833
And you, too.

589
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:28,568
Go on, take it off
and hand it over.

590
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:30,303
There, keep them.

591
00:49:31,712 --> 00:49:33,236
Look, he's a sheriff.

592
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,271
Yeah, it makes me laugh
just to think about it.

593
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:37,806
- Yeah, me too.
- You damn well ought to.

594
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:40,183
Oh, how beautifuI.

595
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,553
Someone has made money!
Spurs of silver...

596
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,558
I know them
when I see them.

597
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:47,583
Now, first some money

598
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:49,254
and then some fun.

599
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:51,992
I thought Mammola loved me.

600
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,966
Well, all right, Mammola.

601
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,333
Let me see,
let's see where I put the money.

602
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,133
Here you are, see?

603
00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:00,139
Here you are.

604
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,107
I'm not selfish, you know.

605
00:50:02,142 --> 00:50:05,009
It is Lincoln's portrait
that gets me excited.

606
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,410
Is that so?

607
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:10,041
No, no no. Give that back,
you mean...

608
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,550
Bad boys.

609
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:13,280
Are these
all of your girls?

610
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:17,550
I have two Irish girls.

611
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:19,786
- Two Irish girls?
- Irish? My goodness.

612
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:21,851
But they are too delicate
for the likes of you.

613
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,795
- Where are they?
- In there.

614
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,230
Boys, now remember,

615
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:28,496
be good and wait your turn.

616
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:30,332
This is a respectable place, eh?

617
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,496
Yes, of course.

618
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:33,768
- See you afterwards.
- Yes, later on, Mammola.

619
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,604
Have a nice time!

620
00:50:35,642 --> 00:50:37,405
I can't stand it another second.

621
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,221
That guy's never coming out!

622
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:54,318
Oh, good.

623
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:56,352
- So can we go inside?
- He paid.

624
00:50:56,396 --> 00:50:57,693
I've been here two hours.

625
00:50:57,731 --> 00:51:00,791
He has paid
and he is full of energy.

626
00:51:00,834 --> 00:51:03,928
- This isn't fair.
- He got in two hours ago.

627
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,598
When are we going
to get in?

628
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,540
- Tomorrow morning?
- Just a minute.

629
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:10,975
He's a sheriff.
He has the badge.

630
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:13,912
- I'm the sheriff.
- I don't give a damn.

631
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,107
No offense meant,
of course.

632
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:18,049
Well, no offense,
you don't care. Jack, come on.

633
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:20,246
Hey, stop that.

634
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,517
Stop.
He has the right to stay there.

635
00:51:22,556 --> 00:51:26,253
$2 each 15 minutes
he can stay there as much as he wants.

636
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:28,727
Stop!
I said stop!

637
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,008
First like this,
and then like this.

638
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:56,181
Is another 15 minutes up, pimp?

639
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:58,953
I'll pay more for the girls.

640
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:05,288
The dirty old man.

641
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:07,266
You two again?

642
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,427
Ambush in the warehouse!

643
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:11,596
I can't believe this!

644
00:52:11,638 --> 00:52:13,970
I paid for two Irish girls,

645
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:15,907
not for you two!

646
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,671
- Boida!
- Yes, boss?

647
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:24,616
- Kill them!
- With pleasure!

648
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:27,643
One, two, three...

649
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,951
Charge!

650
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,618
Can't you do right?

651
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:35,150
Take that.
I'll break your heads!

652
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:41,390
Charge again!

653
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:47,230
And here it comes...

654
00:52:51,244 --> 00:52:54,270
BeautifuI!
It's going down and up!

655
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,040
Did you like the trick?

656
00:52:58,084 --> 00:53:00,575
You wouldn't... You wouldn't!

657
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,986
One, two, three...

658
00:53:10,096 --> 00:53:12,894
What a bad day.

659
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,797
What the hell is going on here?

660
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:18,497
Even in the Great Russia,
this would have never happened to me.

661
00:53:18,538 --> 00:53:22,167
I paid!
I wanted women not cow-boys.

662
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,336
Let me go!

663
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:33,611
No, not in underwear!

664
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:35,621
This is scandalous!

665
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:37,623
This is a respectable
establishment.

666
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:39,352
Get that man.

667
00:53:41,828 --> 00:53:45,355
- Would you like a rose?
- I don't want roses!

668
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:47,491
Out!

669
00:53:47,534 --> 00:53:49,695
All of you! Out!
It's an order!

670
00:53:52,305 --> 00:53:54,034
They have never
seen a woman!

671
00:53:54,074 --> 00:53:55,701
Take this.

672
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,211
I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

673
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:13,121
Why are you ruining my party?

674
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,423
I'm going to stuff your hat
down your throat.

675
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:17,327
That's what I'm going to do.

676
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:18,626
Hey, hey.

677
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:20,360
Let me through,
get out of my way!

678
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,563
Stop it!
No!

679
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:25,628
No, not the picture,

680
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:27,503
not the picture.

681
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:33,706
Hermaphrodite.

682
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:35,681
Turn around, gorgeous.

683
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:40,478
A transvestite.

684
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,954
You've ruined everything!

685
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,650
No!

686
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:47,251
Stop it!
Stop it! Let me through!

687
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:49,728
I'm coming.

688
00:54:49,763 --> 00:54:51,663
What do you want?

689
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,689
You ugly, I hate you!

690
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:56,065
I can't stand you.

691
00:54:57,771 --> 00:55:00,331
Ladies, here I come!

692
00:55:00,373 --> 00:55:02,534
All for you!

693
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:05,476
- Go away, Reverend.
- What is this? BetrayaI!

694
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,350
All right,
where are they?

695
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:17,117
Stand aside, let me through!
You pigs!

696
00:55:17,157 --> 00:55:18,852
You, go away.

697
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:22,726
- Mammola!
- I'll show all of you!

698
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:41,144
After you.

699
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,720
Fools rush in,

700
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:54,454
but this Russian is no fooI.

701
00:55:54,494 --> 00:55:56,962
Back to old Siberia,

702
00:55:56,996 --> 00:56:00,796
where it is better for this boy.

703
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:04,031
Let me through!

704
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:17,516
So this is where you went.

705
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,110
So this was the secret
of last night.

706
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:23,515
You two bastards!

707
00:56:23,556 --> 00:56:25,547
Spending your money
on these women

708
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,321
instead of saving it for me.
Disgusting.

709
00:57:20,213 --> 00:57:22,340
I've been waiting.

710
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:26,216
Is it true
what you told me yesterday?

711
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,920
What was that?

712
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:35,723
That you love me.

713
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:38,731
More than my horse.

714
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,668
Jack told me that
you have a lot of money.

715
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:51,744
If I don't kill you,
will you marry me?

716
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,803
Hey!

717
00:58:17,837 --> 00:58:19,930
Don't you know
that's Jack's woman?

718
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:21,702
- And so?
- And so you don't touch her.

719
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:24,039
I always hated you,
Roy Colt.

720
00:58:24,077 --> 00:58:26,375
It is my time now.

721
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:28,642
Don't move!

722
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:31,172
Commend your souI
to the deviI,

723
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,707
I'm going to shoot you.

724
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,014
Bellatreccia!

725
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:18,997
Fire! Fire the cannon!

726
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,991
That will teach you!

727
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:28,439
What's this,
a dynamite factory?

728
00:59:46,726 --> 00:59:48,751
Get down!

729
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:50,353
- Are you wounded?
- No.

730
00:59:50,396 --> 00:59:52,864
- How many are left?
- Just us.

731
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:55,825
Give me your gun.

732
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,938
Go to the horses.

733
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,203
Oh, my hat.

734
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:06,336
I'll cover you.
Get going.

735
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,943
Retreat! Retreat!

736
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:16,455
Restroom break!

737
01:01:02,669 --> 01:01:04,933
Take off your holster, now.

738
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:07,932
What do you mean?
Are you crazy?

739
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:09,498
What are you doing?

740
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:12,477
With the other hand.

741
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:21,677
Satisfied, boss?

742
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:25,651
Now, get going.

743
01:01:25,692 --> 01:01:27,421
You can't
send him away unarmed.

744
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,927
The Reverend is nearby.

745
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:32,624
In that case,
we'd hear the shots.

746
01:01:42,842 --> 01:01:45,140
So long.

747
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,113
So long.

748
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:58,084
And let the vultures get you
and the Reverend.

749
01:02:00,993 --> 01:02:04,087
I always knew you were
a damn bastard,

750
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,827
but I never thought
you'd end up like this...

751
01:02:09,202 --> 01:02:10,464
for a woman.

752
01:02:10,503 --> 01:02:13,939
You, go with him.

753
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:18,433
She won't come.

754
01:02:18,478 --> 01:02:21,470
You've got the rifle...
you're the strongest.

755
01:02:34,494 --> 01:02:36,018
Here.

756
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:34,504
- Stop it, Roy!
- Put the gun down!

757
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,160
So?

758
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:25,322
Whom are you going with?

759
01:05:29,502 --> 01:05:32,335
With the strongest,
of course.

760
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,333
I think the shots
came from there.

761
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,535
Let's go, Morella,
let's go.

762
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:51,881
Stop!

763
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,677
Three less men.
I'm delighted.

764
01:06:13,713 --> 01:06:15,305
Let's make sure.

765
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:17,043
Calm down, calm down.

766
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,381
You always want to shoot.

767
01:06:19,418 --> 01:06:21,943
I need to think.

768
01:06:21,988 --> 01:06:24,422
You see,
the noise distracts me.

769
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:26,049
Good, Morella, good.

770
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:49,365
Freezing...
the desert.

771
01:09:11,023 --> 01:09:12,422
Son of a bitch.

772
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,985
Son of a tramp.
Son of a slut.

773
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:18,155
Don't move, traitor.

774
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,859
Now I'll show you.

775
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,801
You're going to tell me
where you're hiding the map!

776
01:09:23,836 --> 01:09:25,997
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you!

777
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,370
Is that clear?

778
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:29,806
You deceiver.

779
01:09:29,842 --> 01:09:32,936
One minute, wait.
I'm going to hurt you.

780
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:35,344
- Leave him alone.
- Stop it, woman!

781
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:36,973
Let me work.
I want him to talk.

782
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:41,611
Want more?
Now, tell me where the map is.

783
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:43,952
I ate it.

784
01:09:43,989 --> 01:09:46,287
You ate it?

785
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:48,259
You ate it?

786
01:09:48,294 --> 01:09:49,818
I'll give you a laxative
and you'll shit that map.

787
01:09:49,862 --> 01:09:51,056
I already did.

788
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:54,895
- Where?
- In the desert.

789
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:58,870
Then, I'm going to kill you!
Damn you!

790
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:01,805
- Reverend, no. Stop it!
- Get away from me, woman.

791
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,274
He knows how to find the gold
even without the map.

792
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:31,834
Walk, walk, a nice morning walk

793
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:34,202
is good for your health.

794
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,231
Walk!

795
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:39,142
Stop.

796
01:10:39,178 --> 01:10:41,408
Don't you see,
she can't go on?

797
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:43,278
If you don't put her
on a horse...

798
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:45,715
I won't show you
where the gold is.

799
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:47,776
Never, not even if you kill me.

800
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,152
Courtiers of the Czar

801
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:53,249
are always very kind

802
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,317
towards women.

803
01:10:55,361 --> 01:10:57,556
Little lady.

804
01:11:14,046 --> 01:11:17,607
You know, you're
a beautifuI man up close.

805
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,584
You don't say.

806
01:11:22,521 --> 01:11:24,989
With a wonderfuI,
rugged masculine perfume.

807
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:27,185
You don't say.

808
01:11:27,226 --> 01:11:29,558
Where will be camping tonight?

809
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:32,029
I am not saying.

810
01:11:32,064 --> 01:11:34,999
You like women, don't you?

811
01:11:35,034 --> 01:11:37,298
If it hadn't been for women,

812
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:40,134
I would have been
Pope of all of Russia.

813
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:44,674
20 years in the seminary,
I'm very devoted.

814
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:47,178
And devoted to women,
of course.

815
01:11:47,212 --> 01:11:49,077
That means you like me,
doesn't it?

816
01:11:49,114 --> 01:11:52,049
Very much.

817
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:55,144
Then, you'd marry me?

818
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:56,711
In Russia,

819
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:59,155
we always marry first, then...

820
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:01,216
Down to the end,
then we have to turn left.

821
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,161
I hope for your sake
it's true.

822
01:12:04,196 --> 01:12:06,164
If you don't bring me my gold,

823
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:09,565
I'll smash that pretty face of yours.

824
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:12,536
You must not lie
to a man of the cloth.

825
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:14,300
I'll kill...

826
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,103
What is this?

827
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:18,666
This wooden banana
around your neck?

828
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:20,440
I too am very devout.

829
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,912
This is my totem.

830
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:24,415
Each scratch is a prayer.

831
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,418
I see.

832
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:29,353
You pray a lot,
very devout.

833
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:28,441
I'm not giving you
the treasure.

834
01:13:36,822 --> 01:13:40,223
I drink, but for you,
I'll only wet your pants.

835
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:41,692
Hey, what are you doing
wasting the water?

836
01:13:41,727 --> 01:13:43,126
For us,
there's always water,

837
01:13:43,162 --> 01:13:45,027
but none for this traitor.

838
01:13:45,063 --> 01:13:47,429
Now, come with me,

839
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:49,491
woman called Horse.

840
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:51,628
Come with your master.

841
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:55,096
Walk, good. Come on.

842
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,974
Walk slowly, like this.

843
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:02,310
With delicacy.
Here you go.

844
01:14:02,347 --> 01:14:04,907
Now relax.

845
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,577
If you're good,

846
01:14:06,618 --> 01:14:09,416
I give you a sip of water.

847
01:14:09,455 --> 01:14:11,389
Here you go.
Just a sip...

848
01:14:11,423 --> 01:14:13,653
Just a little sip.
Just a little.

849
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:16,320
There. Enough!

850
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:18,625
Too much water
is not good for you.

851
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:21,599
Too much water
is bad at night.

852
01:14:25,704 --> 01:14:29,071
Now we sleep
like sweethearts.

853
01:14:29,107 --> 01:14:32,304
There. Good.

854
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:51,592
Enough of this touching.
Sleep.

855
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:01,599
What is it, Manila?

856
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,252
You're finding
any excuse to kiss me.

857
01:16:38,637 --> 01:16:40,605
Damn!

858
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,800
It's raining! It's raining!
Everybody take cover!

859
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:44,775
Oh, accursed woman.

860
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,869
You betrayed me!

861
01:16:46,912 --> 01:16:48,675
Come here.

862
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:51,376
I gave you everything, water...

863
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,011
and this is the way
you treat me.

864
01:16:57,189 --> 01:17:00,716
When the sun shines
in the left eye of the skull

865
01:17:00,759 --> 01:17:02,852
with the gold colored band,

866
01:17:02,894 --> 01:17:05,454
wait untiI it is exactly 2:00.

867
01:17:06,598 --> 01:17:08,395
If your watch isn't right,

868
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:10,196
we could end up many yards off.

869
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:11,566
Don't you worry!

870
01:17:11,603 --> 01:17:14,003
I stole this watch
from the astronomicaI observatory

871
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:16,633
- In Peters... burg.
- So much the better.

872
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:19,906
I don't want to be blamed

873
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:21,936
if you dig in the wrong place.

874
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,710
Now, turn the skull

875
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,945
60o to the right.

876
01:17:31,857 --> 01:17:33,256
10 and five...

877
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:35,452
10 and seven...

878
01:17:35,494 --> 01:17:37,826
10... 10...

879
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:39,922
10... 15...

880
01:17:39,965 --> 01:17:42,399
20...

881
01:17:42,434 --> 01:17:44,197
Mama, it is Death!

882
01:17:44,236 --> 01:17:45,726
It's only me.

883
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:47,136
Boida!

884
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:49,197
It's always you.

885
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:51,801
- Everywhere I turn. Shit!
- Reverend!

886
01:17:51,843 --> 01:17:54,311
If you're finished
playing games, I'll continue.

887
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:56,541
Excuse me. Just a few words
among the dead, you understand?

888
01:17:56,581 --> 01:17:57,912
Have you got the stick?

889
01:17:57,949 --> 01:18:00,076
Yes, I've the stick, see?

890
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:02,916
Good, stick it through
the left eye in the skull.

891
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:05,218
Wait, one moment.

892
01:18:05,257 --> 01:18:06,815
Don't you move,
bad woman,

893
01:18:06,858 --> 01:18:09,918
the dead are watching you.

894
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,898
Now measure six lengths
with your hand, after the skull.

895
01:18:23,942 --> 01:18:27,708
One... two...

896
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:30,681
three... four...

897
01:18:30,716 --> 01:18:33,184
Boida, get out of the way.

898
01:18:35,187 --> 01:18:37,417
- The place is here!
- Dig.

899
01:18:37,456 --> 01:18:39,651
Dig! One moment.
One moment.

900
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:41,420
I'll break the ground.

901
01:19:07,219 --> 01:19:10,120
Reverend, there's
nothing down here.

902
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:12,453
If there is no gold,

903
01:19:12,491 --> 01:19:14,186
I'll put out your eyes.

904
01:19:14,226 --> 01:19:15,853
Do I look like a traitor?

905
01:19:15,894 --> 01:19:18,692
Do you think it's funny
for me to sit here,

906
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:20,857
and watch you guys work?

907
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:23,333
I hope you're telling the truth.

908
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:30,173
Reverend!
There's something here!

909
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,675
There's something here!

910
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:34,144
It's gold!

911
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:36,204
Throw it up here!
Throw it to me!

912
01:19:36,248 --> 01:19:38,739
- Gold, Reverend!
- My gold!

913
01:19:38,784 --> 01:19:40,684
My gold!
Throw it! Throw it!

914
01:19:50,695 --> 01:19:52,720
Ah, the smell of gold!

915
01:19:56,034 --> 01:19:58,127
Gold.

916
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,933
My gold.

917
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:02,940
Come on boys,
load up the wagon.

918
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:07,607
We're done here, Reverend.

919
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:12,116
Well,
do we get moving or not?

920
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,313
Let's go Reverend!

921
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:18,553
Come here, Boida!

922
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,524
My gold fell down
in the hole.

923
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:23,392
I have lost a thousand
down there.

924
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:26,420
I'm ruined! Poor Reverend.
Go down there.

925
01:20:26,464 --> 01:20:29,627
Good. Get the gold
for the Reverend.

926
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:31,226
Here, catch.

927
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,335
You give me the gold,

928
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,535
and I'll give you a push, like this.

929
01:20:37,576 --> 01:20:40,704
Say hello do Boida.

930
01:20:40,745 --> 01:20:43,373
- Reverend, what the hell are you doing?
- I pull up the rope...

931
01:20:43,415 --> 01:20:45,212
Reverend!

932
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,979
We're all friends!
Reverend!

933
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:48,576
...and I throw you a stick.

934
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:00,224
Everyone's dead, but you!

935
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:01,755
And now it's your turn.

936
01:21:02,801 --> 01:21:05,099
No, just a minute.
Woman, woman, where are you?

937
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:06,694
Take shelter now.

938
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,104
Now I'll create the biggest
explosion in history!

939
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,234
Look out! It's going off.
It's the end of the world!

940
01:21:15,046 --> 01:21:16,980
I thought we were partners!

941
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:19,279
Not anymore.
The association is dissolved.

942
01:21:19,317 --> 01:21:22,980
I'm breaking it up
with this dynamite stick.

943
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:25,182
If you come across Boida,

944
01:21:25,223 --> 01:21:27,020
give him my regards.

945
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:29,288
And now, count one...

946
01:21:29,327 --> 01:21:31,386
and count two...

947
01:21:33,665 --> 01:21:35,132
Oh, no.
BetrayaI!

948
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,827
Who is shooting my gold?

949
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:40,304
My gold. You beautifuI thing.
I'll pick you up.

950
01:21:40,338 --> 01:21:41,828
My gold is spilled,
all mixed up with the dirt.

951
01:21:41,873 --> 01:21:43,636
Damned you.
Traitors!

952
01:21:43,675 --> 01:21:45,939
Traitors.

953
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:16,574
In hell you will be
as warm as you want.

954
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:20,375
Amen.

955
01:22:23,181 --> 01:22:25,308
We meet again.

956
01:22:29,888 --> 01:22:32,789
Now what do you think
of your old friend Jack, huh?

957
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,758
If I hadn't gotten here in time,

958
01:22:34,793 --> 01:22:37,523
the Reverend would've
blown you to a million pieces.

959
01:22:37,562 --> 01:22:39,792
I'm not sure.

960
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:42,857
Come to think of it,
you should thank me.

961
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:44,232
Why?

962
01:22:44,269 --> 01:22:45,896
The gang has been destroyed,

963
01:22:45,937 --> 01:22:49,771
the wagon is loaded with gold,

964
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:52,402
and it's just standing there.

965
01:22:52,444 --> 01:22:56,005
I know the Reverend was going
to kill me with the dynamite,

966
01:22:56,047 --> 01:22:58,675
but I figured to give it back to him.

967
01:22:58,717 --> 01:23:00,844
How could you do that?

968
01:23:00,885 --> 01:23:02,614
You're all tied up like a salami.

969
01:23:02,654 --> 01:23:04,918
With my hands, that's how!

970
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:08,517
You think the spurs
are only good on horses?

971
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,654
Hey!
You found my hat!

972
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:13,994
Thanks.

973
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:15,693
Oh, no.

974
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:18,202
Not the hat.
The hat, no.

975
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:21,569
The gold we'll split,
but I found the hat and I'm keeping it.

976
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,408
Hat thief.

977
01:23:26,444 --> 01:23:28,878
Give it back, right away.

978
01:23:30,348 --> 01:23:32,782
- Did you call me, "hat thief?"
- Yes.

979
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:45,621
It's mine!

980
01:23:45,663 --> 01:23:48,655
No, mine!

981
01:24:10,855 --> 01:24:12,516
Enough!

982
01:24:12,557 --> 01:24:15,185
Stop. Stay where you are
or I'll kill you.

983
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:20,660
Stop, I said.

984
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,463
Did you think an Indian wouldn't
know how to feign ignorance?

985
01:24:25,503 --> 01:24:28,438
This gold is mine.
You know how hard I worked for it.

986
01:24:31,743 --> 01:24:33,438
Take this,
as a souvenir.

987
01:24:33,478 --> 01:24:36,675
You can use it
when you are lonely.

988
01:24:48,593 --> 01:24:50,493
Here, you can keep it.

989
01:24:53,765 --> 01:24:55,562
No, I'll take the hat.

990
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,295
If it hadn't been
for that Indian of yours...

991
01:24:57,335 --> 01:24:59,963
My Indian?
That was your Indian!

992
01:25:01,506 --> 01:25:02,939
Your Indian!

993
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:07,804
Your Indian!

994
01:25:15,186 --> 01:25:17,984
She was yours!

995
01:25:18,985 --> 01:25:21,985
