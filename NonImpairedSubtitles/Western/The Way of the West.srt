00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,260
WHATEVER IT IS,
THE ANSWER IS NO.

175
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:02,400
SOUTH AND WEST OF HERE
ON THE STEWART RIVER

176
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,990

181
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,472

00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,063
ABOUT RANK

185
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,958

-( body thuds )
-( woman gasps,

189
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,180
...I'’VE DONE MY TIME

190
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,601
AND I DIDN'’T DESERT
MY SERVICE.

191
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,998
THAT WHAT THEY GAVE YOU
WHEN THEY LET YOU OUT?

192
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,370
STEELE'’S GIFT TO HIS MEN
FOR A JOB WELL DONE?

193
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,044
ANYMORE THAN I WOULDA.

194
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:07,641
AND I DIDN'’T DESERVE
NO PUNISHMENT.

195
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:11,645
THEM CREE SLAUGHTERED
THOSE FOLKS.

196
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:24,158
WOULD'’VE MADE AMENDS
FOR KILLING THOSE SAVAGES?

197
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,919
I DESERVE ONE
FOR KILLING THEM CREE.

198
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,809
EVEN THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN?

199
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,984
WHAT ABOUT THE SETTLERS'’
WOMEN AND CHILDREN?

200
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,026
I OWE YOU NOTHING.

201
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,447
AND I OWE
THE SERVICE NOTHING.

202
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,176
THEN I'’LL DO IT ALONE.

203
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,601
BEST BE ON YOUR
GODDAMN WAY.

204

COME WITH ME.

210
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,449
TELL ME WHO DID THIS.

211
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,904
I DID.

212
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,546
BUT WE'’RE
THEIR PROPERTY.

213
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,969
THEY DROVE US
FROM OUR HOMES.

214
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,974
THEY KILLED
MY MOTHER...

215
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,229
AND LEFT ME ALIVE.

216
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,018
MY FATHER SAID IT WAS
BECAUSE I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

217
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,857
WE WERE BROUGHT IN SHIP.

OLAF SAID HE WOULD
NOT ALLOW COSSACK BABY,

222
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:29,429
AND THREW IT
IN THE SEA.

223
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:36,637
NO MAN WOULD HAVE ME.

224
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:45,362
OLAF WANTED ME
TO LAY WITH YOU.

225
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,702
I TOLD HIM YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE ME FOR MY SCARS.

226
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:01,211
I SEE NO SCARS.
