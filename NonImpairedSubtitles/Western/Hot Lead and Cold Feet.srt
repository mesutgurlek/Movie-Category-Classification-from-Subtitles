I guess you'll be out there
a long time.

155
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,779
Just long enough
to claim my inheritance,

156
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,442
and then we'll be back.

157
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,282
You mean
we're going with you?

158
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:58,051
Brother Demetrius says
it might help your education.

159
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,056
Yahoo!

160
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,424
Out with the cowboys and
the guns and the shoot-outs!

161
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,191
No, Brother Marcus,
not in my father's town, no.

162
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,292
Remember, whosoever seeks
peace and love shall find it.

163
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,736
If you have more dreaming to do,
do it with your eyes shut.

164
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,366
We've got a long journey
tomorrow. God bless.

165
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,432
- God bless.
- God bless.

166
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,053
ALL: 1, 2!

167
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,789
Whoo-hoo!

168
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,835
You have a go at me now, Sam.

169
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,735
Oh, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.

170
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:48,973
Hold it!

171
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,136
Easy, Billy.
We know you're grievin'.

172
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,670
- We ain't lookin' for trouble.
- Well, you found it.

173
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,807
Next time,
it won't be your hardware.

174
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,749
It'll be your head.

175
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,346
Aw, quit shakin', Doc!

176
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,119
You made me miss.

177
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,127
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,187
Set 'em up again, Red Dog.

179
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,028
What's up, Ragsdale?

180
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,227
I'd like a little privacy.

181
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,327
You, come inside.

182
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:28,778
Wonder what he's gonna do when
he finds out he's got a brother.

183
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,908
Don't worry about a brother
that ain't gonna show up.

184
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,111
How's that?

185
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:37,054
Boys, you got a job to do.

186
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,259
[Cows mooing]

187
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,091
ROXANNE: Marcus, look.
Something's coming.

188
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,427
MARCUS: Yeah.
It's a stagecoach.

189
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,023
The kind that gets held up.

190
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,090
I hope not.

191
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,726
Don't worry.

192
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,398
That's why the armory
is riding shotgun.

193
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,409
Eli, the stagecoach is here!

194

[Whistling]

195
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,046
Yah! Yah! Go on!

196
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:05,983
Get goin', now!
Yah! Yah! Hah!

197
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,815
Come on, now!

198
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,489
Whoa!

00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,650
Hey, you, there.
Shake a leg.

200
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,785
We ain't got all day, you...

201
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:22,259
You can take as long
as you want, Billy.

202
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,532
Just say the word,
and you got all day.

203
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,697
I beg your pardon?

204
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:29,207
You ain't gonna get
a quarrel outta us.

205
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,903
See?
He dropped his gun.

206
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,372
Does this stagecoach
go to Bloodshy, please?

207
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,349
You bet your sweet life
it does.

208
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,283
Anyplace you say.

209
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,583
Bloodshy, Carson City,
Timbuktu.

210
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,488
You name it,
and that's where we're goin'.

211
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:47,458
We got nothin' but time.

212
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,325
There ain't no passengers
to bother ya.

213
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,456
I'd be obliged if you could
store that for me, please.

214
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,625
Okay.

215
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,464
Thank you.
And that one.

216
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,231
I'll be back in a jiffy.

217
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:00,363
You just take your time.

218
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,337
Wild Billy's talkin'
peculiar, ain't he?

219
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,343
Probably liquored up
from grievin'.

220
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:07,743
Should we make a run for it?

221
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,406
I don't know.

222
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,973
He probably got 'em hid
under that coat.

223
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:18,018
Right, driver.
We're all in now.

Yah! Yah!
Come on, now!

People sure seem polite
around here.

They even call you
by your first name.

Even if it's the wrong one.

231

I've noticed.
‘Billy.’

232
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,437

outta the way!

Sure.

243

But first we got
a little business.

- You want him?
- Good luck.

Yeah.

we might need this.

took us by surprise.

Guess this one's on us.

257
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,811
We come all the way out here
and find out it's you.

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,610
I don't know who you are
or who you think I am.

259
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:54,141
But I do know
you shouldn't point that.

260
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,246
It's liable to go off
and hurt somebody.

261
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,020

- Run for it!
- Out of my way!

Why, he's crazy!
Let's get outta here!

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,642
Wow!

That was awful!

Did I tell ya?

Our first day in the West,
and we've already been held up.

270
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,619
We better take
this thing with us.

271
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,353
We don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

272
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,429
I'm so tired,
I can hardly walk.

273
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,197
Don't worry. When we go through
the Badlands, you'll be running.

274
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,034
We don't run, we walk.
Head high, Brother Marcus.

275
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,507
By holding good thoughts and
relying on the power within us,

276
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,100
our burden shall be lifted.

277
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:55,204
Do you remember that prophet
of old, Elijah?

278
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,374
A man of righteousness
and goodness.

279
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,281
He was sent
to his final victory,

280
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,912
his eternal destination,
in a fiery chariot.

281

Are you all right?

285
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,992
Yes. These critters seem
to have a mind of their own.

286
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,935
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

287
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,064
We were just walking along.

288
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,371
Are you gonna stand there
babbling or help me?

289
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:26,809
We'll help.
Give the lady a hand.

290
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,616
The fiery chariot.

291
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,583
I imagine
you could use a lift.

292
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,483
Thank you.
Where are you going?

293
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,488
As far as Bloodshy.

294
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,148
So are we.

295
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,953
First the fiery chariot,

296
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,460
and now she's taking us
to Bloodshy.

297
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,725
See? You don't have to run
if you listen to Brother Eli.

298
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,856
There.

Marcus.

303
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,337
No, I'm a schoolteacher.

304
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,376
How do you do?
I'm Eli Bloodshy.

305
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,501
We're missionaries.

306

That's Roxanne,
and this is Marcus.

307
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,113
- Bloodshy, huh?
- It was my father's town.

308
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,345
He passed away, but I'm going
to collect my inheritance.

309
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,445
Now, am I just gonna
stand here or get that lift?

310
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,471
‘Put me down,’ I said!
Put me down!

311
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,924
Oh, Mansbridge.

312
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,254
Field, sir.

313
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,258

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,225
I don't like this.

478
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,826
How come there's two of me?

479
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,566
I said, ‘How come
there's two of me?’

480
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,336
Hold it, Billy.
There ain't two of you.

481
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:27,640
There's one of each.
Brothers, spittin' images.

482
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,442
Brothers?

483
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,847
Oh, isn't that marvelous?

484
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,942
I'm overjoyed.

485
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,385
Well, I don't need
no spittin' image!

486
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:37,888
Hold it, Billy!
Hold it!

487
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,015
Now, we got us
a brand-new will.

488
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,027
Now, it mentions the fact
that you got a brother,

489
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:46,622
but it don't say nothin'
about him bein' a twin.

490
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,532
Well, I don't need no brother,
nor no spittin' twin!

491
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,832
Like it or not,
want it or not,

492
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,237
need it or not,
you got him!

493
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,639
Just whose side are you on,
Mayor?

494
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,233
Oh, Mayor Ragsdale?

495
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,609
- Uh, yes.
- Eli Bloodshy, sir.

496
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,046
I've got a letter
asking me to look you up

497
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,777
regarding my inheritance.

498
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,945
Your inheritance?
Now, not so fast.

499
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:11,854
Now, how do we know
he's a real Bloodshy?

500
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,290
You talk funny,
like a foreigner.

501
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,384
Well, I've got
my birth certificate.

502
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,726
I've got my license to
drive a cart in Philadelphia.

503
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,235
And I'm expecting my preaching
permit any day now.

504
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:27,272
Oh, Lordy, it ain't bad enough
I got me a brother.

505
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,806
He's a tambourine whacker!

506
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:31,399
[Laughter]

507
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,738
Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:34,540
Well, Eli.

509
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:35,545
Eli, sir.

510
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:36,774
Yes, Eli.

511
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,477
Yes, we do have an inheritance,

512
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:44,181
but there's
a little contest involved.

513
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,883
What kind of a contest?

514
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,255
Between the two of you.

515
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:49,817
It's spelled out
right in here.

516
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,328
Yes, in detail.

517
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:53,489
Uh, yes.
There it is.

518
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:55,294
‘Winner take all.’

519
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,062
Between him and me?

520
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:58,227
Ha!

521
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:00,271
[Laughter]

522
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,932
What does it consist of?

523
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,100
Oh, just a little race.

524
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,576
[Laughing] Nothin' to be
worried about.

525
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,976
You come on now, Eli.

526
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,742
Let me show you the town
that your daddy built.

527
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,841
I'll see you later, Billy.

528
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:14,852
A little race, huh?

529
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,718
On the Bloody Bloodshy Trail.

530
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,552
Well, if'n I was you boys,

531
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,423
I'd get a few bets
down in the big city.

532
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:25,657
That a way, whilst I'm cleanin'
up on the psalm singer,

533
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,858
you boys
can be cleanin' out Reno!

534
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,401
- Yooooo-hooooo!
- [Gunshots]

535
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,664
That's the Bloodshy
Savings Bank.

536
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,971
Hasn't been open
since the last robbery.

537
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,511
There's not much money
in this town, parson.

538
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,047
I thought my father
had considerable wealth.

539
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,743
Yes. It's all safe
and sound in my vault there.

540
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,751
Don't you worry
about a thing, son.

541
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,049
The lunchroom's shot, too?

542
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:53,922
People around here seem to get
what they need in the saloon.

543
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,888
So I see.

544
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,987
It's the West, you see, son?

545
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,724
It's the wild, wild West.

546
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,393
Hold it.
He's here.

547
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,399
Who?

548
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,834
He is.
Rattlesnake.

549
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,737
But don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.

550
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,468
I got the edge on him.

551
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,169
You do?
Why?

552
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,939
Because he's here,

553
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:16,310
and he knows I know
he's here.

554
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,976
But he doesn't know I know
he knows I know he's here,

555
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,485
but I know.

556
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:24,317
So I got the edge.

557
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:29,691
Let's leave this
up to the sheriff, son.

558
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:40,530
You're here.
I know you're here.

559
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:42,300
Yeah, I'm here, all right.

560
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,275
My sister says
you insulted her.

561
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:48,677
No man insults my sister
and stays alive.

562
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,147
Insulted her?
I asked her to marry me.

563
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,184
So, she was right.

564
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,776
Get ready to slap leather.

565
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,685
Then get ready
to bite the dust.

566
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,314
[Laughing]

567
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,224
You're fast, Denver,
but not that fast.

568
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,194
Nobody's that fast.

569
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:07,754
I didn't get to be the sheriff
of Bloodshy for being slow.

570
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,030
Draw and I'll tattoo
your name all over that sheet.

571
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,566
You draw and there'll be
another badge on Boot Hill.

572
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,973
We'll see about that.

573
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:22,138
At the count of three.

574
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,319
[Chuckling]

575
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,097
1.

576
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,332
2.

577
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,349
Aah! Oh!

578
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,146
[Chuckling]

579
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,778
Whahh!

580
00:29:02,854 --> 00:29:04,788
Uh, uh!

581
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,847
It seems what
hasn't been burnt down

582
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,119
has been boarded up.

583
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,717
I hope the church survived.

584
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:12,787
No. The church burned down
about six months ago.

585
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,388
The church as well?

586
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,525
Perhaps I can speak
to your minister.

587
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,037
Well, yeah. You probably passed
him on the way into town.

588
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,096
All we passed
was a little cemetery.

589
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:26,110
That great big gray tombstone?
That was him.

590
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,339
You beginning
to get the picture, boy?

591
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,177
It's the classic picture
of a town on its knees.

592
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,080
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.

593
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,018
Even if you do win that race,
look around you here.

594
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,147
- What have you got?
- What have I got?

595
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,454
I've got the most marvelous
opportunity a man could have.

596
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:45,519
Thank you for the most
inspiring walk of my life.

597
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,497
What?

598
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,794
Jenny?

599
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,664
In here.

600
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,898
Jenny, fate took us by the hand
when it led us out here.

601
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,805
Everywhere you turn,
there's a golden opportunity.

602
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,103
What are you doing?

603
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,269
Packing.
It goes along with leaving.

604
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,006
Which is what
I'm going to do.

605
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,241
But there's a real job
to be done here.

606
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,615
What job? The school
burnt down six months ago.

607
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,745
All the more reason
we're needed.

608
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:11,345
To start a fire department?

609
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:14,085
To build a new church,
to build a new school,

610
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,218
to lift this town
to its feet, Jenny.

611
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,728
I believe that destiny
has spoken to us.

612
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,789
Did destiny tell you where
the money was coming from?

613
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,097
- My inheritance.
- What about the race?

614
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,467
The race?
You've heard about that?

615
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:29,166
It's all over town.
The kids told me.

616
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,607
Considering the life
my brother's leading,

617
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,769
I'll be taking
unfair advantage.

618
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:37,440
You don't think you stand
a chance to win, do you?

619
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,848
When you're a missionary
in Philadelphia,

620
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,749
you get to be fast on your feet.

621
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,219
How are you in the water?

622
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,519
When was the last time
you shot the rapids?

623
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:49,788
And how about the six-up team?
Have you driven one?

624
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,728
- I've never driven one.
- Then there's the mountain.

625
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,265
Have you ever climbed
straight up 2,000 feet

626
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,200
with razor-sharp rocks
and death at every turn?

627
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,898
Is that what you think
this race is all about?

628
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:01,996
That's it exactly.

629
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:05,236
Half of the people are betting
you won't come out alive.

630
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,402
That's ridiculous.

631
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:10,209
You've been listening to
rumors and a couple of kids.

632
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,750
Mayor Ragsdale assures me
it's nothing more

633
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,217
than a plain, simple,
ordinary race.

634
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,414
You don't believe him,
do you?

635
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,014
Of course. He's a fine,
upstanding gentleman.

that race,

- Yes.

get yourself a crowd.

at the good side of people.

at their good side,

You'd like to have a father,
wouldn't you?

799
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,774
More than anything else
in the whole world.

800
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,251
Well, maybe I'll bring
some soup down later on.

801
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,886
Come on.

802
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,929
No! I tell you,
there is hope!

803
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,729
As Solomon
told ancient Israel,

804
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,270
the house of the wicked
shall be overthrown,

805
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:30,136
but the tabernacle
of the upright shall flourish.

806
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,609
A real battler?
You nincompoop!

807
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,772
My son's a psalm singer!
Yoooo!

808
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,281
Mr. Bloodshy.

809
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,840
You better get out
while the gettin's good.

810
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:43,682
The last feller who came here
talkin' tabernacles

811
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,086
went out feet first.

812
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:47,056
- You remember that.
- Yeah.

813
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,650
But running away
has never been the solution,

814
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,719
not when there are kind,
decent, peaceful people here

815
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:56,426
who want to live in a community
where there's love and goodness.

816
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,664
Looks like his brother
and talks like his mother.

817
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,569
That poor milksop
stands as much chance out here

818
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:05,474
as a snowflake
in the Sahara.

819
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,977
What about my father?
Rest his soul.

820
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,910
He practically
built this town.

821
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,380
Practically?!

822
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:15,351
I cleared timber,
drove nails, dug ditches!

823
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:18,946
What am I telling you for?
You English sissy!

824
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:22,015
But then he just sat around,
let it all turn sour,

825
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:23,924
let it fall
into the wrong hands.

826
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,429
Now it's a town of gamblin',
gunfightin',

827
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,158
hard drinkin',
and fast women.

828
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,291
Sounds pretty good to me.

829
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,892
[Chuckling]

830
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,960
But if a town changed
for the worse,

831
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,938
it could change for the better.

832
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,238
All it needs is faith,
courage, and conviction.

833
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,005
I'm ready to stay right here

834
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,945
and help you fight
to get this town back again.

835
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,473
Well, I guess he does have
a smidgen of spunk after all,

836
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,315
for a prune picker.

837
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,911
- Mr. Bloodshy!
- Yeah? Ooh.

838
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,888
I'm afraid
you won't be here long.

839
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,289
You ain't gonna finish
that race.

840
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,291
You know why?

841
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,988
Because there isn't
going to be any silly race.

842
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,428
What's he mean, no race?

843
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:05,231
If’n he cancels my race,
I'll cancel him!

844
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:08,431
I'm going across the street now
and talk to my brother.

845
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,100
We'll split this inheritance
and use the money

846
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:14,474
to make this a town
worth living in.

847
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,479
Behind those guns of his,

848
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,742
there's a fine,
decent human being.

[Laughter]

850
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,587
Mr. Bloodshy, do you really
believe all that?

851
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,679
I certainly do.
Yes.

852
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:28,350
Well, you're as crazy
as a coot.

853
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:31,657
He's as crazy as two coots.

854
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:34,721
Marcus will spread the word.

855
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:37,962
The whole town will be out there
with love and kindness

856
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,127
in their hearts.

857

may I suggest...

[Gunshot]

872
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,828
Brother Billy, may I suggest
we put aside this contest

873
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,427
and join our hands together

874
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,439
for the benefit
of the community?

875

You know what I mean?

876
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,402
Yeah.
You're a-feared to race me.

877
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:55,911
Certainly not,
but I think it's silly

878
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,505
for two grown men
to compete with each other.

879

Now, if'n you don't run
in that race tomorrow,

you're nothin' more
than I thought you was.

Well, it seems to me
that if there is to be a winner,

1449
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,065
he should have been here
a long time ago, hmm?

it has occurred to me,

to each and every one of you,

goes to...

to share the money
