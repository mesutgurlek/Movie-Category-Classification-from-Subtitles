1
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,957
Whoa!

2
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,330
Mush!

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,170
Now beat it!

4
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,673
All right, I'll leave, if
that's the way you feel about it.

5
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,743
But I'll leave like a gentleman.

6
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,148
Quiet, everybody! Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention, please!

7
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,159
You're about to take your last look at
Mr. Thornton's handsome, smiling face.

8
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,593
So make the most of it, you weasels!

9
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,293
But, as a last insane gesture...

10
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,394
Mr. Thornton wants you all to step up
to the bar and have a drink with him!

11
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,405
Quiet!

12
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,533
Are you ready? Let's go!
To the bar, everybody!

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,578
There you are!

14
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,398
Hiya, Tex.

15
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,668
Hiya, dude. The boys're
telling me you're going home.

16
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,675
Yep. Catching tomorrow's boat.

17
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,245
Well, there's no use in wishing
you luck. I guess you've had plenty.

18
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,678
Give me Michigan Avenue
on a hot afternoon...

19
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,977
and you can have all the yellow
dust this side of Seattle.

20
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,746
I guess we all feel the same way, kid.

21
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:11,152
It seems that all the homesick
guys in the world came up here.

22
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,159
- Put this away for me. It's wearing me down.
- Sure thing.

23
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,724
- Ah, they been kinda running
against you. - Yeah- Oh, thanks.

24
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,731
Give us a couple more stacks. Here's where
I'm apt to earn my fare back to Seattle.

25
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,801
There you are.

26
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,210
Did I say Seattle?

27
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,213
<i>You'd better quit while you still have
the price of a pick and shovel, dude.</i>

28
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,216
What's the matter? You want your grave
dug? Give us some action! I'm buying!

29
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,123
Well, the hot seat went cold, eh?

30
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,126
<i>Better luck next time, dude.</i>

31
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,026
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
Well, so long, fellas.

32
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,099
- So long.
- So long, dude.

33
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,344
Russ, my stomach wants
to know how my credit is.

34
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,348
Well, if your stomach's as good as
your credit, you'll live to be 100.

35
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,351
Thanks. Did I ever tell you about
my grandpa? Died when he was 106.

36
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,353
- What interrupted his youth?
- He quit drinking.

37
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,356
So they cleaned you out, eh?

38
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,791
- That's tough.
- Ah, there's a lot more where that came from.

39
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:13,373
What's the matter, Mr. Thornton? Ain't you
speakin' to your pals since you got rich?

40
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,879
Well, hello, Shorty! How are ya?

41
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,881
- Have a stimulant.
- Thanks.

42
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,178
- When'd you get out?
- This afternoon.

43
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,818
These bastilles up here ain't as cozy as
them stirs down in little ol' New York.

44
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,826
The finest jailhouse I ever seen
was the Coney Island precinct.

45
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,159
- They sent you up for opening the mails, didn't they?
- Shh! Shh!

46
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,459
That was a miscarriage of justice.

47
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,967
Listen-Ah!

48
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:40,971
All I did on that mail route was peek
in a couple of those bill o' dues.

49
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:43,473
It gets darned lonesome
on the trail there.

50
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,511
I was as innocent-like as if I was
sittin' in the New York Public Library.

51
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,012
Letters are supposed to
be private, even up here.

52
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,016
Well, if I wasn't honest trying to
seal it up, I wouldn't have got caught.

53
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,679
- That's too bad.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

54
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,189
- That letter I opened was very interesting.
- Yeah?

55
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,624
Yeah. If you'd have saved a bit of your
bankroll, I'd have cut you in on somethin'.

56
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:05,925
- Oh. More mail?
- Yes and no.

57
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:09,489
That letter I opened was
worth about a million bucks.

58
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,763
Thanks very much for the snort-ola.

59
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,274
Ah! See ya around sometime.

60
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,464
Hey, Shorty! Shorty! Wait a minute.

61
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,132
Let me hear a little more
about that pipe dream of yours.

62
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,228
Pipe dream is right.

63
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,240
I been dreamin' about this for six
months up in that cold Arctic can.

64
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,243
- Yeah? What do you need
a bankroll for? - Well, I-

65
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,246
Hey, youse guys! Get outta here!

66
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,578
23 skiddoo!

67
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,914
Boo!

68
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,080
I need a bankroll to grubstake
us as far as Dawson City...

69
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,090
and then a long way beyond that.

70
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,092
- Yeah? That sounds interesting.
- You know somethin'?

71
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,594
When they caught me
opening those letters...

72
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,096
and the judge presented
me with six months-

73
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
or, as the English jockeys
say, a dozen fortnights-

74
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,102
well, that judge asked me a lot of silly
questions, like how many letters I'd jimmied...

75
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,105
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

76
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,108
- But there's one question he didn't ask me.
- Yeah?

77
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,111
<i>He didn't ask me what
was in that letter.</i>

78
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,114
- Say, is your credit still good in there?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

79
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,411
- Come on. Let's go and exhaust it.
- Okay.

80
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,976
His name was Blake. Martin Blake.

81
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,489
He had red whiskers and,
well, he was a little blind.

82
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,787
Oh, yeah, I remember. He was cracked.

83
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,794
- Told everybody he'd found a rich lode.
- That's the guy.

84
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:49,129
Well, he got sick on the trail. He was
coming to Dawson City to file his claim.

85
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,932
He wrote a letter to his son,
John Blake, in San Francisco.

86
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,939
He had a note on the envelope
- said if anything happened to him...

87
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,941
the letter should be mailed.

88
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,604
Well, his number was up,
so the letter was mailed.

89
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,842
And you looked inside to be sure
everything was neat and in order.

90
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,248
Mmm. But there wasn't
much of a letter.

91
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,253
It was mostly a map.

92
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,255
You made a copy?

93
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,259
As I'm coming to the backstretch with a pencil,
I feel the long arm of John Law on my shoulder.

94
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,761
- Did they take the copy away from you?
- No.

95
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,763
- Then you still have it?
- No again.

96
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,765
Well, what'd you do with it?

97
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,927
I et it.

98
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,438
When that map started to digest
though, see, it sorta went to my head.

99
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,440
Went to my brain.

100
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,942
So, while I'm sitting up
there in the booby hatch...

101
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,878
I made a copy of it from memory.

102
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,949
Take off my boot.

103
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,454
Well, I'll show you. I
got a good memory too.

104
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:48,219
Course, there's a couple of things
here I don't quite figure out.

105
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,319
Now, you see...

106
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,161
I don't know if this is
a mountain or a river.

107
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,861
And I think they said
there was rapids here.

108
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,871
But I don't see how that could be,
because I don't remember no river up there.

109
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,806
Hey, listen, little man, the graveyards
up here is full of gold hopheads...

110
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:06,309
guys that smoked a pipeful of hope...

111
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,848
had glittering yellow dreams and ended
up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground.

112
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,281
Me, I'll take bourbon.

113
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,784
Kills you slower, but a
lot more pleasant-like.

114
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,515
Now, wait a minute, Mr. Thornton.

115
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,614
Something mighty
strange happened today.

116
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,625
- Something mighty strange.
- Yeah?

117
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,127
Sit down.

118
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm standin' out in front
of the Palace Hotel, see.

119
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:31,866
Not doin' nothin', because, well, you know,
a fella just out of the can and broke...

120
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,065
just lookin' and standin' is
about the limit of your activities.

121
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,608
- Yeah.
- Well, it was a good idea, see.

122
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,611
- 'Cause things started happenin'.
- Yeah?

123
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:45,616
Out of this hotel comes the most beautiful
skirt that you ever put your peepers on.

124
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,118
And following her is a
dignified-lookin' guy-

125
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,121
I'd say 46 autumns.

126
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:56,024
And him and her get in the sled and
they go off, headed for Dawson City.

127
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,722
- Thanks for the society note.
- Yeah, but wait.

128
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,289
I get excited, see, I run into the
hotel and take a look at the ledger.

129
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,302
You know the names of these
two interesting people?

130
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,670
Mr. and Mrs. John
Blake of San Francisco.

131
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,675
Old man Blake's son?

132
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,678
I hope, in my subtle way,
I've made myself clear.

133
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,680
You have.

134
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,548
Look, if I get the money for
an outfit, how do we split?

135
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,552
Even-steven.

136
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,554
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.

137
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,556
Listen, they got a day's lead on us.

138
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,559
- It's only a gamble.
- That's what I like about it.

139
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,630
Hot-

140
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,704
What's the matter with this fido?

141
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,706
Sorry, Jack, but that one's taken.

142
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,208
Belongs to a team I sold yesterday.

143
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,746
I'll tell you what. I got a big fella
I'll give you for practically nothin'.

144
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,815
Fifty bucks!

145
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,486
What's the matter with him?

146
00:10:56,588 --> 00:11:00,149
- He ain't broke yet, and I don't think he's gonna be.
- Oh. Tough, huh?

147
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,556
St. Bernard. He's all animal, Joe.

148
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,998
- He's on a hunger strike.
- Won't eat anything?

149
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,662
Nothin' but your hand or
your foot, or points north.

150
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:16,298
- He looks like he was stolen
from some joint in the States.

151
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,070
I never ask a dog no questions.

152
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,670
<i>- Blue ribbons don't mean
nothin' to a pooch up here.</i>

153
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,926
- How'd you like to see me make this guy eat?
- All right by me.

154
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,929
- I ain't got nothin' to do all winter.
- Get some grub.

155
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,990
- Frank, dinner for one!
- Unharness Little Boy Blue. Put him right there.

156
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,907
- Dinner for one.
- Okay. Let him out.

157
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,371
- I hope you know what you're doin'.
- I hope so too!

158
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,110
All right, let go of him.

159
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,123
All right, pull your dog out!

160
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,970
Don't let your dog get this piece.

161
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,484
He'll eat regular from now on.

162
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:37,578
I wish I had time to break
him. He'd make a great dog.

163
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,658
- All right, Frank, put him back.
- I'll do it. Here.

164
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:48,895
<i>Which one of you is Mr. Groggins?</i>

165
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,897
<i>Well, speak up. Is Mr. Groggins here?</i>

166
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,906
My name is Smith.

167
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,034
Are the outfit and provisions
ready that were ordered in my name?

168
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:06,440
Well, why don't you answer me,
Groggins? You speak English, don't you?

169
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,545
Uh, y-yes, sir. H-
Here's your whole outfit.

170
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,417
- Tenderfoot, huh?
- Not as tender as he looks.

171
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,428
If I'm not too inquisitive,
will six dogs be enough?

172
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,499
- They'll pull the load, all right.
- With me on it?

173
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,568
Well, I don't know about that.

174
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,628
You don't look like a man who knows
much about anything, Mr. Groggins.

175
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,640
<i>Well, I do know...</i>

176
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:34,007
that people come up here don't
usually make a buggy ride out of it.

177
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,707
They walk or run with the
dogs, sometimes break trail.

178
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,775
You sure will need more dogs
if you're gonna ride that sled.

179
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,787
And more dog food.

180
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,789
And a needle and thread.

181
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,257
What for, my intelligent friend?

182
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,661
To sew up the guys that's gonna
split their sides laughin' at ya!

183
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:57,223
Once in a while people do laugh at me.

184
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,664
But very briefly.

185
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,438
Well, sir, dogs! Dogs!

186
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,104
Uh, bring Flip and Frowsy.

187
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:12,343
Say, Joe, why don't you show the
honorable Mr. Smith this beautiful animal?

188
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,820
I don't think so. He's too savage.

189
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,483
Is that so? Well, just let him out.

190
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,823
- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith.
- Let him out, I said.

191
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,523
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.

192
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,930
I don't like to take the
responsibility, Mr. Smith.

193
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,434
That's why you'll
never amount to much.

194
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,436
What are you asking for him?

195
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,438
Uh, 250 bucks.

196
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,338
Sold. Let him out.

197
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,709
So your name's Buck, eh?

198
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,845
You're tough, huh?

199
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:57,818
Hey, wait a minute. That
dog cost me a lot of money.

200
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:00,830
- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins.
- Wait a minute.

201
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,763
That dog belongs to me.

202
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:07,771
I bought him, Smith, and I
don't allow my dogs to be shot.

203
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,774
That is, of course,
unless I shoot them myself.

204
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,538
That's all right. I'll give
you twice what you paid for him.

205
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:15,875
He's not for sale.

206
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,345
Just as you say, my good man.

207
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,716
Just as you say.

208
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,056
Well, what others have you?

209
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,058
- Uh, here. Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.

210
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,358
I ordered a collapsible bathtub
from Seattle. Did it get here?

211
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,765
<i>It's a bathtub.!</i>

212
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,732
<i>It's a bathtub.!</i>

213
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,107
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.

214
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,176
Easy with ye.

215
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:49,173
Come on. Out.

216
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,079
Come on. Come on. Come on, Harmon.

217
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,418
Here ya are, Mr. Smith.

218
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,421
We thought it was
something to pile wood in.

219
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:01,856
The only bath a person gets up
here is by the sweat of the brow.

220
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,520
How interesting. Mush!

221
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,993
Been a great pleasure, gentlemen.

222
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,071
A great pleasure!

223
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,740
Nice guys.

224
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,743
Well, I don't like to
see a dog killed either.

225
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,746
But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks.

226
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,749
All right, I told you
I'm buying him, and I am.

227
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,752
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
- Quiet, quiet.

228
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,822
Whose money is this?

229
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,820
Listen, you, you're my
dog, and I'm your boss.

230
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:43,264
The sooner you learn that, the easier
it's going to be for both of us.

231
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,521
<i>Come on.! Mush.! Mush.!</i>

232
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,965
Ho! Ho!

233
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,468
Right there!

234
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,199
Hey!

235
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,368
Go on! Get back there! What'd
you bring this baboon along for?

236
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,970
<i>- That big guy don't like him.!
- That's just too bad! He'll learn to like him!</i>

237
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>- Come on! Let's go! Mush! Mush!
- Get your teeth out of him.!</i>

238
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,013
Come on! Get up there!
Come on, gray boy!

239
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,657
Come on, Buck.

240
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,527
- What's the matter?
- Nearly took my wing off.

241
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,626
Come on, big boy.

242
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,635
We don't mean you any harm.

243
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,228
We're trying to be friendly with you.

244
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,510
Buck, come here!

245
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,707
<i>Buck, come here.!</i>

246
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,421
Come on, boy. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

247
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,826
Come on, now, be-

248
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,326
Buck! Hey, Buck! Buck, come here!

249
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,606
Well, you can kiss
that 250 bucks good-bye.

250
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,609
Yep. It's too bad too.
He'd have made a great dog.

251
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,169
Now he'll either freeze to death,
or wolves'll get him. Poor fella.

252
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,394
Make yourself at home, Buck.

253
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,937
Hey! Look, boss! Wolves!

254
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,184
<i>Is he dead?</i>

255
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:26,220
No, he isn't dead. And he isn't a he.

256
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,195
Hey, you know who that
is? That's Blake's woman!

257
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,868
Oh, John! Oh, John
darling! I'm so glad!

258
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,938
Oh.

259
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,039
Oh- Oh,
I thought-

260
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,644
Is my husband with
you? Have you found him?

261
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,720
<i>You're the only one
we've found so far.</i>

262
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,658
What about your husband?

263
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,591
I don't know.

264
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,595
We ran into trouble...

265
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,598
and we lost most of our
provisions crossing the river.

266
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,863
The ice broke, and
- and then some of our dogs died.

267
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,030
Two days ago my husband
went out to look for food...

268
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,233
and he hasn't come back.

269
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,113
Do you think he's dead?

270
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:25,349
That's a pretty good guess.

271
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,529
What are we gonna do with her?

272
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,600
What can you do? Take her
to Dawson and leave her.

273
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,727
You're forgetting one thing, pal.

274
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,068
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.

275
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,143
And they had the map
- the original one.

276
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,848
You'll find my husband
for me, won't you?

277
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,851
There's nothing we can do. We're
a thousand miles from nowhere.

278
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,285
Either the cold got
him, or the wolves.

279
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,792
- Get on the sled. We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.

280
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,487
He isn't dead. I
- I don't believe that.

281
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:16,431
Hey, listen, lady, in this country when
a guy is gone for two days, he's gone.

282
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,971
I refuse to go until I
definitely know about my husband.

283
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:25,270
If you don't wanna stay and look
for him, you can go without me.

284
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,344
No! No! Put me down!

285
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:38,411
Put me down! I can't go!
I've got to stay! Put me down!

286
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,917
Stop! Stop this sled!

287
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,927
Whoa! What's the matter?

288
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:47,930
- You untie these straps.
- Oh, no, no. You might fall off.

289
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:50,432
I'm doing this for your own
good. Later on you'll thank me.

290
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,935
I hate you, you beast!
Let me out of here!

291
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:56,165
Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but words can never hurt me!

292
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,708
Whoops! Ha!

293
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,778
<i>- Let's go! Mush!
- Mush.!</i>

294
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,036
Beans.

295
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:39,148
It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for
everybody to pitch in and do their share.

296
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,152
<i>You've been with us two days, and you haven't
done anything but sit around and look nasty.</i>

297
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:45,154
<i>Can you cook?</i>

298
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,190
Yes, I'm considered
a very excellent cook.

299
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,023
Huh. Well, how about giving these
beans the benefit of your talents?

300
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,029
I'll do nothing to help you.

301
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,225
I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to
want me with you, you'll take care of me.

302
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:00,794
Want you? We just had an attack of insanity
and decided to keep you from committing suicide.

303
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:02,930
Very bad idea, come to think of it.

304
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,844
Hey! You're forgettin'
our guest of honor.

305
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,022
Thank you, Mr. Hoolihan.

306
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,786
- Hey. Gimme. Come on, gimme.
- Hmm?

307
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,801
Say, uh, Mrs. Blake, if
I ain't too inquisitive...

308
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,804
what was you and your
old man gonna do up here?

309
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,771
Work.

310
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,275
Oh. Looking for the yellow stuff, eh?

311
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,277
Probably.

312
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,109
Can't understand it, a guy taking
his wife way out in the wilderness.

313
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,740
Stupid, if you ask me.

314
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,751
Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.

315
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,753
Yeah?

316
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,756
Yeah. He loved me and I loved him.

317
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,759
Well, I wouldn't let him go alone.

318
00:24:56,861 --> 00:25:00,092
Undoubtedly, that will still impress
you as being a very stupid reason.

319
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,098
We thought it an excellent one.

320
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,259
I still think it's stupid.

321
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,406
<i>Have some coffee.
It might warm you up.</i>

322
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,671
Well, tell me somethin'.

323
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,684
Uh, didn't he have some object?
Wasn't there somethin' he was after?

324
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,381
What I mean is, did he have a hunch,
or did somebody give him a tip?

325
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,392
- I'm very tired, Mr. Hoolihan, and I know you must be.
- Me, tired? Heck no!

326
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,930
Well, I thought you might be,
asking such personal questions.

327
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,226
- Good night.
- Good night.

328
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,408
Boss, she's a woman in a million.

329
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,414
- You think so?
- Yeah. She don't talk.

330
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,484
Oh!

331
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,283
All right, get on with the dogs.

332
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:06,454
No, thank you. I'll
cross the way you men do.

333
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,911
Hold on! Hold on!

334
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,982
<i>Stick with it.!</i>

335
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,776
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!

336
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,207
Say! Nice, modest little
prices they have here.

337
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,209
They practically give things away.

338
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,212
Say, boss, how much we
got this side of the grave?

339
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,010
Just about enough for
a room in a poorhouse.

340
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,381
This mansion over here'll do. Come on.

341
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,683
- Come on, Buck.
- Come on, Buck.

342
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,912
Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's
about time to say good-bye.

343
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:14,583
There's an officer of the
Mounted Police down the street.

344
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:16,676
They'll get you back to the States.

345
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:19,688
We'd stake you ourselves, only,
well, we've mislaid our funds.

346
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,190
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,727
Well, you've been very
nice, Mr. Thornton.

348
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,730
I
- I suppose I was a little difficult, but...

349
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,733
<i>- well, losing someone you've
grown to love isn't- - Yes, I know.</i>

350
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,201
I'm sorry I was so rough.

351
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:41,873
Well, I
- I'm sorry I was so unpleasant.

352
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:45,142
Mmm. I'm sorry that I can't think
of a thing to be sorry about.

353
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,012
Ohh!

354
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,019
I suppose you've got friends
and relatives back in the states.

355
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,180
No. My husband's all I had.

356
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,191
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.

357
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,193
Yes?

358
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,696
We know what brought you up
here. We've known all along.

359
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,790
I mean, old man Blake's claim.

360
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:06,802
But how? How could you possibly know?

361
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:08,804
Give me that map, Shorty.

362
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,806
<i>Yeah.</i>

363
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:12,808
Did you ever see this?

364
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,878
Or, uh, something like it?

365
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:20,145
Yes. Yes, I've seen the original.

366
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,651
This won't do you any
good. It isn't correct.

367
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:25,313
I know it. That's why I
was going to suggest that-

368
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,153
My husband had to borrow
and beg to make this trip.

369
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,659
He went through all sorts
of horrible difficulties and-

370
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,662
I know. Well, now he
- he's gone.

371
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:36,164
That's why I was
going to suggest that-

372
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,168
And you were gonna take
it away from him, steal it.

373
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,604
Oh, now, please be reasonable. Why don't
you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?

374
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,609
Where our map is incorrect, give us
the right route. We'll be partners.

375
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,077
And, well, while you're about it...

376
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,081
I suppose you may as
well consider all angles.

377
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,083
We need your information about this.

378
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,315
We could probably find the mine ourselves
without your help. It would take longer.

379
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,686
Of course, you don't
know us very well...

380
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,624
except that we're a
little rough on women.

381
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,628
We might play you dirty.

382
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,632
We might take your information and then
tell you to, well, go jump in the river.

383
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,702
<i>We might do that.</i>

384
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,139
On the other hand, we might
be on the up-and-up with you.

385
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,148
Let me see your map.

386
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,219
This river here
- it isn't a river, it's a dry creek.

387
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,222
- And that mountain peak, that's down here.
- Criminy! That's it!

388
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,224
Ha!

389
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,624
All the other mistakes are minor ones.

390
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
All right, Mr. Thornton,
now you can tell me-

391
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,299
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?

392
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,302
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves
to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.

393
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,305
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
- My, oh, my, oh, my.

394
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,309
But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife,
stick somebody and take it away from 'em.

395
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,743
- Yeah!
- Come on, Shorty. Mush!

396
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:02,381
- Come on. Let's go.
- All set.

397
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:04,886
Keep your fingers
crossed till we get back.

398
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,719
We've gotta make a touch, Shorty.

399
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,729
Something that means more to
me now that just finding a mine.

400
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,731
Yeah, I been noticing that.

401
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,063
You're the doctor. You
know what's good for ya.

402
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,070
The way I figures it, hunting
for gold's a full-time job.

403
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,073
Anything that interferes
with it, interferes with it.

404
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,735
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

405
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,211
Mind keeping that fat snoot
of yours out of my affairs?

406
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:33,078
All right, all right. No offense,
boss. No offense whatsoever.

407
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,258
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?

408
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,328
Come on!

409
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,912
My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!

410
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,519
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?

411
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,714
That's the second
time he's attacked me!

412
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,984
Yeah, he's crazy about you!

413
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:16,787
Can't you see?

414
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,886
Wait a minute, partner. I'll give
you a chance to make some money.

415
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,761
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.

416
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,994
<i>- Ha.!
- Five hundred.</i>

417
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,093
Nope. Not interested.

418
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:29,934
I'll give you $1,000!

419
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,807
That's a fabulous price to pay for a
dog. I could get a team of six for that.

420
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,406
What do you expect you'd do
with him if I let you have him?

421
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,477
Give myself the exquisite pleasure
of putting a bullet through his head.

422
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,749
Yeah, that's what I thought.

423
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:50,850
No, thanks. I'm sorry I can't
contribute to your fun, mister.

424
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,987
Boo!

425
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,094
<i>What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?</i>

426
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:03,532
Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?

427
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,542
Hello, Sam! How are you? Glad
to see you. Sam, this is Shorty.

428
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,544
- Hello.
- Ah, yes!

429
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,547
Just seen the argument you had
with that fellow back there.

430
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,049
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
- No, no.

431
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:17,052
The dog doesn't like him either.

432
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:19,554
Look, Sam, how you fixed?

433
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,353
Uh, pretty nearly flat.

434
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,988
But anyhow, I got enough to ask you
gentlemens to join me in a drink.

435
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,997
- Bourbon, straight!
- Ditto!

436
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,499
Likewise! Come on, boy! Come on!

437
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,469
Schnapps?

438
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,769
Well, Sam, here's to
your very good health.

439
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,469
- Skoal.
- Prosit.

440
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,947
You know, that's a lot of money
that fellow offered you for your dog.

441
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,517
Yeah? That's a lot of dog too.

442
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,518
<i>Ja!</i>

443
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:01,830
- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?
- No, no, no, not yet.

444
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:04,264
Maybe somebody we know will show.

445
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,860
Ole! Ha-ha! How are you?

446
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,872
I got lots trouble.

447
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,875
Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap.

448
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,877
What matter, huh?

449
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,504
I got load of thousand-pound flour...

450
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,743
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.

451
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,820
Two of my dogs, they die.

452
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,914
It's too big load for the
other four dogs to pull.

453
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,926
Quiet, now!

454
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,429
Yo! That's one fine dog, mister!

455
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,523
You want to sell, maybe?

456
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,125
- No, I don't.
- I'll say he don't!

457
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,466
You know, that fellow back there...

458
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,564
<i>just offered him 1,000 bucks.</i>

459
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,576
- One thousand
bucks? - Mm-hmm.

460
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,579
What the dog do? Spit gold dust?

461
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,581
He's the best dog you've ever seen.

462
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,584
He could pull that load of
yours without any help at all.

463
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,621
- Sure! I'll bet you he could.
- Well, he could.

464
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:01,691
How'd you like to make a
little bet on that, partner?

465
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,261
Haven't any money to bet.

466
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,762
I hear of one dog in Nome...

467
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,992
he pull 800 pound.

468
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,762
But he dies dead to do that.

469
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,270
Ah, no dog can pull 1,000
pounds. It's impossible.

470
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:17,806
Well, then it's
impossible. Let's drop it.

471
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,967
Is it all right to
look at him, mister?

472
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,978
It ain't every day we can see a
dog that can pull a thousand pounds.

473
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,173
Come on, boss. Let's get outta here.

474
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:28,649
What's the matter, gentlemen?

475
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,187
If I overheard correctly...

476
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:36,487
the argument is whether or not
this dog can pull a thousand pounds.

477
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,495
I'm willing to bet a
dollar a pound he can't.

478
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,758
He won't bet. Says he's broke.

479
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:44,265
I don't want money
from you, my friend.

480
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,666
If your dog is able to do
it, I'll give you the $1,000.

481
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:51,206
<i>- If he
can't- - Well?</i>

482
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,171
Why, then, I'll take the dog.

483
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:00,682
No.

484
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,615
<i>Say, that sounds fair to me.</i>

485
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,123
<i>Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog
that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds.</i>

486
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:10,125
<i>- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!</i>

487
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:13,628
<i>First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.</i>

488
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,292
Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem
to think I'm giving you the best of it.

489
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,303
Don't do it, boss.
Let's go outta here.

490
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,600
A thousand dollars.

491
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,318
It's a bet!

492
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,821
It's a bet!

493
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,824
I think you make one
big mistake, mister.

494
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:45,394
But, well, we go outside.

495
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:57,967
- Thornton's crazy!
- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!

496
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,771
- Ten-to-one he
can't! - It's a bet!

497
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,312
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!

498
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,577
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!

499
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:11,781
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!

500
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,395
- Gee, boss, he can't do it. He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.

501
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,733
You're not only doing this for money.

502
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,036
You're afraid of getting stuck
here and losing that Blake woman.

503
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,772
Oh, all right.

504
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:48,454
Your dog is to pull the sled a
hundred yards from the standstill.

505
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,618
That's the bet.

506
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,628
<i>A hundred yards.!</i>

507
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,664
All right, all right!

508
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,607
One, two, three, four...

509
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,110
<i>All right, get back.
Nobody touch that dog.</i>

510
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,273
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, one, two-

511
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,519
Dog is gonna draw a
sled. Just stand there.

512
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,520
The dog will do it!

513
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,352
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.

514
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,585
The dog will do it!

515
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,686
Five, six, seven, eight, nine-

516
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,766
Keep your hands off that
dog, now! You understand?

517
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,126
Oh, I beg your pardon.

518
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,797
Seven, eight, nine, a hundred.

519
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,672
Go on, mister. We're waiting.

520
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:45,843
Buck.

521
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,917
<i>Buck.!</i>

522
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,384
Buck! Come on, boy!

523
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,231
Come on, Buck! Mush!

524
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:26,014
Come on, boy! Mush, Buck!

525
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:33,092
Come on, come on, Buck!

526
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,113
- Come on, boy.
- Stay away from that dog!

527
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,116
Buck, come on!

528
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:05,850
Buck! Come on, boy!

529
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,897
Come on, whitey! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

530
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:40,493
Hooray! That dog done it.

531
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,930
- He all right?
- Hope so.

532
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:53,866
Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but
haven't you forgotten about the money?

533
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:56,207
The gelt? Please.

534
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,338
Mmm! Thank you, sir.

535
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:00,507
- Oh, say. You know something?
- Well?

536
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:03,484
You'd make a good dog biscuit.

537
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,472
- What's that, a halter?
- Yeah.

538
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:35,415
Hmm. Being as I'm working like a
horse, I just as well look like one.

539
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,322
There you are. Now hang on to this.

540
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,324
Is that all?

541
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,451
Did you remember nails?

542
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:47,496
Nails. Hammers and saw. Look.

543
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:50,498
You bought 'em yourself. What's
the matter with you this morning?

544
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,568
- Nothing. Get out.
- Mmm.

545
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,569
Oh, hey, listen-

546
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:56,696
There's something we did forget
- a medicine kit.

547
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,140
We need some iodine and
quinine, just in case.

548
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:01,835
Yeah, all right. I'll get 'em.

549
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:05,403
Hmm. I hope it won't be
too heavy for you to carry.

550
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:09,579
<i>- See youse later.
- All right.</i>

551
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,581
Say, uh, what do we need
the nails and hammers for?

552
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,620
Well, the snow's disappearing fast.

553
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,029
We'll have to cache the sled
later on and build a boat.

554
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,897
Oh?

555
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,901
Say, uh, look-

556
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,170
Yeah?

557
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,245
What is it?

558
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,848
I, uh-

559
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,919
I got something to tell you. Maybe
you better take it sitting down.

560
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:50,082
You know how I feel about
women in this country.

561
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:52,252
Where we're going is ten
times as tough and rugged...

562
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:55,092
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?

563
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:57,189
Well, just this.

564
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,291
I paid your room rent
here at the hotel...

565
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,928
and I'll leave you enough money
for expenses until we get back.

566
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,564
You mean I'm supposed to wait
here while you and Shorty go-

567
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:06,938
That's it.

568
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,945
I've been wondering whether
you'd try something like this.

569
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,106
Well, if you're going, I'm going too.

570
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:14,183
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.

571
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,479
All right, Shorty and I will
stay here. You go find the mine.

572
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:18,554
- Oh, don't be smart.
- Well, you're not going.

573
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:20,623
Wouldn't be fair to
you, or to us either.

574
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,352
Slow us down to a walk and
make us carry double provisions.

575
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,122
Besides, it's more of a risk
than I want to see you take.

576
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:28,789
Believe me, that's my only
reason for making this decision.

577
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,197
If you don't like my way
of doing it, do it yourself.

578
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,031
- You can have my share.
- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?

579
00:44:34,137 --> 00:44:36,662
Well, thank you very much. You'll
not leave this town without me.

580
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,673
We'll leave without you.

581
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:41,642
You'll wait here and like it.

582
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,010
All right, come on. Let's get going.

583
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,816
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.

584
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,484
If that female iceberg comes out and
wants to tag along, smack her down.

585
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:06,559
Wonder what's happened now.

586
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,696
Oh, well. You know, I know a couple of
people used to fool around like that...

587
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:12,036
and they got children now.

588
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,708
You, uh
- You still want to go along?

589
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,318
<i>Not only do I still
want to go, I am going.</i>

590
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,855
All right, come on. Let's get going.

591
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,797
<i>Come on.!</i>

592
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:42,237
Mush! Mush!

593
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,239
<i>Come on.!</i>

594
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,775
Hey! Hey! Come on!

595
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,978
Mush! Mush!

596
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,985
Mush!

597
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:08,596
- What's up, Sergeant?
- They just brought a fellow in.

598
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:11,098
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?

599
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,533
It seems like he left his
sled to go hunting for food...

600
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,571
then couldn't find his way back.

601
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,606
He was almost a corpse
when they found him.

602
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:20,437
- What's his name?
- Well, we found these on him.

603
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:24,503
Name seems to be Blake
- John Blake, San Francisco.

604
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,958
Here it comes.

605
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,936
Say, it even looks like a raft.

606
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,633
Thanks. I always
wanted to join the navy.

607
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:53,732
- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?
- I'm afraid not, matey.

608
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:56,277
- They'll have to run along the bank.
- Very well, sir.

609
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:58,973
Be careful of that varnish
on the deck, you two gobs.

610
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,982
Step right in, commodore.

611
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:05,445
<i>All set? Shove off, cabin boy.</i>

612
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,489
Ca-

613
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,491
Toot, toot!

614
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,561
Hard aport!

615
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,804
Come on, Buck. Come on.

616
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,054
The way I figure it, we
go 100 miles upstream...

617
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:45,025
then we follow a creek
that runs into it north.

618
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,961
Huh!

619
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,225
Never fails.

620
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,097
Oh, you pretty things.

621
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,969
That's right
- north for about 40 miles.

622
00:47:57,073 --> 00:48:01,339
And then all we gotta do is-

623
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,648
Oh, if you could only cook.

624
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:09,717
Then all we have to
do is find the knoll...

625
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:12,754
upon which stands a tree,
half-shattered by lightning.

626
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,824
And the cabin.

627
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,405
Near that knoll.

628
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,575
Gee, I wonder what
it's gonna be like...

629
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,644
having things instead
of wishing for 'em.

630
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,644
Hmm.

631
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,646
Not nearly so much fun.

632
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,684
You're wrong, Claire.

633
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,686
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.

634
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,688
It's owning something that counts.

635
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,953
Taking it when you can't get it any other way
- that's all right too.

636
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,563
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.

637
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:57,633
When there's something
you need, grab it.

638
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,725
Take it away from the other guy.

639
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,736
It's a good law.

640
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,398
It works.

641
00:49:04,507 --> 00:49:09,706
Nope. It only works when you
deserve to have what you take.

642
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,907
Otherwise it's stealing.

643
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,543
Perhaps that particular
commandment isn't respected up here.

644
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:22,352
<i>They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.</i>

645
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,427
Well, Noah...

646
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:27,690
that boat manipulating's a little too
tough for my delicate constitution...

647
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:31,392
so if you don't mind,
sir, I shall go below.

648
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,941
Good night.

649
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,375
- Night, Shorty.
- Night.

650
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,447
Good night, dice.

651
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,459
Summer's just around the corner.

652
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:07,229
I can smell it.

653
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,803
You know, somehow
Dawson and Skagway and...

654
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,037
even California seem like
places I've just heard of.

655
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,649
Seems as if I've lived out
here in this wilderness forever.

656
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,783
Other people and other places...

657
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,085
never existed.

658
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,741
But there's one thing I do remember...

659
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,470
and that's a very
kind and wonderful man.

660
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,755
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.

661
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,827
What are you thinking of, Buck?

662
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,294
Well, he's probably
remembering more than thinking.

663
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,200
Remembering back to the time
when he was more wolf than dog.

664
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:18,137
When there was only one law-

665
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,473
the law we were just talking about.

666
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,684
It's getting late, Jack.

667
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,049
Think I'll say good night.

668
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,218
Not guilty, Your Honor.

669
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:32,146
Cabin!

670
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:34,910
- The tree!
- The mine!

671
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,986
Oh, boy!

672
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:51,526
Hey, somebody pinch me.

673
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,625
That does it.

674
00:52:53,736 --> 00:52:56,899
It's just as it was in the letter.

675
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,477
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.

676
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,482
Hey! Hey, boss!

677
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,075
Boss! Come here, quick.

678
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,450
Hmm. Look at this.

679
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:15,115
Oh, my. Oh.

680
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:18,489
Lookit, lookit! Tell me
if I'm dreamin'. Lookit.

681
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,956
Holy mackerel.

682
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:27,469
It's gold, Claire. More gold than
I've ever seen in my whole life.

683
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:31,138
Oh!

684
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,708
Oh, be careful!

685
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:56,595
Hey, if we panned this
much in an afternoon...

686
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,667
think what we'll get in a month.

687
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,999
Gee, I wish I could stick around
here a couple of days longer.

688
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,335
You know, I been dreamin'
of this moment all my life.

689
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,432
I'm sorry, Shorty, but
you got to file a claim.

690
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:10,569
As long as the trails are open, some
prospector is apt to discover this creek.

691
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,807
First to register
gets discovery rights.

692
00:54:12,915 --> 00:54:14,815
You're the boss, boss.

693
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:17,147
- When I get to Dawson, first
thing I'm gonna do- - Don't.

694
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,187
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.

695
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:21,586
Not a chance. I'm gonna
catch up on my meals.

696
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,127
I like coffee, and my stomach's
been getting weaker every day.

697
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,863
Well, so long, kid.

698
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,001
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.

699
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,269
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake.

700
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,877
Good-bye, Shorty.

701
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,878
Come on, dogs.

702
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:50,414
<i>- Hey.! Hey, Shorty.!
- What?</i>

703
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,385
You forgot your meal ticket.

704
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:55,423
Oh! Oh, yeah. Come to papa.

705
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,600
Snake eyes.

706
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,865
My, oh, my, oh, my. I do declare.

707
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:12,372
Well, good-bye.

708
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,375
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

709
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,129
What's the matter, boy?

710
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,933
Buck!

711
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,633
<i>Buck.!</i>

712
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,087
- What's biting him?
- I don't know.

713
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,923
- What's that, Jack?
- Wolves.

714
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:08,793
That's funny. They don't
usually come so close to camp.

715
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,709
Buck! Come here!

716
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,718
Buck, come back here!

717
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,449
If that's a pack, they'll
kill him. Buck, come here!

718
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,867
<i>Buck.!</i>

719
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:53,973
He's been changing lately.
Haven't you noticed?

720
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:56,306
Seems as though he
remembers things up here.

721
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:59,404
Buck, come back here! Buck!

722
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,022
Buck! Buck, come here!

723
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,591
Well, well. Welcome, stranger.

724
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,633
How are ya? Huh?

725
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,770
Well, seems we still
mean more to him than-

726
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,776
than that old memory.

727
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:39,143
<i>Yeah.</i>

728
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:46,347
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

729
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:49,424
You better come inside
before you change your mind.

730
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,430
Come on, tough guy. Come on.

731
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,562
<i>All right, kid, shake it up.</i>

732
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,834
<i>Shake it up.</i>

733
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,069
Oh, that's grand music.

734
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,407
Yes.

735
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,811
That's grand music.

736
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:16,248
<i>Aw, that's grand music.</i>

737
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,254
<i>Yeah. That's grand music.</i>

738
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,260
That's lovely. Come on.

739
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,396
<i>Shake it up.</i>

740
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,106
<i>All right. You tired? Hmm?</i>

741
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:42,437
All right, come on now.

742
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,241
Let's pull. Together.

743
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,078
One, two...

744
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,913
- three-
- Oh!

745
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,327
Well, we weren't together.

746
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,479
- Oh, I wish you hadn't.
- Why not?

747
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,319
I haven't let myself think about us.

748
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:32,326
- I didn't dare.
- Why?

749
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,589
Oh, I don't know. I-

750
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,756
I've had sort of a
strange premonition.

751
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,834
I don't know exactly
how to explain it, but-

752
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:42,335
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away.

753
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,668
I only have one question...

754
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,242
and I only want one answer.

755
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,010
You know the answer.

756
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:57,244
I don't want to know the answer.

757
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,821
<i>I want to have the answer.</i>

758
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,133
It just struck me, Mr. Blake.

759
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:17,797
Now my back please, Kali.

760
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,966
I say, Mr. Blake, it's just
struck me that so far...

761
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,670
<i>I've taken this
entire matter on trust.</i>

762
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:26,145
I believed your story and put
up the money for this outfit.

763
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:28,978
I still believe your story,
but I think it's time...

764
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,519
you gave me a little
more positive proof.

765
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,646
<i>You should show us the map, Mr. Blake.</i>

766
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,817
When I asked you in Dawson
City to help finance me...

767
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,862
I told you I knew the
location of a very rich mine.

768
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:44,194
I still know where that mine is.

769
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,268
I'm taking you there.

770
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:48,302
But the map, Mr. Blake-

771
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,373
Why do you continually
refuse to show us the map?

772
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:02,417
I see.

773
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,487
Well, what's to prevent
our taking it away from you?

774
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,284
The possibility that
such a map may not exist-

775
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,722
except in my memory.

776
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,226
Violence will do you no good.

777
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,305
You've come this far...

778
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:26,966
and now there's nothing you
can do but go all the way.

779
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,807
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.

780
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,814
Now, now. Who talked of killing?

781
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,817
We're not pirates, my dear man.

782
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,480
We are gentleman adventurers
on the road to great riches, eh?

783
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:44,389
Come, come, Kali. My towel.

784
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,783
Say, Jack.

785
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:12,445
<i>- Buck's gone again.
- Yes, I know.</i>

786
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,319
<i>- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?</i>

787
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:19,292
Well, that's what happens to a
fella when he gets in bad company.

788
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:22,023
Mmm!

789
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,902
Wait a minute.

790
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,653
According to all you told
us, and to all calculations...

791
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:46,812
we should have located
the mine two days ago.

792
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:49,982
I'm afraid you're bringing
out my worst side, Mr. Blake.

793
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,617
- Yes, I-I know, but- - If
you're trying to hoodwink us...

794
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,288
we are certain to find
it out sooner or later...

795
01:03:55,397 --> 01:03:57,365
and if such is the case...

796
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,264
there is nothing left for
us to do but mourn for you.

797
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,303
I swear I'm doing the best I can.

798
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,269
I followed the compass
directions exactly.

799
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,609
<i>The burnt tree.!</i>

800
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,279
- The cabin! That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake...

801
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:23,256
how can you ever forgive me
for doubting your integrity?

802
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,293
You've placed me in a
most embarrassing position.

803
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,488
I scarcely know what to say.

804
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:42,273
One for the master.

805
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,780
And one for the dame.

806
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:52,379
And one for the little
boy who's filing the claim.

807
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,547
Why, Jack, I never suspected.

808
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,989
The world doesn't understand me.

809
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:59,060
At heart I'm an artist.

810
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,994
Oh, I want to write
poetry. I want to compose.

811
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,065
I want to sing, paint.

812
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,260
- Barns?
- Yes, yes. Those too.

813
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,303
I want to starve in a garret.

814
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,566
Wear me hair long. Get
egg on a flowing tie.

815
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:15,110
In other words, be a genius. Ah
- But no.

816
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,405
No, the world sneers at me talent...

817
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,777
and instead it gives me... gold.

818
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,851
Oh, my poor boy.

819
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:39,862
You seem to have all the
comforts of home, Mr. Thornton-

820
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:43,961
A comfortable cabin, golden
evidence of more comforts to come...

821
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,236
and a beautiful lady.

822
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:51,242
You will oblige me greatly
if you will assist...

823
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,781
in making this incident
as painless as possible.

824
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,517
Come on, get it over with.
What are you going to do?

825
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:00,144
Do? My dear man, nothing at all.

826
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:02,587
The important thing is-

827
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:05,558
We're going back by water,
Kali, using Mr. Thornton's canoe.

828
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,221
<i>You may destroy our burros.</i>

829
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,369
As I was saying, the important
thing is to prevent you people...

830
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,907
from filing claim on this
charming site before we do.

831
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,237
And how do you expect to do that?

832
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:23,311
Oh, very easily-

833
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:27,143
by leaving you here and destroying
all means of transportation.

834
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:35,451
<i>- If you can't get back to
Dawson to file, why, then...</i>

835
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:38,082
<i>- you can't get back to
Dawson to file, now can you?</i>

836
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:40,093
So we'll file instead.

837
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:42,095
If you want to work the
mine while we're gone...

838
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:44,256
you're very welcome
to do so, of course.

839
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:47,665
We'll be glad to recompense you
for your trouble when we get back.

840
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,833
Meanwhile we'll take with us your
gun and ammunition, axes, et cetera.

841
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:55,068
It would be a grave
error to leave behind...

842
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,737
the implements for building
another canoe, wouldn't it?

843
01:06:57,846 --> 01:06:59,746
Kali!

844
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,941
<i>Francois.! Kali.!</i>

845
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,746
<i>Come here.!</i>

846
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:07,583
Look here, Smith. Why
can't we do business?

847
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:10,351
I'm always open to an honest
proposition, Mr. Thornton.

848
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,359
We'll give you the claim, all of it.

849
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,361
You can have what gold we've got.

850
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:17,125
But leave us some way of getting out
of here. The winter snows are coming on.

851
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:20,429
My dear man, you call that
a business proposition?

852
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,437
We already have the mine, and
the gold is ours by right of-

853
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,598
How shall I put it?

854
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:27,766
By right of conquest.

855
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,777
Do you mind if we don't
argue the point anymore?

856
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:34,314
Let's help ourselves.

857
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:37,180
Mr. Thornton would
only squander the gold.

858
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,183
I must commend your sense
of humor, Mr. Thornton.

859
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,987
<i>Very few people would be able to
smile on an occasion like this.</i>

860
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:47,789
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

861
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:50,091
I remember watching a magician once.

862
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,168
From an apparently empty hat,
he shortly produced a rabbit.

863
01:07:53,268 --> 01:07:55,896
<i>He smiled very much as
you're smiling now...</i>

864
01:07:56,004 --> 01:07:58,632
<i>because, I imagine, he
knew all the while...</i>

865
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,300
<i>that he had that rabbit up his sleeve.</i>

866
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,878
<i>You've something up
your sleeve, perhaps.</i>

867
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,573
Perhaps.

868
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,847
Roll up your sleeve, Mr.
Thornton. There's no rabbit there.

869
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,683
Come, come. Don't let's
strain our friendship.

870
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,631
Madam.

871
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,771
Careful, you idiot. You
might have split the bottom.

872
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:14,414
We'll be back, my friends.

873
01:09:14,516 --> 01:09:17,417
For the time being, good-bye...

874
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:19,453
and good-bye.

875
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:39,966
Look out!

876
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:19,308
Well, they wanted
gold. Now they got it.

877
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:05,426
Hey, Claire, get the medicine
kit and some hot water.

878
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,767
Is he badly hurt?

879
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,804
Yeah. He's got a nasty
crack on the skull.

880
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,805
Some prospector, I guess.

881
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,842
Go away, Buck. Get out of the way.

882
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,040
John! John!

883
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,913
<i>Oh, John.</i>

884
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:31,918
<i>John, darling.!</i>

885
01:11:43,398 --> 01:11:45,332
Claire, dearest...

886
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,402
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.

887
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:51,898
All right, dear.

888
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,277
I thought I'd...

889
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,370
lost you.

890
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,498
Try to rest, please.

891
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,838
He's feeling much better this morning.

892
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,204
He remembers everything, thank heaven.

893
01:13:01,309 --> 01:13:03,777
It wasn't so serious as we thought.

894
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,938
He wants to see you, Jack.

895
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,478
What are you going to say to him?

896
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:18,124
I wanted you...

897
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:21,286
and I took you with us.

898
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,864
Well, I'm keeping you.

899
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,536
Jack.

900
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,298
You know I love you, don't you?

901
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:35,467
You couldn't doubt that, could you?

902
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,318
Well, he needs me.

903
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:47,081
You have your law and...

904
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,248
I have mine.

905
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:20,416
Best thing you can do, Blake, is to
get out of here as quick as you can.

906
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,116
<i>You need medical
attention. Take the canoe.</i>

907
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,092
<i>It's easy going now, but it won't
be when the heavy snows come on.</i>

908
01:14:28,496 --> 01:14:30,794
Will you come with us?

909
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,799
No, I'll stay here and work the mine.

910
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,461
When you come back in the spring,
we'll divide what I've found.

911
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,890
I came to say good-bye to Buck.

912
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,429
He never would have forgiven
me if I'd forgotten that.

913
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,498
Would you, Buck?

914
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:13,832
You could have skipped that.

915
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,103
You're only making it
tougher on everybody.

916
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,044
Oh, Jack, put your arms around me.

917
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,657
Well, I'll be seeing you.

918
01:15:37,265 --> 01:15:39,790
Yes.

919
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:42,233
You'll be seeing me.

920
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,765
I'll be seeing you too.

921
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,179
Every day and every
night and every minute.

922
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,314
This isn't the end.

923
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:00,721
It can't be.

924
01:16:45,266 --> 01:16:48,167
Careful of that first stretch of
rapids. After that it's clear sailing.

925
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:50,237
Good-bye, Thornton.

926
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:53,407
And God bless you.

927
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,499
Good-bye, Blake.

928
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,180
Good-bye, Jack.

929
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:05,184
Good-bye, Claire.

930
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:10,814
It's hard to say no to
that call, isn't it, Buck?

931
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,386
It's all right, boy. Go ahead.

932
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:44,069
Shorty?

933
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,512
- Yeah!
- Shorty!

934
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:51,278
- Hello, boss!
- Why, you old son of a gun.

935
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,786
You came just in time.
You saved my life.

936
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:55,822
Well, look at you.
You're all dressed up.

937
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,858
Yeah. We're in the
money. I filed the claim.

938
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,859
We're rich
- Richer than Astor's pup!

939
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,555
No trouble at all. I went
right in and signed the names.

940
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,565
- Oh, and the
claim was- - Shorty.

941
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,604
What's that?

942
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,606
That's our new cook.

943
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:16,302
- Where'd you get it?
- I won it in a crap game.
