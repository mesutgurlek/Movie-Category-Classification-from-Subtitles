Easy, boy. Easy.

12

He is either a fool
or he has courage.

The blood is new.
He is a fool to think we are gone.

14

No. He thinks we are here...

15

and he wants us to know this.

16
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,918
This is a good game.

17

But if he crosses our river, shoot.

- At 20-Mile Creek.

24

<i>He couldn't wait.</i>
<i>The peace commission was too slow for him.</i>

So he crossed over into Indian territory
and got what he deserved.

32
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,658
I'm warning you.
From now on...

33

and gets back will wish he hadn't.

when the treaty is signed.

But until then, the agreement is...

we stay on our side of the river

So far, they've stayed on theirs.

go on I can't promise you.

Anybody claiming it?

43

You can start explaining yourself.

Whatever you need to know, sir, is in here.

45
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:01,740
There's, uh, not much to explain.

For your information, we're trying to get
a new treaty signed with the Indians.

47

The Sioux, the Crow and the Blackfeet
are discussing it with us...

48

but Chief Broken Hand and his Cheyennes
are holding out.

49
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,651
I have no idea what they're gonna do.
We're sitting on a powder keg here.

50

And people like you and that prospector
seem to be doing your best to blow the lid off.

51

You can save the speeches, Colonel.
I'm not a private in your army.

52
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,106
No, but you're at Fort Laramie
and I'm in charge here.

00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:37,769
Josh Tanner, huh?
Why did you come here, Mr. Tanner?

54
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,508
- It says there.
- Answer the question.

55
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,713
I have a contract with some businessmen
from St. Louis.

56
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:50,918
- You mean gamblers?
- Because I dress like this?
I happen to prefer it to buckskin.

57
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:54,291
You can't judge a man
by his clothes, can you?

58
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,660
You should have had more sense
than to come alone...

59
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,961
through Cheyenne country
at a time like this.

60
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,593
I traveled at night
until the last day out.

61
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,160
I certainly didn't want to go north,
then east down the Missouri...

62
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:07,003
just to make a big, safe swing
through Pawnee country.

63
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:09,543
You seem to know the territory.

64
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:13,206
One of the reasons I got the contract.
My father was with a trading outfit.

65
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:16,978
Until I went east to school,
I walked every foot of this country with him.

66
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:20,543
- You're authorized here to
stake out Black Hills country.
- That's right.

67
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,681
- Another gold syndicate?
- Real estate.

68
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:26,659
The gentlemen who hired me figured where
there's gold there will be a city sooner or later.

69
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:30,425
And you intend to bypass gold
for real estate?

70
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm not a prospector, Colonel.
I'm a surveyor...

71
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,327
hired to lay out a town site.

72
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:40,306
Oh, a town builder.
Just a public-spirited citizen, is that it?

73
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,971
Not at all.
I'm being paid for it.

74
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:48,243
- Hmm?
- The commissioners are waiting
for you at the council tree.

75
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:53,185
- Any sign of Broken Hand
or any of the Cheyennes?
- Not yet, sir.

76
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,883
- And the government's new gifts are on display?
- They are, sir.

77
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,949
All right, I'll be right down.

78
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:04,827
I hope you enjoy your stay in Laramie.
It may be a long one.

79
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,700
Broken Hand should have more consideration
for the gentlemen from St. Louis.

80
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:13,468
Yes, and for the prospectors
of thieves and gamblers...

81
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:18,308
that are just waiting to crawl all over
his territory the minute the treaty is signed.

82
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,338
- You blame him for staying away?
- I never thought much about it.

83
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,148
To me, Indians are Indians.
I have no feeling about them.

84

Good-day, Mr. Tanner.

86

- Is the detail ready, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

87

- Oh, Mr. Tanner.
- Yes?

89
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,708
You know that all civilians are restricted
to this side of the river...

90

467
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,596
He would die here if he were not old!
I know this.

468
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:50,497
The chief of all the Cheyennes
must think for all his people.

469
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:55,869
Little Dog knows that it is not fear that
speaks within his father, but wisdom.

470
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:59,033
Then I do not like wisdom!

471
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:15,384
Would Tanner go south with
the women and the old ones?

472
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:24,531
I don't know, Little Dog.

473
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:42,507
Yes, I think I would
go south if I were you.

474
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:45,248
Sometimes there is a change.

475
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:48,951
We don't see the reason
for it, but it's there.

476
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:55,090
These things are easy
for Tanner to say...

477
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:58,657
because he is a white man.

478
00:54:58,735 --> 00:55:01,295
Then let the white man go south.

479
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:04,169
We are not farmers-
We are Cheyennes!

480
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,971
And hunters! And fighters!

481
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:19,986
I will go into the hills by myself.

482
00:55:20,057 --> 00:55:23,356
The spirits will tell me what to do.

483
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:25,827
They will not lie to me.

484
00:55:57,828 --> 00:56:00,854
He went in the hills
to speak with the spirits.

485
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,963
Josh...

486
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:12,168
would you tell me something
to help me understand?

487
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:14,437
I'll try.

488
00:56:14,511 --> 00:56:19,107
My father has said that
if we stay here, we will die.

489
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:23,650
The lady at the fort-

490
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,679
She can live in our land
and she will not have to die.

491
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:29,692
No.

492
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,024
And you will not have to die?

493
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:41,599
I have thought of it, and I cannot understand
why there must be this difference.

494
00:56:41,671 --> 00:56:45,198
I don't think even the spirits
have an answer to that.

495
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:50,908
Maybe if- if we could live
in the white man's world...

496
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:54,144
there would be
no more talk of dying.

497
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:56,617
Many white people have come here.

498
00:56:56,686 --> 00:57:00,713
Behind them, they must have
left a great empty space.

499
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:04,693
So if- if they no longer
want this place...

500
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:08,390
maybe the Cheyennes
could go there and live.

501
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:12,060
You will tell me
if this can be done?

502
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:14,933
Would you be happy in
a white man's world?

503
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:17,633
I would try.

504
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,175
Yes, I would be happy.

505
00:57:26,183 --> 00:57:29,846
I'd give a great deal if
I could help Appearing Day.

506
00:57:31,988 --> 00:57:34,752

Hard to believe that it's all over.

509
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,632
Did he say how soon
he'd be ready to sign?

510
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:21,796
I imagine the sooner
the better, sir.

511
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:23,965
Yeah, I suppose so.

512
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,703
Some of the other tribes have
already started to move out.

513
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:30,041
Well, I'll be glad
to see the end of it.

514
00:58:30,113 --> 00:58:32,479
I'm sure it's been worse
for Broken Hand.

515
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:35,211
I know it has.

516

I feel sorry for him.

517

You told me once you had no feeling
about the Indians.

518

I can't understand it.
I don't know why.

There's a Pawnee scout dead, sir.
That Cheyenne knifed him.

she should come.

I told her, but I didn't say
anything about-

Where is she?

You wished to help, you said.
I think you meant it.

549

But you didn't tell me you were promised
to American Horse.

550
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:21,340
There's been much trouble.

551
01:01:21,418 --> 01:01:25,411
I did not tell you of
American Horse because...

552
01:01:25,488 --> 01:01:28,457
what was in his heart
was not in mine.

553
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:30,925
The word of my father was given,
but not my word.

554
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:34,430
But American Horse thinks I stole you.
He came here. He tried to kill me.

555
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,431
And now they've locked him
in the stockade.

556
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:40,367
American Horse was wrong
to do this. I have chosen.

I will stay here.

This is where I will make my life.

559
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:51,714
Bundle her up
and I'll take her back to her people.

560
01:01:51,781 --> 01:01:54,147
I have no people.

561

I told my father.

Now I am dead to all of them.

01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:15,045
What do I need with a rifle?

777
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:18,108
I throw it away.

778
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,381
I do not need it.

779
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:38,596
American Horse has shamed us
before the white man.

780
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:41,403
Little Dog will not do so.

781
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:59,058
Pick up your gun, Tanner.

782
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:02,358
You will pick up your gun
or I will throw mine away also...

783
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,922
and we will fight before
them all to the death.

784
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,969
- A scalp to the winner.
- <i>[ Appearing Day ] Little Dog.!</i>

785
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:20,312
You asked for death for yourself,
and that is your right...

786
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,077
but to pronounce it
on others is wrong.

787
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:26,609
He has always spoken with
one heart and one tongue...

788
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,814
and he has been faithful
to your friendship.

789
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:32,018
<i>Can you not be as faithful to him?</i>

01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:04,747
Here he comes.

793
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:17,632
Bring him down!

Ho!

797
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:21,206
Well, Mr. Tanner, it's all over.

798
01:40:21,282 --> 01:40:24,649
I think we've seen
the last of the Indian wars.

799
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:30,884
They'll be wanting to bury
their dead before they go.

<i>What about her?</i>
<i>She won't be going with them.</i>

No, she won't be.

802

She's going with me.

803
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,573
Appearing Day will be my wife.

- Thank you.
