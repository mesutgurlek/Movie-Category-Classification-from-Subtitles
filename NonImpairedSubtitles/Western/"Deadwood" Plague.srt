- BREATHE.

163
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,133
WE SHOULD CHAT
THIS ALL OUT.

164
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,167
SURE.

165
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,334
WHY DON'T WE DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER?

166
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:44,234
US AND SEVERAL OTHERS?

167
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,167
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

168
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,601

00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,300
THERE WE GO.

170
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,968
ALL RIGHT, LIE DOWN.

171
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,601

I BELIEVE I'D CUT DOWN
GETTING TOLD

173
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,501
HOW BUTT FUCKING
UGLY I WAS

174
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,834

175

SORRY-LOOKING CABIN
EVEN IN THIS SHITHOLE CAMP!

176

PASSERS-THROUGH HAS
A RIGHT TO MAKE INQUIRIES?

177
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,467

E.B.'S WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE KITCHEN.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,334
QUIT DRINKING A FEW HOURS.
WE'RE HAVING A GET-TOGETHER.

189
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,801
WHOM DO YOU MEAN?

190
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,033
BUY SOME FUCKING FRUIT
OR THE LIKE, HUH?

191

STRANGE WAS GOING ON.

192
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,968
ARE YOU PREPARED NOW
TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

193
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,501
IF THAT WIDOW WAS HIGH
I AM A MONKEY'S UNCLE.

194
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,834
HOW MUCH FRUIT?

195
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,234
HOW MANY'S A FUCKING
GET-TOGETHER?

196
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:01,067
NOW ONE THING I CAN
TELL YOU, JOHNNY...

197
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,367
RIGHT NOW AIN'T
A GOOD TIME TO ASK.

198
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,734
HI, AL.

199
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,434
YOU TOSS THE PLACE?

200
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,501
I KNOW WHAT'S
IN THIS ROOM.

201
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,534
HOW'S THE WIDOW?

202

YOU GIVING HER
THAT DOPE?

203
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,100
I GIVE IT
TO HER REGULAR.

204
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,033
AND SHE TAKES IT?

205
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,801
SHE GOES BEHIND
WHERE SHE DRESSES
TO SPARE THE CHILD SEEING.

206
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,634
WHEN SHE GOES BEHIND
WHERE SHE DRESSES TO SPARE
THE CHILD,

207
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,868
DO YOU SEE BILLOWS
OF DOPE SMOKE RISING?

208
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,701
SHE SAYS
SHE EATS IT.

209
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:41,067
- DOES SHE ACT HIGH TO YOU?
- I CAN'T BE SURE.

210
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,033
I NEVER SEEN
A RICH PERSON HIGH
BEFORE.

211
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,067
NEXT PIECE OF DOPE,
TRIXIE...

 <i>YOU GO BEHIND THE SCREEN</i>
 <i>WITH THE WIDOW.</i>

PUT IT IN HER MOUTH,

214
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,667
YOU WATCH HER SWALLOW.

215
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,601
AFTERWARDS, YOU LOOK
DOWN HER FUCKING YAP

216
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,200
AND YOU VERIFY
SHE'S GOT NOTHING

217
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,334
ABOVE OR BELOW
HER FUCKING TONGUE.

218
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,434
I'LL FIND
A GOOD REASON.

219
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,334
YOU BEING FUCKING
CLEVER WITH ME?

220
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,834
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT

221
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,300
AND NOT AROUSE
HER SUSPICION?

222
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,033
ONLY SUSPICION YOU
GOTTA WORRY ABOUT IS MINE

223

OF IF YOU'RE GIVING IT
TO HER AT ALL.

224
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,167
WHY WOULDN'T I?

225
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,901
I'D RATHER TRY TOUCHING
THE MOON THAN TAKE ON
A WHORE'S THINKING.

 <i>ONLY KNOW THIS, TRIXIE,</i>

THAT WIDOW BETTER
BE MUDDLEHEADED

228
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,801
NEXT TIME FARNUM
SEES HER OR YOU PAY.

229
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,300
- CAN I GO BACK?
- PLEASE.

230
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,033

232
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:10,501
- TRIXIE'S GONNA
MAKE SURE SHE DOES.
- GOOD.

233
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:13,133
YOU FIND PRETEXT

DO IT WITHOUT YOU, E.B.?

THE FUCKING WHORE?

314
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,701
YOU HAVE HIGH STANDARDS
AS APPLIED TO OTHER PEOPLE.

315
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,267
I AIN'T JUDGING ANYONE.
I WAS SEEKING INFORMATION!

316
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,067
WELL, ARE YOU
ADEQUATELY INFORMED?

317
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,801
YES, I AM,
YOU COCKSUCKER!

318
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:09,267
'CAUSE I AM
IN THE MIDST
OF A SITUATION.

319
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,033
OH, SMALLPOX?

320
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:20,968
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT TO YOU?

321
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:24,834
FELLA IN THE WOODS I SEE
TO SAY HELLO TO HAS IT.

322
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,901
UNLESS HE CAUGHT IT
FROM A TROUT.

323
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:30,467
I FIGURED SOME IN THE CAMP
COULD BE DOWN WITH IT, TOO.

324
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,434
WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN THE WOODS?

325
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,767
SOMEONE THREW HIM THERE.

326
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,767
ANYWAYS, HE'S BETTER NOW.

327
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,400
AND HOW DO
YOU FEEL?

328
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,534
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

329
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:42,167
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- WHY?

330
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,868
I TAKE IT THAT YOU'RE
FEELING WELL.

331
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,934
- AM I WRONG?
- NO, YOU'RE NOT
FUCKING WRONG!

332
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,968
THAT'S ALL I WANTED
TO FUCKING KNOW!

333
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,667
I WILL LAY YOU OUT
AS SOON AS LOOK AT YOU!

334

A GIFT FOR IT,

SICK PEOPLE UP TO MY HIPS,

340
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:12,667
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT
WANNA COME BACK TO CAMP.

341
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,334

392
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,734
JOEY WAS CHERRY.

HE DIDN'T WANT US
TO DO IT TILL HE KNEW HOW.

395
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,501

403
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,234
YES, SIR.

404
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,200
MAY I ASK
THE MEETING'S PURPOSE?

405
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,734
WELL, HE DON'T GET
INTO THAT WITH ME.

406
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,667
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

407

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,968
FINE.

411
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:48,167
THE THREE RED HANDS
ON THE PONY'S FLANK

412
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,400
WAS THREE MEN KILLED
HAND TO HAND.

413
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,300
THE RED CIRCLE WAS
ONE KILLED ON HORSEBACK.

414
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,234
THE WHITE LINES
ON THE PONY'S LEGS

415
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,367
WAS TIMES THAT HE'S
A'COUNTED COUP.

416
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,400
WITH THEM, WHETHER
YOU MEAN TO KILL YOUR MAN

417
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,234
AFTER OR YOU'RE JUST
SHOWING OFF,

418
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,801
YOU HIT 'EM WITH A GUN BUTT
OR A STICK OR A CLUB.

419
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,067
THAT'S COUNTING COUP.

420
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,033
THAT'S WHY HE COME
FOR YOU INSTEAD OF

421
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,367
PICKING YOU OFF WITH AN ARROW,
LIKE HE DID YOUR HORSE.

YEAH.

428
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:41,267

431
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,400
I WAS AFTER
THE BASTARD WHO DID IT.

432
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,200
ANYTHING BROKE?

433
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,234
NO.

434
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,934

435
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,400
YEAH.

436
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,501
LET'S GET
THAT COCKSUCKER.

437
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,968
WE SHOULD
DIG A GRAVE.

438
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:14,334
I'D AS SOON NOT WASTE
THE FUCKING TIME.

439

IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

440
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,267
YOU AIN'T DOING
HIM NO FAVOR.

441
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:26,000
I MEAN HIS WAY
TO HEAVEN'S ABOVE GROUND
AND LOOKING WEST!

442
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,734
WELL, LET'S
DO THAT, THEN.

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,767
DON'T YOU WANT TO TAKE
HIM OVER THE RIDGE?

444
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,467
THIS HOLE IN THE GROUND
AND PUT HIM UP THERE WITH
HIS HEADLESS BUDDY?

445
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,367

449

DOWN THE WIDOW'S MOUTH.

ON HER GOLD CLAIM?

452
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,167
