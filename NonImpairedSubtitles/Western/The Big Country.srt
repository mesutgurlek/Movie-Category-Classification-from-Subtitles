1
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:29,026
For those that are gonna go on,
one hour to eat, folks,

2
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,236
while we change the horses.

3
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,741
- Let me help you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

4
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:38,243
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

5
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,059
(whispers) Hey, look at that!

6
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,449
All right, Clint. Turn 'em around.

7
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,209
Mr. McKay?

8
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,128
Yes.

9
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:40,263
I'm Steve Leech,
foreman at Ladder Ranch.

10
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,058
I brought Pat's buckboard
and team for you.

11
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:45,310
She's waiting at a friend's house.

12
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,145
Thank you. That's very kind.

13
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,481
I was beginning to think
I was in the wrong town.

14
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,609
This your gear?

15
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,903
That's right.

16
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,994
I don't know as I'd wear that hat
too long around here, Mr. McKay.

17
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:06,122
Oh? Why not?

18
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:09,166
One of these wild cowboys
might take it into his head

19
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,460
to shoot it off ya.

20
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,630
Thank you, Mr. Leech.

21
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,433
How do you do, Mr. Leech?

22
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:30,354
Boys, don't you know to tip your hats
when the foreman of Ladder goes by?

23
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,157
Come on, let's get outta here.

24
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,962
Pat! Hello, Pat!

25
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,840
Jim!

26
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,558
Oh!

27
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,561
Darling, I can't believe
you're really here!

28
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,021
You don't know how long it's been!

29
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,898
Don't I, though!

30
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:17,568
If I'd known how much I'd miss you,
I'd have made you marry me in Baltimore.

31
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,362
- You haven't changed your mind?
- Do I act as if I had?

32
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,365
You must've wondered when
I wasn't at the hotel to meet you.

33
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:26,493
I declare, I wasn't gone
more than a minute!

34
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,914
We're gonna be a public scandal.

35
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,584
My hair's still not the way
I planned it.

36
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:37,545
And I know that my nose is red
from waiting in the sun

37
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,088
without a hat on.

38
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,091
I'm so glad to see you I could cry!

39
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:46,262
Thanks for bringing him to me, Steve.

40
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,224
You're welcome.
Anything else I can do for you?

41
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:52,268
No. If you're through in town,
go on back to Ladder.

42
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,438
- Not ride back with you?
- Oh, heavens, no!

43
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:58,066
We'll take our time.
We'd only hold you up.

44
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:01,444
The reason I mention it is that
the Hannassey boys are in town.

45
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:02,946
They've been drinkin'.

46
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:05,615
We'll be all right, Steve.

47
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,202
Just as you say, Miss Terrill.

48
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,454
Thank you, Mr. Leech.

49
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:21,130
- Well, who lives here?
- Shh!

50
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:26,427
My friend Julie Maragon.
She's the local schoolteacher.

51
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:30,056
- Am I still your girl?
- You'd better be.

52
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,562
All right, Julie, you can come out now.

53
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,065
I've finished kissing him,
for a minute or two.

54
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,445
Julie?

55
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,907
She's gone.

56
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,952
You know, I think I'm gonna like Julie.

57
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,166
Don't mind me, I'm just passing through.

58
00:07:57,334 --> 00:08:00,127
Oh, Julie, you idiot! Come on back here.

59
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,087
This is Jim.

60
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,172
Well, I certainly hope so.

61
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:05,340
(laughter)

62
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,301
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Julie.

63
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:10,137
Well, what do you think of him?

64
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:14,850
You don't look like a sailor.

65
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,979
- You don't look like a schoolmarm.
- I didn't say he was a sailor.

66
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:23,650
I said he was a ship's captain.
His family owns a whole shipping line.

67
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:29,197
But honestly, darling, you do look
funny out here in those clothes.

68
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:33,619
That's what Mr. , uh... Leech said
when he saw me in that hat.

69
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,243
Hey!

70
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,335
(bottle smashes)

71
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,340
(snoring)

72
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,440
(still snoring)

73
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:50,152
We shoulda stayed in town.

74
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,947
Got some girls and more liquor.

75
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,908
Maybe we got us somethin' better.

76
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:59,620
There's Pat Terrill and her eastern
dude.

77
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,291
Let's give him a welcome.

78
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,795
Cracker! Get up outta there.

79
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,341
Oh...

80
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:28,733
The Hannassey bunch.
Local trash. Keep on driving, Jim.

81
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,988
Looks like they want to talk.

82
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:37,825
Well, don't stop.
Go right on through 'em.

83
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,327
Yah! Yah!

84
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,425
Let's go after them.

85
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,934
Whoa, boy!

86
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,245
Whoa! Whoa!

87
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:44,390
Whoa, boy!

88
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,568
Whoa, boy! Whoa!

89
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,991
Yee-hah!

90
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,189
Yah!

91
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:41,239
(cowboys whooping)

92
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,965
Whoa! Whoa!

93
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,764
Howdy, Miss Terrill.

94
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:11,226
That wasn't very social back there.

95
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,563
Well! Whaddaya know?

96
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,149
We got a gentleman with us.

97
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,319
Don't it make you boys feel kinda
dirty...

98
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:25,157
... to look at such a handsome gentleman
all dressed up in a fancy suit?

99
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:28,827
Miss Terrill, ain't you gonna
introduce me to your intended?

100
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,663
I wouldn't introduce you to a dog.

101
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,085
The name is McKay.

102
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:40,839
Polite, too.

103
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,508
Neat, clean and polite.

104
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:48,805
I sure do like your hat.

105
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:52,184
(laughter)

106
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,813
(gunshots)

107
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:01,276
- All right, that's enough!
- Pat!

108
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,821
Oh! Jim!

109
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:11,036
Cut her off there, Rafe.

110
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,622
Look what I got!

111
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,874
Let me try that!

112
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,042
Yah!

113
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,264
- Hey, Buck, I got me a young one.
- Stop it! Let me out of here!

114
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,641
Yah!

115
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,935
Don't you lay a hand on him,
Buck Hannassey!

116
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,985
Give me that hat!

117
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,238
Ooh, Buck Hannassey!

118
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:53,369
Yah!

119
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,544
Don't you touch him! Don't you touch
him! You let me out of here!

120
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,879
All right. Turn him loose.

121
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:13,264
Miss Terrill, he ain't much of a man.

122
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:17,435
Better send him back
where he come from.

123
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:31,782
Jim, are you hurt, darling?

124
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,368
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

125
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:36,704
I'm all in one piece, I guess.

126
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:40,499
I'm so humiliated, having this
happen to you your first day here.

127
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:45,546
Don't worry about it. Greenhorns always
have to get knocked around a little.

128
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,465
Why did you take the rifle from me?

129
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:49,091
I didn't even know that you had a rifle.

130
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:50,468
Why did you take it?

131
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:54,221
Why? Well, I didn't think that
you really wanted to shoot anybody.

132
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:58,559
The Hannasseys! I'd just as soon
shoot 'em as look at 'em.

133
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,103
You don't mean that.
They were just showing off.

134
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,731
I didn't want to let it get serious.

135
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,943
Jim, you didn't think that was serious?

136
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,988
Not really, no.

137
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,324
Aren't you even angry?

138
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:15,617
No.

139
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,539
I wish you hadn't taken my rifle.

140
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:24,167
Well, it's over now.
We're both all right.

141
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,919
Hey...

142
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,509
Not very good shots, are they?

143
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,845
Or maybe this is a better hat
than I thought!

144
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:51,027
- Glad we're getting there.
- Oh, yeah. We'll be there before dark.

145
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:11,339
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm in a mood to go courtin'.

146
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:12,799
The schoolmarm?

147
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:16,636
How are your lessons comin'?
You gonna get promoted?

148
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:49,710
Oh!

149
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:51,753
Surprised you, didn't I?

150
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:54,590
You shoulda seen yourself!
You jumped like a shot deer!

151
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:58,427
- Knock before you come in!
- I knocked. You didn't hear me.

152
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,804
Well, don't come in until I hear you.

153
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,892
- What do you want?
- I just dropped by to see how you was.

154
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:07,769
You oughta keep your door locked.

155
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:08,937
Why?

156
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,356
Why, ma'am, a pretty woman livin' alone?

157
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,610
That's kind of a temptation
in a land of men.

158
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:22,034
That's soup, ain't it?

159
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:28,916
It's kind of thin. Don't stick to
your ribs like beef and beans.

160
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,628
But it ain't bad.
You're a good cook for a schoolmarm.

161
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,296
Thank you.

162
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:38,383
You know, Julie, I can just picture
us together out in the Big Muddy.

163
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,720
The lamp lit.
You cooking, me eating.

164
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,139
Happy as two little dogies
at a waterhole.

165
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:46,391
I'm enchanted.

166
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,979
That's another thing I like about you,
teacher. All them words you know.

167
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:55,234
And the way you sashay down
the street, smilin' when we meet.

168
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,319
Passin' a word or two.

169
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,321
You been leadin' me on, teacher!

170
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,116
You're crazy! I've been pleasant
to you, that's all.

171
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:05,160
You ain't foolin' old Buck.

172
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:08,038
By the way, I just stopped
to pass the time of day...

173
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:11,332
... with your high and mighty friend
Pat Terrill and her intended.

174
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,794
He sure is a dude.
That the kind of a man you want?

175
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:18,214
With a bow tie, a fancy hat
and no nerve to hold a gun?

176
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:21,300
That's enough, Buck Hannassey.
I think you'd better leave.

177
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,177
You know something, Julie?

178
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,805
If we was to join your Big Muddy
with our place...

179
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:27,890
... the Terrills'd dry up
like jimson weed.

180
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,141
Will you get out of here?

181
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,937
I talked it over with Pa.
He likes the idea.

182
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,647
So do I.

183
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:36,607
Let go of me!

184
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,609
You're scared, ain't ya?

185
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,611
I like a woman that's scared of me.

186
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,031
If a woman was to tell the truth,
she likes a man who scares her a little.

187
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,783
You must be drunk!

188
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,286
All right, teacher.

189
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:55,209
But, remember, the Terrills
ain't no friends of ours.

190
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,044
I'll choose my own friends.

191
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,840
No, that won't do. You gotta
be on one side or the other.

192
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:03,050
You can't have it both ways.

193
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:10,516
School's over for today, teacher.
But I'll be back.

194
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,067
(cock crows)

195
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:33,890
- Morning.
- Howdy.

196
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:39,938
- Howdy.
- Good morning.

197
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,314
Morning.

198
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:03,294
Buenos días, señor.

199
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,257
Buenos días.

200
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,634
(Spanish) My name is Ramón Gutiérrez.

201
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:11,928
How do you do? My name is McKay.

202
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,347
(Spanish) Pleased to meet you.
But I knew that.

203
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,183
Girls, this is Mr. McKay,

204
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:21,438
who is going to marry Miss Patricia.

205
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:24,231
Buenos días.

206
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:28,527
Tell me, how many head of cattle
do you have here?

207
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:33,157
(Spanish) Oh, ten thousand...
twenty thousand, forty thousand,

208
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,366
fifty thousand...

209
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:37,786
Cattle are not important to me.
You speak Spanish?

210
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,289
No. I understand you, though.
Perfectly.

211
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,541
Oh, very good!

212
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,130
- Mornin'.
- Morning, Mr. Leech.

213
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,843
- You care to go ridin' this mornin'?
- Yes, I'd like to very much.

214
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:55,554
Ramón, saddle up
a good horse for Mr. McKay.

215
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,347
Yes, sir.

216
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,309
How well do you ride?

217
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,562
Oh, I've ridden some in the East.
Different saddle, though.

218
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,356
If you can sit one saddle,
you can sit 'em all.

219
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,901
Ramón, put him up on Old Thunder.

220
00:23:13,364 --> 00:23:15,407
Right over here.

221
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:45,562
Any time you're ready.

222
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:06,249
Nice day, isn't it?

223
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,801
Well?

224
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,599
Some other time, Leech.

225
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:31,107
Whoa! Whoa!

226
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:37,446
We got a chuck-wagon horse
down at the big barn.

227
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,157
- Morning, Jim.
- Morning, Major.

228
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,835
Mornin', Major.

229
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,921
The boys always try to put
a stranger on Old Thunder.

230
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,799
- Sort of a standing joke.
- I see.

231
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:00,344
What time do you want to start, Major?

232
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:03,306
Any time. Just let me know
when you're ready.

233
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:05,349
Have some breakfast with me, Jim.

234
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:09,687
My daughter's not an early riser,
as you'll soon discover.

235
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,528
Don't let anything
Steve Leech said bother you.

236
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,615
He doesn't bother me.
I seem to bother him.

237
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:23,451
Steve's a little rough,
but he's a fine boy.

238
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:24,785
Turned up as a tow-headed youngster...

239
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:28,873
... with just the clothes he stood in and
the horse he rode. A saddle tramp at 14.

240
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:33,044
Now I doubt if there's a finer
foreman in this entire country.

241
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:35,629
I raised him, made a man of him.

242
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:36,880
I see.

243
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:41,009
Jim, I'm glad to have this chance
to talk to you alone.

244
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:44,012
I know Patricia's impulsiveness.

245
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,224
Frankly, I feared an elopement
back there in Baltimore.

246
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:52,062
I owe it to you that I'm to have
the pleasure of seeing her married here.

247
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:55,231
I owe it to you that I'll have
the privilege of marrying

248
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,733
a very exceptional girl.

249
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,069
I thought we ought
to do this thing properly.

250
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,321
We'll do our best to oblige.

251
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:06,534
- What are your plans for the future?
- A little vague at the moment.

252
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:09,829
If it's romance you're after,
you certainly can find it here.

253
00:26:09,997 --> 00:26:13,375
No prettier sight in the world than
10,000 head of cattle,

254
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:14,709
unless it's 50,000.

255
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,420
And we can have that many one day, too.

256
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:20,590
This country's as big as the sea, Jim.

257
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:23,426
And offers a man the same challenge.

258
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:25,512
I can see that.

259
00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:28,098
Oh, Major...

260
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:32,686
... Pat tells me that you're something
of an authority on weapons.

261
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,691
I thought you might
like to have these.

262
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,693
Duelling pistols.

263
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:42,779
Now this is mighty kind of you, Jim.

264
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:46,574
They're just about the finest
I ever saw.

265
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:48,618
Wonderful!

266
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,706
Wonderful balance.

267
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,459
Made by John Nock of London.

268
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,628
None better.

269
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,798
They've been used.

270
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,092
Yes, they belonged to my father.

271
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,302
Oh...

272
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:10,222
Jim, I know how proud
you are of his memory.

273
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:15,644
We loved him, Major. We were just
as proud of him when he was alive.

274
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:20,649
A man's honour and his good name
are his finest possessions.

275
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:24,653
I agree, but his good name
needed no defence...

276
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:27,239
... and his honour was beyond question.

277
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,826
You know, no one remembers exactly
what that last duel was about.

278
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:36,623
Here in the West, Jim, a man
is still expected to defend himself.

279
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:41,837
If he allows people to think he won't,
he's in trouble. Bad trouble.

280
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:44,506
You're speaking about
what happened yesterday?

281
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,635
I'm not implying any criticism, Jim...

282
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:51,764
... but your gentlemanly forbearance
is misplaced...

283
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:55,100
... when you're dealing with
the Hannasseys.

284
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:57,978
Well, I can't say that I enjoyed it,

285
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:01,648
but I've gone through rougher hazing
in college and at sea.

286
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:05,861
I was keelhauled the first time
I crossed the equator.

287
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:10,324
Well, perhaps you did the right thing...
Pat being there.

288
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:14,912
I don't know that I would've acted
differently if she hadn't been.

289
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,999
They weren't dangerous, just drunk.

290
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,210
I've run into Hannasseys
in ports all over the world.

291
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:23,837
That's where you're wrong, Jim!

292
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:28,175
The Hannasseys are trash. There's
no other word for it. They're trash.

293
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:31,553
They're as prolific as animals
and they live like animals.

294
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:34,640
Rufus, the head of the clan,
is something out of the Stone Age.

295
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:37,893
They live like a pack of wild dogs
up in Blanco Canyon.

296
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,229
The eldest of the litter, Buck,
you've met.

297
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:44,066
They're a pest, a plague.
Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

298
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,900
It'd be a blessing for this country...

299
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:50,238
... if a flood would wipe them
off the face of the earth.

300
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,535
Good morning!

301
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:02,917
Oh, I overslept,
and on your first morning, too!

302
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:07,755
You look...

303
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,056
I thought I was up early
until I went out walking.

304
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:19,851
Oh, no, on Ladder
the people wake up the roosters.

305
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:22,603
- Morning, darling.
- Pat, darling.

306
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,730
Oh, what's this?

307
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:27,024
Ugh! Pistols and coffee.

308
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:29,443
I'll have coffee, Pedro.

309
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,445
What have you two been up to?

310
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:34,240
You don't know each other
well enough to fight a duel.

311
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,450
A gift from Jim.

312
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,370
We're about ready for you, Major.

313
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:40,955
Mornin', Pat.

314
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:42,915
Morning, Steve.

315
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:46,627
- Where are you off to?
- A little hunting expedition.

316
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:49,213
Good. Jim going with you?

317
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,884
No, I think perhaps
Jim would rather be with you.

318
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:55,761
- After all, he just arrived.
- Oh. Of course.

319
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,680
I'll get a gun, Steve.
Be right with you.

320
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,140
Yes, sir.

321
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:04,145
Well, you and I'll ride out and
survey the family acres, darling.

322
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:05,813
All right.

323
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,483
I don't believe Mr. McKay
cares much for horses.

324
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:14,238
Don't tell me they got you on
Old Thunder this morning.

325
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,823
Well, they tried.

326
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:20,161
Mr. McKay said "Some other time",
whatever that means.

327
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,163
It means some other time.

328
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:26,291
Oh, darling, everybody
tries to ride Old Thunder.

329
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,252
- They do? Why?
- Why?

330
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,756
I don't know. They just always do.

331
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:34,966
What are you hunting today, Mr. Leech?

332
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,052
Hannasseys.

333
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:08,708
Pat... Didn't you tell the major that
there was no real trouble yesterday...

334
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:11,211
... until you reached for that rifle?

335
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:14,881
No. I don't think it would have
made any difference.

336
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:17,717
You can tell him if you want to.

337
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,893
(horses approaching)

338
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:10,019
You're actually gonna shoot somebody
because of what happened yesterday?

339
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,771
No. Just teach 'em a little lesson.

340
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:17,359
Major, I don't want to be
the cause of any further trouble.

341
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,738
You'd be doing me a great favour
if you forget the whole thing.

342
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,698
Forget it?

343
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:26,452
When a guest can't come to my house
without being attacked by rowdies...

344
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,287
... it's time something was done
about it.

345
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:31,206
Jim, the major is doing
what he thinks is right.

346
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:33,125
He knows how to handle these people.

347
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:36,754
- I was the one who was knocked around.
- Come with us, then.

348
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:40,007
We'll cut Buck Hannassey out for you
and you can settle with him yourself.

349
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:45,262
There's nothing to settle.
Not this way, anyway.

350
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,638
Now look, Jim...

351
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:50,142
... what you don't realise is that the
nearest law is at the county seat,

352
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,060
200 miles away.

353
00:32:51,227 --> 00:32:53,812
You can't call a policeman.
You have to be your own law.

354
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,941
That may be so, but nothing happened
to justify this kind of a war party.

355
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,444
You're new here and you
don't know this country.

356
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,238
You'll just have to trust my judgment.

357
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:08,452
Major, you're riding on the Hannasseys
for reasons of your own...

358
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,456
... not because of anything
that happened to me.

359
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:36,366
Go on this side.

360
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,878
Where's Rufus?

361
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,548
He ain't here. What do you want?
What are you doin' here?

362
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:53,465
Where is he?

363
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:57,011
Three Wells, and he ain't gonna
take it good, you ridin' in here.

364
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:57,886
Where's Buck?

365
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:01,223
I don't know. In Rafael, maybe.
Anyway, he ain't here.

366
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:04,685
- See if she's lying, Steve.
- Jessy! Come here.

367
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,688
Search every one of these shacks.

368
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:09,898
You stay out of this house!

369
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,570
(cowboys whooping)

370
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,507
I hope you're enjoying yourself, Major!

371
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:49,646
He's not in there.

372
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:52,191
(gunshots)

373
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:59,907
You want that, Major?

374
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,284
Let 'em have their fun.

375
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,462
You look mighty fine
on your horse, Major Terrill...

376
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,091
... but someday somebody's
gonna pull you off.

377
00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:21,135
Tell Rufus, the next time
I'll burn the place to the ground.

378
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:30,436
- Buck ain't around here, Major.
- We looked all over. Cain't find him.

379
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:57,338
(horse whinnies)

380
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,698
Ramón.

381
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,244
Yes, Mr. McKay?

382
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:30,621
Uh...

383
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes?

384
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,004
(horse whinnies)

385
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,890
No.

386
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:55,730
- Come on.
- No...

387
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:58,148
- Come on!
- No!

388
00:39:58,316 --> 00:39:59,941
No...

389
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,147
I'll give you some help, Ramón.

390
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,108
- (horse neighs)
- ¡Te voy a pegar!

391
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,154
Una...

392
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:47,280
Dos...

393
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:48,907
¡Tres!

394
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:59,417
Why you want to ride him now,
if you don't ride him before?

395
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:00,710
Hey!

396
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:09,094
Don't ask me why, Ramón.

397
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:10,971
But, Ramón, whatever happens...

398
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:15,392
... this is strictly between you and me,
and the horse. Right?

399
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,228
But... maybe if the señorita...

400
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:22,691
Even the señorita.
No one must know. All right?

401
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,651
All right.

402
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,348
- Any advice?
- Yes.

403
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,394
Don't do it!

404
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,354
Thanks.

405
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,371
Cast off. I'm aboard.

406
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,062
No. No.

407
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,055
Pig!

408
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,142
Pig! I hope they get you!

409
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,428
Here's one of 'em. They've been
braggin' about it all over town.

410
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,722
Where are the others?

411
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,060
Well, there's Rafe.

412
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,438
That's two of 'em.
Now there's Blackie...

413
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,567
- Don't forget Buck.
- I'm not forgettin' Buck.

414
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,444
What you gonna do with us, Major?
We didn't mean no harm.

415
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,613
We were just havin' a little fun.

416
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:32,371
What do you think you're doin' here?
You got no call to treat us like this!

417
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:36,417
Pick him up.

418
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,170
Where's Buck?

419
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:42,798
- Where's Buck?!
- He lit out early this mornin'!

420
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,968
He's probably halfway
to the canyon by now!

421
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,557
What you gonna do with us?
We didn't mean no harm!

422
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,310
(Rafe) Shut up! Don't crawl to him!

423
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:56,145
There are women and children here.

424
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,147
Take them down to the livery stable.

425
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,399
Let's go.

426
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,157
(Rafe) You wait till Rufus hears about
this!

427
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,826
You ain't gonna feel so damn big then!

428
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,038
We didn't hurt Miss Terrill
or the dude none.

429
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:16,332
Let us go!

430
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,836
You gonna let 'em get away with this?!

431
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,883
You gonna let 'em ride into town
and take it over like they owned it?!

432
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:18,726
(neighing)

433
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:34,885
Whoa, boy.

434
00:49:58,618 --> 00:50:01,661
¡Mucho! ¡Bravo!

435
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:04,289
¡Arriba los buenos jinetes!

436
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:16,009
(punching and groaning)

437
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,646
That's enough, Steve.

438
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:31,108
- Let's go.
- All right, Major.

439
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:33,151
Good day, Mr. Griggs.

440
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:26,912
We're civilised now, Mr. McKay.
I hope you'll stay around.

441
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,164
I'm thinking about it.

442
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:31,709
There's plenty of room out here.
It's a big country.

443
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:34,378
Rope him and hogtie him, Henry!

444
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:44,305
- Major...
- Jim, about what happened this morning.

445
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:45,931
I know exactly how you feel.

446
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,517
I don't like violence one bit
better than you do.

447
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:51,103
What we did today had to be done.

448
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:55,274
I've tried my hand at talking to the
Hannasseys and it just doesn't work.

449
00:51:55,442 --> 00:52:00,112
Jim, just stand on what I tell you.
Let's close the book on it.

450
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,574
It's gonna be a great evening
for you and Patricia.

451
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:09,079
Julie, my dear.
Now the evening can begin.

452
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:13,042
Jim, if I were 20 years younger,
this would be the girl for me.

453
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,170
- Make it ten. You've met, haven't you?
- Yes, indeed.

454
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:19,798
- Julie was my welcoming committee.
- The best horse trader in this country.

455
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:23,344
Major, I just walked in! You can't be
starting on Big Muddy so soon!

456
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:28,891
Listen to that girl! I've offered her a
bale of money every year for that ranch.

457
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,811
Maybe she's like you: She considers
money a corrupting influence.

458
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:34,897
Where's Pat?
Oh, don't tell me. I know.

459
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:38,150
She's waiting till everyone's here
so she can make a grand entrance.

460
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,070
- Well, everyone's here.
- I'll see what I can do.

461
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:44,614
Julie, I promise, not another word
about Big Muddy...

462
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:47,825
- Good.
- Until we have a glass of champagne.

463
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:51,120
(knock at door)

464
00:52:51,288 --> 00:52:53,122
Come in.

465
00:52:56,669 --> 00:53:00,171
- Gracias, Esperanza.
- Por nada, señorita.

466
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:30,159
Oh, Jim, I love you.

467
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:34,330
I've been so miserable
every minute without you.

468
00:53:35,874 --> 00:53:38,543
What have you been doing all day?

469
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:42,463
Oh, I just sort of poked around
the ranch and said howdy.

470
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:43,715
Then I...

471
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:47,885
I... sort of got the feel of the
country.

472
00:53:50,806 --> 00:53:53,141
Everybody's waiting
for you downstairs.

473
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:55,518
Good. That's just what I intended.

474
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:03,067
Hey, you all!

475
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,404
(applause)

476
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:33,597
You've already met Jim, so there's
no need for an introduction.

477
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,934
My daughter Pat was born
and raised among you.

478
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:42,439
When she made her trip East, I had no
idea she'd meet the man of her choice.

479
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:46,526
And I want you to know that
I heartily approve of that choice.

480
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:50,447
And so I say welcome, Jim McKay.

481
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:54,451
Welcome to Ladder,
to this state, and to this house.

482
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:55,577
Thank you, Major.

483
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:03,043
Here you are, Jim. It's your party.

484
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:08,465
(? waltz)

485
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:49,089
May I?

486
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:50,966
Certainly.

487
00:56:01,184 --> 00:56:03,769
You're hurting my hand, Steve.

488
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:10,943
Well, Mr. McKay,
how do you like this country?

489
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:12,528
I like it very much.

490
00:56:12,696 --> 00:56:15,281
Did you ever see anything so big?

491
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:17,533
Well, yes.

492
00:56:18,118 --> 00:56:21,537
- You have? What?
- A couple of oceans.

493
00:56:22,205 --> 00:56:24,290
Well, I declare!

494
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:27,501
Excuse me.

495
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:32,381
- May I have the pleasure, Major?
- Certainly, Jim.

496
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:33,716
Thank you, Julie.

497
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:40,431
Well? How do you like the major?

498
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:42,725
I'm not marrying the major.

499
00:56:44,478 --> 00:56:46,562
Oceans... huh!

500
00:56:48,106 --> 00:56:51,317
May I have the privilege of dancing
with my beautiful daughter?

501
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:54,487
- I reckon you've got a right, Major.
- Thank you.

502
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:57,740
I still think you're the
handsomest man in this room.

503
00:56:57,908 --> 00:57:02,077
You know what makes it nice?
I think my little girl really means it.

504
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:05,539
Happy?

505
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:08,083
Happy as you should be tonight?

506
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:10,085
Almost.

507
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:12,338
Almost?

508
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:19,011
What'll I do if he decides
not to settle here?

509
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:22,932
I don't think I could stand
being away from you.

510
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:25,309
Don't you worry about that.

511
00:57:25,477 --> 00:57:27,811
I'll make a Terrill out of him yet.

512
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:29,647
(? polka)

513
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:16,025
(music stops)

514
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,834
What do you want, Hannassey?

515
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:36,671
I'm just payin' back the call you and
your men made on my home this mornin'.

516
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:40,174
Sorry I wasn't there
to give you the proper welcome.

517
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:41,718
Let him speak his piece.

518
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,219
Take it easy, boy.

519
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:48,016
I've got me somethin'
to say. It's about 30 years overdue.

520
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:52,854
It's a mighty fine house, Major Terrill.

521
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,565
Gentleman's house.

522
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,611
Them's mighty fine clothes
you're wearin'.

523
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:06,200
Maybe you got some of these folks
fooled, but you ain't got me fooled.

524
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:10,662
The Hannasseys know and admire
a real gentleman when they see one.

525
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,541
And they recognise a high-toned
skunk when they smell one.

526
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:21,298
Now I'm not here complainin'
about 20 of your brave men...

527
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:24,676
... who beat three of my boys
till they couldn't stand.

528
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:26,386
Maybe they had it comin'.

529
00:59:26,554 --> 00:59:30,349
Anyways, they're full growed
and can take their lickin's.

530
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:32,392
And I'm not here complainin'

531
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,104
because I know you're tryin'
to buy the Big Muddy...

532
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,899
... to keep my cows from water.

533
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,401
It galls me sore to see

534
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:44,696
the granddaughter of
a gentleman like Clem Maragon...

535
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,239
... under this roof.

536
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:49,242
I'll tell you why I'm here, Major
Terrill!

537
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,995
When you come a-ridin' roughshod
over my land...

538
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:54,414
... scarin' the kids and the
womenfolks...

539
00:59:54,582 --> 00:59:56,625
... when you invade my home...

540
00:59:56,793 --> 01:00:00,337
... like you was the law or God
Almighty...

541
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:02,756
... then I say to you...

542
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:06,176
... I've seen every kind of critter
God ever made...

543
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,679
... and I ain't never seen
a meaner, lower,

544
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,306
more stinkin' yellow hypocrite
than you!

545
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,643
You can swallow up a lot
of folks and make 'em like it...

546
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,395
... but you ain't swallowin' me!

547
01:00:16,562 --> 01:00:20,273
I'm stuck in your craw, Henry Terrill,
and you can't spit me out!

548
01:00:20,441 --> 01:00:22,025
Ya hear me now?

549
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:25,779
You rode into my place
and beat my men for the last time.

550
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:30,409
And I give you warnin'. You set foot
in Blanco Canyon once more...

551
01:00:30,576 --> 01:00:35,622
... and this country's gonna run red with
blood till there ain't one of us left.

552
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:40,502
Now, I don't hold mine so precious,
so, if you want to start, here!

553
01:00:41,629 --> 01:00:43,671
Start now.

554
01:00:58,186 --> 01:01:00,146
What's the matter?

555
01:01:00,897 --> 01:01:03,232
Can't ya shoot a man a-facin' ya?

556
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,703
I'll make it easy for ya.

557
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,497
Here's my back!

558
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:45,191
(door slams)

559
01:01:48,528 --> 01:01:50,613
(horse gallops off)

560
01:01:56,036 --> 01:01:59,038
Well! He certainly said a beardful.

561
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:05,169
If there's anything I admire
more than a devoted friend,

562
01:02:05,337 --> 01:02:06,712
it's a dedicated enemy.

563
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:10,007
But I must apologise
for this interruption,

564
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:13,761
for Mr. Hannassey's bad manners.

565
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:16,055
Please don't let it spoil your evening.

566
01:02:16,223 --> 01:02:20,058
I promise you that this sort of thing
will never happen again.

567
01:02:20,226 --> 01:02:21,768
Music!

568
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:25,647
(? polka)

569
01:02:26,816 --> 01:02:29,150
Well, Jim, now you see what I mean.

570
01:02:29,318 --> 01:02:31,402
Let's have a glass of punch.

571
01:02:33,322 --> 01:02:36,366
With a savage like that,
it's dog eat dog.

572
01:02:39,578 --> 01:02:40,745
Excuse me.

573
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,493
(cock crows)

574
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:30,753
The old man's lookin' for ya.

575
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:08,373
You want me, Pa?

576
01:04:10,418 --> 01:04:12,502
Before you was born, I did.

577
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:19,676
Come here!

578
01:04:20,178 --> 01:04:24,514
Don't you dare look at me like that,
boy. I'll take your hide off!

579
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:27,768
Who asked you to go roughin' up
old Terrill's son-in-law?

580
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:30,270
You said to keep pushin' the Terrills...

581
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:33,357
You push 'em when I say so,
when I'm ready.

582
01:04:33,524 --> 01:04:36,693
They come a-hellin' in here, shootin' up
the place when I'm not around.

583
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:40,739
- I never knowed nothin' like that...
- You never knowed nothin' ever!

584
01:04:40,907 --> 01:04:43,200
Where you been all night?

585
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,746
I paid a visit to my schoolteacher.

586
01:04:48,706 --> 01:04:51,208
You're a liar. She was at Terrill's.

587
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:54,962
I seen her before.
We were sparkin' and kissin'!

588
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:58,715
Julie Maragon's a lady.

589
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:01,468
Maybe, but she's sweet on me, Pa.

590
01:05:09,227 --> 01:05:13,397
Could it be there's a side to you
that I ain't never seen?

591
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:17,693
You ain't lyin' to me again,
are you, boy?

592
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:20,153
Ain't no cause to lie.

593
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:24,574
Maybe I'm smarter'n you think, Pa.
Don't forget, she owns Big Muddy.

594
01:05:24,742 --> 01:05:26,827
I ain't forgettin' that.

595
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,248
That'd be somethin', boy,
if you was to marry Julie Maragon.

596
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:35,251
That'd be a miracle sure enough.

597
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:41,090
Keep after her. Be nice.

598
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:44,343
Stop womenin' around in Rafael.

599
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:46,470
Treat her right.

600
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,931
Take a bath sometime.

601
01:05:54,438 --> 01:05:59,108
Maybe we got us somethin' here
that'll snuff old Terrill out for good.

602
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:03,487
Treat her right, ya hear me?

603
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:06,657
- Right, I said!
- Yeah, Pa. I will.

604
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:18,878
Look, there's the mountain behind here.

605
01:06:19,963 --> 01:06:23,632
But it's too dangerous
to ride alone. You get lost.

606
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,011
- You ever seen a compass?
- Yeah, sure!

607
01:06:29,306 --> 01:06:31,807
Oh, what a funny watch!

608
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:36,771
A watch only tells the time. This tells
me where I'm going and how to get back.

609
01:06:36,938 --> 01:06:38,481
Not out here.

610
01:06:38,648 --> 01:06:40,733
Even out here.

611
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,318
Now don't forget, Ramón.

612
01:06:42,486 --> 01:06:45,654
You tell Pat and the major
that I may be out overnight.

613
01:06:45,822 --> 01:06:49,658
I've got everything I need,
and they shouldn't worry.

614
01:06:49,826 --> 01:06:51,702
All right.

615
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:06,401
Didn't you warn him
that he might get lost?

616
01:08:06,569 --> 01:08:11,781
Sure, I told him. And I told him
all the country was the same.

617
01:08:12,741 --> 01:08:14,993
Then how could you possibly let him go?

618
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:18,580
- He's pretty smart man.
- But he's a stranger here.

619
01:08:18,747 --> 01:08:22,917
- I don't think he get lost.
- And what makes you think he won't?

620
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:31,009
- Well, speak up.
- He say not to worry.

621
01:08:33,929 --> 01:08:36,389
He says he's coming back.

622
01:08:36,557 --> 01:08:39,934
And by the way, you know,
he's got a funny watch.

623
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:44,229
Ramón, you're an idiot.
Come on, show me the way he went.

624
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:54,198
How could Jim do a thing
like that to me?

625
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:57,117
He must be lost by now.

626
01:08:58,077 --> 01:09:02,164
Yeah. That'd be a real
sure enough shame.

627
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:06,043
Now wouldn't it?

628
01:09:15,303 --> 01:09:17,679
If you ever touch me again!

629
01:09:19,724 --> 01:09:22,809
What are you gonna do, Miss Terrill?
Sic your bridegroom on me?

630
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:24,645
You get out of here!

631
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:26,730
Don't worry, I'm goin'.

632
01:09:26,898 --> 01:09:30,692
I'll even get up a search party and
go find your wanderin' boy for ya.

633
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,236
He can have ya!

634
01:09:32,403 --> 01:09:35,948
I can see you two are just
plain made for each other!

635
01:09:43,248 --> 01:09:44,915
(door slams)

636
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:55,067
(McKay groans)

637
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,571
(sighs)

638
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:22,928
(horse neighs)

639
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:09,849
(boards creaking)

640
01:12:43,384 --> 01:12:45,510
Hold it right there!

641
01:12:48,389 --> 01:12:50,515
Put up your hands.

642
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,853
Turn around.

643
01:12:59,316 --> 01:13:01,234
Jim McKay!

644
01:13:01,402 --> 01:13:04,112
What in the world are you doing here?

645
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:07,615
Just haunting an old house, ma'am.

646
01:13:10,703 --> 01:13:13,037
You're too noisy for a ghost.

647
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:22,130
Where's Pat? Surely you're not
riding around here alone?

648
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:26,259
If you tell me this is a big country,
I'll be disappointed in you.

649
01:13:26,427 --> 01:13:29,929
But it is a big country. And you
shouldn't be wandering by yourself.

650
01:13:30,096 --> 01:13:32,890
People have gotten lost
out here, you know.

651
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:34,808
I had a map.

652
01:13:34,976 --> 01:13:39,229
You're either east or west of the river,
north or south of the road...

653
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:41,982
... and I had a compass.

654
01:13:42,358 --> 01:13:46,236
So, I just plotted a course
and navigated my way here.

655
01:13:46,404 --> 01:13:48,655
Well, welcome aboard, skipper.

656
01:13:50,283 --> 01:13:53,243
This must've been a fine
old house in its day.

657
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:57,498
People used to come from a hundred
miles to my grandfather's parties.

658
01:13:57,665 --> 01:14:02,085
I come out here when I can,
stay in that old cottage down there.

659
01:14:02,253 --> 01:14:05,589
Why don't you come down
and visit for a while?

660
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:07,841
I'll get my horse.

661
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:34,868
- No luck, huh?
- Not a sign of him, Major.

662
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:38,497
We covered every foot of ground
between here and the high range.

663
01:14:38,665 --> 01:14:41,542
What do you mean?
A man just doesn't disappear.

664
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:44,503
Have you tried?
Have you really tried?

665
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:48,840
We really tried, Miss Terrill.
We couldn't find him.

666
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,385
Then start out again, all of you.

667
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:54,179
Maybe he was thrown. He may be hurt.

668
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,474
Well, you don't just give up!

669
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:12,446
All right, we'll take
every man we can spare.

670
01:15:12,614 --> 01:15:16,659
I'll take a sweep out toward the canyon.
You head for the south boundary.

671
01:15:16,827 --> 01:15:18,953
You figure he'd be fool enough
to go there?

672
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:23,791
How do I know? If he's crazy enough to
ride out alone in a strange country...

673
01:15:25,002 --> 01:15:27,587
I don't understand this man, Steve.

674
01:15:30,215 --> 01:15:32,341
All right, let's go.

675
01:15:47,691 --> 01:15:50,276
- That was fine.
- More?

676
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,528
No, thanks. Nope.

677
01:15:52,863 --> 01:15:55,823
I didn't realise Buck Hannassey
was that rough on you.

678
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:58,701
In addition to Mr. Hannassey,
I had a little trouble with a horse.

679
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:02,204
- They put you on Old Thunder?
- That's the one.

680
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:04,415
That sounds like Steve Leech to me.

681
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:07,543
No, he's not to blame.
It was my own idea.

682
01:16:08,587 --> 01:16:12,298
He's a rough man, Steve. The whole
country's betting on what will happen...

683
01:16:12,466 --> 01:16:15,217
... when he and Buck Hannassey
finally fight.

684
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:17,845
I suppose you think
we're pretty uncivilised?

685
01:16:18,013 --> 01:16:18,763
No.

686
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,141
People laying bets as to which
of two men will kill the other?

687
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:26,520
On my last voyage a man fell overboard,
and while they were picking him up...

688
01:16:26,688 --> 01:16:29,899
... the crew was making bets
as to which would get to him first:

689
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:32,151
The lifeboat or the sharks.

690
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,905
What happened?

691
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:40,993
- Do you really wanna know?
- Sure.

692
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:47,040
It was hard to tell who won.
Both sides claimed the money.

693
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:49,125
Shall I go on?

694
01:16:49,293 --> 01:16:51,378
Go on.

695
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:56,424
The boat got the man,
but the sharks got the legs.

696
01:16:57,968 --> 01:17:02,097
They finally decided that more of him
was saved than was lost...

697
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:05,433
... and they settled the bets
accordingly.

698
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:08,269
Now let me tell you one.

699
01:17:08,437 --> 01:17:11,898
There was a Comanche massacre
right on this ranch in the early days.

700
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:18,279
They took the survivors and buried them
alive up to their necks. Shall I go on?

701
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:19,322
Go on.

702
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,616
In ant hills.

703
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:24,369
Red-ant hills.

704
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:28,415
(dramatic music)

705
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:54,858
Now what was the point of your story?

706
01:17:55,025 --> 01:17:56,693
Oh, you...

707
01:18:00,781 --> 01:18:03,366
How'd you like to show me around?

708
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,202
Do we ride or do we walk?

709
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:11,875
Mr. McKay, any ranch that you can see
on foot just isn't worth looking at.

710
01:18:21,676 --> 01:18:25,262
- Good pony you've got there.
- He's a good old fella.

711
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,681
- Belongs to Ramón Gutiérrez.
- Oh, Ramón!

712
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:30,476
- You know him?
- Sure, he used to work for us.

713
01:18:30,643 --> 01:18:32,686
Put me on my first pony.

714
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:35,439
Almost put me on my last!

715
01:18:40,862 --> 01:18:42,905
Well, here it is.

716
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:48,160
This is what makes Maragon
the best land in the state.

717
01:18:48,703 --> 01:18:51,455
A present from the king of Spain
to my great-grandfather.

718
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:56,418
- I hope you're properly impressed.
- Yes, ma'am. I certainly am.

719
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,395
Hey... Trout?

720
01:19:15,563 --> 01:19:17,648
No. Catfish.

721
01:19:22,487 --> 01:19:24,905
Tell me about this man Hannassey.

722
01:19:25,073 --> 01:19:28,617
The things he said at the party...
are they true?

723
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:32,496
Some of them are.

724
01:19:33,164 --> 01:19:36,500
During the dry season the Hannasseys,
and sometimes even the Terrills...

725
01:19:36,668 --> 01:19:38,961
... depend on Big Muddy for water.

726
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:44,007
Grandfather always gave them both
access to it whenever they needed it.

727
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:49,847
What would happen if you sold
the place to Major Terrill?

728
01:19:50,014 --> 01:19:51,807
It would mean bloodshed.

729
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:56,269
Major Terrill would refuse
to give water to the Hannasseys.

730
01:19:56,436 --> 01:20:00,565
I love this place, but sometimes
I wish I could get rid of it.

731
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:03,276
Old Rufus and the major hate each other.

732
01:20:03,443 --> 01:20:06,612
If either one of them were
to get control of Big Muddy...

733
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,615
... I'm afraid to think
of what would happen.

734
01:20:10,784 --> 01:20:13,244
What does it take to become a rancher?

735
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:18,457
Suppose a fellow like myself were to
settle out here... what would he need?

736
01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:21,294
Well, the land first, of course.

737
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:24,881
The beginning of a good cow herd,
couple hundred to start with.

738
01:20:25,048 --> 01:20:27,884
Good bulls, and about
a hundred miles of fence.

739
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:30,136
- Hundred miles?
- Well, this is a...

740
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:32,471
- Big country.
- Big country.

741
01:20:37,853 --> 01:20:40,313
You're serious, Jim.

742
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,648
What else would I need?

743
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:45,902
Top hands.

744
01:20:46,904 --> 01:20:50,281
A good foreman to run things for you
while you learn the ropes.

745
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:51,824
Uh-huh.

746
01:20:56,705 --> 01:21:00,082
- Jim, I can't sell Big Muddy to you.
- Why not?

747
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,669
Why not? Well, it would be same
as selling it to the Terrills.

748
01:21:04,004 --> 01:21:06,589
The name is McKay. James McKay.

749
01:21:06,757 --> 01:21:09,342
Will you sell Big Muddy to me,
Miss Maragon?

750
01:21:15,223 --> 01:21:17,350
I'll pay you whatever it's worth.

751
01:21:17,517 --> 01:21:21,604
As far as I'm concerned, the Hannasseys
can take water whenever they need it.

752
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:24,106
That goes for the Terrills, too.

753
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:29,070
Maybe I can keep the peace, if I'm
living here and working the place.

754
01:21:30,488 --> 01:21:32,572
How about it?

755
01:21:33,366 --> 01:21:36,201
Pat always did love this place.

756
01:21:37,244 --> 01:21:39,537
Well then?

757
01:21:40,748 --> 01:21:44,292
And it would be a wonderful
wedding present, Jim.

758
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,671
That's right. And you wouldn't
really be losing the place.

759
01:21:47,838 --> 01:21:50,966
If it's ours, in a way it's still yours.

760
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:19,244
All right.
You've bought yourself a ranch.

761
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:34,592
You're a very persuasive man, Mr. McKay.

762
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:39,097
Let's head back and draw up a paper
before I change my mind.

763
01:23:34,903 --> 01:23:36,570
(yawns)

764
01:23:52,587 --> 01:23:55,172
I don't know where else to look.

765
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:58,175
We'll try it again at first light.

766
01:24:04,015 --> 01:24:05,349
Hey.

767
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:27,955
Don't shoot, boys. I'll come peaceable.

768
01:24:35,088 --> 01:24:38,882
If that's coffee,
I wouldn't mind having a little.

769
01:24:45,097 --> 01:24:47,890
You fellows on a roundup?

770
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:49,475
Roundup?

771
01:24:49,643 --> 01:24:52,103
We've been looking for you
since yesterday.

772
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,564
Where you been, anyway, McKay?

773
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,859
I reckon you're the last man
can answer that.

774
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,821
Been out shopping,
for a wedding present.

775
01:25:01,989 --> 01:25:04,949
You can joke about it now,
but you get yourself lost out here...

776
01:25:05,117 --> 01:25:08,161
... and I gotta keep men out
ridin' their backsides off all night.

777
01:25:08,328 --> 01:25:10,413
I wasn't lost.

778
01:25:10,664 --> 01:25:14,333
You know the major was out himself
tryin' to trail you?

779
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:17,420
Hey, Shorty, you and Waco
go on back to Ladder.

780
01:25:17,588 --> 01:25:20,089
Tell Miss Terrill we've found him.

781
01:25:21,592 --> 01:25:25,970
Tell her we'll bring him in easy
as soon as he's rested up.

782
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:28,639
Douse that fire.

783
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:46,699
Hello, Pat.

784
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:49,911
Jim!

785
01:25:51,788 --> 01:25:54,790
Oh, Jim, we've been
out of our minds with worry!

786
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:58,336
- I'm sorry. You shouldn't have been.
- Thank heavens you're safe!

787
01:25:58,503 --> 01:26:01,130
I was all right all the time.
Didn't Ramón tell you?

788
01:26:01,298 --> 01:26:02,340
Well, sure, but...

789
01:26:02,507 --> 01:26:06,135
Jim McKay, do you mean
they've been out on a wild-goose chase?

790
01:26:06,303 --> 01:26:09,513
We've been driving ourselves
crazy for nothing?

791
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:12,642
Getting lost out here can be
dangerous business, Jim.

792
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:15,019
It's happened to people
who've lived here all their lives.

793
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:17,270
But I wasn't lost, Major.

794
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:20,482
(Steve) And I say you were lost.

795
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:23,318
What were you doin' for
two days and two nights?

796
01:26:23,486 --> 01:26:26,029
Just ridin' around for pleasure?

797
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:30,533
Mr. Leech, I knew exactly
where I was all the time.

798
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:32,494
You're a damn liar.

799
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:36,790
You were the lostest-lookin' thing
I've seen in ten years.

800
01:26:38,084 --> 01:26:40,418
If it's a fight you want...

801
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:43,880
... you've picked the right time for it.

802
01:26:45,675 --> 01:26:48,134
Haven't you?

803
01:26:48,302 --> 01:26:50,845
Yeah, I'm offerin' you a fight.

804
01:26:52,348 --> 01:26:54,516
Or ain't that a nice word back East?

805
01:26:58,604 --> 01:27:00,689
You're gambling, Leech.

806
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,695
You're gambling that
if we fight you can beat me.

807
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:11,366
And you're gambling that if you beat me
Miss Terrill will admire you for it.

808
01:27:11,534 --> 01:27:14,202
Out here we leave a lady's name
out of an argument.

809
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:17,289
But, since you brought it up,
let me tell you somethin'.

810
01:27:17,456 --> 01:27:21,042
I think you took advantage of Miss
Terrill when she was away from home.

811
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:24,963
You looked mighty big back there.
But not out here.

812
01:27:25,756 --> 01:27:28,550
You're just not good enough
for her, McKay.

813
01:27:28,718 --> 01:27:31,303
I aim to prove it. Right here.

814
01:27:37,977 --> 01:27:42,439
You aren't going to prove anything with
me, Leech. Get this through your head.

815
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:48,236
I'm not playing this game on your terms.
Not with horses, or guns, or fists.

816
01:29:02,644 --> 01:29:05,312
Don't you want to hear where I've been?

817
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,481
Why I went?

818
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:09,942
- Don't you want to hear from me...
- Who cares what you did?

819
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,986
You let him call you a liar.
I've never been so humiliated.

820
01:29:13,154 --> 01:29:17,157
- Calm down, Pat. There's no reason...
- Don't you care what people think?

821
01:29:17,325 --> 01:29:20,327
No, I'm not responsible
for what people think.

822
01:29:20,495 --> 01:29:22,579
Only for what I am.

823
01:29:23,164 --> 01:29:25,416
Don't you care what I think?

824
01:29:26,668 --> 01:29:29,419
Do you like to have people
think of you as a...

825
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:33,047
A coward. Why don't you say it?
Are you afraid of the word?

826
01:29:33,215 --> 01:29:34,924
I'm not.

827
01:29:35,092 --> 01:29:38,553
And I'm not gonna spend the rest of
my life demonstrating how brave I am.

828
01:29:38,804 --> 01:29:42,390
You've already demonstrated that
quite fully enough.

829
01:29:53,068 --> 01:29:54,944
Pat?

830
01:29:57,072 --> 01:30:00,074
I'll move into town
first thing in the morning.

831
01:30:01,368 --> 01:30:04,871
I think we both need
a little time to think this over.

832
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,833
I think that could be
a very fine idea. Good night.

833
01:31:12,647 --> 01:31:14,523
(knock at door)

834
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:18,735
(knocking)

835
01:31:18,903 --> 01:31:20,987
Yeah? Who is it?

836
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:56,982
You lost again?

837
01:32:02,029 --> 01:32:04,155
Huh?

838
01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:06,741
Just like before.

839
01:32:07,994 --> 01:32:10,328
I'll be leaving here
in the morning, Leech.

840
01:32:11,998 --> 01:32:13,415
Oh...

841
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,919
Yeah, that would figure, McKay.

842
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:21,006
I don't know why you thought
you had to come say goodbye.

843
01:32:22,174 --> 01:32:23,758
The goodbye that I have in mind

844
01:32:23,926 --> 01:32:27,220
will take a little more room
than we have in here.

845
01:32:39,775 --> 01:32:41,900
Well...

846
01:32:42,068 --> 01:32:46,071
We got maybe half a million acres
here on Ladder, Mr. McKay.

847
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,450
You just go pick out
any little spot that suits ya.

848
01:32:49,618 --> 01:32:51,452
I'll be right with ya.

849
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:54,663
I'd like this to be strictly between us.

850
01:32:54,831 --> 01:32:57,708
I can see how you'd feel that way.

851
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,210
All right.

852
01:33:28,615 --> 01:33:32,785
McKay, you're a bigger fool
than I thought you were.

853
01:33:32,952 --> 01:33:36,664
And, to tell you the truth,
that just didn't seem possible.

854
01:37:00,408 --> 01:37:01,908
Come on.

855
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:49,496
All I can say, McKay...

856
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:53,542
... is you take a hell of a long time
to say goodbye.

857
01:37:59,758 --> 01:38:03,385
I'm... just about finished...

858
01:38:05,305 --> 01:38:07,848
... if it's all right with you.

859
01:38:11,603 --> 01:38:13,896
It's all right with me.

860
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:35,918
Now tell me, Leech. What did we prove?

861
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:40,631
Huh?

862
01:39:40,149 --> 01:39:42,692
They're gettin' near the river, Steve.

863
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,777
All right, boys. Let's go.

864
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,280
Why are we doin' this, Steve?

865
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:52,952
- Why? Major's orders, that's why.
- I ain't sidin' with the Hannasseys...

866
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:57,957
... but... chasin' thirsty cattle away
from water just don't seem right.

867
01:40:03,213 --> 01:40:06,841
Look, cowboy, you'd be better off
if you just do what you're told...

868
01:40:07,009 --> 01:40:09,427
... and don't ask any questions.

869
01:40:20,564 --> 01:40:22,648
(cattle lowing)

870
01:40:28,947 --> 01:40:31,032
(horse whinnies)

871
01:40:32,242 --> 01:40:34,327
(cowboys whoop)

872
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:09,611
(gunshots)

873
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:11,863
(cowboys whooping)

874
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:56,950
This your stinkin' idea, Leech?

875
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:00,412
They pay you double
for this kinda dirty work?

876
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,081
You just run on back home
and tell your daddy...

877
01:42:03,249 --> 01:42:05,792
... he's watered his last steer
in the Big Muddy.

878
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,295
Yes, sir, I'll deliver that message.

879
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:12,757
And you run on back home
and shine up the major's boots!

880
01:42:28,064 --> 01:42:31,775
All right, let's spread out
along the river. Let's go!

881
01:42:42,829 --> 01:42:44,955
Why ain't you dead?

882
01:42:47,751 --> 01:42:51,503
You let 'em run my cows off
and you come back standin' up!

883
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:55,633
What could we do, Pa?
There was 20 of them. Just a few of us.

884
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,802
Them cows is worth more
than the whole lotta ya.

885
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:01,889
We gotta get 'em back to water, ya hear?

886
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:05,643
We gotta get 'em back, or they won't
last two days in this dry spell.

887
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,811
We'll get 'em back, Pa.

888
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:10,397
How? When? Next year?

889
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,858
We got to figure a way

890
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:16,695
to get them Terrill men away
from the Big Muddy right now!

891
01:43:21,076 --> 01:43:24,703
I ain't had any peace
since Clem Maragon died.

892
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,938
Go get that girl.

893
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:53,439
- Bring her here.
- Who? Julie Maragon?

894
01:43:53,607 --> 01:43:54,899
You just do as you're told.

895
01:43:55,067 --> 01:43:57,735
If she's sweet on you like you claim,
it'll be easy.

896
01:43:57,903 --> 01:44:00,780
If she ain't, drag her here by the hair.

897
01:44:02,157 --> 01:44:03,324
¡Viejito!

898
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:06,786
¡Señorita! Muy buenos días.

899
01:44:06,954 --> 01:44:08,371
How are you?

900
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:12,625
¡Qué linda! Glad to see you again!

901
01:44:13,085 --> 01:44:15,044
Is Miss Patricia home?

902
01:44:15,212 --> 01:44:17,255
Miss Patricia...

903
01:44:17,423 --> 01:44:20,758
I don't know. I didn't saw her today.

904
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:27,932
Something wrong, Ramón?

905
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:30,768
It's not a place to me to say it.

906
01:44:31,603 --> 01:44:37,275
- Not even to such an old friend?
- Oh, an old friend! Yes!

907
01:44:37,443 --> 01:44:41,404
But, you know, last night
was a big trouble here.

908
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,699
And Mr. McKay go away.

909
01:44:44,867 --> 01:44:49,412
To San Rafael or somewhere.
I don't know.

910
01:44:57,838 --> 01:44:59,464
Hello.

911
01:45:00,007 --> 01:45:03,092
Throw something off a chair
and sit down.

912
01:45:04,303 --> 01:45:06,804
Would you like to try a cigarette?

913
01:45:07,598 --> 01:45:09,265
Where'd you get those?

914
01:45:09,433 --> 01:45:12,393
In the East. Don't look so shocked.

915
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:14,771
I saw a woman smoking one.

916
01:45:14,938 --> 01:45:17,023
It's very elegant.

917
01:45:22,946 --> 01:45:26,574
Oh, well. I don't care
about anything, anyway.

918
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:29,785
All right, Patsy, what's wrong?

919
01:45:29,952 --> 01:45:32,704
Nothing. And you know
I detest that nickname.

920
01:45:32,872 --> 01:45:35,707
You have to know everything,
don't you?

921
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,667
I didn't mean to be inquisitive.

922
01:45:37,835 --> 01:45:40,587
Oh, for heaven's sake, sit down.

923
01:45:40,755 --> 01:45:44,257
I declare, some people
you can't insult at all...

924
01:45:44,425 --> 01:45:47,803
... and other people get in a huff
over the slightest thing.

925
01:45:50,348 --> 01:45:52,015
Oh, I'm sorry.

926
01:45:52,183 --> 01:45:55,394
I'm in such a state today
I don't know what I'm saying.

927
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:58,355
Well, are you going to tell me or not?

928
01:46:00,358 --> 01:46:03,485
Oh, Julie, he's not the man
I remembered.

929
01:46:07,073 --> 01:46:09,991
Well, he couldn't very well
bring his ship with him.

930
01:46:10,827 --> 01:46:14,287
What's going on here, Pat?
What's happened between you and Jim?

931
01:46:14,455 --> 01:46:17,082
Ramón said he went into town.

932
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:19,543
Yes. I sent him away.

933
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:23,422
For heaven's sakes, why, Pat?

934
01:46:23,589 --> 01:46:28,218
Well, because. He backed down
from Steve in front of everybody.

935
01:46:28,386 --> 01:46:29,803
Steve called him a liar
right to his face

936
01:46:30,596 --> 01:46:32,431
and he just stood there and took it.

937
01:46:32,598 --> 01:46:34,766
Why did he call him a liar?

938
01:46:34,934 --> 01:46:36,726
Jim said...

939
01:46:36,894 --> 01:46:38,854
What difference does it make?

940
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:42,691
The important thing is that Steve
said it and Jim refused to fight.

941
01:46:42,859 --> 01:46:46,570
It's just sort of the last straw.
It's been one thing right after another.

942
01:46:46,737 --> 01:46:51,575
Buck Hannassey beats him up on the road
and he refuses to do anything about it.

943
01:46:51,742 --> 01:46:52,909
Oh, well!

944
01:46:53,077 --> 01:46:57,289
But he wouldn't even get on Old Thunder
when the boys saddled him up for a lark.

945
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:02,294
Then just to stand there when Steve
called him a liar and not do anything...

946
01:47:02,462 --> 01:47:04,920
You say Jim wouldn't ride Old Thunder?

947
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:09,925
That's funny. He mentioned about
having trouble with a horse...

948
01:47:10,093 --> 01:47:11,469
I'll be right back.

949
01:47:11,636 --> 01:47:13,888
- Where are you going?
- To ask Ramón something.

950
01:47:14,055 --> 01:47:16,891
I know that he didn't ride him.
Everybody here knows it.

951
01:47:17,058 --> 01:47:19,393
The major was standing right there.

952
01:47:19,561 --> 01:47:23,439
You always think you know everything,
Julie, but this time you're wrong.

953
01:47:23,607 --> 01:47:25,733
Come on. Let's go find Ramón.

954
01:47:29,654 --> 01:47:30,988
Ramón.

955
01:47:32,115 --> 01:47:33,073
Yes?

956
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:35,993
Did Mr. McKay ride Old Thunder?

957
01:47:38,497 --> 01:47:41,665
No. I don't think so.

958
01:47:44,377 --> 01:47:47,338
Ramón, why did Mr. McKay
ask you not to tell anybody?

959
01:47:47,797 --> 01:47:50,508
I don't know. Maybe because he...

960
01:47:53,637 --> 01:47:55,221
That is no fair.

961
01:47:55,388 --> 01:47:57,806
I'm sorry, Ramón, but we had to know.

962
01:47:57,974 --> 01:47:59,683
So he did ride him?

963
01:47:59,851 --> 01:48:02,937
Oh, yes. He ride him himself.

964
01:48:03,104 --> 01:48:08,734
Old Thunder threw him down five,
ten times. I don't know how many.

965
01:48:09,194 --> 01:48:10,903
And he don't give up.

966
01:48:11,071 --> 01:48:13,113
But Old Thunder give up,

967
01:48:13,281 --> 01:48:18,494
and then he was walking like this,
like an old burro, you know.

968
01:48:23,959 --> 01:48:27,127
A man like him is very rare.

969
01:48:33,385 --> 01:48:34,426
Thank you, Ramón.

970
01:48:36,846 --> 01:48:39,138
You're welcome, señorita.

971
01:48:43,644 --> 01:48:47,605
If he was gonna ride the brute, why
didn't he do it when it meant something?

972
01:48:47,773 --> 01:48:50,483
Well, he did ride it when
it meant something to him.

973
01:48:50,651 --> 01:48:53,736
Obviously Mr. McKay
is afraid of only one thing:

974
01:48:53,904 --> 01:48:56,573
That people may suspect him
of showing off.

975
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:59,534
But if he loved me, why would he
let me think he's a coward?

976
01:49:01,495 --> 01:49:04,330
If you love him,
why would you think it?

977
01:49:05,958 --> 01:49:08,960
How many times does
a man have to win you?

978
01:49:11,505 --> 01:49:14,841
Well, I think it's a downright
deceitful way of acting.

979
01:49:15,009 --> 01:49:16,884
I'm glad he's gone.

980
01:49:17,845 --> 01:49:21,139
And you can go too if all you can
think to do is criticise me.

981
01:49:23,309 --> 01:49:25,685
The way you're sticking up for him...

982
01:49:25,853 --> 01:49:29,188
... a person might think you were
in love with him yourself.

983
01:49:30,274 --> 01:49:32,400
If you feel that way about him,
why don't you go after him?

984
01:49:32,568 --> 01:49:34,110
I'm sure I don't care.

985
01:49:35,571 --> 01:49:37,697
You fool!

986
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:40,074
The man loves you!

987
01:49:40,701 --> 01:49:44,203
While you were blaming him,
do you know what he was doing?

988
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:47,165
Buying Big Muddy for you
as a wedding present!

989
01:50:48,267 --> 01:50:50,310
(dog barking)

990
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:01,613
Hello, Jim.

991
01:51:04,617 --> 01:51:06,660
I've been looking for you.

992
01:51:08,121 --> 01:51:10,414
I wanted to talk to you
about the Big Muddy.

993
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:11,707
Oh.

994
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:15,043
I hoped I was free of
that problem for good.

995
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:20,257
I bought it on the understanding that
it would be a wedding present for Pat.

996
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:23,969
I don't want to keep it
under false pretences.

997
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:32,769
Jim, you're making a mistake
you're gonna regret.

998
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:36,356
I know Pat. She's generous, sensitive...
a little high-strung, maybe.

999
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:40,485
Once you get her... get her away
from her father's influence...

1000
01:51:40,653 --> 01:51:43,822
... she's got the makings
of a wonderful wife.

1001
01:51:46,868 --> 01:51:47,826
Well, it seems to me

1002
01:51:47,994 --> 01:51:51,203
that when a man uproots his life
and travels 2,000 miles...

1003
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:53,706
... he must be very much in love.

1004
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:57,334
How can you change your mind
after one silly misunderstanding?

1005
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:02,590
It goes much deeper than that.

1006
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:05,801
It's finished.

1007
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,806
I'm sorry.

1008
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:18,773
I guess I've been conducting a class on
something I don't know very much about.

1009
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:27,114
Pat's very lucky
to have you for a friend.

1010
01:52:31,953 --> 01:52:34,038
Now...

1011
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:38,626
- What about the Big Muddy?
- Do you want me to take it back?

1012
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:42,338
No, I want to keep it.
Work it. Build it up.

1013
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:49,553
I'd like to go ahead and
have the deed recorded.

1014
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:54,558
All right.

1015
01:52:57,145 --> 01:52:59,230
Thanks, Julie.

1016
01:53:44,775 --> 01:53:46,609
(knock at door)

1017
01:53:46,902 --> 01:53:48,778
Come in.

1018
01:53:56,161 --> 01:53:57,829
Pat.

1019
01:53:58,622 --> 01:54:00,540
Come in.

1020
01:54:05,504 --> 01:54:08,965
Won't you sit down?
I think this is the safest chair.

1021
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:13,469
Thanks, but I can't stay.
I just came to return these pistols.

1022
01:54:13,637 --> 01:54:16,973
The major felt that you
should have 'em back.

1023
01:54:18,642 --> 01:54:21,811
They were a gift.
I want him to have them.

1024
01:54:26,483 --> 01:54:31,029
Jim, I... I can't pretend to be
proud and polite any longer.

1025
01:54:31,947 --> 01:54:34,407
They're not why I came.

1026
01:54:34,742 --> 01:54:38,286
I didn't even think of 'em
till I had my hat on.

1027
01:54:39,663 --> 01:54:43,333
You said that you wanted
to think things over.

1028
01:54:44,293 --> 01:54:45,835
Have you?

1029
01:54:46,003 --> 01:54:47,170
Yes.

1030
01:54:56,805 --> 01:55:00,433
I don't think it'll work out
between us, Pat.

1031
01:55:05,104 --> 01:55:07,439
Oh, Jim, you can't mean that.

1032
01:55:08,441 --> 01:55:10,901
I know I've been wrong.

1033
01:55:11,069 --> 01:55:13,737
I've been silly and stupid and...

1034
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:15,906
But can't you see?

1035
01:55:16,074 --> 01:55:19,409
Those two dreadful days and nights
of worrying about you.

1036
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:22,996
I couldn't think. I was out of my mind.

1037
01:55:23,373 --> 01:55:26,875
If only you'd remembered
how much you mean to me.

1038
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:30,837
If only you'd told me,
explained to me...

1039
01:55:31,422 --> 01:55:34,466
You didn't give me
much of a chance, Pat.

1040
01:55:34,634 --> 01:55:36,843
You were all so determined
to see me fight.

1041
01:55:37,387 --> 01:55:40,764
But it would have meant so much,
if I'd only known.

1042
01:55:41,766 --> 01:55:46,728
I don't mean to reproach you.
That's the last thing I wanna do. But...

1043
01:55:46,896 --> 01:55:50,399
Even when you rode Old Thunder,
everybody knew it.

1044
01:55:50,566 --> 01:55:54,611
Ramón knew it, Julie knew it.
But me, not a word. Why?

1045
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:58,448
You knew how much it meant to me,
with everybody laughing at me.

1046
01:55:58,616 --> 01:56:00,742
And don't tell me they weren't.

1047
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:03,245
But you wouldn't do it for me.

1048
01:56:03,413 --> 01:56:05,706
Why not? Why not for me?

1049
01:56:06,666 --> 01:56:11,753
There are some things a man has to prove
to himself alone, not to anyone else.

1050
01:56:12,922 --> 01:56:15,090
Not even to the woman he loves?

1051
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:19,594
Least of all to her, if she loves him.

1052
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:23,473
- Do you understand that, Pat?
- No.

1053
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:28,270
No, I'll never understand that,
so don't try to explain it to me.

1054
01:56:28,438 --> 01:56:31,273
And then you say it won't work,
just like that.

1055
01:56:32,942 --> 01:56:34,693
No, Pat.

1056
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:37,279
Not just like that.

1057
01:56:40,782 --> 01:56:42,491
Jim, I love you.

1058
01:56:42,659 --> 01:56:44,869
You know I love you.

1059
01:56:45,037 --> 01:56:47,455
It'll never happen again.

1060
01:56:48,457 --> 01:56:50,207
I promise.

1061
01:56:51,877 --> 01:56:54,503
Oh, I need you!

1062
01:56:54,671 --> 01:56:56,964
I need you so terribly!

1063
01:56:57,674 --> 01:56:59,675
Oh, darling...

1064
01:57:02,637 --> 01:57:05,473
Oh, I promise... I promise.

1065
01:57:06,808 --> 01:57:08,809
Oh, darling.

1066
01:57:08,977 --> 01:57:13,522
It's all been such a misunderstanding.
It'll never happen again.

1067
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:16,984
I mustn't think mixed-up things
any more.

1068
01:57:17,152 --> 01:57:21,572
Oh, there's so much to do. I haven't
even told the major the good news.

1069
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:26,952
Wait till he hears about my wedding
present. He'll be so proud of you.

1070
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,580
He has such plans for the Big Muddy.

1071
01:57:29,748 --> 01:57:33,334
The major thinks on a grand scale,
I can promise you that.

1072
01:57:33,502 --> 01:57:36,170
He even wants to put in new corrals...

1073
01:57:36,338 --> 01:57:37,588
Pat...

1074
01:57:47,766 --> 01:57:52,019
I didn't buy the Big Muddy
to make the major proud of me.

1075
01:57:52,187 --> 01:57:54,271
I had plans of my own.

1076
01:57:55,440 --> 01:58:00,820
And I promised Julie that the neighbours
could have all the water they need.

1077
01:58:00,987 --> 01:58:03,030
What do you mean by that?

1078
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:07,201
I'm not going to go on living
in the middle of a civil war.

1079
01:58:07,369 --> 01:58:10,621
Do I understand you
to mean all the neighbours?

1080
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:16,376
That's right.
That includes the Hannasseys.

1081
01:58:17,878 --> 01:58:19,796
The Hannasseys?

1082
01:58:19,964 --> 01:58:22,507
You can stand there and say that to me?

1083
01:58:22,675 --> 01:58:26,928
You heard that filthy man
insult my father with his lies.

1084
01:58:27,096 --> 01:58:30,140
They were all lies!
You know they were lies!

1085
01:58:31,225 --> 01:58:35,812
Oh, you're just like all the rest
of them. You hate the major.

1086
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:40,441
I don't know why I came here!
I don't have to crawl to you or any man!

1087
01:58:40,609 --> 01:58:42,402
You'll never see the day

1088
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:44,654
when you're half the man
that Henry Terrill is! Never!

1089
01:59:12,141 --> 01:59:14,267
(whistled signal)

1090
01:59:17,605 --> 01:59:19,689
(whistled response)

1091
01:59:23,611 --> 01:59:25,987
Let's go, teacher.

1092
01:59:57,435 --> 02:00:00,020
What do you want, Mr. Hannassey?

1093
02:00:00,521 --> 02:00:05,484
I've wanted a lot of things in my life,
most of which I never got.

1094
02:00:05,652 --> 02:00:07,527
Sit down.

1095
02:00:07,695 --> 02:00:11,114
Mandy! Bring the lady some supper.

1096
02:00:11,282 --> 02:00:14,493
- Me too, Pa.
- You do your own yellin', boy.

1097
02:00:14,661 --> 02:00:17,996
People will be coming after me.
I hope they bring a rope.

1098
02:00:18,331 --> 02:00:22,626
They'll be comin' after you,
all right. I've seen to that.

1099
02:00:22,794 --> 02:00:26,338
When Henry Terrill comes
a-bustin' in here this time...

1100
02:00:26,506 --> 02:00:31,802
... that's gonna be the prettiest sight
my ageing eyeballs ever beheld.

1101
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:35,806
He's gonna be the most surprised
dead man you ever saw.

1102
02:00:41,145 --> 02:00:43,897
So that's why you've done this.

1103
02:00:46,276 --> 02:00:49,695
Well, it's a sorry Sunday when
the granddaughter of Clem Maragon...

1104
02:00:49,862 --> 02:00:54,449
... forces me to go agin the gentle
teachings that I was brung up with.

1105
02:00:55,451 --> 02:00:58,287
But you let Henry Terrill
run my cows off of the Big Muddy...

1106
02:00:58,454 --> 02:01:01,248
... and 24 of 'em died of thirst
before I could take a breath.

1107
02:01:01,416 --> 02:01:03,333
I let Henry Terrill?

1108
02:01:03,501 --> 02:01:07,129
I've stood by every promise
my grandfather ever made!

1109
02:01:07,297 --> 02:01:11,049
She's pretty when she's
like that, ain't she, Pa?

1110
02:01:11,217 --> 02:01:13,302
Now listen, young lady...

1111
02:01:13,469 --> 02:01:16,596
... I aim to get my cows back to water!

1112
02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:20,851
I'm a law-abidin' man.

1113
02:01:21,019 --> 02:01:24,438
That is, if there's any law to abide by.

1114
02:01:24,605 --> 02:01:29,233
Now I aim to do this thing
nice and legal.

1115
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,281
Take off your hat.

1116
02:01:38,869 --> 02:01:39,952
Now...

1117
02:01:42,372 --> 02:01:45,416
How would you like to marry
my boy Buck there?

1118
02:01:47,461 --> 02:01:48,711
Huh?

1119
02:01:48,879 --> 02:01:51,839
He's a fine, upstandin' young fella.

1120
02:01:52,007 --> 02:01:56,177
And then we could have the
Big Muddy all in the family, huh?

1121
02:01:58,847 --> 02:02:01,349
You must be out of your mind!

1122
02:02:03,143 --> 02:02:06,979
Well, he's got some rough edges,
I know, but...

1123
02:02:07,147 --> 02:02:09,106
... from what he tells me...

1124
02:02:09,274 --> 02:02:13,986
... maybe you wouldn't mind to
smooth 'em off a little bit, huh?

1125
02:02:15,572 --> 02:02:17,782
Don't act like
you're doin' me no favour.

1126
02:02:17,949 --> 02:02:20,785
Maybe I could learn you
a little, teacher.

1127
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:29,460
Sweet on you, huh?!

1128
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:34,799
Well, if you ain't the mother
and father of all liars!

1129
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:42,390
Well now, Miss Maragon...

1130
02:02:43,475 --> 02:02:47,853
... if this son of mine is so offensive
to your delicate sensibilities...

1131
02:02:48,021 --> 02:02:51,357
... there's more than one way
to tree a coon.

1132
02:02:51,525 --> 02:02:53,609
Now, uh...

1133
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:58,155
... if you want to get
yourself outta here,

1134
02:02:58,448 --> 02:03:00,783
and if you want to stop a slaughter...

1135
02:03:00,951 --> 02:03:05,161
... now... you just, uh, just sign this.

1136
02:03:05,329 --> 02:03:09,582
It's a bill of sale of the Big Muddy
at a fair price.

1137
02:03:34,066 --> 02:03:35,692
Now take me home.

1138
02:03:46,245 --> 02:03:48,371
What's goin' on here?

1139
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,709
For six years I've been tryin'
to get you to...

1140
02:03:53,461 --> 02:03:56,087
And now you just sign it like that.

1141
02:04:01,051 --> 02:04:03,678
Are you tyin' knots in my tail?

1142
02:04:05,264 --> 02:04:07,182
Speak up!

1143
02:04:07,349 --> 02:04:10,477
Big Muddy isn't mine to sell,
Mr. Hannassey.

1144
02:04:14,565 --> 02:04:17,066
Girl, you're tryin'
the edge of my patience.

1145
02:04:17,234 --> 02:04:20,445
I mean it. I don't own the Big Muddy.
That paper's worthless...

1146
02:04:20,613 --> 02:04:23,031
... so you might as well take me home.

1147
02:04:26,118 --> 02:04:27,827
You gone and sold it to Terrill.

1148
02:04:27,995 --> 02:04:31,956
I wouldn't sell it to the Terrills
any more than I'd sell it to you.

1149
02:04:32,124 --> 02:04:35,793
I did the one thing I could to try
and bring peace and sanity here.

1150
02:04:35,961 --> 02:04:38,587
I sold it to a man nobody
can ride roughshod over.

1151
02:04:38,755 --> 02:04:41,048
- To who?
- I sold it to Jim McKay.

1152
02:04:41,216 --> 02:04:44,760
The dude! Terrill's son-in-law, Pa.
Same difference.

1153
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,887
No wonder they drove our cows off.

1154
02:04:47,055 --> 02:04:50,933
- I sold it to him with the promise...
- Peace, you say!

1155
02:04:51,726 --> 02:04:53,393
Tryin' to make a fool of me, girl?

1156
02:04:53,561 --> 02:04:56,480
He's not marrying a Terrill.
He's not marrying anybody.

1157
02:04:56,648 --> 02:04:59,358
Now there's your dinner, if you want it.

1158
02:04:59,526 --> 02:05:01,443
If not, the bed is in there.

1159
02:05:01,611 --> 02:05:04,613
Let me take you to him.
Talk to him. He'll tell you himself.

1160
02:05:04,781 --> 02:05:07,449
You don't get outta here that easy.

1161
02:05:08,785 --> 02:05:12,621
I still don't know
how much truth you just told me...

1162
02:05:12,789 --> 02:05:17,626
... but don't you never look down
your nose at me or mine again!

1163
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:22,214
If my conscience was bothering me,
it ain't no more.

1164
02:05:22,382 --> 02:05:25,467
What happens here tomorrow
is on your head...

1165
02:05:25,635 --> 02:05:27,719
... not mine.

1166
02:05:34,018 --> 02:05:36,103
It's no use.

1167
02:05:37,564 --> 02:05:40,649
A coyote couldn't slip
through that canyon.

1168
02:05:40,817 --> 02:05:44,152
There ain't no Hannasseys
sleepin' tonight.

1169
02:07:01,021 --> 02:07:04,023
I was saving this for Terrill's neck.

1170
02:07:04,191 --> 02:07:08,402
But, in a manner of speaking,
it'll serve the same purpose.

1171
02:07:12,616 --> 02:07:15,409
- Does everybody know the signals?
- You bet.

1172
02:07:15,577 --> 02:07:17,453
Right!

1173
02:07:32,052 --> 02:07:34,136
(door creaks)

1174
02:08:27,982 --> 02:08:30,400
(muffled screams)

1175
02:08:38,325 --> 02:08:39,993
No! Don't!

1176
02:08:44,832 --> 02:08:47,959
Do I make you sick? Hm? Do I?

1177
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:53,923
Get out!

1178
02:08:59,388 --> 02:09:01,765
Crawl! You act like a dog,
crawl like one!

1179
02:09:01,932 --> 02:09:04,225
Crawl, I said! Crawl!

1180
02:09:19,116 --> 02:09:22,786
You've pressed me for the last time,
hear me? For the last time!

1181
02:09:22,953 --> 02:09:26,371
Pa, I mean it!
Don't you press me no more!

1182
02:09:45,433 --> 02:09:49,102
Someday...
Someday I'll have to kill you.

1183
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:27,491
Thanks. I'll be back in a day or two.

1184
02:11:27,659 --> 02:11:29,327
Thank you.

1185
02:11:29,494 --> 02:11:31,579
Now don't get lost.

1186
02:11:37,336 --> 02:11:38,753
Mr. McKay!

1187
02:11:38,921 --> 02:11:40,922
Ramón!

1188
02:11:41,757 --> 02:11:43,341
What brings you to town?

1189
02:11:43,508 --> 02:11:46,844
It's a big trouble.
Very bad. The major...

1190
02:12:01,777 --> 02:12:04,528
(snoring)

1191
02:12:52,493 --> 02:12:55,245
What took you so long, Steve?
See anything?

1192
02:12:55,413 --> 02:12:57,998
Plenty. Major, they're ready
and waitin' for us.

1193
02:12:58,165 --> 02:13:01,209
There must be a rifle
behind every rock in that canyon.

1194
02:13:07,508 --> 02:13:09,843
We can handle anything they've got.

1195
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:12,137
- We're going in.
- Major...

1196
02:13:12,304 --> 02:13:14,681
When I think of that poor,
defenceless girl

1197
02:13:14,849 --> 02:13:16,725
in their filthy hands...

1198
02:13:17,435 --> 02:13:20,895
Steve, we'll earn the gratitude of
every decent person in this country...

1199
02:13:21,063 --> 02:13:24,274
... if we put an end to them,
once and for all.

1200
02:13:28,779 --> 02:13:32,615
Where are those other men you sent for?
Should've been here an hour ago.

1201
02:13:32,783 --> 02:13:35,243
We're gonna need every one of 'em.

1202
02:13:35,411 --> 02:13:37,996
Well, I won't wait much longer.

1203
02:13:38,831 --> 02:13:40,915
Somebody comin', Major!

1204
02:13:49,550 --> 02:13:54,054
Well, look who we have here.
The new owner of the Big Muddy.

1205
02:13:55,681 --> 02:13:59,392
You certainly cover
a lot of territory, McKay.

1206
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,644
Where do you think you're going?

1207
02:14:03,147 --> 02:14:04,647
I'm going into Blanco Canyon.

1208
02:14:05,149 --> 02:14:09,736
That's a fine place for a man who
goes out of his way to avoid a fight.

1209
02:14:10,905 --> 02:14:13,363
What business do you have
in Blanco Canyon?

1210
02:14:13,656 --> 02:14:15,240
Miss Maragon is being held there.

1211
02:14:15,408 --> 02:14:17,826
I think I can bring her out
without any violence.

1212
02:14:17,994 --> 02:14:20,162
You're not going in there, McKay.

1213
02:14:20,747 --> 02:14:22,790
That's for me to decide.

1214
02:14:23,166 --> 02:14:27,002
I'm telling you for the last time,
you're staying here.

1215
02:14:34,177 --> 02:14:38,555
I'm going in. If you want to stop me,
you'll have to use that.

1216
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:42,518
But, if you shoot me down...

1217
02:14:44,145 --> 02:14:47,397
... let's have it clear,
in front of all these men.

1218
02:14:47,565 --> 02:14:49,817
You're not here to get
Julie Maragon out.

1219
02:14:50,568 --> 02:14:54,947
You're just using this for an excuse
to start your own private war.

1220
02:15:05,083 --> 02:15:07,042
(Steve) Major...

1221
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:09,086
Major!

1222
02:15:09,254 --> 02:15:11,130
You can't do it.

1223
02:15:11,297 --> 02:15:13,382
Let him go.

1224
02:15:17,887 --> 02:15:21,265
He won't get in there far enough
to open his mouth.

1225
02:15:21,432 --> 02:15:25,602
If he wants to get himself killed,
let the Hannasseys do it.

1226
02:15:49,042 --> 02:15:51,127
(birdlike whistle)

1227
02:16:17,696 --> 02:16:20,114
It's the dude.

1228
02:16:29,124 --> 02:16:30,708
- Stay here.
- Right.

1229
02:16:59,279 --> 02:17:02,406
How do you like Blanco Canyon? Huh?

1230
02:17:05,077 --> 02:17:07,370
Hell of a place for a sailor!

1231
02:17:14,336 --> 02:17:15,586
(birdlike whistle)

1232
02:17:15,754 --> 02:17:17,838
(whistled response)

1233
02:18:05,094 --> 02:18:07,971
You wanna see him dead
right in front of your eyes?

1234
02:18:08,139 --> 02:18:10,390
Then you tell him you come here
cos you wanted to

1235
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:11,891
and you ain't leavin', see?

1236
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:14,894
You let on anything else, I'll kill him.

1237
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:36,166
Hello, Mr. Hannassey. I'm Jim McKay.

1238
02:18:36,334 --> 02:18:38,418
I know who you are.

1239
02:18:38,586 --> 02:18:41,755
This is a different kind of party
we're havin' here today.

1240
02:18:41,922 --> 02:18:46,092
Not as elegant as the major's shindig,
but it's gonna be a lot more lively.

1241
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:50,472
Now, may I ask what
brings you here - uninvited?

1242
02:18:50,639 --> 02:18:53,350
I've come to take Miss Maragon home.

1243
02:18:53,517 --> 02:18:55,852
Mister, you've got
more gall than brains.

1244
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:58,021
You just rode by a passel of guns...

1245
02:18:58,189 --> 02:19:00,898
... and you got a couple
on you right now.

1246
02:19:01,441 --> 02:19:04,777
Just what is your notion
of why Miss Maragon is here?

1247
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:08,697
We both know why Miss Maragon
is here, Mr. Hannassey.

1248
02:19:08,948 --> 02:19:11,825
My cows are waterin'
on the Big Muddy again.

1249
02:19:11,993 --> 02:19:14,995
Pretty soon I'm gonna
have Henry Terrill where I want him,

1250
02:19:15,163 --> 02:19:16,163
if that's what you mean.

1251
02:19:17,916 --> 02:19:20,626
Then you've got no more reason
to hold her here.

1252
02:19:20,794 --> 02:19:22,252
I own the Big Muddy now.

1253
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:26,256
I give you my word you can have
all the water you want.

1254
02:19:28,093 --> 02:19:31,637
- Have you got any proof of that, boy?
- Right here.

1255
02:19:31,805 --> 02:19:34,723
Just hold your seat. Buck?

1256
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:37,643
Buck'll do the lookin'.

1257
02:19:41,022 --> 02:19:43,148
Well, whatta we got here?

1258
02:19:43,316 --> 02:19:45,567
The deed's in my coat.

1259
02:19:47,487 --> 02:19:51,740
Ain't them real pretty!
Look, Pa, toy pistols.

1260
02:19:51,908 --> 02:19:53,992
Gentlemen's weapons.

1261
02:19:56,454 --> 02:19:59,748
You come loaded for bear,
didn't you, boy?

1262
02:19:59,916 --> 02:20:02,709
Just what did you expect
to do with these?

1263
02:20:03,837 --> 02:20:05,921
Buck, look in his coat.

1264
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:16,473
It's been recorded.

1265
02:20:27,402 --> 02:20:29,945
If this ain't a frosty Friday.

1266
02:20:31,156 --> 02:20:35,951
I've been tryin' to get my hands on
this deed since Clem Maragon died.

1267
02:20:40,789 --> 02:20:46,461
What about my promise? All the water
you want, just as long as you want it.

1268
02:20:46,628 --> 02:20:50,548
You've got the looks of a man
that means what he says.

1269
02:20:50,716 --> 02:20:53,426
But this ain't just a matter of water.

1270
02:20:54,094 --> 02:20:56,053
The Hannasseys will have no peace...

1271
02:20:56,221 --> 02:21:00,558
... till the bones of Henry Terrill
is bleachin' in Blanco Canyon!

1272
02:21:00,726 --> 02:21:04,729
Now, he started this blood-spillin',
and I aim to finish it!

1273
02:21:04,938 --> 02:21:07,482
His way!

1274
02:21:11,737 --> 02:21:14,780
You had me fooled
for quite a while, Mr. Hannassey,

1275
02:21:14,948 --> 02:21:16,908
with your self-righteous talk.

1276
02:21:17,075 --> 02:21:20,077
What's the difference
between his way and your way?

1277
02:21:20,245 --> 02:21:23,748
How many of those men out there
know what this fight is really about?

1278
02:21:23,916 --> 02:21:26,834
This isn't their war.
This is nothing but a personal feud...

1279
02:21:27,002 --> 02:21:30,463
... between two selfish, ruthless,
vicious old men:

1280
02:21:30,839 --> 02:21:33,132
Henry Terrill and you.

1281
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:35,968
You gonna stand there and take that?
I've had enough of...

1282
02:21:36,136 --> 02:21:37,970
You're mistaken, Mr. McKay.

1283
02:21:38,138 --> 02:21:42,808
I came to visit for a few days.
There's no need for anyone to worry.

1284
02:21:43,143 --> 02:21:46,812
I suppose I... I should've
left word with somebody.

1285
02:21:56,073 --> 02:21:59,116
I don't care what you think.

1286
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:06,499
- I didn't ask you to bother about me!
- Julie, you've got to come with me.

1287
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,502
If you don't show yourself
at the entrance to the canyon,

1288
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:11,087
men are going to be killed.

1289
02:22:17,885 --> 02:22:19,970
I can't help that.

1290
02:22:20,972 --> 02:22:23,682
There's nothing I can do about it.

1291
02:22:26,477 --> 02:22:31,064
This trouble's not about me, so...
so why don't you just go away?

1292
02:22:46,163 --> 02:22:48,665
What is it that you're afraid of?

1293
02:22:49,834 --> 02:22:51,376
Nothing.

1294
02:22:51,544 --> 02:22:54,045
Nothing. I'm... I'm not afraid.

1295
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:59,676
I come here all the time.
Everybody knows that.

1296
02:23:03,389 --> 02:23:06,766
Don't you know?
Me and Julie's old friends.

1297
02:23:06,934 --> 02:23:10,687
Now, why don't you just get goin'
while you still can?

1298
02:23:20,531 --> 02:23:22,574
Now wait a minute.

1299
02:23:25,036 --> 02:23:27,704
I'm not leaving here without her.

1300
02:23:29,206 --> 02:23:32,042
You're tryin' to protect him. Why?

1301
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:40,383
Guess there's no need to answer that.

1302
02:23:44,764 --> 02:23:46,389
And you...

1303
02:23:46,557 --> 02:23:50,809
You come a-brazin' in here, unarmed,
takin' a mighty tall chance...

1304
02:23:50,977 --> 02:23:53,604
... tryin' to stop a fight
that ain't your fight.

1305
02:23:54,105 --> 02:23:55,939
Now why?

1306
02:24:13,667 --> 02:24:15,668
Well, Buck, are you blind?

1307
02:24:22,592 --> 02:24:25,177
Jim, you should never have come here.

1308
02:24:25,679 --> 02:24:28,097
Please go and leave me alone.

1309
02:24:29,099 --> 02:24:32,017
Well, don't just stand there! Go!

1310
02:24:32,519 --> 02:24:34,561
Oh, please go, Jim! Please!

1311
02:24:34,729 --> 02:24:35,854
Buck!

1312
02:24:53,915 --> 02:24:55,165
Look out, Jim!

1313
02:24:55,333 --> 02:24:56,625
(gunshot)

1314
02:24:58,211 --> 02:25:00,754
You don't shoot an unarmed man.
Not while I'm around.

1315
02:25:00,922 --> 02:25:02,756
Then give him a gun, Pa!

1316
02:25:02,924 --> 02:25:05,634
Give the dude a gun and let him
stand up and draw like a man.

1317
02:25:05,802 --> 02:25:10,889
- I'll fight him any way he likes.
- You heard him, Pa! Give him a gun!

1318
02:25:11,683 --> 02:25:14,393
Come on up here, both of ya.

1319
02:25:25,154 --> 02:25:27,739
Why do you carry these?
You a dead shot with 'em?

1320
02:25:27,906 --> 02:25:30,199
I haven't fired any pistols for ten
years.

1321
02:25:30,367 --> 02:25:32,744
Give him one of his own, Pa.
Quit this talkin'.

1322
02:25:32,911 --> 02:25:35,496
Shut up! I'll handle this!

1323
02:25:36,373 --> 02:25:39,584
You're a great one for hittin' women
and beatin' slower men to the draw.

1324
02:25:39,752 --> 02:25:42,003
- Mr. Hannassey...
- You stay out of this!

1325
02:25:42,171 --> 02:25:45,089
Yeah, you love a fight your style.

1326
02:25:45,257 --> 02:25:48,968
But I wonder if you've got
the stomach for it, gentleman style.

1327
02:25:49,136 --> 02:25:51,179
What about you? Talk's cheap.

1328
02:25:51,346 --> 02:25:54,640
You're crazy, Pa.
Me use one of them single-shot toys?

1329
02:25:54,808 --> 02:25:58,728
I've stood up with nothin' but
one shot between me and damnation.

1330
02:25:58,896 --> 02:26:02,315
How would you like to start fightin'
fair and square for a change?

1331
02:26:02,483 --> 02:26:04,734
Lookin' down the barrel of a gun...

1332
02:26:04,902 --> 02:26:07,236
... where your fast draw
won't do you any good, huh?

1333
02:26:07,404 --> 02:26:08,529
Why should I?

1334
02:26:08,697 --> 02:26:12,241
Because I say so!
Now give me that gun belt!

1335
02:26:12,409 --> 02:26:14,368
And, for the first time in your life,

1336
02:26:14,536 --> 02:26:17,246
try to be the man
that I'd like you to be.

1337
02:26:17,414 --> 02:26:19,874
Give it to me!

1338
02:26:21,752 --> 02:26:23,544
Take care of that.

1339
02:26:23,712 --> 02:26:28,049
Hey, you up there! Let me know
if there's anything stirrin'!

1340
02:26:29,051 --> 02:26:32,053
- Are these guns loaded?
- All but the caps.

1341
02:26:32,221 --> 02:26:35,890
They haven't been fired for a long time.
The vents will have to be cleared out.

1342
02:26:36,058 --> 02:26:37,683
I'll do it for you, if you like.

1343
02:26:37,851 --> 02:26:40,394
Teach your grandmother to suck eggs?

1344
02:26:40,562 --> 02:26:42,396
I've been handlin' guns like this,

1345
02:26:42,564 --> 02:26:45,399
flintlock and caplock,
since before you were born.

1346
02:26:46,443 --> 02:26:48,569
Follow me...

1347
02:26:49,071 --> 02:26:51,155
... gentlemen.

1348
02:26:55,118 --> 02:26:57,036
Jim...

1349
02:27:17,723 --> 02:27:19,808
Come on, Steve.

1350
02:27:24,772 --> 02:27:29,067
Major, we haven't heard a single shot.
Do you suppose McKay got through?

1351
02:27:29,235 --> 02:27:31,695
That's no concern of ours.

1352
02:27:31,863 --> 02:27:33,947
What's the matter with you? Come on.

1353
02:27:34,115 --> 02:27:37,284
This is bound to cost us half our men.
What if it's not necessary?

1354
02:27:37,451 --> 02:27:41,788
What did you expect? A taffey pull?
Anybody'd think you were scared.

1355
02:27:42,123 --> 02:27:44,833
Suppose he's ridin' out of there
with her right now

1356
02:27:45,001 --> 02:27:46,626
and we start a lot of shootin'?

1357
02:27:46,794 --> 02:27:51,840
I'd walk into hell after you, Major. Not
much you could ask I wouldn't try to do.

1358
02:27:52,008 --> 02:27:56,052
I just don't hold with you on this.
I just can't do it, Major. I can't.

1359
02:27:57,013 --> 02:27:59,139
By damn, you are yellow!

1360
02:28:02,351 --> 02:28:07,606
You call me whatever you want, but I'm
not beatin' up any more men for you...

1361
02:28:07,773 --> 02:28:11,860
... I'm not running off any more cattle
or shootin' any more Hannasseys for you.

1362
02:28:12,028 --> 02:28:15,614
You ride on in there if you want to.
I'm finished.

1363
02:28:16,407 --> 02:28:20,410
You're finished all right.
I don't need you on this trip.

1364
02:28:21,495 --> 02:28:23,288
All right, men, mount up!

1365
02:28:30,171 --> 02:28:32,255
I said mount up!

1366
02:28:52,859 --> 02:28:54,234
I see.

1367
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:57,404
I'm all alone in this.

1368
02:28:59,866 --> 02:29:01,951
All right.

1369
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:04,912
I've been alone before.

1370
02:29:09,751 --> 02:29:11,710
Major...

1371
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:14,797
Major!

1372
02:31:16,335 --> 02:31:18,377
Clear the line of fire.

1373
02:31:21,715 --> 02:31:24,467
I forgot all the fancy rigamarole
that goes with this...

1374
02:31:24,635 --> 02:31:27,637
... so I'll just say "ready",
"aim", "fire".

1375
02:31:28,138 --> 02:31:30,389
Cock your hammers on "ready".

1376
02:31:31,475 --> 02:31:33,184
There's one thing I do remember.

1377
02:31:33,352 --> 02:31:35,686
If either man tries to beat
the signal...

1378
02:31:35,854 --> 02:31:40,441
... it's my duty to shoot him down like
a dog, and I'll do it, so help me!

1379
02:31:40,609 --> 02:31:44,695
This thing's gonna be done
right and proper. Understand?

1380
02:31:44,863 --> 02:31:46,697
Here.

1381
02:31:47,407 --> 02:31:49,491
Your choice.

1382
02:31:52,537 --> 02:31:54,621
Now, back to back.

1383
02:31:56,707 --> 02:31:59,709
And keep your fingers off
of the trigger.

1384
02:32:00,211 --> 02:32:02,212
Clear the way there!

1385
02:32:02,755 --> 02:32:06,258
I can feel you sweatin'
right through my shirt.

1386
02:32:09,137 --> 02:32:11,221
Now, I'll count to ten.

1387
02:32:11,722 --> 02:32:13,598
Now, you turn on "ready".

1388
02:32:14,225 --> 02:32:16,268
Fire when I tell ya.

1389
02:32:16,561 --> 02:32:17,894
Walk!

1390
02:32:18,396 --> 02:32:20,939
One, two, three...

02:32:21,107 --> 02:32:23,233

1392

Ready...

1395
02:32:46,299 --> 02:32:47,757
Aim...

1396
02:32:57,101 --> 02:32:58,351
Fire!

1397
02:33:03,399 --> 02:33:06,526
- I warned you, you dirty low...
- All right!

1398
02:33:09,614 --> 02:33:11,198
Now it's my shot.

1399
02:33:15,328 --> 02:33:17,454
Go ahead!

1400
02:33:57,077 --> 02:33:58,661
Fire!

1401
02:33:58,995 --> 02:34:01,247
Go on, shoot!

1402
02:34:36,950 --> 02:34:37,783
Buck!

1403
02:35:21,035 --> 02:35:22,660
I told you.

1404
02:35:22,911 --> 02:35:25,580
I told you I'd do it.

1405
02:35:25,748 --> 02:35:28,166
I told you, but you wouldn't believe me.

1406
02:35:28,334 --> 02:35:30,251
Damn your soul!

1407
02:35:30,419 --> 02:35:31,919

1408
02:35:32,087 --> 02:35:34,172

Let them pass.

1410
02:37:09,851 --> 02:37:11,935
Get my horse.

1411
02:37:55,605 --> 02:37:57,397
(gunshots)

1412
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:01,401
Take cover! Take cover!

1413
02:38:02,361 --> 02:38:04,446
(gunfire)

1414
02:38:16,374 --> 02:38:18,459
Get back here! Get off those horses!

1415
02:39:00,293 --> 02:39:04,630
McKay!

1416
02:39:19,437 --> 02:39:23,816
You said Henry Terrill and me.
You were right.

1417
02:39:24,568 --> 02:39:26,819
Come on! Keep movin'!

1419
02:40:02,438 --> 02:40:04,522
Hold your fire!

1421
02:40:18,704 --> 02:40:23,333
Hold your fire!

1422

Keep 'em covered, but hold your fire!

1423
02:40:54,031 --> 02:40:55,990

Come on out!

1425
02:41:03,582 --> 02:41:05,583
Henry Terrill?

1426
02:41:05,751 --> 02:41:07,251
Do you hear me?

1427
02:41:10,339 --> 02:41:12,340

1428
02:41:13,592 --> 02:41:15,426
