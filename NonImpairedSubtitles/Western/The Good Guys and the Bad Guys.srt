<i>Our story tells of a man grown old</i>

2
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:08,975
<i>His blood's still warm</i>
<i>but his heart's grown cold</i>

3
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:13,113
<i>He thinks he's still the man he was</i>

4
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,181
<i>But the young poke fun at everything</i>

5
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,956

00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:39,146
<i>Younger folks start making jokes</i>

00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:42,810
<i>They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg</i>

10

<i>They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg</i>

11

<i>At Marshal Flagg</i>

14
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:04,198
<i>A man recalls all his youthful days</i>

15
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,732
<i>When he tasted life in a million ways</i>

16
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:11,975
<i>He dreams his dreams, at times it seems</i>

17
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,982
<i>That he's only two times ten</i>

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>That he's full of fire again</i>

19
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:19,153

<i>At Marshal Flagg</i>

28
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,132
Damn red-headed chicken thief!
Blow his stealing head off.

29
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,138
Damn fox ate another one
of my hens this morning.

30
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,465
Consarned thieving...

31
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,374
Well, get down off of there.
Come have a snort.

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,707
- Nippy, huh?
- Nippy, hell!

33
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,748
I damn near froze last night.

34
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,380
- Why didn't you sleep inside?
- Walls and roofs is for city folks.

35
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,191
- Well, then why did you build it?
- Never built nothing like it before.

36
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:39,192
Grundy, either your coffee
or your liquor's getting awful rancid.

37
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,103
- Chaw?
- No, no.

38
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,640
- So what no-good you been up to?
- Just the usual.

39
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:50,705
- I saw some...
- What?

40
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:54,742
- Saw some...
- Grundy, will you please spit?

41
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,447
Saw some men yesterday.
Down by the flats.

42
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,253
- Who were they?
- Never seen them before.

43
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,226
- What'd they look like?
- Mean.

44
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:08,123
- What do you mean "mean"?
- Just mean. Ornery.

45
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,425
Well, what were they doing?
How many of them were there?

46
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,732
Not much of anything. Just sitting.
About a dozen of them.

47
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:17,104
Well, didn't you see anything
or hear anything?

48
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,971
I heard a couple of names.
One was called Waco.

49
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:23,570
And another called...
I can't remember exactly.

50
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,206
McBride, MacLean, McKay,
something like that.

51
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,380
- McKay? Did you say McKay?
- Something like that.

52
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,553
What did he look like, this fellow, McKay?

53
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,090
- Only saw his back.
- From the back then!

54
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,147
Well,

55
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,686
he was tall, taller than the rest.

56
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,731
He wore them long Mexican spurs
with the pointed rowels.

57
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,200
His horse and his clothes,
what color were they?

58
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:49,227
Black. Whole outfit, horse and man.
Even his holster.

59
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:51,933
I remember that,
because he wore it high on his belt.

60
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,704
Not low, like some of these
showoffy young'uns.

61
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:59,205
John McKay. That's who you saw.

62
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:01,546
You mean the McKay? Big John McKay?

63
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:03,943
That's right.

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,716
Thought he was killed years ago,
down along the Red River.

65
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:07,778
So did I.

66
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,483
Thanks for the coffee.

67
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,902
- If you need an extra gun, count me in.
- Thanks, Grundy.

68
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,905
Hot damn!

69
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,045
There's finally gonna be some action
around here.

70
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:07,949
Up. Here you go.

71
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,918
You weren't so eager
to get rid of me last night, Jed Davis.

72
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,683
Come on, Ginny,
there wasn't nothing personal about it.

73
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:14,745
Nothing personal!

74
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:18,590
Be the first time you ever laid hands
on me that it weren't personal!

75
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:23,327
High time they closed that dirty place.
Been the shame of this city.

76
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,891
Harold!

77
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,165
- Hi, Nell.
- I don't know you, do I?

78
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:33,035
- Bye, Nell.
- I sure as hell should remember him.

79
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,471
Harold, you tell me immediately
how you know that woman.

80
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,708
Harold! Answer me this instant.

81
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,215
She's a friend of Pa's.

82
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:44,014
Hey, Nell, give us something
to remember you by.

83
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,587
This'll remind you
of what you'll be missing, boys.

84
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,590
- That's my garter.
- No, it's mine.

85
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,060
Give me my garter, will you?

86
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,926
- I swear to...
- Fight!

87
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,297
I never figured on this much fuss.

88
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:09,037
Well, Howard, fuss is publicity.
Publicity is votes. Remember that.

89
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,478
I congratulate you, Mayor Wilker.

90
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:16,109
That establishment
was a blight on the entire community.

91
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,743
Right you are, Mrs. Peters.

92
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,812
It's a civic disgrace. The work of the devil.

93
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,289
Don't worry, Ed.

94
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,260
The house will be open right after election.

95
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,527
Good. Good. Good.

96
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,369
Oh, good.

97
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,802
Come on, Howard.

98
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,668
So long, Charley.

99
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,599
Dirty thing.

100
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,704
Take your hands off me!

101
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,943
Bye. No hard feelings anymore.

102
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,186
Goodbye!

103
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,496
Bye.

104
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:44,933
This is for you, Jim, for being
the nicest marshal we've ever known.

105
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,999
All right, girls, let's hear it for the marshal.

106
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:52,309
- Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

107
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,679
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!

108
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,878
Well, back to the office.

109
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,118
Public servant's work is never done.

110
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,159
- Mayor.
- Yes?

111
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,431
Oh, Flagg. Good morning.

112
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:18,032
Gonna need about 20 men.
Volunteers for a posse.

113
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:21,338
- Posse? Did you say posse, Jim Boy?
- That's right.

114
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,139
You have them
bring their guns and ammunition,

115
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,270
meet me over at the courthouse,

116
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,746
and I'll get them sworn in and we'II...

117
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,182
Wait a minute, Jim. Now wait.
What is all this posse talk?

118
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,853
You know that train that's due Saturday
with the money for the new bank?

119
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,390
- Yes.
- Well, I think there's gonna be a holdup.

120
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,790
- Holdup?
- That's impossible.

121
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,626
John McKay has been seen in the territory.

122
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,493
And who the hell is John McKay?

123
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,366
Who the hell is John McKay?

124
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,529
For your information,
Mayor Wilker and Deputy Boyle,

125
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,802
John McKay is one of the most wanted
outlaws in the country.

126
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,241
Oh, you mean Big John McKay,
that old-time train robber.

127
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,871
- That's right.
- Sure, I remember now.

128
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,541
I read about him in the pulp books.

129
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,639
He used to be pretty famous

130
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,183
around the time
the James boys was cutting up.

131
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:05,049
The James boys?
Ye gods, that's over 20 years ago!

132
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,419
Yeah, but wasn't he killed,
somewhere down in Texas?

133
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,048
Well, if he was,
I wouldn't be standing here

134
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,286
saying he's planning a holdup,
now would I, Mr. Boyle?

135
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,349
Yeah, but the book said that...

136
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,396
I don't give a damn what the book said,
the man's alive!

137
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:18,399
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Jim Boy.
Now, calm down. "Holdup," "posse"...

138
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,401
We haven't used those words in... In years.

139
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,869
Well, in case you've forgotten, Mayor,
they mean trouble.

140
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:26,271
Which is exactly what we're gonna have
if we don't quit jawing and start moving.

141
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:27,934
And we're gonna have even more trouble

142
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,877
if we go off halfcocked
and get this whole town up in arms.

143
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,574
We're not going off halfcocked,
the man is dangerous.

144
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,947
Wait a minute, Jim, let's...
Let's be sensible.

145
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,816
If he was alive,
this man would be 100 years old!

146
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,116
He's no older than I am!

147
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,424
I'll tell you what, Jim Boy,
let's go over to your office

148
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:51,057
and discuss this in a rational way,
shall we?

149
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,641
Jim Boy, this place needs air!

150
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,646
Get a window open.

151
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:13,086
- Scared the hell out of me.
- Not as scared as you're gonna be.

152
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,651
There's our man.

153
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,964
Do something about those windows,
will you, Jim Boy? You look peaked.

154
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:28,992
Well!

155
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,332
This is more like it.
A man can work in here.

156
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,102
Space. There's light. There's air.
It's very nice, Howard.

157
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,237
Yes, neatness indicates organization.

158
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,783
Organization promotes productivity.
I'm impressed, Howard.

159
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,753
Well, I hope you'll be impressed when
McKay hauls off $100,000 on Saturday.

160
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:49,723
Now look, Jim, this poster is 20 years old
if it's a day.

161
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,352
- Now, it cannot be the same man.
- Well, it is.

162
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,089
I had a detailed description.

163
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:56,028
A description?
I thought you said you saw him.

164
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,929
I said he was seen in the territory.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,059
Then you actually did not see him?

166
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,933
- No.
- Well, who did?

167
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,835
- A fellow named Grundy.
- Grundy?

168
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:10,201
Jim! That crazy, whiskey-guzzling
old sot in the hills?

169
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,271
- He is not crazy.
- You can't be serious, Jim Boy.

170
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,476
You mean
you'd turn this town upside-down

171
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:19,612
and create a panic over some wild bandits
or some bank robbers

172
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,054
on the word of a lunatic
hiding up in the hills?

173
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,854
He's not a lunatic,
and he's not hiding in the hills!

174
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:28,021
- He just don't take to city life.
- No, we can't risk it, Jim.

175
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,655
Not with an election coming up.

176
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:32,360
Now, if you told me that you had
seen McKay with your own eyes,

177
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,164
I would consider a plan of action.

178
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,295
But this is just... This is just hearsay.

179
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,930
You can't run a town on hearsay.

180
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,841
We'd be the laughingstock of the state
if this turned out to be a wild goose chase.

181
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,344
Jim, go home.

182
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,873
Forget about posses
and holdups and the like.

183
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,647
- Time marches on.
- Well, I'm still marshal of this town.

184
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:53,620
And as long as I am,
I aim to do my job the best way I can.

185
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,020
I'm forming a posse.

186
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,251
I'd like your cooperation, but if needs be...

187
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,090
Jim Boy. Jim, wait a minute.

188
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,823
Now, Saturday is two days away.

189
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:06,061
Now, all I'm asking for is a couple of hours
to analyze the situation.

190
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,228
Now, that's fair enough, isn't it?

191
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,200
- Well...
- You're a reasonable man, Jim Boy.

192
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,275
Howard, I'd like...

193
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:16,834
Howard.

194
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,376
I want you to walk me to the office.

195
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,974
I have something
I want to discuss with you.

196
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,665
James Flagg.

197
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,111
You are late for supper!
You know what time we sit down.

198
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,943
I mean, I don't run a restaurant here.

199
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,449
I haven't got time to eat anyway, Mary.

200
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,178
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Billy.

201
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,345
Marshal Flagg, Billy, you know that.

202
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,515
Boy, you should've seen
all the ruckus in town today.

203
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,990
A whole bunch of ladies
were piled aboard the train

204
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,051
and the mayor was there and everything.

205
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,290
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Where are they going?

206
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,059
- Who?
- The ladies.

207
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,691
- Another town, I guess.
- Why?

208
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,759
Billy!

209
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:52,303
- Ma!
- And don't call me "Ma."

210
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,773
Did they wanna go?

211
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:56,402
I don't suppose
it occurred to anybody to ask them, Billy.

212
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,911
They weren't bad, were they?

213
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,245
I mean, if they'd been bad, you'd have
run them out of town, wouldn't you?

214
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,150
Yeah, Billy.
If they'd been bad, I'd have run them out.

215
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,517
Then if they weren't bad
and they didn't wanna go,

216
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,022
how come they went?

217
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,079
Well...

218
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,456
Billy, someday you'll learn

219
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:14,462
that people don't always agree
on what's good and what's bad.

220
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,963
Now, about those ladies,

221
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,829
they were just practicing
the oldest profession on earth.

222
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,802
I thought being marshal
was the oldest profession.

223
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,033
- No, that's just second oldest.
- Well, then what's first?

224
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:30,535
You got yourself into this,
you get yourself out.

225
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,783
Well, Billy, you see, the...
The Lord made men and he made women.

226
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,980
And he...
Well, he didn't make them quite the same.

227
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,420
Gee, I know that.

228
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,118
- But why'd...
- Billy, that's enough questions.

229
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,821
Now, why don't you just run along?

230
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,988
Grownups don't tell kids nothing.

231
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:57,033
- Ma! Howard Boyle's here.
- Billy.

232
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,573
Come on in, Howard.

233
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,071
- Evening, Mary.
- Evening.

234
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:01,507
- Marshal.
- Howard.

235
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,375
The mayor wants to talk to you, Jim.

236
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,777
- Already?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,748
He decided to cooperate, huh?

238
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,648
I think you ought to come down
and see him yourself.

239
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,049
- You tell His Honor I'm on my way.
- Okay.

240
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:18,225
And, Howard, start rounding up a posse.

241
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,921
- I'd like to be on the flats by sunup.
- Right.

242
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:24,692
What's this about a posse?

243
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,361
Nothing to worry about, Mary.
Not now, anyway.

244
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,159
Jim.

245
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,138
- Be careful, will you?
- I'll be back.

246
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,704
Maybe then I'll take you to dinner.

247
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,470
Jim! Jim Boy, come on!

248
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,864
Come on!

249
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,546
Come on, Jim, this is for you.

250
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:15,915
Come on, this is it for you, Jim Boy.

251
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:20,117
Folks, this is a great day for our town.

252
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,157
Today we're gonna
pay our respects to a man

253
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,215
who has devoted 20 years of his life

254
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,091
to make this a safe
and decent place to live in.

255
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,598
You know, when Marshal James Flagg
came to our fair city,

256
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:36,365
it was untamed, lawless, frontier town.

257
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:40,397
But with honesty,
resolution and dedication,

258
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,410
regardless of personal danger,

259
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,478
James Flagg has tamed this town

260
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,640
and made it the prospering community
we all enjoy today!

261
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,011
And so it's come time for us

262
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,817
to pay the debt
we all owe to this courageous man

263
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,883
and to show our appreciation
for a job well done.

264
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,128
Jim Boy, in appreciation

265
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,229
for long and outstanding service,

266
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,929
we present you with this gift.

267
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,268
Well, open it, Jim Boy, open it.

268
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,211
Read the card, Jim, read the card.

269
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:32,015
"To James Flagg, Marshal emeritus."

270
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,494
Yes, that's the sentiment
we're gonna inscribe on it later.

271
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,190
I didn't have time today.

272
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:40,895
And, folks, with the watch
goes a full pension for life!

273
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:46,770
Carefree days of whittling and fishing.

274
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,710
And each year henceforth,
this day shall be known as Flagg Day!

275
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:02,087
Now we all know
that it's gonna be mighty difficult

276
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,419
to fill Marshal Flagg's boots,

277
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:07,588
but there is a man among us
who's gonna give it a first-rate try.

278
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,965
Howard Boyle has youth! He has integrity.

279
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,197
He's bold, ambitious and he's honest.

280
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,831
And he will give us the kind
of law enforcement that we all need.

281
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,303
I give you Howard Boyle.

282
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,685
"It's a... It's a great honor to..."

283
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,057
Louder, louder.

284
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,195
"It's a great honor

285
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,497
"to be chosen marshal of this fine city.

286
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,332
"I shall endeavor to carry out the duties

287
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,635
"and responsibilities of my new office

288
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:57,145
"in the fine tradition of my predecessor.

289
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,170
"With the..."

290
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:01,079
- Aid.
- "...aid and support

291
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:06,281
"of our great mayor and all of you,

292
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:09,688
"I feel confident of the continued growth

293
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,426
"and prosperity of our great city."

294
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,854
Thank you.

295
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,023
Howard, thank you.

296
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,659
And now, by way of celebrating,

297
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,468
the town treasury,
with a little persuading from me,

298
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,031
has decided to foot the bill at Polly's.

299
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,901
Drinks on the house.

300
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:33,302
<i>A lawman's lost when he has no star</i>

301
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:37,734
<i>And when you're licked</i>
<i>people know you are</i>

302
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:43,212
<i>They give him a watch and with that gem</i>

303
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:46,516
<i>In a minute flat he's just a bust</i>

304
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:51,582
<i>'Cause he's just like one of them</i>

305
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:58,198
<i>It's tough to hear</i>
<i>that you're all washed up</i>

306
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,668
<i>But he drinks the dregs of that bitter cup</i>

307
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:08,435
<i>He says, "You fool, keep cool, keep cool"</i>

308
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,880
<i>Then a door that's monogrammed</i>
<i>with his name is fiercely slammed</i>

309
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:15,541
<i>And then he thinks</i>

310
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:20,350
<i>"Well, I'll be damned"</i>

311
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,450
<i>Marshal Flagg</i>

312
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,222
<i>Marshal Flagg</i>

313
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:32,756
<i>Beneath his shirt his shoulders sag</i>

314
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:39,066
<i>Where to go, he doesn't know</i>

315
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:43,703
<i>No future for Marshal Flagg</i>

316
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:51,784
<i>No future for Marshal Flagg</i>

317
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,671
No, thank you.

318
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,679
I still don't figure what you're gonna do.
You can't take them all on.

319
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,085
You aiming to get McKay first?

320
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,486
Don't know why you're even bothering.

321
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:06,115
Let McKay pull it off.
Teach that rotten town a lesson.

322
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,561
It's not the town's fault, Grundy.
They thought they were honoring me.

323
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:10,655
Honor!

324
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:13,530
Hell, they don't even know
the meaning of the word.

325
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:17,368
Why, probably not more than a dozen
even recollect

326
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:21,808
what a hellhole that place was
before you pinned on your badge.

327
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,907
Well, it's too late to
do anything about it now. It's done.

328
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,012
I got McKay to think about.

329
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,775
- I'll get my gun.
- Oh no, you're not coming.

330
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,253
- Why not?
- It's not your job.

331
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:36,916
Well, it ain't yours no more either,
damn it!

332
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:40,257
- They fired you!
- Thanks for the hospitality, Grundy.

333
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,320
You got a nice warm place in there.
You ought to try it sometime.

334
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,261
You go getting killed,
don't come running back here.

335
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,164
Damn fool.

336
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,702
Damn fool!

337
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:26,896
Beats me.

338
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,538
- It's open.
- When the hell are we gonna move?

339
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,904
- Cards.
- Two.

340
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,676
Waco knows what he's doing.

341
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,946
- Found out about the shipment, didn't he?
- Besides, today's Friday.

342
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,283
The money don't come in till tomorrow,
so what's the hurry?

343
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,687
The hurry is
I get jumpy just sitting around.

344
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,781
Jumpy?

345
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,088
What the hell's to get jumpy
about this job?

346
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,561
Town full of hicks, it'll be a pushover.

347
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,255
Yeah, if there ain't any Pinkerton men.

348
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:53,324
For that kind of money,
a man's gotta figure on some risk.

349
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:57,667
Risks or no risk, it sure beats the hell
out of busting your back for $3 a day.

350
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,100
- Cards.
- Two.

351
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:05,235
Three.

352
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:16,151
It's your bet.

353
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,017
By me.

354
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:22,420
Your bet.

355
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,440
I swear one day I'm gonna stuff my boot
right down that old man's mouth.

356
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,339
I don't know why we drug him along
in the first place.

357
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,708
He's supposed to know this country.

358
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,180
He had a... Had a gang once
that operated in these parts.

359
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:44,446
Hard to imagine, ain't it?
Him leading a gang.

360
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:45,548
Call.

361
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:48,946
That and that better.

362
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,324
Up.

363
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,999
Turn around.

364
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,739
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

365
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:19,844
Name is Flagg. James Flagg. US Marshal.

366
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,684
Marshal? That old man?

367
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,888
Flagg?

368
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,294
McKay?

369
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,109
Get them saddled.

370
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:49,808
You spook them horses?

371
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,244
- I asked you a question, mister.
- He spooked them.

372
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:56,514
Sneaked up on McKay, I hit him.

373
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,492
- What do you want this old buzzard for?
- He says he's a marshal.

374
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:05,932
- He sure don't look like no marshal to me.
- This is James Flagg.

375
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,025
Now who the hell is James Flagg?

376
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,367
Who the hell is James Flagg?

377
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,502
He's the toughest marshal
this side of the Mississippi.

378
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,135
Oh, yeah?

379
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:23,681
- What town you toughest marshal of?
- Purgatory.

380
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:26,919
He's the marshal of Purgatory
down along the Forks River.

381
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,183
You're a little outside of your territory,
ain't you?

382
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,725
Purgatory's more than
100 miles from here.

383
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:36,063
You sure this isn't
another one of your wild stories?

384
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,365
If you're a marshal, let's see your badge.
I don't see no badge.

385
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,427
I lost it.

386
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,636
Well, the famous marshal lost his badge.

387
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,173
He's a marshal like you're Calamity Jane.

388
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:57,040
Mount them up, Deuce.
We're heading for Progress.

389
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,054
What are we gonna do with him?

390
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,048
Shoot him.

391
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,222
Can't go cold-blooded
killing a man like that.

392
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:09,957
Well, then stay here and hold his hand.
Pick you up Saturday.

393
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:12,525
Better anyhow.
That way you'll be out of my hair.

394
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,658
Now wait a minute, Waco!

395
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,033
Now, listen, McKay,
you're here on a free ride and you know it.

396
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:17,935
You're hanging on by your teeth.

397
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,066
Now, you want to come, you put a bullet
in your marshal friend, here.

398
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,508
If not, you stay here and hold his hand.

399
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,671
Either way, it don't matter to me.

400
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,733
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I never would've believed it.

401
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:50,202
Now, don't you get any fool notions.
This is still my gang.

402
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,072
- Waco works for me.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

403
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:01,208
I never figured I'd see the day that
John McKay was rawhided by a green kid.

404
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,910
Rawhided? Look who's been rawhided!

405
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,782
You walk in here, broad as daylight,

406
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:08,049
you take three steps
and you get your scalp parted.

407
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:11,751
You put that cannon away,
and I'll show you whose scalp gets parted.

408
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,294
Oh, no.
I leave fool stunts like that to marshals.

409
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:17,525
- Why, you flabby...
- Don't give me an excuse to use this.

410
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,233
All these years and you still get riled up
just thinking about it.

411
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,102
I get riled up when I think about a man
breaking his word.

412
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:27,698
- Never gave you my word.
- The hell you didn't!

413
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,174
Oh, the hell I did!

414
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,109
You told me
that you wouldn't pull anything

415
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,647
and the minute I turned around
you damn near knocked my head off!

416
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:34,943
What'd you expect me to do?

417
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:36,779
Let you take me in
and spend 20 years in jail?

418
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,512
I expected you to keep your word.

419
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,111
I promised. I never gave you my word.

420
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,054
Well, what the hell is the difference?

421
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:46,287
One's a promise, the other's my word!
That's the difference.

422
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,350
Oh, no.

423
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,261
Sun never set on the day that Big John
broke his word to a friend or an enemy.

424
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,698
What was that business
about me being Marshal of Purgatory?

425
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,900
Waco would've shot you right on the spot

426
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,602
if he knew
you were the Marshal of Progress.

427
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,577
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

428
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:07,246
I just don't go for unnecessary killing.

429
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,078
I still can't get over it.
All these years and you're still hunting me.

430
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,619
I was hunting jackrabbits, not you.

431
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,593
Matter of fact,
I forgot about you years ago.

432
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:23,893
I heard you got killed
down along the Red River.

433
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,023
Red River.

434
00:31:26,768 --> 00:31:29,635
That job would've made
the James gang look like city boys.

435
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:33,504
Three express cars!
More gold than in a dozen banks.

436
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,203
- And more Pinkerton men, too.
- Still don't know how I made it.

437
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,370
I did get two slugs. Right there.

438
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:43,814
Guess the bullet with Big John's
name on it just ain't been fired yet.

439
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,918
You damned idiot! I'd have hit him!

440
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,107
Get him. Come on, boy.

441
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,202
Damn fool.

442
00:33:58,252 --> 00:34:00,846
Carmel, you grow more beautiful
every year.

443
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,014
Thank you.

444
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:03,646
To you.

445
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,089
I do feel wicked imbibing before sundown.

446
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,952
Well...

447
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,391
<i>Voilà!</i>

448
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,792
Sundown.

449
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:19,537
Oh, Mayor Wilker.

450
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,941
You know, Mayor Wilker is so... So formal.

451
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,501
My... My Christian name is Randolph.

452
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,244
- Randolph?
- Yes, but to you it's Randy.

453
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:31,448
- Now, Randolph...
- No, Randy.

454
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,047
Randy, we must remember I'm a Mrs.

455
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,587
I, my dear, am a mister.

456
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,153
- Please! If my husband knew, why...
- Never fear.

457
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:48,359
Your husband is aware
only of engines, valves, gasoline.

458
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,463
- It's true, I'm afraid.
- Yes.

459
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:52,597
Every weekend he's out and about
in his automobile,

460
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,164
while you, in the bloom of your youth
and beauty, are left alone,

461
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:57,575
unattended, like an unplucked rose!

462
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,144
- Yes.
- Wasting away.

463
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:03,574
- Yes. Yes!
- A victim of internal combustion.

464
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:06,711
That's why
we belong together, Carmel, dear.

465
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:11,191
You, a Ionely woman.
I, a Ionely public servant.

466
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:15,252
Both of us love-starved victims
on the altar of progress.

467
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,927
Are you Ionely?

468
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,722
Lonely?

469
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,696
Carmel, dear.

470
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,398
When I sit at my desk,

471
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,232
pondering the awesome
responsibilities of my office,

472
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,835
I'm probably
the Ioneliest man in the world.

473
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,781
- You poor man.
- Yes.

474
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,582
So your mayor needs assistance, devotion,

475
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:44,186
and patriotic support.
You are patriotic, aren't you?

476
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,453
I'm a member of the DGW.

477
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:50,986
The what?

478
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:55,098
Daughters of George Washington.
We're more patriotic than anybody.

479
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,538
Well, that's what I'm gonna appeal to,
your patriotism.

480
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:04,967
There.

481
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,704
There.

482
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:12,016
You see, what I need... What I need

483
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,149
is the warmth of my constituents.

484
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:20,324
- Yes, the warmth.
- Their affection.

485
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:23,192
Yes, their affection.

486
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,598
Their spiritual sustenance.

487
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,897
Yes, their spiritual substance.

488
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,201
Yes, my dear, substance.

489
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:49,781
Mayor.

490
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,692
Randolph.

491
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:58,431
- Randy!
- Mayor?

492
00:36:58,499 --> 00:36:59,932
Yes? Flagg!

493
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:04,037
Well, it's nice to see you, Mrs. Flannahan.

494
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:07,666
We'll discuss your suggestion
at the next council meeting.

495
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:15,944
Have you gone crazy?

496
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,008
- Mayor, this is...
- Don't you know what doors are for?

497
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:19,746
- Mayor...
- Don't you know how to knock?

498
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,811
- But...
- Are you totally out of your mind?

499
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:22,981
Will you listen to me?

500
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:25,025
It'll take a $10 bottle of perfume
to smooth this over.

501
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,084
- Mayor, this is Big John McKay.
- I want to get to the Emporium.

502
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,630
Didn't you hear me, Mayor?
This is John McKay.

503
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:33,030
- Fella I was telling you about.
- Yes, yes.

504
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,397
Of course, we'll discuss it later.

505
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:38,234
- But his gang is in town right now.
- Right you are, Jim Boy.

506
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:42,242
But, Mayor, the bank! Tomorrow's train.
The money!

507
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,868
Look, Jim Boy, you're retired.

508
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,845
Now you don't have to
think about those things.

509
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,347
Now, just go home, relax, go fishing.

510
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:51,675
- Boyle can handle these things.
- These men will eat Boyle alive!

511
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:54,186
Come on now, Jim, don't exaggerate.

512
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,290
Now, Jim Boy, you know
my office is always open to you,

513
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,761
but next time knock a little.
You know what I mean?

514
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,957
You scare the hell out of a man,
barging in like that.

515
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,159
And both of you, take a bath,
you're a sight!

516
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:10,567
Listen, Jim Boy,
could you stop at the Emporium and...

517
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,469
You buy your own damn perfume!

518
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,236
Right you are, right you are, Jim Boy.

519
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:20,475
Retired? Jim Boy! Jim Boy's been retired.

520
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,249
What'd they do, throw you out
for some fancy-pants young dandy?

521
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:25,683
- Come on, move.
- So that's it, ain't it?

522
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:29,222
After all those years,
they give you a gold watch

523
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,453
and a pat on the back
and a kick in the ass, didn't they?

524
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,561
They say there's no honor among thieves.

525
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,619
Look.

526
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,765
What's happened makes no difference
as far as you're concerned.

527
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:43,668
You're my job, badge or no badge.
Now mount up.

528
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:47,966
Come tomorrow, I'm gonna
take you over to the county seat

529
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,907
and turn you over to the US Marshal.

530
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:51,069
Where to now?

531
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,511
You go back up on your mountain
and try to stay out of trouble.

532
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,744
- Yeah, but, Jim, you...
- Will you do like I said, Grundy?

533
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,516
Damn fool!

534
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,051
Just like you said, Waco,
train's due at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

535
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,557
You seen that new bank yet?

536
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:43,730
It's gonna take a ton of dynamite
to blow it.

537
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,561
That's why we ain't gonna try.

538
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,034
- I thought you told me the plan was...
- Plan's been changed.

539
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,431
We'll make our move at the depot when
they unload the money from the train.

540
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,840
And we hit them from all sides at once.

541
00:39:58,012 --> 00:39:59,707
You two spread the word.

542
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,780
We'll meet at the depot in the morning.

543
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,983
Tell the boys
to stay out of trouble tonight.

544
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:16,218
Tuber.

545
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,593
One schooner. Hi.

546
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,749
That'd warm a man's bed on a cold night.

547
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:16,723
This thing is over,
I think I'll get me one just like her.

548
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,814
Why wait?

549
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,425
How about a drink, honey?

550
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,362
I don't drink with customers.

551
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,864
Deuce!

552
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,372
Waco don't want no trouble tonight.

553
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:48,548
Here we are.

554
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:53,158
- Here, let me help.
- Oh, that's all right.

555
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:59,690
Well, I'm pleased to know
there's one gentleman here, anyway.

556
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:04,130
James, are those really necessary?

557
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,532
- Yes, they are really necessary.
- Thank you anyway, ma'am.

558
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,905
It's all right.

559
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,069
- That's delicious.
- Really?

560
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:16,045
- As good as Mrs. McKay's?
- Mrs. McKay's?

561
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,777
You really believe there's a woman

562
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:19,910
fool enough to get hitched up
with the likes of that one?

563
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:23,218
James Flagg,
I'll ask you to mind your manners.

564
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,781
You may have your reasons
for behaving like this,

565
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,657
but as long as Mr. McKay
is a guest in my home,

566
00:42:28,729 --> 00:42:30,720
I want him treated courteously.

567
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,291
Courteously?

568
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,859
- That thieving, low-down...
- James!

569
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,628
I'm sorry, Mr. McKay.

570
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:41,573
It just seems that some folks have
never really learned proper manners.

571
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,745
Thank you, ma'am. But I've...
I've learned to make allowances.

572
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,514
Well if there's anything else you'd like,
just call.

573
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:53,747
- Good night, ma'am. And thank you again.
- You're welcome.

574
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,585
Jim Boy, the sugar.
I'll take just a smidgen.

575
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,353
- Jim Boy?
- I'm a guest.

576
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,363
Just a smidgen.

577
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:11,830
Thank you.

578
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,205
- Mrs. McKay. That'll be the day.
- There was.

579
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:19,811
- Was what?
- A Mrs. McKay.

580
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,817
I don't believe it.
When could you've gotten married?

581
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:27,877
After the Red River job.
I was shot up pretty bad.

582
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,583
So I went up to Canada for a spell.

583
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,821
There was this woman...

584
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:38,320
So?

585
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,127
Forget it.

586
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:43,996
Well, who was she?

587
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:48,073
A Quaker gal.

588
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:52,537
You have got to be
the world's biggest liar.

589
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:57,383
Are you telling this straight?

590
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:00,845
A real fire and brimstone Quaker?

591
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:04,451
Well, if you're not lying,

592
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,392
how come you're not up there in Canada
with your wife?

593
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:08,587
She died.

594
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,558
The fever. Two days, it was all over.

595
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:13,992
Everything.

596
00:44:17,671 --> 00:44:18,968
Any young'uns?

597
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,005
One. A boy.

598
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:25,174
It's been five years since I seen him.

599
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,839
- Who's taking care of him?
- His ma's kin.

600
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,418
Five years, that makes him almost 11.

601
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:37,984
How about you, did you ever get hitched?

602
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:39,981
Nope.

603
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,187
Never did.

604
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:58,109
- Billy, what are you doing up this late?
- I heard you talking.

605
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:00,276
It's you, Mr. McKay.

606
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,951
Beats me how you'd even know
who it is anymore.

607
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:11,582
Gosh, Mr. McKay,
I knew it was you the minute I saw you.

608
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:13,353
Jim's told me all about you.

609
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:17,124
Why, he says you're the most famous
train robber in the whole world.

610
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:20,424
Did you come to rob a train, Mr. McKay?

611
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,366
Don't you think you'd better
get back to bed, Billy?

612
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:24,563
Jim, do I have to?

613
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,903
Your ma catches you down here,
she's gonna tan all our hides. Now get.

614
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,135
Hey, Billy.

615
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:32,735
I'd consider it a favor
if you'd sell this poster to me.

616
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:34,307
Oh, no, sir.

617
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:38,784
Jim gave it to me for my scrapbook.
I could never sell it, not for anything.

618
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,948
I understand.

619
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,016
But here.

620
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:09,145
What ever happened to the rest of them,
the ones that didn't go to Red River?

621
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:11,582
They're gone. They're all gone.

622
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:15,317
Smiley was hung,
over Tulsa way a few years back.

623
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:19,123
Jessup was killed by
the Pinkertons on the Union Pacific.

624
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:23,094
Blanchard was shot
in a stud game over in Tombstone.

625
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:26,699
Doc Samuels put a bullet in his own head.

626
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,393
They're all gone.

627
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:32,166
- What about your bunch?
- The same. They're all dead.

628
00:46:32,973 --> 00:46:36,932
Owens. Blake. Kincaid. Haggarty.

629
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:39,677
Even old Dawson.

630
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:41,947
Marshal Abilene?

631
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,813
Eyes got so bad
he couldn't hit a six-foot fence.

632
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,849
They still bushwhacked him.

633
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,381
Shot him in the back,
at night from an alley.

634
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:54,860
Back-shooting, bushwhacking...
That's all the young ones know nowadays.

635
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:57,522
They got no pride, they got no honor.

636
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,898
Just ain't no fun anymore.

637
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:09,704
You got a privy out back?

638
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:13,571
What do you mean, out back?
The name of this town is Progress.

639
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:14,909
We got one right here in the house.

640
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,474
- In the house?
- Yeah.

641
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:20,085
Right there under the stairs.

642
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,637
You gonna hold my hand?

643
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:11,027
Well, I'll be damned!

644
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,303
Grundy.

645
00:48:47,774 --> 00:48:51,301
Well now, time sure ain't been
no enemy of yours.

646
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:54,472
- You look fine, Polly.
- Thanks.

647
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,476
Now what brings you to town?

648
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:01,009
Oh, I just figured I'd pay a visit,
see how civilization's coming along.

649
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:02,680
Ain't too encouraging.

650
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:06,017
Ralph, a glass of our worst for my friend.

651
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:11,225
You tired, boy?

652
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,805
Store-bought whiskey! Ain't got no kick.

653
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,900
She ain't too good to drink
with an old mule skinner.

654
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:26,735
Guess whatever women want,
you ain't got.

655
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:28,570
Yeah?

656
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:31,411
Watch.

657
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,514
Hey, I thought you didn't drink
with the customers.

658
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,648
That's right.

659
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,453
Well, what do you call this old rummy?

660
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:41,994
- Rummy?
- He's a friend.

661
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:45,723
Well, that's all I wanna be, honey.
Just a friend.

662
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:47,323
Why, you...

663
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,977
You just made a bad mistake, old man.

664
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:06,782
Don't. Drop it! Drop it!

665
00:50:09,623 --> 00:50:11,022
You're a pushy one, ain't you?

666
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,996
Well, you're still young,
maybe you'll learn.

667
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,297
Thanks for the drink, Polly.

668
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:43,379
Old man!

669
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:50,057
Grundy!

670
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:54,599
Oh, Grundy.

671
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,037
Well, somebody get a doctor, hurry!

672
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,103
Polly, get me to Flagg.

673
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:08,437
It was a fair fight.

674
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,809
Fair fight?

675
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:13,485
He didn't have a chance.

676
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:19,521
Now it's your turn, mister!

677
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,893
- Polly, put the gun down.
- No!

678
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:25,731
I'll take that gun.

679
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:29,329
Come get it.

680
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:37,403
Thanks.

681
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,046
Anytime, Marshal.
I believe in law and order.

682
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,853
Come on, I'll help you get him to the jail.

683
00:52:02,903 --> 00:52:04,427
There was a razor.

684
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,814
Oh, the hell with them.

685
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:25,356
Jim! Grundy!

686
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:36,061
Grundy, for the love of...

687
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:37,624
They're all over town.

688
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:39,670
I thought I told you to stay out of trouble.

689
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:42,832
I could have took him, Jim,
if he'd fought fair.

690
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,134
I could have took him.

691
00:52:46,278 --> 00:52:47,677
Jim, I...

692
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:21,373
Jim, you're out-gunned.

693
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,407
There's nothing you can do about it,
short of taking on a dozen men

694
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:26,950
and getting yourself blasted
all the way to hell.

695
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:28,747
You got any bright ideas?

696
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:33,616
Going fishing sure does take
the miseries out of a man.

697
00:54:08,493 --> 00:54:10,984
Gonna have to fix that, one of these days.

698
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:16,496
Once every fall
for 10 years you've said that.

699
00:54:17,035 --> 00:54:18,525
Yeah, I guess.

700
00:54:24,676 --> 00:54:25,973
It's cold.

701
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,447
- Let's go on inside, huh?
- I'll be along.

702
00:54:31,883 --> 00:54:33,817
You'll just catch your death
standing out here.

703
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:35,375
I'll be along, Mary.

704
00:54:42,394 --> 00:54:46,831
Jim, I know what's going
through your mind.

705
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:53,363
But please, don't do anything foolish.

706
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,436
He was my friend, Mary.

707
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:59,944
- He died doing my job.
- I know.

708
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:04,878
But there are too many of them.

709
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:09,480
You'll just get yourself killed, too.

710
00:55:10,755 --> 00:55:12,916
Maybe it should have happened
a long time ago.

711
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:17,894
Men like me and McKay in there,
we've outlived our usefulness.

712
00:55:19,698 --> 00:55:23,896
Why, that is just nonsense.

713
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,403
Why, you're as needed now
as you ever were.

714
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:33,101
Yeah, that's why the town gave me
that nice, shiny new watch yesterday.

715
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:37,774
Oh, I'm not just talking about the town.
You're needed here.

716
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:48,816
I mean, Billy needs you.

717
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:51,827
You're the only father he's ever known.

718
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:58,469
And I need you, too.

719
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:22,582
- Randy?
- Yeah.

720
00:56:25,397 --> 00:56:29,766
You're not gonna desert me, are you?
Not after last night.

721
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,802
My dear, sweet Carmel,

722
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:41,843
you know, nothing on Earth could
provide me with more pleasure

723
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:43,710
than spending the entire day with you.

724
00:56:43,782 --> 00:56:49,516
Lolling idly,
partaking of your bountiful fruits.

725
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:52,445
But consider this.

726
00:56:53,024 --> 00:56:55,686
Would our love be as magnificent
if it flourished

727
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,024
at the expense of Progress' progress?

728
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:01,428
Could any man ask for more than you?

729
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:04,593
My sweet, I think not.

730
00:57:06,137 --> 00:57:07,468
You're so handsome.

731
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,706
I wanna tell the whole wide world
how wonderful you are.

732
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:13,175
Oh, no!

733
00:57:13,244 --> 00:57:16,236
I mean, don't think I don't appreciate
your gesture, my flower,

734
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:19,772
but I don't need anyone
to blow my trumpet for me.

735
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,615
Besides, I think it would prove prudent

736
00:57:24,689 --> 00:57:27,385
if our mutual respect
remains a private affair.

737
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,288
Oh, by the way.

738
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:31,688
Your husband,
what time was he expected to return?

739
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:05,493
Mayor! Mayor! Hey, Mayor!

740
00:58:05,563 --> 00:58:08,589
- We wanna see the killer.
- Yeah, can we go to the jail and see him?

741
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:11,260
Wait a minute. What...
What's all this killer talk?

742
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:12,701
We don't have any killer in jail.

743
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,795
The heck there ain't! You know he's there.

744
00:58:14,873 --> 00:58:16,363
The one that shot the old man.

745
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:19,877
- Grundy, that's his name. Grundy.
- Yeah, that's the one.

746
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:21,844
We want to see the killer
that shot Grundy.

747
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:23,244
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, boys.

748
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:24,679
I'll go over and talk to Marshal Boyle.

749
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:27,445
If he says it's all right,
then we can take a quick look.

750
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:28,986
I'll be right back.

751
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:33,421
We want to see him, Mayor!
Or we ain't gonna vote for you!

752
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:37,492
Little bastards.

753
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:48,998
Howard!

754
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:55,042
Howard. Howard.

755
00:59:36,454 --> 00:59:38,752
- Good morning, Turk.
- Well, morning, Mayor.

756
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:41,314
- The Express on time?
- Last I heard.

757
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,196
Say, Turk, you notice
anything funny going on?

758
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:51,165
No. No.

759
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:56,900
- Heard from your wife, Mayor?
- Wife?

760
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:00,676
Think she's enjoying herself
back in St. Louis?

761
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:06,940
Yes. Yes, fine. Just fine.

762
01:00:07,018 --> 01:00:09,509
Course I haven't heard
when she's coming back.

763
01:00:09,587 --> 01:00:11,077
See you around, Sam.

764
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,427
You done real good.

765
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:20,054
Now just sit back and relax.

766
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,931
Mary! Mary.

767
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,634
- Mayor Wilker.
- Yes. Where's Jim?

768
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:30,503
- Oh, right in there.
- Thank you.

769
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:34,511
Jim Boy, we're in trouble.
We are in big trouble. Good morning.

770
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:36,342
What's he doing here?

771
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:37,938
Well, what the hell
did you expect me to do?

772
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,176
You wouldn't let me lock him up.

773
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,911
Oh, you're right. You're right.

774
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:43,010
I was a fool not to listen,
a thickheaded fool.

775
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:45,988
But look that... That's water over the dam.
We can't cry over spilled milk.

776
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,992
Now look, the real problem is,
what are we gonna do now?

777
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,049
They're all over town.

778
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,789
There's one holding a gun
on Turk down at the depot.

779
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:54,559
- What about your boy, Howard?
- He's gone! Disappeared!

780
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:55,860
Do they suspect
that you're onto them yet?

781
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:57,525
Yes, I think... No, I don't think so, no.

782
01:00:57,602 --> 01:00:59,160
Listen, Jim,
we've got to think of something!

783
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:01,228
- They're gonna rob the bank!
- Oh, no.

784
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:02,863
I don't think we have
to worry about the bank.

785
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,964
What are you saying?

786
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:05,634
The way I figure, if they're bright,

787
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,940
they'll have that money
long before it gets to the bank.

788
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:12,042
Brilliant. Jim Boy, that's brilliant!

789
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:15,574
Of course, they'll steal
the money en route. Of course.

790
01:01:16,187 --> 01:01:18,747
- Well, how does knowing that help us?
- It doesn't.

791
01:01:18,823 --> 01:01:20,984
Well, we just can't let them
steal the money.

792
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,220
There's an election
coming up in two weeks.

793
01:01:23,294 --> 01:01:25,626
We'll pass out guns, arm the men.

794
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:28,063
And start a war? You think those people
are gonna re-elect you

795
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:29,463
if half the town is massacred?

796
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:33,760
You're right, Jim Boy, you're right.
This is gonna take something special.

797
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:36,136
Say, why don't you go up on the roof
and pick off a few?

798
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:37,504
That's something special all right.

799
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:39,304
That's special enough
to get Flagg's head blown off.

800
01:01:39,377 --> 01:01:41,436
- You shut up, McKay.
- Wait a minute, now, Jim Boy.

801
01:01:41,512 --> 01:01:45,004
Maybe Mr. McKay here
has something constructive to contribute.

802
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:48,519
There's only one plan
and it's as plain as the nose on your face.

803
01:01:48,586 --> 01:01:51,714
You can't stop them from getting
the money once the train gets into town.

804
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:53,086
And since they're covering the telegraph,

805
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:55,352
you can't stop the train
from coming into town.

806
01:01:55,426 --> 01:01:58,657
What you gotta do is stop the train
from stopping in town!

807
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:04,931
- What? Stop the train from stopping?
- The train just steams right on through.

808
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,061
Fellas down at the depot
would be looking mighty foolish.

809
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:09,129
But the train will stop, it always does!

810
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:11,937
Not if somebody boards it
and tells them not to.

811
01:02:15,246 --> 01:02:17,840
A tremendous idea.

812
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:22,418
That is bold, that is inventive,
it is audacious.

813
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:25,456
It's worthy of your reputation, Mr. McKay.
I am impressed!

814
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:27,923
- Well...
- Well, that's the plan, Jim Boy.

815
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:31,587
We ride out of town, board the train,
just roar right on through.

816
01:02:32,029 --> 01:02:34,554
- What do you mean we?
- Well, of course I'm coming.

817
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:37,863
You don't think I'd let an opportunity
like this slip by, do you?

818
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:41,098
I mean, have you any idea
what this can do for my career?

819
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,363
Oh, I can see it now.

820
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:47,571
Crisscrossing the country,
delivering lectures on law and order.

821
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:50,471
The need for positive action!

822
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:52,345
Civic responsibility!

823
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,813
Yes, I could write a book.

824
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:57,184
I could write a weekly column
syndicated all over the country.

825
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:58,415
The world.

826
01:02:58,923 --> 01:03:02,882
You know, I could be governor.
Maybe even president.

827
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:05,354
President Randolph Wilker.

828
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,027
Oh boy, there'd be no stopping me.

829
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:08,087
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

830
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:09,997
I should mention something
kind of important.

831
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,500
- Please, go ahead.
- If you're gonna pull this off,

832
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:14,629
you're gonna have to board a train
at a dead run, and if you ain't careful...

833
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:17,196
- Dead run, that means while it's moving?
- While it's moving.

834
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:19,675
If you ain't careful,
you could wind up like Dusty Boggs.

835
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:21,211
- Dusty Boggs?
- He boarded a train once.

836
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:22,678
- Oh, what happened to him?
- I don't know.

837
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:24,977
All we found was a grease slick
along the cinder bed.

838
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:30,419
You make an excellent point, Mr. McKay.
Yes, I should be more prudent.

839
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:32,080
I have a whole town to worry about.

840
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,556
If this was for my own safety,
there'd be no hesitation,

841
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:37,458
but I do have a public trust.

842
01:03:37,528 --> 01:03:39,359
Country's just lost a president.

843
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:40,863
Tell you what you do, Mr. Mayor.

844
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:43,594
You go downtown, circulate around,
let yourself be seen,

845
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:45,295
and just don't let on
that you suspect anything.

846
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:47,667
- Right, Jim Boy. What are you gonna do?
- Board the train.

847
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:49,103
- Alone?
- Alone.

848
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:50,936
Well, what about McKay here?
Why can't he go along?

849
01:03:51,008 --> 01:03:53,977
- Because he's one of them, that's why!
- Not anymore, he's not.

850
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,877
Isn't that right, Mr. McKay?

851
01:04:03,654 --> 01:04:05,679
Yes, ma'am.

852
01:04:05,756 --> 01:04:08,748
As of that old man, Grundy,
I ain't got no ties.

853
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,628
Like I said,
I don't go for unnecessary killing.

854
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:14,992
Then you'll go together.

855
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,637
There. Now shake.

856
01:04:28,379 --> 01:04:32,145
- Do I have your word this time?
- You got it.

857
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:05,042
<i>They're partners now in a frantic chase</i>

858
01:05:05,116 --> 01:05:08,552
<i>Determined looks are upon each face</i>

859
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:12,385
<i>They ride through the trails</i>
<i>of the Ionesome hills</i>

860
01:05:12,456 --> 01:05:15,289
<i>And you know these men are real men</i>

861
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,658
<i>Real men with iron wills</i>

862
01:05:20,865 --> 01:05:24,130
<i>There's just one thought</i>
<i>running through each brain</i>

863
01:05:24,201 --> 01:05:27,693
<i>They won't give up</i>
<i>till they catch that train</i>

864
01:05:27,772 --> 01:05:31,435
<i>They work and sweat to pay a debt</i>

865
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:33,340
<i>To a most ungrateful town</i>

866
01:05:33,411 --> 01:05:35,311
<i>They said that Flagg's a clown</i>

867
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:39,247
<i>The folks who let the marshal down</i>

868
01:05:45,156 --> 01:05:46,145
Jump!

869
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:55,061
Come on, you can make it!

870
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:57,995
Come on.

871
01:06:02,606 --> 01:06:04,301
Guess I'm a bit rusty.

872
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:10,179
- Throw up your hands!
- Reach for the sky.

873
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:12,374
- We got you covered.
- Relax, fellas.

874
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:14,847
My name is James Flagg,
I'm the Marshal of Progress.

875
01:06:14,919 --> 01:06:17,183
Marshal, huh? Let's see your badge.

876
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:19,017
I don't happen to have it
with me right now.

877
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:21,183
I know you. You're Big John McKay.

878
01:06:21,892 --> 01:06:24,861
I was on the Missouri-St. Paul in '88
when you and your outlaw gang

879
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:26,521
robbed us of $18,000.

880
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:28,224
Now, there is gonna be a train robbery.

881
01:06:28,299 --> 01:06:29,994
But we're not the ones
that are gonna pull it off.

882
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:31,261
You bet your boots you ain't!

883
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:34,236
One move and I'll splatter you
all over the rear of this car.

884
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:35,397
Lock them up, Bump.

885
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:36,997
We'll be in Progress before long

886
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:39,599
and then we can turn these two varmints
over to the real marshal.

887
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:41,645
- Where'll I put them, Tick?
- Put them in the privy.

888
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:44,112
- It's a good place for their kind.
- All right, come on, move!

889
01:06:49,487 --> 01:06:50,511
Move!

890
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:54,787
Just keep calm, folks.
Everything's well in hand.

891
01:06:56,394 --> 01:06:57,452
Inside.

892
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:08,100
Imagine him remembering me
after all these years.

893
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,478
Bumper, you stay and guard them,
and watch them like a hawk.

894
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,745
Yes, sir. Don't worry none about me.

895
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,327
Marshal! Marshal Boyle!

896
01:08:05,396 --> 01:08:08,160
- Is Marshal Boyle here?
- You got eyes, ain't you?

897
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:18,897
You're the hooligan that killed
that old man last night, aren't you?

898
01:08:18,976 --> 01:08:20,068
What of it?

899
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:22,612
Well, hanging is too good
for the likes of you.

900
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,911
If I were a man, I'd take you out
and give you a good thrashing.

901
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,646
Weren't for that dress, I'd think
you were a man, you ugly old wart.

902
01:08:33,424 --> 01:08:34,721
Wart!

903
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:36,457
Ugly!

904
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:38,154
Ugly old wart!

905
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,548
Good citizen was just here asking for you.

906
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:02,114
Just figured you'd like to know
you haven't been forgot.

907
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:34,017
This damned thing
is smaller than I remember.

908
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:54,767
Bridge! Bridge! Bridge! Bridge.

909
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,098
- Morning.
- Morning.

910
01:11:49,019 --> 01:11:50,816
I got the skinny one, Tick.

911
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:53,219
Come on, we'll head them off up front.

912
01:11:54,024 --> 01:11:57,551
- You hit?
- Hit, hell! I just slipped. Come on, let's go.

913
01:11:57,628 --> 01:11:59,892
Relax, folks, nothing to worry about.

914
01:13:28,118 --> 01:13:29,710
We got them, Bump.

915
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:28,960
Flooded.

916
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:46,415
Harry, the train.

917
01:15:48,025 --> 01:15:52,394
Doris, we are here. The depot is there.

918
01:15:52,462 --> 01:15:54,123
Trains stop at depots.

919
01:16:14,451 --> 01:16:18,649
Harry. Harry.
It doesn't seem to be slowing down.

920
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:25,052
- Are you sure, Harry?
- Doris, please.

921
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:37,634
Harry, it didn't stop.

922
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:04,523
Everybody! Hey! Stop, stop! Stop!

923
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:08,935
Everybody! Up in arms!
Up in arms, everybody!

924
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:11,941
They're gonna rob the train.
Follow that train.

925
01:17:12,009 --> 01:17:13,909
- Everybody!
- Tallyho!

926
01:18:30,253 --> 01:18:31,379
Three no trump.

927
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:37,518
That's it, boys, we're gaining on them.

928
01:18:42,566 --> 01:18:43,555
Four of hearts.

929
01:18:48,672 --> 01:18:53,700
They're the bad guys, not us,
and they're gaining on us!

930
01:18:53,777 --> 01:18:55,267
Now what can we do?

931
01:18:55,846 --> 01:18:58,246
Look, get me down! Get me down!

932
01:19:42,526 --> 01:19:44,357
Hey, what the hell's he doing?

933
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:24,157
Double.

934
01:20:34,144 --> 01:20:35,611
They're gonna attack us.

935
01:21:04,374 --> 01:21:06,308
Damn it, I quit!

936
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,315
Beats the hell out of me.

937
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:18,418
Jump!

938
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:40,265
Redouble.

939
01:21:43,346 --> 01:21:46,372
Hey, dynamite! Dynamite!

940
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,265
Let's get out of here!

941
01:22:18,915 --> 01:22:21,247
Come on,
the honor of Progress is at stake.

942
01:22:21,318 --> 01:22:23,081
Come on, men, come on.

943
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,017
Forward!

944
01:22:46,142 --> 01:22:47,131
Stop!

945
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:48,801
I think he's trying to tell us something.

946
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:51,312
Stop! The bridge is out!

947
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:53,942
That's what he's trying to tell us!

948
01:22:59,689 --> 01:23:00,917
Pull!

949
01:23:01,658 --> 01:23:03,751
She's running wild! Jump!

950
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,790
Hell of a way to run a railroad.

951
01:24:00,283 --> 01:24:01,978
Get that money out of there!

952
01:24:20,036 --> 01:24:22,504
Hurry it up! We ain't got all day!

953
01:24:48,898 --> 01:24:49,887
See them?

954
01:24:55,705 --> 01:24:57,696
Maybe we ought to get out of...

955
01:25:06,316 --> 01:25:07,806
Should we join them?

956
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,657
Let's get the hell out of here!

957
01:25:29,339 --> 01:25:30,601
Waco!

958
01:25:57,634 --> 01:25:59,625
You sure got style, McKay.

959
01:26:00,036 --> 01:26:01,765
I'll say that much for you.

960
01:26:20,557 --> 01:26:23,958
- I thought I could beat him.
- You beat him.

961
01:26:44,414 --> 01:26:49,181
Jim! Jim Boy, you did it!
And you, Mr. McKay.

962
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:53,721
I have never witnessed a more splendid
example of audacity and valor.

963
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:57,123
This story will be told and re-told
around campfires

964
01:26:57,193 --> 01:27:00,458
by men who still admire courage and...
And daring and...

965
01:27:00,997 --> 01:27:02,191
- Yes, sir?
- Pardon me.

966
01:27:02,265 --> 01:27:04,392
I'm Dave Cargo of the New Mexico Press.

967
01:27:04,467 --> 01:27:05,764
How do you do, sir?

968
01:27:05,835 --> 01:27:09,999
Is there any truth to the rumor that
you're thinking of running for governor?

969
01:27:10,373 --> 01:27:11,704
Governor?

970
01:27:13,243 --> 01:27:18,875
Well, I must say I never even thought
about state office.

971
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:24,381
The responsibilities of mayor
are awesome enough, but governor?

972
01:27:25,421 --> 01:27:28,049
One can't be selfish,
I mean, if the country needs...

973
01:27:28,124 --> 01:27:30,024
I mean, the state needs me I...

974
01:27:31,194 --> 01:27:34,925
I've never been one to say no
to anyone in need.

975
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:38,357
For example, now you...
You take Progress...

976
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:39,526
Excuse me.

977
01:27:39,602 --> 01:27:42,332
You take Progress, for example.
Now, I came here...

978
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:43,702
You know something?

979
01:27:43,773 --> 01:27:46,435
I do believe one day
that man could be president.

980
01:27:46,509 --> 01:27:49,706
Yeah, he's amazing,
there's no getting around it.

981
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:52,339
That's the real 20th century man.

982
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:03,288
Hey, that was quite a show
you guys put on.

983
01:28:04,527 --> 01:28:07,963
Hey, look, Jim, I don't pretend
to be half the man you are.

984
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:09,498
I doubt if I ever will be.

985
01:28:09,565 --> 01:28:11,533
I... I'd appreciate it
if you'd take the badge back.

986
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:14,297
No, you can keep the badge, Howard.
I'm a retired man.

987
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:17,396
- Yeah, but the town needs you.
- Not anymore.

988
01:28:18,107 --> 01:28:20,041
No, you'll do just fine, Howard.

989
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:22,339
- Just one thing.
- What's that?

990
01:28:22,412 --> 01:28:25,677
You have to learn to tell
the good guys from the bad guys.

991
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:35,686
Catch that horse, McKay.

992
01:28:46,235 --> 01:28:49,136
Well, Flagg... What the hell are you doing?

993
01:28:49,205 --> 01:28:51,639
- I'm taking you in, McKay.
- Taking me in?

994
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:55,106
I didn't promise,
and I didn't give you my word.

995
01:28:55,545 --> 01:28:56,944
The sun never set on the day

996
01:28:57,013 --> 01:28:59,846
that James Flagg broke his word
to friend or enemy.

997
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:01,816
Now wait just a damn minute!

998
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:04,284
When you get out of jail you can take
that boy of yours fishing.

999
01:29:04,354 --> 01:29:06,845
He'll be an old man
by the time I get out of jail!

1000
01:29:06,923 --> 01:29:09,756
Oh, I doubt that.
Not after the way you helped out today.

1001
01:29:09,826 --> 01:29:11,225
Come on, let's go.

1002
01:29:12,028 --> 01:29:14,189
Flagg, you ain't even a marshal.

1003
01:29:15,131 --> 01:29:17,326
Now you know damn well
the first time you turn your back

1004
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,095
I'm gonna clout you
over the head and run off.

1005
01:29:19,469 --> 01:29:22,632
<i>A man is young then a man grows old</i>

1006
01:29:22,705 --> 01:29:23,729
Flagg!

1007
01:29:23,806 --> 01:29:26,366
<i>His blood's still warm</i>
<i>but his heart grows cold</i>

1008
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:27,534
Flagg!

1009
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:30,841
<i>He knows he's still the man he was</i>

1010
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:33,473
<i>And the folks are proud of everything</i>

1011
01:29:33,549 --> 01:29:36,382
<i>Everything the old man does</i>

1012
01:29:36,452 --> 01:29:38,477
Damn you, Flagg, listen to me!

1013
01:29:38,554 --> 01:29:42,012
<i>Marshal Flagg, Marshal Flagg</i>

1014
01:29:42,592 --> 01:29:47,689
<i>He doesn't boast and he doesn't brag</i>

1015
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:50,694
<i>Now younger folks</i>

1016
01:29:50,767 --> 01:29:53,235
<i>Aren't making jokes</i>

1017
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:56,600
<i>They're cheering for Marshal Flagg</i>

1018
01:29:56,672 --> 01:29:59,869
<i>Yes, they're cheering for Marshal Flagg</i>

1019
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:04,946
<i>Cheering for Marshal Flagg</i>
