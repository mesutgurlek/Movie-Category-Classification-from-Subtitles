1
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,286
Your last chance, Choya.

2
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,920
You come on out!
Come out with your hands up, Choya!

3
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,796
Makes no difference if you're guilty or not,
they'll hang you sure, Choya.

4
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,495
They don't care
that you drew in self-defense.

5
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,664
Funny. He was plumb good for nothing...

6
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,934
but there ain't nobody so no-account
but what somebody loves them.

7
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,978
You got any friends?

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,842
My guns.

9
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,446
- Kinfolk?
- My horse.

10
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,254
You don't make good sense, son.

11
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,491
Gunfighters never stop to think
how grief and hate pile up against them.

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,697
Throw out your guns, Choya!

13
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,766
There goes our million-dollar deal.

14
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,600
You shouldn't have picked him for this, Leff.

15
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,038
If he don't look for trouble,
trouble finds him.

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,339
Get up.

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,141
Come on.

18
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,986
Raise your hands.

19
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,358
Hold it!

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,126
He's got Dad Travis.

21
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,438
Let go of Dad! Give us shooting room.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,345
- Watch out for Dad!
- Watch it, Choya.

23
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,921
- Let him have it!
- No, watch out for Dad Travis.

24
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,518
Easy.

25
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,420
Watch it.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,293
- We're gonna lose him!
- Get out of the way, Dad!

27
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,598
- Don't let him get away.
- Come on, let's go after him.

28
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,445
On your horse! Get him!

29
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,146
Looks like our deal's still on.

30
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,187
Let's swim the river
and we'll find his hideout.

31
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,907
Choya.

32
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
We're friends, Choya.

33
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,777
Reach.

34
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,184
We're friends, Choya.

35
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,883
We even left our guns below
with the horses.

36
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,519
That's a natural precaution,
but as I say, we're friends.

37
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,028
I got asthma.

38
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,828
We've been riding your trail
from Montana to Arizona.

39
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,889
Why?

40
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,869
The first time I seen you
was in Dodge City a couple of years back.

41
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,064
I asked you a question.

42
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,336
We got a business proposition,
a million-dollar deal.

43
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,237
- Get out.
- $1 million, maybe more.

44
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,971
Give me a minute, just a minute.

45
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,949
The scheme's foolproof.
You can take it easy for the rest of your life.

46
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,986
We'll own the biggest ranch
in the Southwest.

47
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,452
Is it all right for me to give you
the rest of the deal?

48
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,486
Turn around. Slow.

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,956
Sit down.

50
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,467
It's the softest touch a man could find.

51
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,697
Only problem we ever had
was getting you to tie in with us.

52
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,709
First time I laid eyes on you in Dodge City,
I knew you was the man for the job.

53
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,439
You had the eyes, the right age,
and the nerve.

54
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,448
I seen you when you made your play
in the saloon that night.

55
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,780
Took you a long time to find someone.

56
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,577
The law kind of delayed Leff up Kansas way.

57
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,291
Our drunken partner
is a great one for mouth.

58
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,859
Quit fidgeting. Another titch or two is all.

59
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,232
You know, even plain tattooing, battleships,
wiggling gals and the like...

60
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,002
is a kind of select art, you know,
like painting a picture.

61
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,810
But this is like one of them master pictures,
high art.

62
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,643
Get it done.
We got to get to town for supplies.

63
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,318
How about the old man in this set-up?
What kind of an <i>hombre</i> is he?

64
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,187
Hard and sharp as a razor. Rich as a bank.

65
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,718
People have been telling me
I ought to settle down.

66
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,285
There you are!

67
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,965
Perfect. Like it was born on your skin.

68
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,097
High art.

69
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,404
That's a real birthmark if I ever seen one.

70
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,270
- How long before this thing heals?
- A couple of days if she don't fester.

71
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,775
I hardly ever get
a bad case of blood poisoning anymore.

72
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,344
Hey, we didn't say anything yet
about the split.

73
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,354
- Three ways, all even.
- Oh, no. Down the middle, half for me.

74
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,423
- Nothing doing.
- Shut up.

75
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,649
You mean as much for you
as me and Tattoo together?

76
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,327
That's right.

77
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,261
I reckon that figures.

78
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,960
Making us junior partners.

79
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,466
A quarter of a million
will buy a whole riverful of whiskey.

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,032
Come on, Tattoo,
let's go down and get them supplies.

81
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,540
- Be sure you sing out when you come back.
- Like a choir.

82
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,308
I only got one life. I ain't no cat.

83
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,475
We got enough money left
for a couple of bottles?

84
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,569
You got nothing to worry about.

85
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,815
You know what I been dreaming lately, Leff?

86
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,283
Owning my own saloon.

87
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,482
Dancing girls and everything.

88
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,581
The biggest place in the West...

89
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,025
and not one single customer except myself.

90
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,930
Soon it's gonna be the real thing.
A quarter of a million...

91
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,364
How long you figure a quarter of a million
lasts a man, Leff?

92
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,407
Half as long as half a million.

93
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,777
That's the finest...

94
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,312
No, Leff! No!

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,432
Coming up, Choya. It's me, Leff.

96
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,330
It's okay, Choya. It's me.

97
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,773
- Stop hog-calling my name.
- Just don't want there to be no mistakes.

98
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,813
We can ride whenever you're ready.

99
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,348
- Where's Tattoo?
- I bought him out.

100
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,290
His horse, too?

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,155
I figured what you don't see
don't bother you none.

102
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,192
You figured everything, didn't you?

103
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,700
- When do you figure my turn?
- Set-up's no good without you.

104
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,771
We don't need Tattoo.

105
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,207
No sense dragging a lot of dead weight,
especially when it's all drunken mouth.

106
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,272
- It's going to be a real trusting partnership.
- I trust you, Choya.

107
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,613
Right down the line.

108
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,783
Come on. Let's go, partner.

109
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,947
Well, there's your Rio Grande.

110
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,148
Old Mexico, great place for dodging.

111
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,623
I'm only trying to be sociable.

112
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,455
You ain't spoke ten words
in the past three days.

113
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,253
"Bar O.M. Ranch. Richard Lavery, owner.
Keep out. This means you."

114
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,947
You read it right, partner. It means you.

115
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,359
You lay over in town
until you hear from me.

116
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,258
No reason we can't ride in together.

117
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,264
Just walk up to the door and knock
and take my shirt off?

118
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,261
Look, from here out, I'm doing the figuring.

119
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,666
- I just thought...
- I'm not asking you.

120
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,195
Sure. Maybe it's better that way.

121
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,371
Don't forget the details I told you.
Let me hear from you real soon.

122
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,780
Don't use that rocking horse story
lessen you have to.

123
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,258
- All right?
- Yup.

124
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,519
Fetch it.

125
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,389
Harder.

126
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:39,987
Come on.

127
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,692
Hey, company.

128
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,567
Low-cut holsters.

129
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,441
Who's the foreman?

130
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,111
- You overlooked the sign back there, mister.
- Maybe he don't read.

131
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,884
I'm the foreman. What do you want?

132
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,753
- I want a job.
- So?

133
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,493
- What can you do?
- Anything you can.

134
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,233
I didn't come looking for trouble.

135
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,243
I want a job.

136
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,528
Call that coffee?

137
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,517
- Morning, Bob.
- Howdy, boys.

138
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,878
Well, fence is coming along fine. Just fine.

139
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,515
Hey, Spig.

140
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,458
Rode all this way
just to get a cup of your coffee.

141
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,596
- New hand?
- Not by a long sight.

142
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,110
We had a little misunderstanding.
I'm looking for a job.

143
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,274
Ransome does the hiring.

144
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,585
Mr. Ransome, you were saying
you needed some more hands.

145
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,315
I don't want no gunfighters.

146
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,790
Fist fighters, you mean.

147
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:52,259
Why don't you take him on and then show
him who's the foreman of the Bar O. M?

148
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,392
He looks pretty uppity to me.

149
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,671
- That new colt ready?
- Ready as he'll ever be.

150
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,968
He's bone wicked.
Needs strong riding and quirt handling.

151
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,542
Well, I'm his man.

152
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,939
- I'll take him on tomorrow before supper.
- All right.

153
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,241
Here you go, Spig.

154
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,805
Come on, Ruth.

155
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,815
- Bye.
- Bye.

156
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,462
- What's your name?
- They call me Choya.

157
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,398
- Where you from?
- I wouldn't know.

158
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,435
You want that job or no?

159
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,964
I said I did, didn't I?

160
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,767
Come on.

161
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,742
- What are you doing here?
- Against the rules?

162
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,351
There aren't any rules of that kind
on this ranch.

163
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,389
No? I'm glad to hear it.

164
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,825
- Thanks for getting me the job today.
- I had nothing to do with it.

165
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,263
- Mr. Ransome does the hiring.
- I know. Thanks anyway.

166
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,363
You kind of like yourself, don't you?

167
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,958
It's the only affection I can depend on.

168
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,696
You can't expect folks to like someone...

169
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,261
who tries to behave
like a one-man stampede.

170
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,240
We aren't used to gunfighters.

171
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,334
Besides, I imagine a posse drove you
into these parts.

172
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,207
Posses I can dodge.

173
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,476
Young ladies spitting insults I can't handle.

174
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,484
Wait a minute.

175
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,187
I didn't mean all those things.

176
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,023
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,331
I guess I started the shooting.

178
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,626
- What's your name?
- Choya.

179
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,729
Spanish for "cactus."
Why do they call you that?

180
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,103
Did you ever try to pick one?

181
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,477
What's your real name,
the one you were born with?

182
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,137
I wouldn't know.

183
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,681
I guess this meeting's over for the evening.

184
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,217
Dad doesn't mind.
He and Mother are just talking in there.

185
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,589
- Is that all the family?
- Well, that's all now.

186
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,298
- Now?
- I had a brother, but I never knew him.

187
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,594
What happened to him?

188
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,602
He was kidnapped when he was about 5.

189
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,338
We never heard anything more.

190
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,442
But Dad still renews the reward every year.

191
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,278
Reward?

192
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,616
Yes, $100,000, but it hasn't meant anything.

193
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,846
Dad and I realize he must be dead...

194
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,292
but not Mother.

195
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,787
Her whole world centers
on the hope Richard's alive.

196
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,431
Well, listen to me run on and on.

197
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,968
- That you, Ruth?
- Yes, Dad.

198
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,899
- Mother will be going up pretty soon.
- All right, Dad.

199
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,303
- You're far from home, mister.
- I didn't know there was a dividing line.

200
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,680
- Then keep it in mind.
- Sure.

201
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,713
I'm a cowhand.

202
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,846
And the Laverys don't mix with dirty
cowhands outside their corrals.

203
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,481
Dad didn't mean it that way.

204
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,085
Plain as those signs out there:
"Keep out. This means you."

205
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,293
Dad, you were wrong.

206
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,865
You think so, chick?

207
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,332
Then I'll square it with him tomorrow.

208
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,566
Sure is an ornery young fellow.

209
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,370
You could both do with some breaking.

210
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,977
Hey, Ransome. I thought you said
the boss was coming right soon.

211
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,954
How about somebody else
taking a turn holding this colt?

212
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,728
The old man's liable to get hurt at his age.

213
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,359
The meanness ought to be rid
out of that horse before a Lavery tries it.

214
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,232
Why doesn't Ransome talk him out of it?

215
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,565
You don't know the old man.

216
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,732
He don't like for no one
to ride the mean ones except himself.

217
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,307
He doesn't?

218
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,015
Hey, get away from that horse!

219
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,234
Get that colt, Sam.

220
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,460
- Get off my ranch.
- When I get ready.

221
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,910
- Ransome, pay him off.
- It'll be a pleasure.

222
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,704
Not till I pay you off.

223
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,349
Wait a minute.

224
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,666
- Wait a minute.
- Let me go!

225
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,064
Hold it.

226
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,063
- Where are you from?
- None of your business!

227
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,733
- Talk civil!
- Where are you from?

228
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,901
Places.

229
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,678
- Where are your folks?
- "Where you from, where are your folks?"

230
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,179
You want to fight, let's fight!

231
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,011
You was asked a question.

232
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,119
- Where are your folks?
- I got none. Nobody owns me.

233
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,618
- How old are you?
- Crowding 30, if it's any of your business.

234
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,625
Why don't you pay me off
and let me get out of here?

235
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,891
- This mark...
- It's not your brand, is it?

236
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,155
Ransome.

237
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,501
- What's the matter, you crazy?
- Craig, take a look.

238
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,001
That's the same birthmark. It's Mr. Richard.

239
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,132
The sooner I get out of here, the better.

240
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,869
- Listen to me.
- Let go of me!

241
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,537
Boy, you don't understand.

242
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,581
I've got to know something about you.
You might be my son.

243
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,278
And you might be <i>loco.</i> Let go!

244
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,544
All right, boys.

245
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,387
Let me explain.

246
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,732
My son was taken from this ranch
when he was that high.

247
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,501
We've never stopped looking.

248
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,399
We only had one thing to go on: a mark.

249
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,169
His birthmark. Like yours.

250
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,646
I don't know what this adds up to, mister...

251
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,877
but as far as I know,
I've never been into Texas before in my life.

252
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,612
But the birthmark.

253
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,818
Look, you clean up.

254
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,882
I'll have Ransome bring you
up to the house.

255
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,223
I want Mrs. Lavery to see you.

256
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,312
Look, boy, she's inside with Ruth.

257
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,914
I want you to try and understand
what she's been through.

258
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:43,114
I've told her this might be a mistake,
but she's excited, naturally.

259
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,648
And you won't mind her
asking you questions, will you?

260
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,284
- No, but I still think you're wrong, mister.
- We'll see.

261
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,127
Thanks, Ransome.

262
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,437
You just have a chair. I'll bring her in.

263
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,056
Richard?

264
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,023
Would you mind showing that birthmark
to my wife?

265
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,122
Later.

266
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,392
Look ma'am, I've been telling your husband
he's made a mistake.

267
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,802
Do you...

268
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,999
Do you remember me at all?

269
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,272
Forgive me, but it's been so very long.

270
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,138
No, ma'am.

271
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,210
- Is there anything familiar about us?
- How could there be?

272
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,685
Richard was so little. Just a baby.

273
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,052
Do you remember anything about the house,
the ranch?

274
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,615
Richard was barely 5.
He couldn't remember.

275
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,992
I can remember before that. When I was 3...

276
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,295
You heard your baby stories from us so
often you think it's your own memory, dear.

277
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,495
There wasn't anyone
to tell stories to Richard.

278
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,603
But, Mother,
any child can remember when he's 5.

279
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,165
Surely you must remember something.

280
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,372
The only thing I can remember
are kid dreams.

281
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,343
- But they never made much sense.
- What were they?

282
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,407
Please.

283
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,080
Nothing about here or Texas.

284
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,219
Just crazy things...

285
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,358
like a rocking horse.

286
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,192
What about the rocking horse?

287
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,359
It had three legs.

288
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,996
One in front was always missing.

289
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,203
It was your darling.

290
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,872
Your favorite toy.

291
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,647
I still have it.

292
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,066
This is part of the south section.

293
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,741
- Fine stock.
- Yeah.

294
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,878
They should weigh in pretty heavy
by roundup time.

295
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,644
Our line runs about over
to the foot of those mountains there.

296
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:32,089
I sound like one of those tourist guides.
"This is part of the south section.

297
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,991
"To the right we have the stock,
and to the left we have the mountain."

298
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,856
What I really want to say is
that I'm very happy.

299
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,489
- Are you?
- Yes.

300
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,695
As soon as we spoke that first night,
I felt something about you.

301
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,535
It's kind of hard to explain...

302
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,876
but afterwards I kept thinking about you.

303
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,013
Of course, I couldn't really have known...

304
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,182
but I don't know, I just felt close to you.

305
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,210
Took you a long time
to buy me as a Lavery.

306
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,051
Oh, I had to be sure, Dick.

307
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,987
Another shock in Mother's life
might have been more than she could take.

308
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,858
I should have known Mother's instinct
about her own son...

309
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,625
couldn't have been wrong.

310
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,866
Could be she's been wanting this
to happen so bad...

311
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,103
- that she bought me on sight.
- Yeah, that could be.

312
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,935
But there're no "ifs" about you.
You're Richard Lavery, my brother.

313
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,339
And I'm your kid sister.

314
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,907
If we're gonna get back for supper,
we'd better ride.

315
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,116
The next time I get sentimental,
you tell me to shut up.

316
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,922
It's just that I need practice
at having a brother.

317
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,551
You're all right. Come on.

318
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,463
- What was it like, Dick?
- What was what like?

319
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,437
All those years,
what you did, where you went?

320
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,574
I want to hear about everything
that you ever thought or did.

321
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:02,204
- You wouldn't like it. I don't myself.
- Sounds exciting.

322
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,482
Like maybe you had to use those guns.

323
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,578
I have.

324
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,679
- You don't have to wear them around here.
- I wouldn't feel dressed without them.

325
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,917
Don't worry about what's past, Dick.

326
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,018
We're gonna love you so much
that you'll forget anything else...

327
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,723
- but the ranch and your family.
- Shut up!

328
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,668
I'm sorry, but you asked me to say that
if you ever got sentimental.

329
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,334
- Of course.
- Come on.

330
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,114
Mother has all my baby pictures
in the other album.

331
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,854
That's the first time
you were ever on horseback.

332
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,221
Your mother wouldn't let me
start you any younger.

333
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,283
You got bucked off just after that was taken.

334
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,385
And I boosted you right back up again.

335
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,762
Here you are with old Lobo,
how you'd hug him.

336
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,131
Mother, you skipped the one
on the mountain lion skin.

337
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,899
- I was going to spare Richard that one.
- No, let's have it.

338
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,635
He was loping off just after killing a calf.
I winged him at 150 yards.

339
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,448
Here you are on your fifth birthday.

340
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,780
You spent all that day
learning to say "Mexico" with a "th."

341
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,843
Weren't you cute? "Methico."

342
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,622
Mother, you really shouldn't
stay up any longer.

343
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,559
No, I suppose not.

344
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,957
- But what about all of you?
- I'm ready to turn in. Good night.

345
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,659
I'll see you to your room, Richard.

346
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,725
- Good night, son.
- Good night.

347
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:32,929
I'll see you later, Mother.

348
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,494
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

349
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,176
All right, Hank,
when you're through with 'em...

350
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,187
round up the bunch in the south section.

351
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,421
Well, I guess the Bar O.M.
won't be going out of business for a while.

352
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,629
You'll be driving $185,000 worth
of prime beef to Paso this year.

353
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,771
Let's get back to the ranch.

354
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,586
A man's viewpoint sure changes.

355
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,983
I used to want success right enough,
but nothing like the way I do now.

356
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,926
Great feeling to know
your own flesh-and-blood son is around...

357
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,397
to take over what you sweat to build.

358
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,430
Greatest feeling in the world.

359
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,096
Look, there's something I want to tell you.

360
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,663
No! How many times do I have to tell you?

361
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,333
We don't need no more hands.

362
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,345
Don't I even get invited to a cup of coffee?

363
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,038
Get!

364
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,146
What... Choya!
Where did you blow in from?

365
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,291
- How come you get hired here?
- Hired?

366
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,991
An old partner shows up
and you let them horselaugh him?

367
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,929
Reckon you've changed some.

368
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,695
Son, any old-time friend of yours...

369
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,135
Hold on there.

370
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,673
- You kind of took Dick unexpected.
- Dick? Dick who?

371
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,506
- Richard Lavery, Jr., my son.
- Choya?

372
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,578
Have your little joke, mister.

373
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,013
I ain't much on laughing
on an empty stomach.

374
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,880
Go on, Dick, tell him.

375
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,853
- He's right.
- Why, you old...

376
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,755
You mean all those years
you said you had no folks...

377
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,452
you had this place to come to?

378
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,893
Dick will tell you all about it.
First, we'll have to fill up that stomach.

379
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,625
No, sir.
First, let me introduce myself proper.

380
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,199
T. Jefferson Leffingwell.

381
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,203
And I'm right proud to make
the acquaintance of Choya's...

382
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,468
I beg your pardon, sir, Richard's folks.

383
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,503
Dick, take Mr. Leffingwell up to the house
and have Jose spread things.

384
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,206
I'll join you later.

385
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,580
Come on, Ransome.

386
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,266
- I thought we was going to the dining room.
- You were told to wait in town.

387
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,311
Sure, wait. I got calluses from waiting.

388
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,773
I thought you'd want me handy by now.

389
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:36,550
As soon as you're in the saddle,
we'll dump the ranch on the open market.

390
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,919
We'll be up to our ears in gold.

391
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,394
Why don't you stop dreaming?
You saw Lavery, he'll outlive both of us.

392
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,554
Are you getting soft in the head?

393
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,225
He ain't gonna outlive no.45 slug, is he?

394
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,631
Get this straight: nobody's gunning him.

395
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,231
Choya, as long as he lives...

396
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,174
you've got nothing here
but room and board.

397
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,102
I ain't young enough just to sit around
and wait for him to have a natural...

398
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,014
You don't have to wait.
We're getting out of here.

399
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,852
Choya, you can't. This thing's mine.

400
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,580
Nearly my whole life's in it.

401
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,354
You ain't got no right to go
and get religion on them Laverys now.

402
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,556
If I ain't got this deal, I ain't got nothing.

403
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,565
We'll get ours.
We're not pulling out of here broke.

404
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,460
I'm heading that cattle drive to Paso...

405
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,697
me, Richard Lavery, Jr.

406
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,373
There's around $180,000 in it.

407
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,409
- You know what that means?
- Cut our profit?

408
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,445
Take nothing more than a gambling stake?

409
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,309
I don't want the whole state of Texas
on a dish.

410
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,942
Just a little while and we'll be able
to cut up more than $1 million...

411
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,679
plus the cattle money.

412
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,584
I can't stand their
staring at me every minute.

413
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,122
I'm nobody's son or brother. I can't take it.

414
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,488
Choya, just a little while longer.

415
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,888
That's the way it is.

416
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,392
And don't you figure any other angle.

417
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,270
Reckon I ain't young enough
or fast enough to argue the point.

418
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,967
And I'm smart enough to know
when I'm beat.

419
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,540
You can sign me on for the cattle drive.

420
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,372
Yeah.

421
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,942
I've starved and went to prison,
and, yes, and killed.

422
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,283
All the while, I was counting on the money
I was gonna make out of this.

423
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,593
I figured I'd go back
to New Orleans in style.

424
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,731
$90,000.

425
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,627
What can a man do with that?

426
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,774
You'll have to hold over in Paso
longer than you think.

427
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,972
Your sister always takes mighty long
with the shopping...

428
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,413
and she's got a list longer than your arm.

429
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,509
Stuff for Mother, for me,
and, I suspect, for you.

430
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,422
But she ain't never on time.

431
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,188
Keep a man waiting, a whole herd of cattle
doesn't make any difference.

432
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,352
Ruth!

433
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,559
That herd will be in Paso before you start.

434
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,701
- You married a very bad-tempered man.
- And a very impatient one.

435
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,639
Don't worry about Ruth on the trail.
She can take care of herself.

436
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,675
She's been riding herd with me
since she was so high.

437
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,571
And if any problems come up,
talk them over with Ransome.

438
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,170
He's about as reliable as they come.

439
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,113
Well, this will be the first drive
I've missed in more than 20 years.

440
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,318
I guess that kind of tickles you, Mother.

441
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:30,321
I used to gripe that there was nobody
to handle things for the family but myself.

442
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,123
It sure is different now.

443
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,997
Makes me feel mighty fine inside
to be able to say that, son.

444
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,394
This time I wouldn't have minded
if you took the drive.

445
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,367
Here you're hardly home
and going off again.

446
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,573
Hurry back, won't you?

447
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,905
- We'd better get started.
- I'll take good care of him.

448
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,007
Ruth, pick out one of your pretty girlfriends
in Paso for Dick.

449
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,348
I'll bet Dick had a girl picked out long ago.

450
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,887
- Let's go.
- Goodbye, Dad.

451
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,817
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, darling.

452
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:08,862
- You didn't say, Dick. Is there a girl?
- I didn't say.

453
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:10,184
Well, Richard, we made good time today.

454
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,390
Not good enough.
I got to do better tomorrow.

455
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,294
No sense running their weight off
before they're sold.

456
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,836
The less they weigh, the less they pay.

457
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,532
- That's poetry, folks.
- You keep out of it.

458
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,974
- I didn't mean anything aggravating.
- I know.

459
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,489
What's wrong, Dick?

460
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:50,000
You've been jumpy and irritable
ever since the drive first started.

461
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,365
You've even been avoiding me,
your own sister.

462
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,165
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

463
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,431
You and father are sure two of a kind.

464
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,772
Impatient, ready to rear and buck
at the flick of a whip.

465
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,106
- Ransome?
- He means well.

466
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,511
There isn't anything he wouldn't do for us.

467
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,073
- I'm sorry. I'll see him later.
- Thank you.

468
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:11,281
Wait. Let's talk a bit.
We might not get much chance in Paso.

469
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,083
There'll be dozens of family friends
waiting to meet you.

470
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,183
- Nothing doing.
- But you have to.

471
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,229
There's Judge Carter and the Martinsons...
Let's see.

472
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,821
The Medberrys and Aunt Haddie.

473
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,356
Oh, you'll like Judy Medberry.
She's the prettiest girl in Paso.

474
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,164
Blonde, blue eyes...

475
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,595
Say, you're not even listening to me.

476
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,733
Of course, if you've already picked someone
before you came home...

477
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,299
There wasn't anyone.

478
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,107
Then maybe you and Judy will hit it off.
Goodnight, Dick.

479
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,094
Good idea to see Ransome. Good politics.

480
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,664
You know, I've been figuring way ahead.

481
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,901
That $90,000 ain't going to last forever.

482
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,136
Someday, we'll come back.

483
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,611
Family'll always forgive a little thieving
in an only son...

484
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,138
- and take you back in the fold.
- We're never coming back.

485
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:18,150
A body can't be sure of that.
All depends on finances.

486
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,524
- Too bad she's your sister.
- Find yourself a rat hole.

487
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,957
I was only joking.

488
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,793
But maybe you called me right, Choya.

489
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,536
Maybe "rat" fits me proper,
so don't push me too far.

490
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,680
- Don't back me up against no wall.
- You're the one that's pushing too hard.

491
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,675
You won't hit an older man.

492
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,881
You ain't the kind that will draw first...

493
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,647
or shoot a man in the back.

494
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,495
You ain't.

495
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,566
That's the best we've ever done.

496
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,969
Bet you next year we'll drive
nigh on to 10,000 head to the market.

497
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,037
- Take the boys and head back to the hotel.
- Sure.

498
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,208
- See that Miss Ruth's made comfortable.
- I'll do that.

499
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,319
You won't have to wait for me.
I can handle the bank business okay.

500
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,582
All right.

501
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,227
What are you doing, riding herd on me?

502
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,261
- I don't need anybody to hold my hand.
- Well, I don't reckon you do.

503
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,993
All I aim to do is pick up my horse.

504
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,923
Just double-checking the tally, Mr. Lavery.

505
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,762
You Lavery?

506
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,524
Yeah.

507
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,795
By golly, you must be young Richard.
Shake, son.

508
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,833
Luke Dawson's who I am.

509
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,535
We heard how you was back from the grave.

510
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,908
How are the two nicest people
in the whole state of Texas?

511
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,245
- Your ma and pa.
- Fine, thanks.

512
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,808
That's good. They sure must feel
like new folks with you back home.

513
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,548
This here's my partner, Ranger Tully.

514
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,112
- Howdy.
- Hello.

515
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,624
I'm with him.

516
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,719
You know, you sure caused us
plenty of trouble when you was took.

517
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,728
We chased one lead
all the way across to New Orleans.

518
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,363
- New Orleans?
- Yeah, but nothing come of it.

519
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,598
Good to see you.

520
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,800
Anything you want
while you're in town, anything...

521
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,400
- you come over to the jail, <i>pronto.</i>
- Thanks.

522
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,844
- You, too.
- Thanks.

523
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,980
Comes to a total of $183,067.

524
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,020
Don't bother to count it.

525
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,491
Give me a receipt
and deposit it to the Lavery account.

526
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,087
All right, sir.

527
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,228
They chased you clear to New Orleans?

528
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,240
You're throwing our fortune out the window.

529
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,936
- You took that kid, didn't you?
- But I didn't get the money.

530
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,343
- You'll be sorry for this till your dying day.
- Maybe.

531
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,773
All I'm sorry about is
I got dirtied up with you.

532
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,875
Here you are, Mr. Lavery.

533
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,020
It's a much safer way to handle big money.

534
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,152
That's the way my friend and I feel. Thanks.

535
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,345
You're getting good odds, Leffingwell,
five to one.

536
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,854
Better odds than you gave the Lavery kid.

537
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,784
What did you do with that boy?

538
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,091
You wouldn't do that.
You ain't the murdering kind.

539
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:00,066
- Where is that boy?
- He died on me before I could collect.

540
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,971
I swear on my mother's grave,
he died on me, across the border.

541
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,837
- You're lying.
- No, wait. Please.

542
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,108
He was took from me.

543
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,875
You just let it ride? You didn't try
to get him back or collect the reward?

544
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,781
What are you giving me?

545
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,255
He was took by Mateo Rubriz.

546
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,554
- The old bandit?
- Yeah.

547
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,629
You picked that name
because you knew Rubriz is dead.

548
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,028
No, he ain't.

549
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,398
He's got a great big territory
in the mountains other side of Hermosa.

550
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,039
He found gold.
It's worth a man's life to go near there.

551
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,872
What about that Lavery boy?

552
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:43,377
He's been told that he's Tonio Rubriz.
Old man's crazy about him.

553
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,677
He'd kill anybody that tells him any different.

554
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,590
Twenty-five years.

555
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,957
Best hand a man ever held for getting rich...

556
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,894
and it all goes up in smoke.

557
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,745
Pick it up!

558
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,180
Reckon I ain't that good a gambler.

559
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,150
Get out!

560
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,624
Get out of Paso.

561
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,193
Get 1,000 miles out.

562
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,094
If I ever hear
that you're around the Laverys...

563
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,156
I'll kill you.

564
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,558
- Who is it?
- May I see you, Ruth?

565
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,891
Come in, Dick. I'll be with you in a minute.

566
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,362
Why, Dick,
you haven't changed your clothes yet.

567
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,500
Listen, Judy Medberry expects to meet
her Beau Brummel.

568
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,475
Lucky for you, I went shopping.

569
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,673
I hope you'll like these shirts.
I didn't know what size you took...

570
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,340
- Ruth.
- Yes, Dick?

571
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,652
- I'm not going with you tonight.
- Oh, but you must.

572
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,422
Everybody'll be very anxious to meet you.

573
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,658
Here's the bank receipt.

574
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,053
I'm leaving, and I want
to tell you something first.

575
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,524
I know, Dick.
It's something out of your past.

576
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:47,334
The thing that's been bothering you
through the whole drive.

577
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:52,836
But there isn't anything you could tell me
that would ever topple over my faith in you.

578
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,237
I've thought about it a lot.

579
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,238
I'm not a child.

580
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,009
Oh, Dick, I know you've had
a strange and lonesome life...

581
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,418
but that's what we're going to change.

582
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,523
What's a sister for if she can't help you?

583
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:17,291
I wish I had some place to crawl
and hide, but I've got to tell you.

584
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,004
I'm not your brother.
I'm a four-flushing thief.

585
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,700
- No, Dick that isn't true. It can't be.
- It's not Dick, it's Choya.

586
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,078
This isn't a real birthmark.
It was tattooed on.

587
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,016
That story about the rocking horse...

588
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,524
I learned that by heart from the man
who stole your brother.

589
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,991
Oh, no!

590
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,859
I was going to hit it big...

591
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,393
I was going to be Richard Lavery, Jr...

592
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,868
take it easy the rest of my life.

593
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,568
But nobody told me...

594
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,567
I'd meet somebody like you.

595
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,987
<i>- Buenas.</i>
<i>- Buenas.</i>

596
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,662
- Hermosa?
- Hermosa, <i>pa'llá.</i>

597
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:57,626
- How far?
<i>- Sí,</i> Hermosa.

598
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,959
<i>Gracias.</i>

599
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,347
You should have heard Dick
trying to describe your measurements...

600
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,648
to the saleslady.

601
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,313
Luckily I came into the shop.

602
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,984
- Dick picked the color out himself.
- When will Richard be back, dear?

603
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,359
He couldn't tell exactly.
Some business of long standing, I guess.

604
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,988
I didn't want to pry.

605
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,063
I may have to take it in the waist a bit.

606
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,264
He'll write if he's delayed, won't he?

607
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,776
Write?
Oh, I don't guess Dick's much on writing.

608
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:44,736
I'd better get some of this trail dirt off
before supper. Excuse me.

609
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,311
It's sure pretty, Mother.

610
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,289
Put this in the safe for me, will you?
It's the bank receipt Dick sent back.

611
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,851
- Richard...
- Now, Mother...

612
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:01,363
don't you go imagining all sorts of things.

613
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,965
Young fellow Dick's age must have had
all sorts of loose strings to tie up...

614
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,936
these last five or ten years.

615
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,533
I want to talk to Ruth.

616
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,682
- What happened in Paso?
- I told you.

617
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,417
I didn't believe that. Where is he?

618
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,088
I've got to know, Ruth.
What happened to your brother?

619
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,062
He's not my brother.
He came here to rob us.

620
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,161
That birthmark was tattooed on his shoulder.

621
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,025
Honey, you're talking crazy.

622
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,469
It's true. He admitted it in Paso.
He said he was a fake.

623
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:47,502
A four-flushing thief.
Oh, Dad, what'll we do?

624
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,784
I should have used a gun that day,
outside the bunkhouse.

625
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:05,291
Ransome! Come in.

626
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:12,727
Killing him is hardly enough now.
But it's all I can do.

627
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,364
No, that won't solve anything.
It won't help Mother, will it?

628
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,765
That's what we have to think about.

629
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,105
I'll find him.
I'll find him and drag him back.

630
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,051
He'll go through with this four-flushing
all the way.

631
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:37,286
He'll be Richard Lavery, Jr.,
as long as your mother's alive. Come!

632
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:45,060
Get a couple of horses ready, Ransome.
We're leaving for Paso.

633
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,459
Yes, sir.

634
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,600
Take care of your mother, honey.

635
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,855
Halt! You have gone far enough, <i>señor!</i>

636
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,494
- I want to talk to Mateo Rubriz.
- Through the head if you move.

637
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,131
Gomez, take his guns!

638
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,902
<i>Señor</i> Tonio with his father?

639
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,139
It is for you to answer, not ask questions.
Get off the horse!

640
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,530
Rubriz?

641
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,475
Since when do you intrude at my dinner,
Gomez?

642
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:07,040
<i>- Señor,</i> he said he must see you.
- I do not like strangers to come here, <i>señor.</i>

643
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,718
If you'd stop feeding your belly,
I'd tell you why I'm here.

644
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,956
Next time, I take off your ear.

645
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:24,091
You're pretty good with a knife.
And a gun, too.

646
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,896
Everybody across the Rio Grande
knows that.

647
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,871
- That's why I hightailed it up here.
- That was a big mistake.

648
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,306
Either you or the Texas Rangers.

649
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,372
You see, I ran out of places to hide
across the river.

650
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,436
Mateo Rubriz is no innkeeper.

651
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,843
I didn't know you were
friends with the Rangers.

652
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,115
Is that how you think I got the reputation
people talk about?

653
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,920
Friends with the Rangers?

654
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,821
Before the government forced me to retire,
<i>señor,</i> I used the Rio Grande...

655
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,696
- like a ferry boat.
- That's why I thought you'd hide me out.

656
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,965
- So, what do they call you?
- Choya.

657
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,671
Choya. It is a name I have heard.

658
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,203
Not too often,
not with the biggest reputation.

659
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,872
Small things with a gun.

660
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,510
Big enough that the Rangers
want to do a little hanging.

661
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,386
Me, they wish to hang
1,000 times. Gomez!

662
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,853
I will tell you stories about the old days.

663
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,056
Then you will know
why people talk about me...

664
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,725
on both sides of the Rio Grande. Sit down.

665
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,270
The belly is bigger than the brain.
It needs to be comforted.

666
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,439
You young ones have not heard
enough bullets to know the sound of them.

667
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,281
When I rode with Juarez,
I heard them by the hundreds.

668
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,840
Enough bullets to know their music.

669
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,781
Tonio!

670
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,923
- You work late at the mine.
- A busy evening, <i>jefecito.</i>

671
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,464
- This is <i>señor</i> Choya, my son.
- Welcome.

672
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,864
He has come here because he does not see
eye to eye with the Texas Rangers.

673
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,664
<i>- Jefe.</i>
- Excuse me.

674
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,334
You are from Texas, <i>señor?</i>

675
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,506
- You ever been there? Texas?
- Many, many times.

676
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:18,177
I have used the Rio like a ferry boat.
<i>Señor,</i> I can tell you...

677
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,308
- I've heard that already.
- You will please occupy <i>señor</i> Choya.

678
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:25,081
- What is it, <i>jefecito?</i>
- It is nothing. I will be right back.

679
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,721
How would you wish
to be entertained, <i>señor?</i>

680
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,227
You have heard all my stories
from my <i>jefecito.</i>

681
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:36,026
But you've never heard this one.
I want to show you a brand.

682
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,965
Maybe you know it.

683
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,406
That sign... But it is on my body, too.

684
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,842
Yes, but yours is real. This is tattooed.

685
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,746
Sit down.
I want to tell you something about yourself.

686
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:58,715
Rubriz!

687
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,622
What are you doing here?

688
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,454
I told you never to draw a breath again
in these mountains.

689
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,690
After 25 years, you think I'd go <i>loco?</i>
I got good reason for coming.

690
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,191
I got important information.

691
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,233
- It's about Tonio.
- Tonio? Roberto.

692
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,813
I turned down a chance at $100,000
to do this for you.

693
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,540
What is the information?

694
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,313
$50,000 is all I'm asking from you,
because old friends are best.

695
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,048
The information!

696
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,348
Gunfighter from Texas
coming to tell Tonio and take him back.

697
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:40,157
- Tonio back? Back where?
- Family in Texas. He's their son.

698
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,131
Take him away!

699
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,940
Wait! He says you're not my father!

700
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:00,710
I will have you flayed a little at a time
and let the dogs eat your hide!

701
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,615
Are you? Are you my father?

702
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,177
You've got a mother and a father
waiting for you, Tonio. Make him answer.

703
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,190
- You know he's not your son.
- Take him away!

704
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,818
- Tell him who he is, Rubriz!
- Take him away!

705
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,791
Tonio, there has been no one in the world...

706
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,928
more to me since the day
you were abandoned in my village.

707
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:26,066
- Then all these years have been a lie?
- No, Tonio. Are you not my son?

708
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:29,509
What is blood? When you were little
and you cried in the night...

709
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,673
I put my hands on you
and the love of God flowed into your body.

710
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,809
You went to sleep holding my hand,
and when I tried to pull away...

711
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,480
you still gripped it while you slept.
It made me very happy when I watched you.

712
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,046
That's how I made you my son!

713
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,423
I made you a Mexican,
a part of this nation of fighters.

714
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:48,123
- I made you my son, Tonio.
- You should have told me, <i>jefecito.</i>

715
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,232
Mother of God, make him understand.

716
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:56,366
All I have stolen, I swear to replace.
For silver, I shall bring gold.

717
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,207
It was by a miracle from Heaven
that I gained you as a son.

718
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:06,271
The doors of my heart were open
and I held you inside ever since.

719
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:10,443
- I hold you there now, Tonio.
- I, too, <i>jefecito.</i>

720
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,653
Deeds are much greater than blood.

721
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,025
Remember when the soldiers chased me
down the Valley of Pines...

722
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,926
how you came like an angel,
took me on your horse...

723
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,395
supported me and saved me.

724
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:25,332
I think of the night at Saltillo, when they
hemmed me into the patio and you came.

725
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,460
And in Chihuahua,
when I slept and snored...

726
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:31,303
like a drunken fool when they surround me,
but you broke through and carried me away.

727
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,639
- No, we fought them together.
- Yes, side by side.

728
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,376
I will leave you now, Tonio.
I have words for <i>El Choya.</i>

729
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,316
No, <i>jefecito,</i> he has done nothing.
He brought with him a story.

730
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,717
He's told it. Now he can go.
Things are as they were.

731
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,584
But he will talk. There will be trouble.

732
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,749
Since when have we run away from trouble?

733
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,417
My Tonio!

734
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,727
We will send the Yankee back?

735
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:56,990
You are hungry. Better eat now.
Then we will talk some more.

736
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,435
- You are up late, <i>señor</i> Tonio.
- I want to see the Yankee.

737
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,140
- But it is against orders.
- Let me by.

738
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,710
Untie him.

739
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,550
The order to tie him like a pig came
from <i>señor</i> Rubriz himself.

740
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:23,615
- Untie him. This is my order.
<i>- Señor</i> Rubriz himself must give the order.

741
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,032
I regret this.

742
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,911
He was with my father before I was born.

743
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,047
You were born in Texas, Lavery.

744
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:49,243
Do not use that name to me, <i>señor.</i>
I am a Rubriz.

745
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,946
Suit yourself.

746
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,288
Me, I want some free night air.

747
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,426
Here. I hope you will not have to use this.
Your horse is outside the door.

748
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,936
You will have to ride very fast
through the pass to surprise the sentry.

749
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,167
- You're not coming with me?
- No. Mateo Rubriz spoke the truth.

750
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,271
Whatever came before does not matter.
We are father and son.

751
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:18,440
You're Richard Lavery, Jr. You've got
a mother and father and you can't change it.

752
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:23,417
A crazy thing to be born twice
in one lifetime. You had better ride, <i>señor.</i>

753
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,481
We're riding together.

754
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,393
You are a cunning man without honor.

755
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:37,994
- And Tonio Rubriz is a fool.
- Move through that door quietly.

756
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,934
Now move!

757
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:02,880
Who goes?

758
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,291
Keep walking.

759
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,021
Halt!

760
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,459
Juan!

761
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,258
I will cover them, Carlos!

762
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,759
Halt!

763
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,575
See, Tonio,
how they protect us from ourselves?

764
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,770
Oh, it is you, <i>señor</i> Tonio.

765
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,713
When you did not speak, I did not know.
<i>El señor</i> Tonio, Juan!

766
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,988
<i>Señor</i> Rubriz!

767
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,129
Tonio took the Yankee away.

768
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,791
- What are you saying?
- It is true, <i>jefe.</i>

769
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,099
The Yankee has Tonio.
They went through the pass.

770
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,299
Everybody is to ride! Move!

771
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,270
- They got a long start.
- We'll take the cuts through the mountains.

772
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,838
Tonio will delay him.
The Yankee doesn't know the short way.

773
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,351
- Tonio will show him the way.
- Tonio will not show him.

774
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,216
Well, he took him out, didn't he?

775
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,331
Light signal fires on every hilltop.

776
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,435
Tell the valley the Yankee is coming
on the Hermosa Trail.

777
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,636
A sackful of pesos for the patrol
that takes him, dead or alive.

778
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,282
You can't put all the patrols
on the Hermosa Trail, Rubriz.

779
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:37,513
- Suppose he takes the other way?
- I said Tonio will not show him the shortcut!

780
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,355
You would do better to shoot me.

781
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,300
- Is there a nearby place we can stop?
- There is nowhere you can stop.

782
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,959
This'll hold for a while.

783
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,904
When you are taken this time,
I will not interfere.

784
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,972
- I don't intend to be taken.
- No?

785
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,869
Look, <i>señor...</i>

786
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,309
you cannot outride those signals.

787
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,610
Every rifle in these hills will search you out.

788
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,345
- Well, let's go.
- No...

789
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,153
you go while you can.

790
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,186
Is the money you hope to collect for me
enough to pay for your life?

791
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,753
- Stop stalling.
- You will do nothing to me.

792
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,826
- Dead I am not worth one peso.
- Do you want to be hog-tied?

793
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,558
No...

794
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,537
I will come.

795
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:40,878
It's a long way to the Rio Grande.
You will never make it.

796
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,375
Which way?

797
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,641
This.

798
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:23,314
- Where does that trail go to?
- It goes nowhere.

799
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:26,986
We'll take it.

800
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,060
They took the short way.

801
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,603
It's like I said, Rubriz.
Tonio wasn't pushed into this.

802
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,070
He done the pushing.

803
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,438
I will believe it when I hear it
from Tonio himself.

804
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,637
All these years cannot be destroyed
by a few words from a stranger.

805
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,543
Stranger? Why, they're partners by now.

806
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:21,583
While we're sitting here,
they're making time for the Rio.

807
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,948
Ricardo! Manuel!

808
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,112
Signal all the patrols to cross the canyon.

809
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,250
Cover the shortcut all the way to the Rio!

810
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,069
Look! The other side of the canyon!

811
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,508
The Yankee has taken the shortcut!

812
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:25,438
I told you, you will never make it.
They know we are coming up this trail.

813
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:19,665
- You'd better run for your life!
- That's what I figure on doing.

814
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,337
I'll leave you someplace where you're okay.

815
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,017
We saw them, <i>señor.</i> Only two minutes ago.

816
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,124
Your friends are getting close.

817
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,603
- It will do you no good to ask my help.
- I don't ask for something I don't want.

818
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,266
I'll make it easy for them to locate you
after I clear out.

819
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:10,471
Why? Why do I concern you?

820
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,910
How about one of these cigarettes
I rolled you?

821
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,616
- Why are you leaving?
- No sense in bringing back a dead man.

822
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,325
They are the best trackers in the world.

823
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,797
If they track too close,
I'll have to kill some of them.

824
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:36,736
- You can start the fireworks by yelling out.
- I will not call out.

825
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,773
<i>Señor</i> Rubriz!

826
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,044
They stopped here not too long ago.

827
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,283
They went together.

828
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,480
Search everywhere. He can't be far.

829
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:24,417
A sackful of pesos for Choya.
I want Choya, dead or alive!

830
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:01,545
They must have found the horses.
They're making camp down below.

831
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:05,191
I told you they were
the best trackers in the world.

832
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,487
I'll be pulling out soon. Anything you want?

833
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:12,032
You will not get through.

834
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,502
Maybe. I'll wait till they bed down.

835
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,636
I'm gonna leave one shell in this gun.
When I start I'll fire a couple of times.

836
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,679
That'll bring somebody quick.

837
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,944
When you hear them, you let go.

838
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,418
They'll find you.

839
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:39,118
Since yesterday, I have asked myself
if you did this for money.

840
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,829
I do not think it was for money.

841
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,903
What made you do it?

842
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,073
What made you come into our mountains?

843
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,867
Maybe it's because I'm tired.

844
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,139
Figured my luck's running out.

845
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,609
I don't mind talking.

846
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,085
I was trying to be you.

847
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,316
They believed me.

848
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,618
I had all of the angles figured.

849
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,654
All except one.

850
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,700
You've got a sister, Lavery.
Her name is Ruth.

851
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:32,175
The way you say the name
makes a picture of her jump into my head.

852
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,552
And her mother? Ruth's mother?

853
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:44,251
She's every reason to make a man
as straight as a string.

854
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:48,994
Make a man feel
that there isn't any bitterness in the world.

855
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:54,296
Does my... Does Ruth's mother...

856
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,931
- have affection for you?
- For me?

857
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,966
I'm all the worst things you can call a man.

858
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,436
But she's not the name-calling kind.

859
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,212
Neither's the rest of the family.

860
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,477
All my life I've been a snake...

861
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:17,792
lived by my wits,
gotten what I wanted any way I wanted it.

862
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,621
Just lately I've been wondering if...

863
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,499
just for once,
I couldn't do something straight...

864
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,333
do something a little decent.

865
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,874
But you took nothing.

866
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,511
And now you will try to go back
and see them?

867
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:44,610
If I get out of this,
I'm going to skip the whole state of Texas.

868
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:48,052
But you get yourself across the border
and meet those people.

869
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,318
Meet them and you'll know what I mean.

870
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,422
This will be only inches away.
When they come, you use it.

871
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,058
<i>Adiós.</i>

872
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,136
Choya...

873
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,912
I will have that smoke now.

874
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,851
You will have to go back
to the Laverys, Choya.

875
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,713
Not a chance.

876
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,786
I cannot go by myself.

877
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,669
You will not bring back a dead man.
I will make it.

878
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,568
- But you can't, we haven't any horses.
- We will get horses.

879
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,208
Help me up.

880
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:47,441
- Tonio, you can't.
- Please, Choya, I give you my word.

881
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,612
I will make it.

882
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,880
I wish to see for myself
this wonderful family.

883
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:44,498
Tonio's done everything except
draw you a picture.

884
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,371
Still you keep right on believing in him.

885
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,315
They ever get to the Laverys,
you and Tonio are through.

886
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:03,718
I used to think there was nothing
I wanted more in life than money.

887
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,953
Stacks and stacks of hard cash.

888
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,394
But now, most of all,
I want to watch Choya die.

889
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,063
I want to do the killing.

890
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,915
Hernandez.

891
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,779
Gomez, what is it?

892
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,277
Come over here, quickly.

893
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,136
Who is there?

894
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:08,938
Halt!

895
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,059
Shoot them!

896
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:18,111
When I saw <i>señor</i> Tonio,
I didn't know what to do.

897
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,347
How could I know
he was helping the Yankee?

898
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,652
- Tonio helping the Yankee?
- Yes.

899
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,421
It is not easy to recognize
a traitor among your own.

900
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,392
Do we return home?

901
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,694
That is not the way
Mateo Rubriz punishes traitors.

902
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,564
Tonio is no different than the others.
Catch the horses.

903
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:45,112
Jorge. Get the horses. We ride.

904
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:04,858
Are we close?

905
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,536
Close enough to spit in the Rio.
So are Rubriz's men.

906
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,036
Spread out all over the beach.

907
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:14,302
We will bring them up.

908
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,305
I will tell you how.
First you will light a fire.

909
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,912
Then, fire three quick shots.

910
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,592
Mateo Rubriz will give a sackful of pesos
for the Yankee.

911
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,660
<i>Sí,</i> and another for Tonio.

912
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:45,570
If only fortune smiles on us. Look!

913
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,644
They have the Yankee trapped!

914
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:03,216
Back down! Hurry! Down! It was a trick!

915
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:11,976
Look behind every rock and bush! Find their
trail! See if they crossed the river!

916
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,967
Well, there's the ridge.

917
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,271
Back to the ranch by sundown.

918
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,710
Thought what you're gonna say
to Mrs. Lavery?

919
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:48,085
I don't know what to say to her, Ransome.
I'm afraid to tell her the truth.

920
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:52,191
Yet if I don't, every time anybody
rides up to the ranch...

921
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,751
she'll be waiting for him
to come through the door.

922
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,160
And every time she'll have a disappointment.

923
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,792
I don't know what to say.

924
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:05,267
Maybe you could say
he's sticking in Paso on ranch business.

925
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,340
We could do some more looking
around Arizona.

926
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,448
There's a stray horse!

927
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:22,113
Carrying a Mexican saddle.

928
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:35,801
Fresh out of the Rio. Let's have a look.

929
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:20,970
Tonio?

930
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,880
Are they still on the beach, <i>compañero?</i>

931
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:32,015
Everything's fine, Tonio. You're back home.

932
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,361
Slowly, very slowly.

933
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,106
The two of you came out
of Mexico together.

934
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:54,580
- Now it is right that you die together.
- He didn't come out with me.

935
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,382
I brought him out at the end of a gun.

936
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:02,216
No longer is my heart bigger
than my head, Choya.

937
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,325
Tonio, get up, you traitor!

938
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,787
Take it easy, Rubriz. He's unconscious.

939
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:15,368
- One of your men shot him.
- Then he will not be awake to see death.

940
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,696
But you are awake!

941
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:21,506
If you kill him, Rubriz,
you'll groan the rest of your life.

942
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,404
- You're the top of his world.
- No more.

943
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,513
That's the truth.

944
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,243
Hello? Are you all right?

945
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,114
- It's me, Ruth. Choya.
- Choya?

946
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,486
Choya, I'm so glad.

947
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:41,188
I've been searching
the whole house for you. May I come in?

948
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:44,463
- Not now.
- Please, Choya.

949
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,865
- Is anything wrong?
- Send her away.

950
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,833
Go back downstairs. Now.

951
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,515
What is the taste in your mouth, Choya?

952
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:12,523
- Like salt.
- And your neck is stiff?

953
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,920
- I can still nod to a friend.
- Choya!

954
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:23,034
Choya, please let me in there!

955
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,898
Dad! Hurry!

956
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:39,579
All right, get up.

957
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,247
Pick that chair up.

958
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,056
Sit in it. Sit down!

959
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:53,532
This is the reason he went with me.
The end of a gun.

960
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:58,004
That's the reason
you're going to sit there and listen to me.

961
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,131
It's no use. Nothing will help you.

962
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:02,603
I have thirty rifles outside.

963
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,449
Choya, what's going on in there? Open up.

964
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,547
Hold it, Lavery.

965
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,426
- Lavery.
- Yes?

966
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:27,300
Stay where you are.
Don't let anybody outside, you understand?

967
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:28,591
Yes.

968
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:34,966
If a.45 slug would untwist that mind
of yours, I'd let you have it in a second.

969
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,576
But he'd never forgive me for that.

970
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:45,282
- Not the way he feels about you.
- Your gun will not help me believe lies.

971
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,088
No, I suppose I'm gonna have to kill you.

972
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,792
Kill you like a <i>loco</i> horse.

973
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,790
Then your men can come in here
and finish off the rest.

974
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,868
Kill the best part of your life.

975
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:06,133
I took him from nothing, made him my son.

976
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,902
And he loves you for it.

977
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:11,473
Why, he kept stalling
and pussyfooting me at every jump.

978
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:14,276
Even tried to make me take the long
way through the hills.

979
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,783
The only reason he came with me
yesterday was to help me...

980
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,250
square myself with this family.

981
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,050
But all these years I have been his family.
He's been mine. There was nothing else.

982
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,216
Now you're going to blow him out
like a light?

983
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,219
You never stopped to figure
that his mother and his father...

984
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,025
have a right to some of what you've had
for the past years.

985
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,732
They've had nothing
since Leffingwell stole him out of this room.

986
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,834
To me, he was abandoned.
I did not know he was stolen.

987
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,596
Well, you know it now.

988
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:44,000
Twenty-five good years and you're gonna
wipe him out with your own hand.

989
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:47,104
He has destroyed those years,
all the happy days.

990
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:52,277
He has forgotten.
He despises me, leaves me.

991
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:56,719
If you don't believe
he has nothing but love for you...

992
01:29:56,791 --> 01:30:00,557
you don't believe when he's well
he'll be running right over to see you...

993
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:03,028
if you don't know him better than that...

994
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:07,025
you or your riflemen,
it doesn't matter, go ahead.

995
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:10,696
Go ahead while he's still asleep.

996
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:23,745
Shall I leave him here,
let him forget Mexico?

997
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:29,019
- Forget me?
- Forget you or Mexico?

998
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:35,360
Why, when he's well, he'll be making
the Rio Grande like a ferry boat.

999
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,990
Running between you and the Laverys.

1000
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:42,401
Could it be so?

1001
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:29,173
Life is not by the blood,
but by the bread, eh, Tonio?

1002
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:41,759
There's the man who raised your boy.
Mateo Rubriz.

1003
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:46,121
Choya.

1004
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,140
He is too sick to ride along
with me, <i>señora...</i>

1005
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:02,046
and in sickness,
I think it's best he be with his mother.

1006
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:05,485
Maybe someday I can come to see him
and he to see me?

1007
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,578
- Anytime.
- Thank you, <i>señor.</i>

1008
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,721
<i>El Choya,</i> he's more like me than myself.

1009
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:22,064
He invites me to do murder,
but first he removes the bullets.

1010
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:53,255
Choya!

1011
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,938
- Why did you do that?
- We can ride double.

1012
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:01,164
Come on, give me a hand.

1013
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:03,541
What do you think you're doing?

1014
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,545
Might be fun to be out where things happen.

1015
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:07,774
- You're not leaving the ranch.
- I am if you are.

1016
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:10,009
- Now listen...
- Don't argue with me, Choya.

1017
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,711
I'm pretty tough.

1018
01:33:23,798 --> 01:33:26,494
<i>Hasta la vista, Choya!</i>

1019
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:29,534
<i>Adiós, amigo!</i>
