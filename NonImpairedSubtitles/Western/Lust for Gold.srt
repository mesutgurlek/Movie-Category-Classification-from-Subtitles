1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,995
You are looking at Superstition Mountain.

2
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,789
A barbaric pile of rock,
40 miles long by 20 wide.

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,792
The man is Floyd Buckley.

4
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,869
He's going into this 800 square miles
of sudden and violent death...

5
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,349
because he thinks
it's just another mountain...

6
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,829
and because he's greedy for its treasure.

7
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,070
Yeah, I said treasure. Gold.

8
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,871
$20 million worth of precious yellow metal...

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,716
waiting to be found
in America's most elusive mine...

10
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,633
appropriately named "The Lost Dutchman".

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,519
It's simple to get to. The mountain, I mean.

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,388
Just drive 36 miles due east
from Phoenix, Arizona, and there she is.

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,476
She looks easy from the outside.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,638
Inside, it's like Satan's private art gallery.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,559
Sculptured pagan granites,
unmellowed by time...

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,074
hidden in terrifying canyons and gorges.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,276
But if you'd like to pick up $20 million...

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,352
and figure, like Buckley there,
that a mountain's just a mountain...

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,714
I'll show you where to look.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,711
But before you leave for Arizona...

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,839
you ought to know that 21 men have been
murdered grabbing for that dough...

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,072
and hundreds more have died in other ways.

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,552
You see, this is the true story
of Superstition Mountain.

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,915
The biography of a death trap.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,799
My name's Barry Storm.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,678
I was hurled into this story
when I heard that shot.

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,389
Up till then, I was just an ordinary guy
with a reasonable curiosity...

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,277
about the Lost Dutchman Mine.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,158
A curiosity I wish I'd never been born with.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,356
I hurried towards the sound of the report...

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,910
and hoped I'd find a hunter
who'd maybe bagged a deer.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,231
I found Floyd Buckley, sprawled and dead.

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,357
His blood, life, and dreams
spilling out on the unfriendly ground.

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,672
When you find a dead man,
you're supposed to call the police.

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,991
I'm a good citizen.
I set out to do what you're supposed to do.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,435
Fear and panic
gave me a boost up over that ledge...

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,715
and I began to run, not walk,
to the nearest exit.

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,473
Speed no longer meant anything to Buckley,
but it did to me.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,677
I didn't want to be framed in the crosshairs
of a telescopic sight...

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,273
on a high-powered rifle.

41
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,998
I'd just gone in to look for gold.

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,277
I didn't want to find lead
from the business end of a killer's gun.

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,750
It took me three days
and 36 miles of tough hiking...

44
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,832
to put the sheriff
from Florence, Arizona into action.

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,591
Identification bracelet.

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,875
Wallet.

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,668
Telegram.

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,193
"Lecturing in Los Angeles, September 30th."

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,350
They're going to have to get a new speaker.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,431
That's all the personal effects.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,949
Let's go.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,633
Sit down, son.

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,116
You say your name's Barry Storm.

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,397
You're from Colorado
and you've been here only 10 days.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,475
You're no prospector, but you were up there
when Buckley got shot.

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,792
What were you doing in the mountain?

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,474
I know it sounds kind of bad,
but I was following Buckley.

58
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,675
You were what?

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,955
Now, wait a minute. I didn't shoot him.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,157
I had a good reason to be up there.
My grandfather was Jacob Walz.

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,071
- Who?
- Jacob Walz.

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,634
The man who owned
the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,073
The Dutchman, huh?

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,276
That goes back to about 1880.

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,671
He's supposed to have killed
quite a few men in his time.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,915
That doesn't have anything to do with me.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,718
All I know is, when I was a kid...

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,270
my mum heard about this mine
her father was supposed to have found.

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,396
I always figured
someday I'd come down here.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,357
So you came down here. Go on.

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,876
I thought there might still be a buck
laying around that had my name on it.

72
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,474
The first place I went to
was the Claims Office in Phoenix.

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,076
- How do you spell that again?
- Walz. W-A-L-Z. Jacob Walz.

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,757
Nope. Nobody by that name
ever registered a claim here.

75
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,156
This record goes clear back to 1870.

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,559
But there must have been.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,915
The Lost Dutchman
was supposed to be worth a fortune.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,672
He wouldn't leave the money laying around.

79
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,034
Maybe he never found a mine.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,634
Some people don't believe
there ever was a Lost Dutchman.

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,358
Well, then again, some do.

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,000
The news had a story on it
just this morning.

83
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,954
There.

84
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,116
This newspaper item was my first lead.

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,035
I wanted to meet this guy who said
he was going to find my grandfather's mine.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,193
Mr. Buckley, ask you a couple of questions
about this newspaper story.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,192
- Certainly. I'm always glad to see the press.
- I'm not a reporter.

88
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm just interested in you being so sure
about locating that Lost Dutchman.

89
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,991
If you read my books, you'd know
I wouldn't go on a wild-goose chase.

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,275
- You've got a map?
- Naturally I have a map.

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,272
- One of the original Peraltas, in fact.
- Peralta?

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,399
The Peralta mine I'm seeking and
the Lost Dutchman are one and the same.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,108
Then it looks like you and I
have got something in common.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,760
- Yes?
- I happen to be Jacob Walz's grandson.

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,718
Really? You mean the man
who allegedly owned it?

96
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,032
That's very interesting, I'm sure.

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,032
- I never knew he left a family.
- I can prove it if I have to.

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,078
That's why it might be good business
to let me come along with you.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,639
If you know how to use this map...

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,518
I not only know how to use it,
but I know where the marker is.

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,591
And I know how to use that, too.

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,319
But for your information, young man,
I never go partners.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,435
Excuse me.

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,352
He really brushed me off.
I decided right then to follow him.

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,238
When his car dropped him off
at Apache Junction, I was waiting.

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,232
I started tailing him then.
But Buckley was too sharp.

107
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,153
He lost me on the third day.
I never caught up with him again.

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,153
- Not till after I heard the shots.
- 30-30. Entered downward, from behind.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,790
This must be the map
he was talking about. It was in his wallet.

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,197
- Something's been torn off the top of it.
- Maybe that's the way he got it.

111
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,748
Maybe it had directions on it
and he tore it off himself.

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,719
Some fellows memorize directions
so that nobody else can use their maps.

113
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,359
Why, half the state has got indigestion
from eating old maps.

114
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,992
You been staying in Phoenix?

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,036
- Your things there?
- Well, some of them.

116
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,917
Most everything I own is right on me.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,117
I put my bag in the bus depot
after I checked out of the hotel.

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,713
You haven't got a job.

119
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,030
You say you're the Dutchman's grandson.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,556
You tail a guy you thought was holding out
on you. He gets knocked off.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,108
Ray, you'd better take him out
to the mountain tomorrow.

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,430
Let him show you
just how he spent those three days.

123
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,909
Walter, you'd better go along with them.

124
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,270
How long after the shot
before you found him?

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,318
Ten to fifteen minutes.
Maybe longer. He was still warm.

126
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,830
- You didn't see anybody else?
- No.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,117
What were your plans
if Buckley had found the mine?

128
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,431
Well, I don't know exactly.
But I wouldn't have shot him.

129
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,510
Well, I guess I didn't have any plans.

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,718
That is, beyond hoping there might be
a mine I might have some legal rights to.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,119
Come on, Walter.

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,998
Let's have a look
at the other side of the canyon.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,551
What are you looking for now?

134
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,712
Buckley was hit from behind.

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,553
The killer was somewhere up there
by that cliff.

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,517
You were up over there.

137
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,951
Does that take me off the hook?

138
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,077
Maybe. Unless Buckley spun around
before he fell.

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,235
You see, three other guys
have been knocked off in this same area...

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,153
ahead of Buckley, before you even got here.

141
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,911
That's a break in your favour.

142
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,393
Buckley was the fourth?

143
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,550
The fourth in the last two years.

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,589
All right around here and all by a 30-30.

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,071
And if you look in the record book...

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,516
you'll find out 20 men have died
in this mountain since 1880.

147
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,268
Well, I'm through. Let's get back
to Apache Junction and some cold beer.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,033
I was just thinking,
this all adds up to something.

149
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,714
- Like what?
- Four guys murdered, all in the same area...

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,758
all by a 30-30,
all in the shadow of Weaver's Needle.

151
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,995
So?

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,310
The killer thinks he knows
where the gold is.

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,153
When it looked like the others might find it
before he did...

154
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,800
when they got too close,
he knocked them off.

155
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,155
So the jackpot must be somewhere close.

156
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,594
Near that peak.

157
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,518
Buckley, I bet he found it.

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,273
- Found what? The mine?
- No, the marker.

159
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,397
He said he knew where the marker was
and how to use it.

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,956
Come on. I'll show you something.

161
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,993
There's your marker.

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,909
- This is what Buckley meant?
- It's the only marker in this mountain.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,913
The rocks hammered in that old
saguaro cactus indicate three directions...

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,231
but only the one pointing north
leads anywhere, though...

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,039
to some signs carved
in those rocks up there.

166
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,509
It's quite a climb. Come on.

167
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,199
There they are.

168
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,154
What do they mean?

169
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,279
Oro is the word for gold.
The sunburst means the mine is near.

170
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,793
Now, this means 50 yards away
in the direction the snake is pointing.

171
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,317
Now, the only trouble is, nobody
has ever been able to find anything...

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,719
by following those signs.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,552
- Aren't they the real thing?
- Who knows?

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,949
Who put them there?
You suppose my grandfather?

175
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,271
No, they're Spanish signs.
Supposed to have been cut by the Peraltas.

176
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,590
Peraltas. Buckley had a Peralta map.

177
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,353
- Had the name "Manuel" on it.
- There were three of them.

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,715
Brothers. Manuel, Pedro, and Ramon.

179
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,912
They were the first to find gold in here
100 years ago.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,072
There's an old Indian legend
about them and this mountain, eh, Walter?

181
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,549
They opened up several of the mines
and then left.

182
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,315
And then Pedro, the oldest brother,
came back with a big expedition.

183
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,075
Walter, here, who's an Apache himself,
has heard from his own people...

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,718
the story of what happened.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,155
After many nuisance raids by the Indians...

186
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,834
Pedro Peralta decided to hide his gold.

187
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,998
He selected the richest
and most inaccessible mine of all...

188
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,559
as his storage place.

189
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,476
It was reached through a narrow, twisted,
and almost hidden canyon...

190
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,154
that finally opened onto a torturous runway.

191
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,155
This runway was the only entrance to
and the only exit from...

192
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,473
the fabulous mine, located
on the thin precipitous ledge below.

193
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,997
While armed men stood guard...

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,231
Pedro's miners led their animals
to the dangerous ledge...

195
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,596
where the rough ore was separated
from that which had been crushed...

196
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,797
and the pure gold nuggets
were hurriedly poured into sacks...

197
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,075
for storage in the hidden mine.

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,311
Pedro sat just inside his mine...

199
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,836
and noted that he possessed
some $20 million worth of gold.

200
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,310
But fate had decreed
a different kind of fortune for him.

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,072
Fate, and the Apaches.

202
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,957
Cochise, the greatest of all Apache chiefs...

203
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,235
watched the lightning-like attack.

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,794
And when every Spaniard
was finally killed...

205
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,348
he ordered his warriors to close the mine.

206
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,437
You see, the Spaniards
had defiled a holy place...

207
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,431
when they came into Superstition...

208
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,149
because to the Apaches it was the sacred
home of their Thunder Gods.

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,278
It wasn't enough to just kill Pedro
and his men.

210
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,352
All traces of them and their work
had to be erased.

211
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,238
So the mine was completely closed
and hidden.

212
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,117
With that accomplished,
Cochise and the Apaches...

213
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,351
felt their Thunder Gods
were avenged and appeased.

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,632
Every mine was closed...

215
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,793
so efficiently that they disappeared
from view as though they had never existed.

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,996
And Pedro's $20 million worth of gold...

217
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,073
was buried inside the sacred mountain
from which it had been taken.

218
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,793
That's the legend...

219
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
as the Apaches have told it
for over 100 years.

220
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,035
- The Apaches buried all that gold?
- Just like in Fort Knox.

221
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,712
Didn't the other brothers, Ramon or Manuel,
ever come back?

222
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,553
Well, they say Ramon came back,
but who knows?

223
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,033
You know, I generally charge tourists $10
for telling that yarn.

224
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,035
The mine, where the gold is buried,
that's the one my grandfather rediscovered?

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,236
So they say. Let's push it along.

226
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,157
- Ray, wait a minute.
- Yeah?

227
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,153
Do I have to go out with you?
I'd like to stay in here a while longer.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,995
Getting you, too? Gold-happy.

229
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,393
You know every tourist I tell that yarn to
has to stay in a little while longer.

230
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,756
- All trying to figure out them signs.
- I'm something more than a tourist.

231
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,229
I've got a family interest in that mine.

232
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,397
Well, it's all right with me.
I'll leave you some grub.

233
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,430
But, remember, there's a killer loose in here.
I'd hate to see you end up like Buckley.

234
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,078
Covin's reminder about Buckley...

235
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,958
took some of the excitement out of me,
but only for a minute.

236
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,395
The Deputy could think I was a fool
if he wanted to...

237
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,678
but I was determined to try my luck
at putting the golden jigsaw together.

238
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,473
For the next five days I beat my brains out...

239
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,358
trying to make the Spanish treasure signs
pay off.

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,039
Fifty yards, they said.

241
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,470
I went 50 yards in every direction
but straight up.

242
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,350
If I'd had wings, I'd have tried that.

243
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,432
I began to realise
that this was no ordinary puzzle.

244
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,391
I finally thought that maybe
if I went over every foot of the area...

245
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,278
where the four men had been murdered,
I might find something.

246
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,999
How close I came
I didn't learn till a lot later.

247
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,911
I didn't know I was being stalked...

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,468
that for a moment I was a bull's eye,
a sitting duck.

249
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,152
Number five on the list.

250
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,110
I just kept going,
dreaming about being a millionaire.

251
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,272
The only thing I learnt was that the guy
who'd murdered Buckley...

252
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,954
wasn't the only killer loose in Superstition.

253
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,033
You don't relax right away.

254
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,032
You sort of coast to a stop
after a shock like that.

255
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,155
I was almost afraid to look at my leg.
I was sure he'd gotten me.

256
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,189
He hadn't, but he came awful close.

257
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,436
I finally started to breathe again
and shook off the shroud of fear...

258
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,272
the rattler had thrown over me.

259
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,828
I picked up my pack and started to get up.

260
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,639
That's when I found it buried in the ground.

261
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,280
When I pulled rocks loose
to throw at the snake...

262
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,316
I'd uncovered a part of a rifle.

263
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,039
Excitedly, I dug the rest of it
out of the gravel.

264
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,113
I didn't have any idea what kind it was,
but as I held it in my hands...

265
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,395
I wanted to believe
it had been my grandfather's.

266
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,029
Because if it was, it could mean
I was close to the lost mine.

267
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,235
To the gold.

268
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,476
Call it fate, luck, it doesn't matter.

269
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,996
But a rattlesnake that had tried to kill me
had led me to this old weapon.

270
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,119
At that moment it seemed I could
actually feel the presence of Jacob Walz...

271
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,599
in the unfriendly canyon.

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
Suddenly it was more important
to find out about this gun...

273
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,117
than to keep on searching for the mine.

274
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,873
So I decided to leave the mountain
and bring the gun to you.

275
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,474
- Would you know what kind it is?
- Looks like a Sharps.

276
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,949
- But we're interested in a 30-30.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,510
But if it is old enough, it could have been
my grandfather's, couldn't it?

278
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,194
- I told you he had the bug.
- Let me see it.

279
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,911
I think I got a Sharps here.

280
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,550
A Sharps. A breech-Ioader.

281
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,397
Forty-five-ninety calibre. Lots of 'em
around here in the '70s and '80s.

282
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,675
That one killed a sheriff in 1875.

283
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,634
You know, finding this where I did,
I thought I might be near his mine.

284
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,358
That is, if it was his gun.

285
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,113
I never heard anybody say
what kind of a weapon Walz used.

286
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,636
If it's so important for you to find out,
you might try the Pioneer's Home.

287
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,314
- The Pioneer's Home?
- It's in Phoenix. Old folks' place.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,153
One of those old-timers
might be able to tell you about this...

289
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,673
and your grandfather, too.

290
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,228
They got nothing else to do up there
but talk.

291
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,788
Thanks. I think I'll pay them a visit.

292
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,469
Mrs. Bannister might be able to help you.

293
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,835
She spent her childhood
in Florence Junction.

294
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,230
She isn't easy to talk to.
If you'll promise not to upset her...

295
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,355
I won't.

296
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,395
Martha, this is Mr. Storm.

297
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,630
He wants to ask you a few questions.

298
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,558
You know I don't like being bothered.

299
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,757
You've got no right
to bring people pestering me.

300
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,230
It's about my grandfather.
He lived here around 1886.

301
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,039
I knew a lot of people who lived here.
What was his name?

302
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,917
Walz. Jacob Walz.

303
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,678
I won't talk about him.

304
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,076
Jacob Walz was a mean, wicked man.

305
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,676
And if you're his grandson,
you're probably just like him.

306
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,149
Did I hear you mention Jake Walz?

307
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,959
He was a real sidewinder, that man.

308
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,713
What do you want to know about him?
I'll be glad to tell you.

309
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,429
You're always poking your nose in
where you ain't wanted, Bill Bates.

310
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,478
- He didn't ask you.
- My name's Barry Storm.

311
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,869
- You see, Walz was my...
- Checking up on old Jake?

312
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,713
Well, you've come to the right place,
young fellow.

313
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,554
- Now, if you want my opinion, l...
- He don't want anything from you.

314
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,918
I'm the one who knows
all about Jacob Walz.

315
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,036
I found this gun and...

316
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,591
You like guns, don't you?

317
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,632
You probably go around scaring people
with them, just like he did to me.

318
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,832
When I was a girl in Florence Junction,
he frightened me.

319
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,631
What you doing, mister?

320
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,553
What you doing?
Why are you playing with that?

321
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,953
Is that gun yours? It's brand new, ain't it?

322
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,199
- Ain't it, mister?
- Come here.

323
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,798
Want to have some fun?

324
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,791
Put your finger in there.

325
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,029
Pull.

326
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,479
Pull harder.

327
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,799
I got buyers for two of our burros.
A Mexican fellow and his partner.

328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,229
Well, here's your burros.
You got them at a good price, too.

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,719
Gonna have a look
for that lost Spanish gold?

330
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,237
I guessed right, didn't I?

331
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,993
Everybody looks for it,
but nobody ever finds it.

332
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,992
I figure them Indians hid it.
Too good, they hid it.

333
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,155
- What do you mean the Indians hid it?
- That gold is hid forever.

334
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,353
Want to sell back them burros?
I'll give you half what you paid for them.

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,552
Well, maybe they ain't hid it
good enough. Eh, Peralta?

336
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,995
Silencio!

337
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,512
Keep your mouth shut.

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,596
Name of Peralta
mean anything to you, Dutchie?

339
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,319
Be a dirty shame
if they was to stumble onto something...

340
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,709
and we wasn't there to see what is was.

341
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,109
Yeah.

342
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,876
- They're making camp for the night.
- Yeah, it's about time.

343
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,113
The fellows must be part mountain goat,
the way they been hightailing it.

344
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,193
Go start a fire down in the gully there,
and don't make any smoke.

345
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,351
I'll go unload the burro.

346
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,117
Soon as I play myself a game.

347
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,556
You know, I think you're right about them.

348
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,552
They haven't even stopped
to pan one of the streams.

349
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,394
- They know where they're going all right.
- Sure they know where they're going.

350
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,911
You should've seen the way that Mexican
jumped down the other fellow's throat...

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,399
when he started to talk.

352
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,199
You're dang right
they know where they're going.

353
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,675
Say, you're lucky I let you in on this.

354
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,470
You go down and build a fire
and don't make any smoke.

355
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,716
Just turn up the ace of spades
and I can win this game.

356
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,476
Well, it could be the ace of spades.

357
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,198
I won that game.

358
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,199
Them's the settin'est two fellows
I ever seen.

359
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,029
Suppose they sleep setting up that way?

360
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,393
Their fire's going out.

361
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,597
Darn ace of spades never shows up
when I need it most.

362
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,591
Beats me every dang game.

363
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,195
Come on!

364
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,033
They tricked us,
them shad-bellied hornswogglers!

365
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,270
Made us think they was setting here.

366
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,114
- They won't get away.
- We can pick up a trail.

367
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,475
I figure they went this way.
What do you think?

368
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,473
- Why, sure, Dutchie.
- All right, go get the burro. Go on!

369
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,996
The two who were following us...

370
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,550
I wonder if they follow our trail?

371
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,552
No, we'd have seen them two days before
if they had.

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,389
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

373
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,115
I found the marker and the signs.

374
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,313
We won't have long to wait
for the next sign now.

375
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,076
See, the moon is just rising.

376
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,631
I never heard of finding a mine
by the light of the moon.

377
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,749
It is 38 years to the day
that my brothers and I were here.

378
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,716
You won't forget our agreement?

379
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,033
I am a Mexican.

380
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,556
- I cannot file a claim for this mine.
- No, I won't forget.

381
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,669
I file the claim as an American citizen,
and we go 50-50.

382
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,791
We must get to the ledge below.

383
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,113
There's nothing here.

384
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,998
It's been many years,
but I'm sure this is the place.

385
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,153
Maybe the old burro-seller's right.
Maybe the Indians did cover it up.

386
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,599
We dig here.

387
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,152
My old legs are killing me.

388
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,190
I'm getting too old
to be traipsing around these mountains.

389
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,196
When we go back, lets go to Phoenix
instead by way of Florence Junction.

390
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,795
What do you say, Dutchie?
You never been to Phoenix, have you?

391
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,752
It's a real live town.

392
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,192
I remember once I was...

393
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,357
Look at it! Gold! Sacks of it, already mined!

394
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,398
We've got a storehouse.

395
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,111
I tell you it's the richest gold ore
you ever seen.

396
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,599
Come on.

397
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,879
Gold!

398
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,318
Joe, what is it?

399
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,391
Fellow found gold in Superstition,
Mrs. Thomas.

400
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,755
Brung back nuggets as big as your fist.

401
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,316
- What's happening?
- Parsons is weighing it now.

402
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,310
- Stranger, you've hit it rich.
- How much?

403
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,279
- For that ore, I'd say close to $40,000 a ton.
- $40,000 a ton.

404
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,749
- That's bigger than the California strike.
- How much?

405
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,558
$40,000 a ton!

406
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,636
- Bonanza!
- $40,000 a ton.

407
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,030
- Can you imagine?
- Go and buy up every burro in town. Hurry.

408
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,753
- How much?
- $40,000.

409
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,916
- $40,000.
- It's over $40,000.

410
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,198
- It's way over $40,000.
- Nearly $50,000.

411
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,594
- How much for what I brought in?
- A mite less than 300 pounds.

412
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,958
- I'll give you $5,000 for it.
- It's worth $6,000.

413
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,429
Refined, maybe. As it is, no.

414
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,114
- Let's see.
- Stop crowding me, will you?

415
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,313
All right, $5,000.

416
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,598
What's your name?

417
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,269
I have to have your name on this receipt.

418
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,508
- Walz. Jacob Walz.
- What's his name?

419
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,636
He said his name was Jacob Walz.

420
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,558
- Who is he?
- Jacob Walz.

421
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,108
- Must be a Dutchman.
- Or a German.

422
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,794
Yeah, that's what I said, a Dutchman.

423
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,949
Jacob Walz.

424
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,793
Sign it.

425
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,153
It's a receipt stating I paid you $5,000...

426
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,879
for 297.5 pounds of gold ore.

427
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,591
- You ain't paid me yet.
- I will.

428
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,675
You've got to sign it. It's the law.

429
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,315
Is he signing his name?

430
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,914
- I don't know.
- He isn't even signing his name.

431
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,310
- He can't even write his own name.
- He can't read nor write.

432
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,757
How do you like that, Julia?

433
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,469
A stupid foreigner that can't even read
or write finds $1 million gold mine.

434
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,109
And you get $11 a week
clerking in a hardware store.

435
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,669
You and your high-school diploma.

436
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,310
And ten 50s make $5,000.

437
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,277
You're sure going to file a claim, ain't you?

438
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,635
I'd like to talk to you about a deal
you might find interesting.

439
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,757
Whereabouts is this strike?
Ain't you going to file a claim, mister?

440
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,671
Boy, you really struck it rich.

441
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,479
I'll bet that ore is worth more
than Parsons said.

442
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,950
- That gold has got...
- He got $5,000...

443
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,755
Pete.

444
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,999
Pete, where are you?

445
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,393
Get off my bed.

446
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,109
How many times must I tell you to stay
out of my room, unless you're invited?

447
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,272
I've got a right to lie on your bed.
I'm your husband.

448
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,479
Come into the other room.
I want to talk to you.

449
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,959
Talk to me in here.

450
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,199
Julia!

451
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,629
That's right, Pete. Come in.

452
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,115
All right. What do you want?

453
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,548
Sit down.

454
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,117
A man named Jacob Walz
has just arrived in town.

455
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,358
- I want to meet him.
- Why?

456
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,319
He's discovered gold.

457
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,392
What do you want to meet him for?
I've got a right to know.

458
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,674
Really?

459
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,830
Well, I have a right to some things, too.

460
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,911
Like being sick and tired
of running a bakery.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,753
- Wait a minute.
- You've had four years to get me out of here.

462
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,389
- I've had bad luck. I'm doing the best I can.
- Yes, you've done very well.

463
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,232
Have you been able to keep a job?

464
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,231
Have you replaced our savings...

465
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,359
you so cleverly invested in grazing land
no animal could live on? Have you, Pete?

466
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,796
- That wasn't my fault. I got swindled.
- No, I got swindled.

467
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,514
So now, you're going to bring
that man here.

468
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,438
- No, I won't, Julia.
- Yes, you will.

469
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,439
There's still that unsolved murder
in Milwaukee.

470
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,110
- All right.
- Good.

471
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,072
Of course, he's not to know
that I'm married to you.

472
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,797
- But you are married to me.
- Yes, but he's not to know.

473
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,519
You understand, Pete?

474
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,713
- What do you want of him?
- I'm not sure yet.

475
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,553
But I am sure I'm not going to stay here
and dry up...

476
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,517
like the other women in this filthy town.

477
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,717
I'll get a job driving the stage to Tucson
or mining up in Gold Field.

478
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,234
Yes. He's at Luke's Saloon now.

479
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,876
Buy him drinks or whatever he wants.

480
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,751
Just see that I meet him, Pete.

481
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,749
Pete?

482
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,836
There's some money on the floor.

483
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,951
He's been here close to eight hours.
How long can he go on?

484
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,315
- Come on, Walz. Tell us where the...
- No!

485
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
Very good,
how about buying you a drink, mister?

486
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,798
I buy my own drinks.
I could buy the whole place if I wanted to.

487
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,269
Where'd you strike it rich, Dutchie?
Come on, tell us.

488
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,989
- You want to hear about the mine?
- Is there much of this high-grade ore, Walz?

489
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,672
That? That's nothing.

490
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,312
Why, that's just some of the loose stuff
I picked up on the outside of the mine.

491
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,668
You mean on the outside?

492
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,230
On the inside of the mine,
there's a vein of gold as thick as...

493
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,237
- As thick as her waist.
- Where is it? Come on, tell us.

494
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,472
All right, I'll tell you.

495
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,400
From the mine,
you can see the old military trail.

496
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,596
- Yeah?
- Then, it is in Superstition?

497
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,269
But from the trail, you can't see the mine.

498
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,318
You've been teasing and horsing us around
all night, Walz.

499
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,437
Now, you tell us where you struck it rich
or shut up.

500
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,590
- Put up or shut up.
- That's telling him.

501
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,070
- It's about time somebody told him off.
- The blowhard.

502
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,440
- Maybe I'll file a claim.
- What?

503
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,631
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

504
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,917
You'd know right where to look.
That'd make it easy for you.

505
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,675
Well, come on up and try to find it.
And I'll be waiting for you.

506
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,910
I'll give you a real welcome.

507
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,120
That's telling them, Walz.
How about buying you a drink?

508
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,590
He told you before,
he can buy his own drinks. Come on, honey.

509
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,113
Are you really a Dutchman, honey?
I bet Elsie you was a German. Was I right?

510
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,719
What, honey?

511
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,593
Bring me a drink.

512
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,875
Had enough of that Dutchman tonight.

513
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,595
I bet you get awful Ionesome
up in the mountains all alone.

514
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,710
It ain't natural for a man
to be by himself all the time, honey.

515
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,310
When you go back to your mine,
maybe you ought to take a little company.

516
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,709
Maybe like taking Lucille with you?

517
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,195
You're just like the rest. All you want
is my gold. That's all any of you want!

518
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,669
I don't want none of your gold, mister.
Not tonight.

519
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,159
- Get out of my place!
- You dirty...

520
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,073
Stop it, Lucille. You heard me, get out.

521
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,719
All right. You won't let me stay in...

522
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,077
and I won't let you come out.

523
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,559
He's bluffing.

524
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,511
Relax, boss, another half minute,
he'll fall on his face.

525
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,351
Get out of here, you drunken...

526
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,153
Take it easy.

527
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,151
Come on, Jim. Let's get him.

528
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,719
- Where'd he get to?
- Where'd he go?

529
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,831
- He disappeared, Julia.
- Not so loud, Pete.

530
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,990
- I tried to bring him home.
- He's inside now.

531
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,991
Unconscious, passed out here on the street.

532
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,196
Now, please don't come back
until I send for you.

533
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,508
- Julia.
- Please.

534
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,553
Good night, Pete.

535
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,513
Well, at last. Good morning.
How do you feel now?

536
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,514
Here's some coffee. Fresh roll.

537
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,992
You may wash up in there.

538
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,552
- How'd I get here?
- You were lying in the doorway of my shop.

539
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,678
- You were quite sick.
- I was drunk last night.

540
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,633
- Either way, I still couldn't leave you there.
- Why?

541
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,948
- Why?
- Yeah.

542
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,716
Because I felt sorry for you.
What other reasons are there?

543
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,234
- How much do I owe you?
- Owe me?

544
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,038
- Yeah, here.
- Why, nothing.

545
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,910
Very glad you're feeling better now.

546
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,712
My name is Jacob Walz.

547
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,837
I'm glad to know you, Mr. Walz.
I'm Julia Thomas.

548
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,077
- You do not know who I am?
- No, should I?

549
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,990
Everybody in town's talking about me.

550
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,708
- Why?
- I found a bonanza.

551
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,194
- What?
- Gold.

552
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,840
I found the richest gold mine in the world.

553
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,678
That's nice.
Would you like some more coffee?

554
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,469
- You have no interest?
- Should I have?

555
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,472
Mr. Walz, I don't know anything
about gold mines.

556
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,791
I just know about baking,
and trying to run my little shop.

557
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,714
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I do have to get the baking done.

558
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,430
You don't even want to know
where my mine is.

559
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,159
I wouldn't know a gold mine
if I fell into one.

560
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,439
- I'm very much obliged to you.
- You're welcome.

561
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,871
May I call upon you sometime?

562
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,918
- Well, l...
- This evening?

563
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,678
All right, if you wish.

564
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,668
Excuse me.

565
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,597
- Good morning, Mrs. Butler.
- How much are them?

566
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,035
- 20 cents a dozen.
- That's outrageous.

567
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,270
- And them?
- The same.

568
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,555
You ought to be ashamed
charging such prices.

569
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,677
- But they're the lowest in town.
- Ever since that gold strike...

570
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,469
everybody's charging four times what things
is worth, and you ain't no different.

571
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,437
Criminals, all of you.

572
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,437
Give me half a dozen of them.

573
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,873
- Very well.
- The freshest ones, mind you.

574
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,712
- All this stuff's been sold.
- What?

575
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,392
- It belongs to me.
- Why, you can't do...

576
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,913
- And you get out.
- You can't talk to...

577
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,228
- You get out!
- I won't stand it!

578
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,197
You get out and you stay out!

579
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,589
Herr Walz, you shouldn't have done that.

580
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,391
She was one of my best customers.

581
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,630
You let people talk to you that way?

582
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,631
When a woman has to support herself...

583
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,756
it's necessary to endure
many unpleasant things.

584
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,159
I buy everything.

585
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,992
- Really, there's nothing...
- It's for sale?

586
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,752
- Yes, but...
- All right, I buy everything.

587
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,671
You wrap it up. I take it with me.

588
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,512
- Everything?
- Here.

589
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,270
- Hey, you like cookies?
- Yes, sir.

590
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,835
Here.

591
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,598
- All of them?
- Yeah.

592
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,753
Good evening.

593
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,550
- Gum drops.
- Thank you. How nice.

594
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,355
Won't you come in?

595
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,434
Please. Won't you sit down?

596
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,393
I'm much obliged to you
for taking me in last night.

597
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,835
It was nothing at all.
I'm much obliged to you.

598
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,070
- Why?
- For the biggest day's business I've had...

599
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,754
since I came to Phoenix. I've sold out.

600
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,909
- Would you like to see the album?
- Yes, I would.

601
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,715
This is my mother, my father.
He died when I was seven.

602
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,320
That was after they came from Germany.

603
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,068
- Oh, dear. Not that one.
- Here, wait a minute.

604
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,754
I keep meaning to take it out of there.

605
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,037
It's so embarrassing.

606
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,758
You grew up fine.

607
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,193
Let me see.

608
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,359
I was born and raised in Milwaukee.
This is the house we lived in.

609
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,277
And this is my mother's uncle.
He's in Dresden now.

610
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,115
- And this is...
- When did you come here?

611
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,952
About four years ago.

612
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,752
Why did you come here?

613
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,879
After my mother passed away,
I just didn't want to stay there anymore.

614
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,238
I thought this was as good a place as any
for a woman to make her own way.

615
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,873
Now, this is...

616
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,792
- Herr Walz, do you like music?
- Who doesn't like music?

617
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,273
Herr Walz.

618
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,150
- I'm sorry.
- Good night.

619
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,514
Please.

620
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,033
I didn't want to make you angry.
It was just that you are so very beautiful.

621
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,838
Good night, Herr Walz.

622
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,790
Don't assume you can take liberties...

623
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,314
simply because
I'm a businesswoman living alone.

624
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,914
- May I call upon you again?
- Good night.

625
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,870
- You may use this door.
- Please, may I call upon you again?

626
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,074
Tomorrow?

627
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,959
All right.

628
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,951
- Good night.
- Good night.

629
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,236
Good night, Frulein.

630
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,352
That's her husband sitting over there.

631
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,193
You think that Dutchman would've
found out about him by now.

632
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,239
Walz doesn't even know she's married.
Folks are scared to tell him.

633
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,550
Walz would shoot your head off,
if you said anything.

634
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,234
How many trips has Walz made to that mine
since he met her?

635
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,673
Five. Maybe six.

636
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,393
Next.

637
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,792
How long will it be?

638
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,034
Let me see. I've got this gentleman here.

639
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,912
He can have my place.

640
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,633
What's so funny?

641
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,230
- Give me a shave.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,039
Just got back into town?
Only been gone five days.

643
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,638
Who is that fellow?

644
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,115
Him?

645
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,229
He's the fellow that gave you his place.

646
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,870
Pete, what are you doing here?

647
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,314
I told you not to come back
unless I sent for you.

648
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,868
Everybody in town knows what's going on
but him.

649
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,520
- And they're laughing at me.
- Stop acting like a child.

650
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,909
- Why'd I do it?
- Do what?

651
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,992
Get up and run out of that barbershop
like a scared rabbit.

652
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,196
And all the time I wanted to...

653
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,073
- What are you so dressed up for?
- He said he'd be back today.

654
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,832
And I don't want him to find you here.

655
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,559
You've seen him nine or 10 times.
How long will this go on?

656
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,712
- What difference does it make?
- Julia, don't see him anymore.

657
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,553
- You're a fool.
- You're the smart one.

658
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,876
Only not as smart as you thought you were.

659
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,839
Not smart enough to get any of his money
or to find out where his mine is.

660
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,753
I know what I'm doing.
He'll be here any minute.

661
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,951
Have you told him yet?

662
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,109
Have you told him you're married...

663
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,957
that you're somebody else's wife?

664
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,191
- Pete, I want you to leave.
- Somebody will tell him.

665
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,677
Maybe somebody in the barbershop
already told him.

666
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,193
He'll find out.

667
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,272
He'll find out you're after the same thing
everybody else is after.

668
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,429
Get out.

669
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,988
I won't stand for you fooling around
with that Dutchman.

670
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,152
Let go of me. You're mussing my dress.
Let loose of me.

671
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,988
I'll send for you when I want you.

672
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,153
That's him.

673
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,629
Go out the back door. Go on.

674
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,550
This is it.
He pays off tonight, or it's the last night.

675
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,950
And when I come back
it'll be through the front door, Julia.

676
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,835
Jacob.

677
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,998
Every time I see you, you are more beautiful.

678
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,271
All the way to and from the mine...

679
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,750
I keep practicing
pretty speeches to say to you.

680
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,838
When I see you, I forget them.

681
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,791
Do people talk to you about me, about us?

682
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,269
- No one would dare. Why?
- There's something I must tell you.

683
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,199
What is it?

684
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,037
I should have told you a long time ago,
but I never thought it would be necessary.

685
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,432
I'm married. I have been for five years.

686
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,835
I couldn't lie to you, not now.

687
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,398
I don't love my husband.

688
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,916
Now I know I never have.
All I want is to be free of him.

689
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,277
- You don't care for him?
- No. I love you, Jacob.

690
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,433
- What's his name?
- Pete Thomas.

691
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,430
- Will he give you a divorce?
- Divorce?

692
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,634
For money. Will he give you a divorce?

693
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,879
I don't know.

694
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,672
Here's $2,000. We'll set a limit, say $5,000.
Will that be enough for him?

695
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,068
Perhaps.

696
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,993
But he must sign a paper
giving you a divorce.

697
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,230
I know about these things.
I was married once myself.

698
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,872
My wife divorced me,
took my daughter away from me...

699
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,599
all because my wife didn't sign a paper.

700
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,195
So he must sign that paper
before he gets a penny of money.

701
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,036
Will you make the arrangements?

702
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,634
- No, I'll do it myself.
- No, Jacob. I know I can.

703
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,756
Good. When did he get back?

704
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,834
Tonight.

705
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,233
What is it, Jacob?

706
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,596
I'm going back to the mine tonight
to get more money for us.

707
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,439
I love you.

708
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,874
I love you, Julia, and I want to marry you.

709
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,354
Soon, there will be just you and I.

710
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,594
Yes, Jacob. Just you and I.

711
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,189
Hey, everybody, I just saw the Dutchman.

712
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,032
He woke up old man Parsons.

713
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,510
Made him open up his store to get his grub.
I saw him head for the corral.

714
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,909
He's on his way back to the mine.

715
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,077
I don't know. Go after him.

716
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,991
Give me a drink, one for the road.

717
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,310
You and your big mouth,
you wreck our business.

718
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,436
We got to find that mine.

719
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,316
Come on. Wake up.

720
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,508
What is it?

721
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,558
- I want you to get my burros ready.
- It's you.

722
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,310
What for? You just got back.

723
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,150
It ain't decent waking a man
in the middle of the night.

724
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,516
- Not for burros.
- Do you know a Pete Thomas?

725
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,800
I ain't no gossip. I mind my own business.

726
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,509
I didn't ask you for any gossip.
I asked you if you knew him.

727
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,715
We say howdy when we meet.
I haven't seen him much lately.

728
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,268
He ain't used no animals for a spell.

729
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,518
- How long has he been here?
- I don't know. Three or four years.

730
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,197
Ever since him and his wife
came here from Milwaukee.

731
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,158
I'll start rounding up them dang burros
for you now.

732
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,391
I don't see why you can't wait
until morning, though.

733
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,199
Where did he go?

734
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,794
Must be getting old.
I can't seem to remembering him going.

735
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,393
Corral, I guess.

736
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,274
It's safe to go home now.
The Dutchman's gone.

737
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,550
Did you have a nice evening?

738
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,470
Did he pay off,
or do you have to see him just once more?

739
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,438
I'm glad you're back.

740
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,637
He gave me this. $2,000 and there'll be more.

741
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,798
This is for you, Pete, and the rest is coming.

742
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,077
- More than that if you want it.
- I don't want his money, understand?

743
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,038
- Let go of me and listen.
- No, you listen to me for a change.

744
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,669
You're through with him,
and this time I'll make sure of it.

745
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,314
What do you mean?

746
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,517
When he comes back from the mine
he'll find me here, where I belong.

747
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,354
I'll tell him how you played him for a sucker.
You're like the rest, only worse.

748
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,714
You pretend to be decent.

749
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,076
I'll tell him the whole rotten story,
from beginning to end.

750
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,434
The whole story, Pete?

751
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,476
Yes, including the murder.

752
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,549
It won't matter if you turn me in.
It won't matter at all...

753
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,116
because when I'm through with him
I'll have a second one to my credit...

754
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,474
Jacob Walz.

755
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,278
- You've got to listen to me.
- Try to buy me off, would he?

756
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,873
He can't do it.

757
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,034
Wait a minute. Whose idea was this?

758
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,476
- Did he think it up all by himself?
- No, he didn't.

759
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,796
It was my idea, all mine.

760
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,950
I don't like those kinds of ideas.

761
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,594
I'll kill him before he gets out of town.

762
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,193
Don't be silly.

763
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,916
The only way I could get the money
was to tell him you could be bought off.

764
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,718
You're still my wife.

765
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,031
I'm not lying to you.

766
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,148
He thinks you'll give me a divorce
for money.

767
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,708
There was no other way of getting it.

768
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,832
Don't you understand?

769
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,072
Could it be that it isn't just his gold
you're interested in...

770
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,515
that you've been lying to me?
Could that be?

771
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,070
- Don't be a fool.
- Answer me. Are you in love with him?

772
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,757
I've told you over and over again,
all I want is his gold.

773
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,434
- For us.
- I don't want anything from him.

774
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,237
Not even his mine?

775
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,873
Once I find out where it is,
he'll be no problem to us.

776
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,349
- Julia, you aren't lying to me?
- No.

777
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,872
You really leaving tonight?

778
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,190
The guy said you were on your way
back to the mine.

779
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,113
- When you leaving?
- What's the matter, Dutchie?

780
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,669
Come on, Walz. We're friends.

781
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,195
You've had enough now to kill a horse.

782
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,510
Why don't you take your business
somewhere else?

783
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,637
Ain't they buying gold in Tucson
or other places?

784
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,198
Every time you leave Phoenix,
you take half the town with you.

785
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,192
Everybody trying to follow you
and find out where that mine is.

786
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,589
I'll bet there's a hundred
of our customers waiting...

787
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,194
to follow you into that mountain right now.

788
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,593
Take your gold and go to some other town.
You ruin our business coming here.

789
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,870
Get me a pencil and a piece of paper.

790
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,393
There's Weaver's Needle.
There's the runway.

791
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,438
That's the ledge 200 yards
from the cactus marker.

792
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,590
- The mine's just below that.
- I see.

793
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,910
- I'm not coming back to Phoenix.
- What?

794
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,877
Too many people following me out of town.

795
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,032
Crowd's getting bigger and
it's getting harder to lose on the trail.

796
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,190
We'll meet somewhere else,
doesn't matter where.

797
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,317
- But, Jacob, I thought...
- You can get a divorce anywhere.

798
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,517
You can leave your husband the same way
my wife left me.

799
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,272
Is there anything wrong with that?

800
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,395
No, only I thought...

801
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,438
Of course, if you didn't mean
what you said about us.

802
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,789
If you lied.

803
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,074
Oh, no.

804
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,678
I did mean it, Jacob.

805
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,433
There's no sense giving him any money.
I've thought it over.

806
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,112
Can't I go with you now?

807
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,998
I'd never lose those people on the trail
if you were with me.

808
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,152
- You're so strange.
- Will you meet me at the mine or won't you?

809
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,593
Yes, I'll meet you there.

810
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,433
It may take me two or three extra days
because of the crowd.

811
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,399
- You'll be there ahead of me.
- Yes, I'll be waiting at the mine for you.

812
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,636
What did he want?
What did he come back for?

813
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,597
Nothing. Just to see me again.

814
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,632
Planning on running out on me, Julia?

815
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,199
No, Pete.

816
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,872
You know I wouldn't go without you.

817
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,075
I do now.

818
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,515
And I know something else.
You're in love with him.

819
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,955
You've been lying to me about that, too.

820
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,031
But we're going to the mine together.

821
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,874
You're going to be there when I kill him.
Do you understand?

822
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,311
Let me see that map again.

823
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,113
There's Weaver's Needle. We're almost there.

824
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,357
And I can hardly wait.

825
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,038
This is it.
This is the runway he told you about.

826
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,189
What if he's here?

827
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,396
He said it would take him
two or three extra days.

828
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,959
Anyway, he expects me.

829
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,918
If he is here,
you get him out where I can see him.

830
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,829
Jacob.

831
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,512
Pete, come on down. It's all right.
He's not here.

832
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,880
Look at it, Julia, just look at it.

833
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,998
Now I see why he always got back
to town so soon.

834
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,793
All he had to do is pick it up.

835
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,595
Pete.

836
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,159
It's worth millions.

837
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,477
Bring the burros down here.

838
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,916
The runway we came down
is the only way on or off this ledge.

839
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,958
Go on.
You were so anxious to be ready for him.

840
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,914
You're right.

841
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,193
Julia!

842
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,234
- They're gone. Everything's gone.
- What?

843
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,155
Our supplies, the food,
the water, everything. It's gone.

844
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,192
- Maybe the burros just wandered away.
- No, they were tied up.

845
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,238
- He's already here. He knows.
- No.

846
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,357
Call to him. Get him out in the open. Go on.

847
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,760
Jacob, where are you?

848
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,637
I didn't want to bring him. I didn't want to.

849
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,272
Listen to me.

850
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,473
I didn't want to bring him. He made me do it.

851
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,189
Please, darling. Help me.
Quick, before he finds out I'm gone.

852
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,674
You fool.

853
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,392
Get away from me.

854
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,112
All right, what are you waiting for?
Get it over with.

855
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,593
Pete, ask him for water. Go on.

856
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,993
You want her?

857
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,353
Take her. You can have her.

858
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,952
Nobody wants you.

859
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,548
From the beginning, it was her idea.

860
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,595
I don't want your gold. I never did.

861
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,240
If you want her, take her. You can have her.

862
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,558
You see, Jacob, I've gotten rid of him.

863
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,278
I killed him for you.

864
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,794
Now you know I wasn't lying to you.

865
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,793
It's all over.

866
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,431
It's just you and me now, remember?
Just like you wanted it.

867
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,073
You love me. You said you did.

868
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,913
We can be married now, just like you said.

869
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,474
I wasn't lying to you, Jacob.

870
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,797
He forced me to bring him with me.
I didn't want to.

871
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,276
You've got to believe me. You've got to.

872
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,999
I proved I loved you when I killed him.

873
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,998
Please help me.

874
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,119
I want you.

875
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,275
All you ever wanted was my gold.
Well, now you've got it.

876
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,077
This record only goes back to 1912.

877
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,116
Arizona didn't become a state till then.

878
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,634
But you got the right dope
from those old newspapers.

879
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,314
I remember for a fact it was in 1910...

880
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,436
two years before we had a coroner's office.

881
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,919
What are you two talking about?

882
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,594
I'm checking up on a female skeleton
found in Superstition.

883
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,319
If Bill Bates was right,
that skeleton was Julia Thomas'...

884
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,550
the woman my grandfather was in love with.

885
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,108
If you don't stop harping
about this Walz business...

886
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,475
somebody's going to
swear out a lunacy complaint.

887
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,552
But, Ray, I've got a lot to go on now.
First, I found that rifle.

888
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,677
Then I checked the stories
of the old folks at the Pioneer's Home.

889
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,149
I even learnt that
an earthquake did hit Superstition.

890
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,435
- It was on May 3rd, 1887.
- Who cares?

891
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,080
I'm going back to that canyon
where I found that rifle.

892
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,513
So long, fellas.

893
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,031
Might as well clear off one of my tables.

894
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,634
Be just my luck they bring him in
on Sunday.

895
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,351
- Did you find your mine yet?
- Nope.

896
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,989
But I'm on my way back to Superstition
right now.

897
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,469
You better be careful.
There's still a killer up there.

898
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,869
I got nothing to lose, except my life.

899
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,194
The sky clouded up...

900
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,271
and the wind tried to blow a scare into me...

901
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,999
as I made my way
back to the treasure signs.

902
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,232
Three days later...

903
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,118
the clouds got out of the sky
and into my brain.

904
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,758
I got lost.

905
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,718
I couldn't even find the canyon
where I'd uncovered the old gun.

906
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,869
Like an idiot...

907
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,428
I fumbled in and out of one gorge
after another...

908
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,829
pushing along with no more sense
or reason...

909
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,478
than if I had been on a treadmill.

910
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,199
I knew I had to locate the rock
called Weaver's Needle...

911
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,999
before I could even start looking
for the lost mine.

912
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,709
Then, with sheer blind luck
I walked right into it.

913
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,837
Here was the spot I'd found the gun,
killed the rattlesnake.

914
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,751
And I had my starting point.

915
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,875
A short distance away I found the cliff...

916
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,110
from which I could see the old military trail.

917
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,078
Jacob Walz had said that from his mine
he could see the trail...

918
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,071
but from the trail
nobody could see the mine.

919
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,628
I set out to prove he'd told the truth.

920
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,795
Now, I'm a guy who gets dizzy just standing
on a high kerb.

921
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,679
But even when the ground dropped out
from under me...

922
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,196
like a deceitful friend,
I kept scrambling along the cliff side...

923
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,793
keeping the trail in sight.

924
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,997
When you're sick with gold fever
you have no patience with caution.

925
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,957
All you think of is getting your hooks into...

926
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,634
that glittering pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

927
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,711
I followed the edge of that cliff...

928
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,837
staying within view of the trail
for the next three days.

929
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,912
My fever began to go down
as discouragement set in...

930
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,878
and I was about ready to give up
and go home, when suddenly...

931
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,598
I came on a wide ledge.

932
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,511
Gradually, it dawned on me that here...

933
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,717
the trail was in sight
but that a mine couldn't be seen from below.

934
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,429
And then I found the map,
the strange map carved in a stone.

935
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,870
This was something I hadn't expected.

936
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,589
I got as excited as a poker player
filling an inside straight flush.

937
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,434
They looked like old Spanish markings.
A sort of master map of the region.

938
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,274
But the doodles didn't make any sense,
because I didn't know how to read them.

939
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,759
Then I found that hole...

940
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,798
and realized it had been drilled into
the rock for some reason.

941
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,235
I didn't have any idea
what the reason could be...

942
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,995
but I picked up a stick
and began probing to try and find out.

943
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,672
I peered along the stick...

944
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,558
but its direction pointed out nothing
I hadn't seen before.

945
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,039
Then I discovered...

946
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,953
though it looked like just a single hole
on the outside...

947
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,235
there were actually several on the inside.

948
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,470
My second look didn't lead anyplace either.

949
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,028
But the third started bells ringing
in my head.

950
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,680
It pointed my eyes
at a strange kind of peak...

951
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,877
a startling rock formation with a window
in its top.

952
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,111
I felt as if Santa Claus
had just climbed down my chimney.

953
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,714
I began making tracks for that peak.

954
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,278
As I clawed and climbed my way towards
the window above...

955
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,271
one thought kept repeating itself.

956
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,796
Nobody, not Ray Covin, the Sheriff,
Bill Bates...

957
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,156
nobody had ever mentioned the weird map
cut in the rocks...

958
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,357
or this peak that had been pointed out
by the stick in the hole.

959
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,749
I'd discovered these things all by myself.

960
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,072
What I knew was top secret,
private knowledge for Barry Storm.

961
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,914
I felt sure that at last, finally...

962
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,594
I was on the express road
to the Lost Dutchman...

963
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,955
and my grandfather's fabulous mine...

964
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,112
where I'd find lumps of gold
piled up like rubble.

965
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,909
I was so dreamy, I figured all I had to do
was crawl through that window...

966
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,468
and the mine was on the other side.

967
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,755
But there wasn't any mine,
there was nothing.

968
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,400
I figured I'd crawled behind
another eight-ball.

969
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,995
Then I realized this arch was man-made.
It did add up to something.

970
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,355
And when I saw my shadow
on the valley floor...

971
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,795
I knew this window was the key to the gold.

972
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,838
My whole future was
in that square of light below.

973
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,151
I raced back to the wall map
to fix its location in my mind...

974
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,789
then got started on that last lap
to fame and fortune.

975
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,716
But something had changed.
It wasn't like I'd left it.

976
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,878
Looking for this?

977
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,032
Ray, what are you doing here?

978
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,634
- Looking for you.
- What for? Ray, I got it.

979
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,712
I found the window cut in the rock.
It's a sort of a light sign.

980
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,588
It casts a shadow that points to a spot
where the gold may be buried.

981
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,955
- And the spot is...
- Go on.

982
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,038
Of course, it may not mean anything at all.

983
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,793
- What did you come back for?
- Another murder.

984
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,712
Drop your gun belt.

985
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,630
You shut up fast when you thought
you'd found something.

986
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,188
You don't want a partner and neither do I.

987
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,273
You killed Buckley.

988
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,033
I've been looking for
that gold for 20 years, Storm.

989
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,634
If anybody's going to get it,
it's going to be me.

990
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,790
You're right about that light sign.

991
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,872
And some night it's going to show me
where the gold is.

992
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,679
Turn around.

993
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,553
Start walking.

994
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,714
We'll send a posse in after you
in a couple of weeks.

995
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,392
No murder here.

996
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,313
Your bones will show you just died
of a bad fall.

997
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,675
Keep walking. Right to the end.

998
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,156
Covin makes victim number 21.

999
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,028
Good thing Walter trailed you,
or you'd still be explaining this.

1000
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,078
Too bad he didn't get up in time
to help you.

1001
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,952
But why were you having me tailed?

1002
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,076
I wasn't. I was after Ray.

1003
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,910
It wasn't any accident
I sent Walter with you the first time.

1004
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,468
Ray had a funny habit
of being out of the office...

1005
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,437
whenever these murders happened.

1006
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,080
And he was always so fast
locating the bodies.

1007
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,357
I stayed behind that first time
after Covin told me to go back.

1008
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,910
When I saw him raise his gun
about to shoot you, I knew he was the killer.

1009
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,673
Then you've been using me
for a clay pigeon.

1010
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,875
Kind of.

1011
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,713
I couldn't arrest my own deputy
just on knowing.

1012
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,109
I had to prove Covin was the murderer.

1013
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,760
That's why I was waiting for you
to go in again.

1014
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,389
I knew if you got too close,
he'd have to make a pass at you.

1015
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,756
Well, let's get going.
I want to be out of here before dark.

1016
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,751
I'm not going with you.

1017
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,230
I got a date up there tonight.

1018
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,397
Mind a little company?

1019
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,477
Ought to be kind of interesting...

1020
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,438
watching a man just dig up $20 million.

1021
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,789
All I'm waiting for is that full moon.

1022
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,272
When it comes through that window...

1023
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,272
it'll light up the patch of ground
where I'm to dig.

1024
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,471
That's all I'll need.

1025
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,279
Look at it.

1026
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,471
I'm standing right in the centre of it.
Right here.

1027
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,678
This is where I dig.

1028
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,869
My grandfather's gold.

1029
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,315
$20 million worth.

1030
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,074
It's moved.

1031
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,152
It was here, that square light. Now it's there.

1032
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,675
You hadn't figured on that, Storm?

1033
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,719
You forgot the moon
and earth keep moving.

1034
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,838
At this rate, you'll have to dig up
the whole mountain.

1035
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,353
Need a bulldozer.

1036
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,069
That earthquake changed things, too.

1037
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,754
That's why Ray Covin never found the mine.

1038
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,751
That's why you'll never find it.

1039
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,159
That's right.

1040
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:55,119
If it is the moon that'll point out that gold,
it'll only do it once a year.

1041
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,795
On the anniversary of the night
the Peraltas made that sign.

1042
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,233
That's the catch.

1043
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,552
When was that sign made?
What night, what hour, what moment?

1044
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,954
If I could figure that out, I'd hit the jackpot.

1045
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,508
And if you did,
this county would need a new sheriff...

1046
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,036
because I'd be right there digging with you.
Come on, let's go.

1047
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,632
Well, that's the story
as far as I'm concerned.

1048
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,871
The whole biography of
Superstition Mountain won't be finished...

1049
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,474
till somebody takes that gold away from her.

1050
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,949
The treasure signs, the marker...

1051
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,755
the light sign, they're all genuine.

1052
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:32,469
Maybe you can figure out
that strange map carved in the stone.

1053
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,997
I've got a hunch
it holds the key to the fortune.

1054
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,595
Anyway, everything's all there
in the mountain.

1055
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,079
And if you're interested...

1056
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,038
you might like to know that any citizen
of the United States...

1057
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,997
has the legal right to search for gold.

1058
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,355
And you don't have to pay anybody
for the privilege.

If you should find Superstition's treasure,
the State of Arizona...

1060
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,036
and the Government of the United States
will recognise your claim to it.

1061
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,917
Like I said at the beginning...

1062
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,709
if you'd like to pick up $20 million,
I'll show you where to look.

1063
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,873
Well, I've shown you.
