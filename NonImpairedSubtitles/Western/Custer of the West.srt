1
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:28,701
Charge!

2
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,708
Charge!

3
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:44,850
Custer...

4
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:46,143
...General.

5
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:49,859
I didn't recognize you without
your hourse. Sit down.

6
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,454
Thank you, sir.

7
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,932
Lincoln wants us to write
personally...

8
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,889
...to the widow and
grieving mother. You knew...

9
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:09,766
...Major Bridge, didn't you?
- I did.

10
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,406
"As Commanding General,
I have the opportunity...

11
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:16,406
...to know your late husband
Major Bridges.

12
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,533
I was present at his death.

13
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,704
It may be of some comfort
to you to know that...

14
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,920
...he died as the coward he was,
with his back to the enemy...

15
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:24,919
...climbing a fence
to get away.

16
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:28,139
- What did you write?
- The usual, of course.

17
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,638
"He met his end unflinching...

18
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,349
...despite the severity
of his wounds...

19
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,523
...and sacrificed his life
so that others could live.

20
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,608
Etc, etc.
Phillip Sheridan.

21
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:42,195
Commanding General
Army of Potomac".

22
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,704
You're staying in the Army,
aren't you, Custer?

23
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:48,507
I like the life,
you know that.

24
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,635
You want me to find
a post for you...

25
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,590
...someplace lively,
interesting?

26
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,642
That's what am I here for,
General?

27
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,220
There's some Indians out west
that need killing.

28
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,434
That's a dirty job.

29
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:03,282
Not the sort of thing
that appeals to you, is it?

30
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:05,525
No.

31
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:08,073
No, you prefer a holy war.

32
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,580
The state of union.

33
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:13,082
Onward Christian soldiers,
free the slaves!

34
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,713
Well, I suppose
I can't blame you.

35
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,307
No one's gonna pin a medal
on you for killing Indians...

36
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:23,523
...and stealing their land.
- What's the matter?

37
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,401
I'm concerned about you,
son.

38
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,781
You're the only man I know...

39
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,111
...who reached the top
of his profession...

40
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,120
...and was on his way down
before he was 30.

41
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,874
What happens
to a boy General...

42
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,380
...when they don't need
anymore Generals?

43
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:41,459
I don't know.

44
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,464
Tell me!

45
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,927
Well, I suppose the boy general
should become...

46
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:49,564
...a boy farmer
or boy bank clerk, or...

47
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,320
How about a cowboy?

48
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,893
Oh, I forgot you, don't drink.

49
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,399
You didn't forget.

50
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,734
You just keep trying.

51
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,947
All right. I'll make a drunk
out of you yet.

52
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:28,501
General, you must have
something I'm right for.

53
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:32,011
I've got a few jobs here,
you can have your pick.

54
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,303
I guess you deserve it.

55
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,477
Occupation:
Garrison in Atlanta.

56
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:41,443
Soft life, sort or like
being a Prison Warden.

57
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:45,075
- No.
- Here's another one.

58
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,664
There's an arsenal up in
New York State, out of service.

59
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:52,127
They won't be making
any more guns...

60
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,708
...but its government property
so has to be protected.

61
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,179
I guess somebody's got
to make sure the kids...

62
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,430
...don't throw rocks
through the windows.

63
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,592
No!

64
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,011
All right.

65
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:05,894
Here's a job as Cavalry
Instructor with West Point.

66
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:09,272
Teaching the yahoos how
to get off and on a horse.

67
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,567
No, General, no.

68
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,906
- Well, what do you want?
- I want action!

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,207
That brings us back
to the Indians.

70
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:22,423
They're on the land and
we want it. Plain robbery.

71
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,224
You won't be able to tell
yourself you're fighting for...

72
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,891
...a noble cause. You know there
must be over a million of them.

73
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,776
You could be outnumbered
a hundred to one.

74
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:32,395
You'd be fighting against the
best legged cavalry in the...

75
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,110
...world and you'll have
to chase those devils...

76
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,904
...over the roughest
country in the world...

77
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,281
...desert, mountains,
prairies.

78
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,992
You know, Custer?
You could become...

79
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,832
...a living legend.
Or get yourself killed.

80
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,433
Dead men make
better legends.

81
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:57,563
It's up to you.
You want to go west?

82
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,772
Libby! Libby!

83
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,778
How come they didn't name
the boat after you?

84
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,064
Take the flowers, Libby.

85
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,872
Are you really a General, Ody?

86
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:22,626
You think I hired
this uniform?

87
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,042
It's true what everyone's
saying...

88
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,137
...you won the war
all by yourself.

89
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,094
No, I was only in 60 charges.

90
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,268
I know, I fought in every one
of them too...

91
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,308
...alone in bed every night.

92
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,114
You're not the only hero
in the family.

93
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,533
Did I tell you they built
a statue of you...

94
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:43,581
...outside the courthouse?
- How do I look?

95
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,119
Damned if he was getting off
that boat...

96
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,998
...10' tall.

97
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:51,801
I used to go out there every day
and sit beside you and knit.

98
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,058
And I climbed down
now and then?

99
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:14,546
- Where's your luggage?
- On the boat

100
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,548
You going somewhere?

101
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,718
The Dakota territory.
This time you're going with me.

102
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,639
Remember what the man said,
"for richer or poorer...

103
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,651
...for better for worse".

104
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,865
My bag's in there.

105
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,966
Have you got
a comfortable cabin?

106
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,853
General Sheridan
sent me a message.

107
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:56,283
This time we're in this thing
together, my friend.

108
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:46,630
Miners.
I warned 'em.

109
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:49,513
Is this show being
put on for us?

110
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,063
They're telling you,
General Custer.

111
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,727
Keep the settlers out the
Indian territory...

112
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:58,987
...and they'll handle things
themselves.

113
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,448
You seem to understand the
Indian point of view, Benteen?

114
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:19,479
Watch ahead!

115
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,186
Grab the stick, Charlie!
Try to steer it!

116
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,772
Try to steer it!
We're coming to a right turn!

117
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,365
Turn to the left!

118
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,614
To the left, go on!

119
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:30,624
Hold it steady!

120
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:33,911
We're coming to a right!
Go on, watch it!

121
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,925
Watch it!
To the right!

122
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,679
To the right, hurry up!

123
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:40,553
Hold it, hold it!
Are you all right, Charlie?

124
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,854
Turn left!

125
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,724
To the right!
Go on, to the right!

126
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,450
To the left!
Go on, to the left!

127
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:54,994
Hold steady,
Turn right, Charlie!

128
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,377
We're coming to a right!
To a right!

129
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,334
Hurry up, to the right!

130
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:04,591
To the left, go on,
to the left!

131
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,386
To the left,
hold steady!

132
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:08,767
To the left!

133
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,558
Now, to the right!
To the right!

134
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,282
To the left, go on!
Hurry up, to the left!

135
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,736
Hold steady!
Watch ahead, to the right!

136
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,073
To the right!

137
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:22,833
Now, to the left!
To the left!

138
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,163
Watch it!

139
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,855
Dismount the men,
prepare to fire.

140
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:40,398
The Indians are well within
their rights, Sir.

141
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,658
The treaty gives them the
authority on their territory.

142
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,342
Dis-mount!

143
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,055
Fire!

144
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,408
All right, the Indians
are out of range.

145
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:08,364
Stop wasting your ammunition.

146
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,536
De-sist!

147
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,726
Atten-tion!

148
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,061
Present sabres!

149
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,698
Mayor Reno reporting, sir.
Welcome to the fort.

150
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,125
- Troops ready for inspection.
- Thank, you, Major.

151
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:33,133
I hope the parade
met with your approval, sir.

152
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,174
- Very good, one observation.
- Sir?

153
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:36,424
You only play
Hail to the Chief...

154
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,354
...for the President
of the United States.

155
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:41,353
- I'll have that corrected, Sir.
- Thank you. Dismiss the men.

156
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:42,518
Yes, sir.

157
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:47,370
Order! Left!

158
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,914
- Benteen.
- Dismiss the troops, Sergeant.

159
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,286
Atten-tion!

160
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:55,169
Troops dis-missed!

161
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,510
Why'd you join the Army,
Captain?

162
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,816
Come in, Major Reno.

163
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,612
Just asking the Captain here
why he joined the Army.

164
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,453
Sit down.

165
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,550
You're a crusader, ain't you?

166
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,300
Serve the Union.

167
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:26,894
Now you want to serve
the world.

168
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,394
Well, that's not the kind
of Army I'm gonna run.

169
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,443
Yes, sir.

170
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:36,869
Now, Major, what made you
choose the military way of life?

171
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,999
Well, sir, I was born into it.

172
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,247
I came from a long line
of professional soldiers.

173
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:44,834
My father fought
with Andy Jackson...

174
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,335
...and my brother
was at the Alamo.

175
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,091
Your father a drunk, too.

176
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,053
I'd like to remind you sir, that
I'm an officer and a gentleman.

177
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,935
I was wondering, Major,
if you come from...

178
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,563
...a long line of drunkards?

179
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:02,452
By the way, that parade of
yours out there, that was...

180
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,202
...the most stupid
miserable parade...

181
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,707
...I ever saw in all my life.

182
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,257
How many drinks
did you have today, Major?

183
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,715
One or two.
Can't remember?

184
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:17,933
I can tell you why
you joined the Army.

185
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:21,266
It was because the Army
gave you a home.

186
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,361
Because blind or sober...

187
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,116
...know matter how much
he drinks...

188
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:27,525
...you're entitled
to the saloon...

189
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:29,787
...you're entitled to the
respect of every officer...

190
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,411
...and man under
your command.

191
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:37,093
Major, there's no law
says you can't drink.

192
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,933
But if I find you drunk
on duty...

193
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:44,020
...once...

194
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,105
...that long line
of officers'...

195
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:50,442
...is gonna end right here...

196
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,532
...with you Major.

197
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,963
You like it as much as I do,
Benteen?

198
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,308
Troops ready, sir.

199
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,439
- Good mornin', Major.
- Good mornin', sir

200
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,986
My orders were for a full troop
with mounts.

201
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,077
Yes sir. The rest of the men
fell out for sick call, sir.

202
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,293
Get down, will you Major?

203
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,168
Yes, sir.

204
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,242
Good morning, Doctor.

205
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,577
Got an epidemic here,
have ya?

206
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,450
Malingerers,
every one of them, sir.

207
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,791
Do you mind if I have a word
with your patients...

208
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,674
...if they're not too sick?
- They're as healthy as mules.

209
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,332
Thank you, Surgeon.

210
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,380
- I want the cook.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,810
Now then, soldier.
What's your ailment?

212
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:29,729
Breathing, sir, it comes hard,
my lungs, sir.

213
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,997
You don't look too sick to me,
Corporal.

214
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,539
In here, sir.

215
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,498
Inside and rotting away.

216
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,046
I hear you've been
in the Army a long time...

217
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,473
Sergeant Buckley,
15 years, sir.

218
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:49,811
This illness, come over you
sudden like?

219
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,190
- Yes, sir.
- Must be catching, eh?

220
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,314
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,992
All right, Cook, any of the men
skip breakfast?

222
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,494
- None did.
- Did they have a good meal?

223
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:06,130
Yes, they did.
Little onions.

224
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,301
- Little onions.
- Pasty.

225
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:09,717
- Pasty.
- Bistec.

226
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,095
- Bistec.
- Fried potatoes.

227
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:12,977
- Fried potatoes!
- Biscuits.

228
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,056
- Biscuits!
- Pie and coffee.

229
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,390
Pie and coffee!

230
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,567
All right. Thank you, Colonel.

231
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,406
Doctor...

232
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,994
...this epidemic, you think it
has something to do...

233
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:25,998
...with my orders to pull out
against the Cheyene?

234
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:29,544
General,
this epidemic is gonna last...

235
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,833
...as long as your orders stand.

236
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,259
These men need the right
treatment, of course.

237
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,758
What would you prescribe,
a little mild exercise?

238
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,899
Might be just the thing.
I will try it.

239
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,395
With your permission.

240
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:43,988
Major, I want all men
out here...

241
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:46,322
...in 10 minutes,
gear and full packs.

242
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,240
- Yes, sir.
- That goes for officers too.

243
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:51,575
Yes, sir.
You heard what the man said.

244
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:54,757
"On the parade ground,
in full field gear...

245
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:58,799
...in 10 minutes".
Come on!

246
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:00,171
Move!

247
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,184
Double quick.

248
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,899
Double quick!

249
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:58,518
Major!

250
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,622
Keep the pace, Sergeant.

251
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,908
Hup, two, three.

252
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,581
Hup, two, three, four.

253
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:11,799
March! March!

254
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:15,133
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

255
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,892
March!

256
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:14,567
Major!

257
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,964
All Halt!

258
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,984
Troop, attention!

259
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,246
Right shoulder, arms!

260
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:05,772
Present arms!

261
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:14,862
Hold up!

262
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:31,912
All right, soldier.

263
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,044
Dis-missed!

264
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,661
Lieutenant, Cheyenne!

265
00:29:02,468 --> 00:29:04,676
What the hell are they doing
off the reservation, sir?

266
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,055
I don't know, but we're going
to take them right back.

267
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:29,300
Pull back!
Pull back!

268
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:31,381
There are too many of them.

269
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:49,722
- Sergeant Gaskin.
- Yes, sir?

270
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:52,893
We'll split the columns,
take the wagons up the trail.

271
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:54,356
Yes, sir.

272
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:02,164
We'll go the hard way.

273
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:33,376
We're headed straight
into the desert, sir.

274
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:37,883
Hard going, dragging guns and
wagons through that sand.

275
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:40,262
Harder on the men,
worse on the horses.

276
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,816
We've got to find us some.

277
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,274
They killed two of our men.

278
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:47,905
Right.

279
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,406
We'll lose a lot more than two
men if we go chasing them.

280
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:56,708
Now listen, there are
35 Indians out there.

281
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:59,334
If we lose, every Cheyenne
of the reservation...

282
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:01,512
...will figures he can get away
with it, too.

283
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,849
Six months from now,
we'll be chasing...

284
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:05,557
...4,000 of them.

285
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:09,607
That's gonna be much worse
on the men...

286
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:12,491
...and a lot harder
on the horses, so...

287
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:14,658
...give the order, Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,240
Let's move 'em out!

289
00:34:05,263 --> 00:34:06,723
Come on, let's get going.

290
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,346
Come on!

291
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:17,905
We can't move it any further.

292
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:20,779
Take it apart!
Put it on runners.

293
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:22,071
Yes, sir!

294
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,377
Break out the tools.

295
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:22,683
- Water.
- No, no, no!

296
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:25,847
Give us some water,
water.

297
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,138
- I can't...
- General's orders.

298
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,162
What are you doing?
Get away!

299
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:41,790
Get away!

300
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,845
Sir, the sun's got him.

301
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:09,088
Get up, soldier.

302
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,729
The sun will be down
in an hour.

303
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:24,194
We'll all have a drink.

304
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:28,285
Come on, boy.

305
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:41,657
Out of range.

306
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,327
- Sergeant Gaskins?
- Sir.

307
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:49,045
Sound out all the ranks,
bring up the cannon.

308
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,882
Yes, sir!

309
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,403
Fire!

310
00:38:18,852 --> 00:38:19,967
Fire!

311
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:58,578
All right, Sergeant,
move them out.

312
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,585
Yes, sir.
Move out!

313
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:36,769
- ¡Buckley!
- Sir?

314
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:38,353
Get a rifle.

315
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:44,491
Shoot over their heads.

316
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,601
All right.

317
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,483
Knock one down.

318
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:24,724
Give them another warning.

319
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,532
Knock one down.

320
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:47,096
- Let me get him, sir.
- All right.

321
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,111
Wait a minute!

322
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:01,370
Wait a minute!

323
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,711
They think the chief
turns into a bird.

324
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,978
Shoot the bird down,
Sergeant.

325
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,862
Shoot it down!

326
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,972
- Take care of the prisoners.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

327
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,613
How 'bout that Indian up there,
sir?

328
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,784
Just shot him down,
Sergeant.

329
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,875
Don't you believe a man
can turn into a bird?

330
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,279
Look at them, sir,
they can't fight.

331
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:44,493
We took the whole Cheyenne
nation...

332
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:46,537
...with 265 men.

333
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:49,801
Pizarro conquered Peru
with 167.

334
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:06,602
I've come a long way to tell you
men personally...

335
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:09,685
...that I'm damn well fed up
with these Cheyenne raids.

336
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,231
The whole Army's fed up,
Washington's fed up!

337
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:17,528
Give me a break, scalping,
burning, butchering...

338
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:19,783
It's our job t put a stop
to all it!

339
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:21,959
Put a stop to it now.

340
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,087
If there's any doubt
about the policy...

341
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,428
...of my command, I'll give it
to you in one sentence:

342
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,509
The only good Indian
is a dead Indian.

343
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:32,975
You know?

344
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:35,724
Very good, General,
very well put, sir.

345
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:43,905
You don't look too happy,
Captain, don't you approve?

346
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:45,995
I'm afraid I don't, sir.

347
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:48,705
Steal their land
and break our treaties...

348
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:51,084
...we have no excuse
to murder them, too.

349
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:53,513
Another bleeding heart.

350
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:55,636
The country's full
of bleeding hearts.

351
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:56,849
Now we even have them
in the army!

352
00:47:58,023 --> 00:47:59,518
Coffee, gentlemen?

353
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:03,608
Just for two.

354
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:06,612
That's all for now.

355
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,463
I don't suppose you have
any whiskey?

356
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:16,135
No, I'm afraid not.

357
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:18,514
I know you don't drink it...

358
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,852
...but you might keep it
around for those that do.

359
00:48:21,979 --> 00:48:24,223
I'll save some for you
from the store.

360
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,809
Thank you.

361
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:29,066
Will there be anything else?

362
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:32,529
Yes, you might tell me that
you're pleased to see me.

363
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:36,410
Your husband's wouldn't be
a hero if it weren't for me.

364
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,039
Artie and I are grateful,
General...

365
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:40,374
...you know that well.

366
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:45,426
I'll skip the whiskey,
it's bad for the liver anyway.

367
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,766
- How's your liver, George?
- Fine, General.

368
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:52,279
Stay healthy,
your country needs you.

369
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:56,993
You're a lucky girl.

370
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:59,373
Yes, I know I am, General.

371
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:01,868
Thank you.

372
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:07,508
You two must have a lot
to talk about.

373
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,384
Excuse me.

374
00:49:12,188 --> 00:49:14,348
Now, sit down,
listen to me.

375
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,990
There's an election coming up.

376
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:22,238
The administration needs a
victory. I promised them one.

377
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,872
Wrong time for a victory.

378
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,125
Got to cross too many rivers,
you know that.

379
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,921
I just told you it's
the right time, George.

380
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,630
Election time.

381
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,387
It so happens the Cheyenne
have approved to the treatry.

382
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:37,770
Left the reservation.

383
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:40,191
Last month we had orders
to give the Cheyenne...

384
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:41,979
...rifles so they could
go hunting, now you're...

385
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:45,069
...telling me to kill them,
because they've gone hunting.

386
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:53,879
I read in all
the Eastern newspapers...

387
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:56,167
...that your General Custer
is a great Indian fighter.

388
00:49:56,762 --> 00:49:58,803
I'm told you have the best
cavalry regiment...

389
00:49:58,932 --> 00:50:01,092
...in the United States Army.
And I'm telling you...

390
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:02,557
...go out and fight them.

391
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:05,941
You tell me how to surround
10 injuns with one soldier.

392
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:09,527
No one knows your war record
better than I.

393
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:13,279
I'm betting on Custer's luck.

394
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:18,161
General, there's
4,000 Cheyenne...

395
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:22,595
...in the villages and the
washes, I've got 400 soldiers.

396
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:28,559
George, how am I to know that?
I can't crawl back.

397
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,860
I think you owe me this one.

398
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,074
Take a dispatch
to General Sheridan.

399
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,415
"Despite overwhelming odds...

400
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,627
...a great victory was won
here today.

401
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:41,386
Factors contributing
to our success were:

402
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,849
First...

403
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,981
...the Indians
were asleep.

404
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:48,316
Second...

405
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:52,529
...the women and children
offered little resistance.

406
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:54,707
Third...

407
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:57,001
...lndians have been winded...

408
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:59,170
...by our change in policy".

409
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:21,727
P.S.

410
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:26,315
Should you require
any further contributions...

411
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:27,946
...towards your election
campaign...

412
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:31,110
...be so good
as to let me know.

413
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:39,047
Your obedient servant.
George".

414
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:04,096
- Where were these people?
- They're trappers and miners.

415
00:55:04,232 --> 00:55:06,356
We caught them crossing
into Cheyenne territory.

416
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:09,364
There's a gold strike
on the reservation, sir.

417
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:12,901
Come on.

418
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:28,896
How long has this rabble
been here?

419
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,350
Four days, sir. And
we can't keep them here, sir.

420
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:32,987
With your permission, sir,
I'd like to march...

421
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:35,112
...them back to the railroad
and ship them back east.

422
00:55:35,242 --> 00:55:36,903
Gold, Captain, gold.

423
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:40,367
Send them men away and they'll
just bring back a thousand more.

424
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,827
We've pushed the Cheyenne's
out of half their territory...

425
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:45,716
...we can't let these people
take the rest of it!

426
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:49,252
Come in, gentlemen.

427
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:01,699
I've to give you this letter,
it's from General Sheridan.

428
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:03,490
Thank you, dear.

429
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,380
Sorry to keep you waiting,
gentlemen. Excuse me.

430
00:56:11,677 --> 00:56:12,709
All right.

431
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:14,597
Go ahead, Captain, tell him.

432
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:16,298
Tell me what?

433
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:19,812
I brought somebody to see you,
sir.

434
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,435
- Who?
- A Cheyenne.

435
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:25,825
He's here?

436
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:29,076
- Yes, in the other room.
- Make him any promise?

437
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,625
I only promised him
that you'd see him.

438
00:56:33,505 --> 00:56:34,881
Speak our language?

439
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:38,504
Been to Washington twice,
he's negotiated two treaties.

440
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:40,967
Both of which we broke.

441
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:05,052
I'm George Armstrong Custer.

442
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:08,682
Office of the
United States Army.

443
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,986
The Captain tells me that
you understand our language.

444
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:14,645
Is that so?

445
00:57:16,785 --> 00:57:17,984
Good.

446
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:22,699
Because I want to understand me
very clearly.

447
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,132
I know the only reason
you come here...

448
00:57:28,263 --> 00:57:29,806
...is to threaten me.

449
00:57:30,558 --> 00:57:32,636
If I don't promise to keep
the miners out of...

450
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,690
...the Indian territory, you're
going to start killing them.

451
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:37,975
Isn't that true?

452
00:57:41,118 --> 00:57:43,575
Am I speaking too fast for you?

453
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:45,701
I understand you.

454
00:58:05,366 --> 00:58:08,535
I hope I can make it
plain to you that...

455
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:12,043
...I won't bargain with you
about the miners.

456
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:14,124
I will not be blackmailed...

457
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:15,835
...into making empty promises.

458
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,590
I am not in a position
to make any promises.

459
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:24,512
Whatever I decide to do, I'll
do it because it is right...

460
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:27,023
...according to my way.

461
00:58:27,653 --> 00:58:29,065
Right!

462
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:32,241
I know you've got human rights.

463
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:35,742
Treaty rights, moral rights.

464
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:39,585
And if ever I should forget
any of them...

465
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:42,792
...there's always
Captain Benteen...

466
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:45,006
...to remind me of them.

467
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:49,728
But I am not a politician,
not a martyr, not a creature.

468
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,354
When I say moral-less,,
I mean...

469
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:57,401
...l'm not the best of all men.

470
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:00,999
I'm a soldier.

471
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,664
The only rights
that concern me...

472
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:06,128
...are the rights
of my soldiers.

473
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:07,754
The only duty of concerns me...

474
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:09,715
...is the duty of my command.

475
00:59:13,396 --> 00:59:15,556
I'll make it very simple
for you.

476
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,985
The fact that we seem to be
pushing you clear...

477
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:21,785
...off the earth,
is not my responsibility

478
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,362
The problem is precisely
the same...

479
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:26,207
...as when Cheyenne
decide to take...

480
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,494
...another tribe's hunting
ground...

481
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,707
...you didn't ask them
about their rights.

482
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:33,465
You didn't care if they had been
there a thousand years.

483
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:35,806
You just took more men
and more horses...

484
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:39,139
...and destroyed them in battle,
you took what you wanted.

485
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:44,485
And right or wrong,
for better or worse...

486
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:49,202
...that is the way things
seem to get done.

487
00:59:49,873 --> 00:59:54,622
That's history.
I'm talking about history.

488
00:59:57,428 --> 01:00:02,009
You are a militarily defeated
people.

489
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,981
You're paying the price
for being backward.

490
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:12,575
And whatever my personal
feelings...

491
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:16,747
...I haven't said any...

492
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:21,583
...there's nothing I can do
to change all this.

493
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,129
Do you understand me?

494
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:29,271
I understand.

495
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,940
Captain.

496
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:56,229
Major...

497
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:59,519
...see what's going on out
there. Try and shut them up.

498
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,771
Yes, sir.

499
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:13,761
Let me in.
Go away!

500
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,805
Put that man in jail.

501
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:19,970
What's going on here, Sergeant?

502
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:23,193
- We're going to have trouble.
- What are these men doing?

503
01:01:26,075 --> 01:01:28,318
We're digging for gold, sir.

504
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:30,865
This is government property,
Mister.

505
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:34,543
Save your breath, we ain't
stopping until you let us out.

506
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:39,214
This is a parade ground...

507
01:01:39,389 --> 01:01:41,098
We're gonna keep digging
until...

508
01:01:41,225 --> 01:01:44,312
...there's no fort left,
just one big hole.

509
01:01:44,898 --> 01:01:46,643
Take that pick away from him.

510
01:01:50,198 --> 01:01:52,572
Put those picks down!
Put them down!

511
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,458
Look these men up, Sergeant.

512
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,300
Put them in the guardhouse.

513
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:23,707
- Did he say anything to you?
- No sir, not a word.

514
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:48,249
Present sabres!

515
01:02:57,769 --> 01:02:59,810
Sir, the second platoon's gone.

516
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:01,270
Deserted!

517
01:03:02,986 --> 01:03:06,192
- Mulligan's platoon?
- They went after gold, sir.

518
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,159
Mulligan started it.

519
01:03:15,173 --> 01:03:16,419
Major!

520
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:19,176
Get that mob out of here!

521
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:22,008
Where, General?

522
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:26,975
I don't care, Benteen.

523
01:03:27,861 --> 01:03:31,030
Open the gate!
Let them out!

524
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,613
You're letting them go into
Cheyenne territory?

525
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,161
- You know that, don't you?
- I know that, Benteen.

526
01:03:38,295 --> 01:03:39,874
I know that.

527
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:43,756
- Get them out!
- Yes, sir.

528
01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:48,888
Open the gates!

529
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,292
Benteen.

530
01:04:04,296 --> 01:04:06,587
Bring Mulligan back here.

531
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:10,720
Yes, sir.

532
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,927
Was it an important letter,
the one from General Sheridan?

533
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:44,320
"Unofficially the president
thinks that...

534
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:47,574
...the discovery of gold in
the Dakotas is wonderful news.

535
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:52,490
Best interest of the country...

536
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,417
...expects you to use
your best judgement".

537
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:59,050
You did what you had to.

538
01:05:00,557 --> 01:05:01,720
Yeah.

539
01:05:02,393 --> 01:05:04,601
I used my best judgment.

540
01:05:57,318 --> 01:05:58,481
Captain!

541
01:06:02,034 --> 01:06:04,823
Yellow as butter. Did you ever
see the light, Captain?

542
01:06:04,955 --> 01:06:06,996
You're under arrest,
Mulligan.

543
01:06:07,126 --> 01:06:08,621
Crister Mulligan's the name
now, sir...

544
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:10,546
...happy to see you
this fine morning.

545
01:06:10,673 --> 01:06:12,418
Come off it, Paddy.

546
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,296
I'm taking you back
for desertion.

547
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,089
Desertion?

548
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:21,389
If it's men you need,
Captain...

549
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:26,282
...l'll buy you one in my place.
Five, fifty.

550
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:29,318
I'll buy you
the whole regiment...

551
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,999
...and every man in it'll
be named Paddy Mulligan.

552
01:06:34,379 --> 01:06:36,457
Where are the others,
Mulligan?

553
01:06:37,551 --> 01:06:39,925
The trouble started no sooner
we were out the gate.

554
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:42,346
Some wanted to go north
some wanted to go south.

555
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:44,760
I should've know...

556
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:47,436
...I couldn't get them to stick
to hard work.

557
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:51,482
For that matter,
neither could I.

558
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:55,493
I just wanted
to take off my Army boots...

559
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:59,917
...and gold mine in the clear
waters of that stream.

560
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:03,550
And that's how I found the gold.
Not leaving it

561
01:07:05,723 --> 01:07:07,931
There's enough here
for both of us, Captain.

562
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:14,481
Think of all the good things
a decent man like you...

563
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,274
...could do with it?

564
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:26,501
Oh, well.

565
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:29,468
Back it goes.

566
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,052
Sooner or later some other
lucky man will find it.

567
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,100
Well...

568
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:37,848
I... now...

569
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:40,145
...I guess I better
put on my boots, huh?

570
01:07:56,182 --> 01:07:58,010
I'll do you no harm,
Captain.

571
01:07:58,644 --> 01:08:01,813
You can have your gun back,
just let me go.

572
01:08:03,027 --> 01:08:04,652
All I ask is your word.

573
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:27,597
Desertion?

574
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,112
I suppose that's serious
business.

575
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:16,188
At ease, Sergeant.

576
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,202
I was hoping you'd come
to see me.

577
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:26,494
Chaplain tells me you got
new evidence.

578
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:27,704
Of course.

579
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,670
I don't know...

580
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:33,088
...how to put it
into words.

581
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,880
Put it in your own words then.

582
01:09:38,268 --> 01:09:40,844
Well, it's so hard.

583
01:09:41,482 --> 01:09:43,560
I don't know where to begin.

584
01:09:44,237 --> 01:09:46,860
Come on.
Take your time, sit down.

585
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:48,440
Thank you, sir.

586
01:10:00,013 --> 01:10:02,137
They asked me what I want,
"anything...

587
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:05,183
...you like, considering
it's your last request"...

588
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:06,690
...as a Sergeant.

589
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:09,434
Then I'll have strawberries.

590
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:13,315
And if they are not mature,
I'll wait.

591
01:10:16,624 --> 01:10:19,081
You can get them,
I told him I would like them.

592
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,124
Go on.

593
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,258
I hope you're not in a hurry,
sir.

594
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,601
If there's any man with
his eye on the clock, it's me.

595
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:32,602
Where was I?

596
01:10:33,402 --> 01:10:35,027
New evidence.

597
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:37,483
Yes, new evidence.

598
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:44,585
I'll give you a drink.

599
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:55,397
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, sit down.

600
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:07,366
I was talking about
strawberries.

601
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:09,785
Do you like strawberries,
General?

602
01:11:10,463 --> 01:11:11,959
I'm listening.

603
01:11:12,258 --> 01:11:13,837
Lovely fruit.

604
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:15,757
Once when I was still
a schoolboy...

605
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:17,473
...a teacher asked me
to show her...

606
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,760
...where the strawberries grew.

607
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:22,272
I was happy to oblige.

608
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:24,526
Her being a pretty thing...

609
01:11:24,654 --> 01:11:26,446
...and not much older
than myself.

610
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,532
Berry picking we went.

611
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:31,114
It was a beautiful day,
the berries...

612
01:11:31,999 --> 01:11:35,370
...were standing against
green lights of the hills...

613
01:11:36,089 --> 01:11:38,000
...and afterwards she said:

614
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,631
"Mulligan, you giving them
all to me?"

615
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:44,551
And I looked in her basket
and it was true.

616
01:11:44,771 --> 01:11:46,147
How strange.

617
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:50,651
And then I understood,
I was in love.

618
01:11:51,323 --> 01:11:53,068
It was the first time.

619
01:11:55,205 --> 01:11:56,700
Sergeant...

620
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:00,545
...if its company you want,
I'll send the Chaplain.

621
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:04,293
Come morning,
you'll be taking up...

622
01:12:04,428 --> 01:12:06,588
...a few minutes of my time,
sir.

623
01:12:17,116 --> 01:12:20,867
- We must go to the matter.
- Yes, sir, you're right.

624
01:12:23,752 --> 01:12:27,835
Sergeant, your appeal
has been appealed and denied.

625
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:31,303
Now you have got to present me
with new facts.

626
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,936
Facts! That's right.

627
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:36,679
Facts!

628
01:12:37,817 --> 01:12:40,855
That's what the men all admire
about you, General.

629
01:12:41,031 --> 01:12:44,117
You always know
all the facts.

630
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:47,073
You talking off the point.

631
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,410
I'm talking for my life,
General.

632
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:51,171
You haven't said a single word
I could get...

633
01:12:51,298 --> 01:12:53,256
...to court as new evidence.

634
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:55,129
And nothing that wouldn't
let me think...

635
01:12:55,263 --> 01:12:57,506
...that you wouldn't desert
all over again.

636
01:12:57,642 --> 01:13:00,134
Rules! Porters!

637
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:02,351
Court-martial!

638
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:05,982
I'm talking about the juice
in a man's veins.

639
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:09,077
I'm talking about all the
good times you never had.

640
01:13:09,578 --> 01:13:11,453
Off the point, you say?

641
01:13:11,623 --> 01:13:13,664
The drinking, girls.

642
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:16,162
Smoking cigars,
chasing rainbows...

643
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:17,876
That's the point.

644
01:13:19,219 --> 01:13:21,546
You've got no feeling,
General.

645
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:24,388
There's just an empty place
inside.

646
01:13:24,645 --> 01:13:27,185
A hole stuffed
with rubbish.

647
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:31,436
The flag, the regiment
the duty.

648
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,078
You listen to me, Mulligan.

649
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,001
You don't think twice...

650
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,626
...about the soldiers you had
behind you to do your job...

651
01:13:44,803 --> 01:13:47,972
...or maybe they get killed
doing it.

652
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:56,066
All you ever wanted
was to strike it rich.

653
01:13:56,823 --> 01:14:00,159
It wasn't to get rich, I didn't
desert for the gold. It was...

654
01:14:01,707 --> 01:14:05,078
...for other reasons that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

655
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:08,126
What is it about?

656
01:14:13,977 --> 01:14:15,389
I have to go now.

657
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:19,485
Go on, General.

658
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:21,945
Go home.

659
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,735
Your wife is waiting for you.

660
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:28,708
Sergeant, maybe you wanted
too much out of life.

661
01:14:28,918 --> 01:14:32,171
Maybe life doesn't
have too much to offer.

662
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:33,747
Guard!

663
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:56,506
- Tomorrow, sir?
- Daybreak.

664
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:52,503
Attention!

665
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:55,807
Ready!

666
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:01,943
Aim!

667
01:16:17,015 --> 01:16:18,391
Fire!

668
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,261
Mrs. Custer,
I want to introduce...

669
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,178
...to his lmperial highness,
the Grand Duke of Russia.

670
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:05,466
You know that Duke's
a really nice guy.

671
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,677
Too bad I never know what
the hell he's talking about.

672
01:17:08,893 --> 01:17:12,311
Why didn't you learn French,
the language of diplomacy?

673
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,892
You trying to tell me,
I'm not diplomatic?

674
01:17:15,028 --> 01:17:16,571
What's he doing here?

675
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:18,905
Well, you know we bought
Alaska from the Russians.

676
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,195
So we're going to fight
the Eskimos?

677
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:23,123
Now George, that's not fair.

678
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:32,797
The first thing he did,
when he came...

679
01:17:32,933 --> 01:17:34,393
...to Washington was say...

680
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:37,142
..."I want to meet Custer,
the Indian fighter".

681
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:38,644
That's a fact.

682
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,186
You're a big man among
the Russians.

683
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:45,821
You have a lot of important
friends...

684
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:49,123
...in Washington.
- Who?

685
01:17:52,257 --> 01:17:53,633
All right, me.

686
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:56,922
What is the Duke doing here?

687
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:01,183
Well, the Duke and
a lot of important people...

688
01:18:01,313 --> 01:18:03,391
...are looking into investing
into America's future.

689
01:18:03,734 --> 01:18:04,933
Like what?

690
01:18:05,737 --> 01:18:07,778
Trade, gold mine,
shipping.

691
01:18:09,243 --> 01:18:10,738
Railroads?

692
01:18:14,878 --> 01:18:17,667
It's a big country. You can't go
to one side...

693
01:18:17,883 --> 01:18:20,256
...to the other without
going through the middle.

694
01:18:20,387 --> 01:18:22,796
Yeah, the middle
is Indian territory.

695
01:18:23,726 --> 01:18:27,596
They've already had to put with
miners, trapper, soldiers.

696
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:30,351
They're going to put up with
bombers making a big territory.

697
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:33,692
It's a big territory but
not enough for everybody.

698
01:18:43,592 --> 01:18:46,001
All right, then something's
gotta give, doesn't it?

699
01:18:49,727 --> 01:18:52,896
You know, it's going to cost us
a helluva lot of soldiers.

700
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:02,531
I'm just the messenger boy.

701
01:19:02,957 --> 01:19:05,165
I got the message,
now you got it.

702
01:19:09,468 --> 01:19:12,970
They tell me you're not supposed
to keep royalty waiting.

703
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,059
Sit down, General.

704
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:35,502
You said I got friends
in Washington.

705
01:19:37,056 --> 01:19:38,966
I got friends in New York,
Boston...

706
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:41,641
...Philadelphia because
anything I write...

707
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:43,732
...the newspapers will print.

708
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,983
Are you going to write about me?

709
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,157
They don't care.

710
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,444
You're going to tell them
you don't have enough army.

711
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,290
They don't care.

712
01:19:55,002 --> 01:19:58,338
Is there anything
you care about, Phil?

713
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:06,475
I won't try to stop you.
If it'll help you...

714
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:10,018
...sleep any better, go ahead
and attack the railroad...

715
01:20:10,153 --> 01:20:12,028
...blast the administration...

716
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,649
...damn the Secretary of War.

717
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:18,616
You think that's going to stop
the train from coming through?

718
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:30,884
It's seems every time we get
together, we get into a fight.

719
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:32,475
Phil...

720
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:36,945
...how soon does the railroad
come through?

721
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:39,862
It's here now.

722
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:44,617
They're laying track along
the border of the trail.

723
01:20:50,386 --> 01:20:53,259
The only good Indian
is a dead Indian.

724
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:56,391
The Army fed that stupid line
to everyone...

725
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:58,349
...they sent west.

726
01:21:02,072 --> 01:21:03,733
You know something?

727
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:06,612
The Indians are doing
the same thing I would do...

728
01:21:06,747 --> 01:21:10,830
...if I were in his place,
Fight to the bitter end.

729
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,067
Timber!

730
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,041
Timber!

731
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:51,875
- Do you see any hostiles?
- Nope.

732
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,337
But they're here all right.
I can feel them.

733
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:10,951
We're turning this nice Indian
ground into sawdust.

734
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,156
Just to build
a lousy railroad.

735
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,458
When this line gets
to San Francisco...

736
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:19,211
...l'm going to take me a ride
and see the Pacific Ocean.

737
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:22,298
You're never going to have
enough money to buy a ticket.

738
01:28:05,222 --> 01:28:08,094
Says here, they say they're
talking about appointing...

739
01:28:08,227 --> 01:28:10,137
...General Custer as Governor
of the Dakota territory.

740
01:28:10,272 --> 01:28:12,147
Can't read.

741
01:28:13,986 --> 01:28:16,111
Can't read son of a colonel?

742
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:22,334
In my kind of business
a man don't need to read.

743
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:44,276
Solid gold, my own gold mine.

744
01:28:45,247 --> 01:28:47,205
Chain too.

745
01:28:48,126 --> 01:28:49,503
Ring too.

746
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:54,962
These days I don't like anything
but gold to touch my skin.

747
01:28:57,475 --> 01:28:59,849
Even here in my mouth.

748
01:29:01,315 --> 01:29:03,772
You know what?

749
01:29:04,278 --> 01:29:07,696
I sure like the taste of gold.

750
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,655
You say it's an honor
for the Mayor to back...

751
01:29:57,826 --> 01:30:00,116
...Colonel Custer to become
the governor he gets my votes.

752
01:30:00,288 --> 01:30:02,496
He's the one who opened up
the territories.

753
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:05,628
The gold territories.
Yes, he sure did.

754
01:30:15,605 --> 01:30:17,065
What's going on?

755
01:30:18,485 --> 01:30:20,894
General Custer
must protect us.

756
01:30:23,702 --> 01:30:24,901
Stay down!

757
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:28,035
I can get the cart,
we can roll down.

758
01:30:31,715 --> 01:30:32,879
I'll cover you.

759
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:22,712
We're going to crash!

760
01:32:15,012 --> 01:32:18,264
Appears these massacres are
all over the eastern papers.

761
01:32:19,478 --> 01:32:21,935
Flags are flying at half-mast.

762
01:32:22,107 --> 01:32:24,397
Residents declared
a day of mourning.

763
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:26,524
Tell me General.

764
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:30,079
Why did you choose
the Army as career?

765
01:32:32,374 --> 01:32:34,618
Telegram came from
the War Department.

766
01:32:34,753 --> 01:32:36,165
Shall I read it, sir?

767
01:32:37,216 --> 01:32:39,839
"To General
George Armstrong Custer.

768
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:43,267
You are hereby relived
of command...

769
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:46,183
...and suspended
from active duty.

770
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:49,518
You are ordered to report
to Washington D. C...

771
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:52,941
...within 30 days from
receipt of this telegram...

772
01:32:53,284 --> 01:32:55,527
...to appear before
a U.S. Congressional...

773
01:32:55,663 --> 01:32:59,200
...Committee investigating
conditions...

774
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:02,673
...in the Indian territory".
Looks like Washington's...

775
01:33:02,842 --> 01:33:05,595
...looking for somebody
to blame for the massacre.

776
01:33:05,972 --> 01:33:07,467
Go on.

777
01:33:09,269 --> 01:33:11,678
"Marcus Reno will assume
command of this...

778
01:33:11,815 --> 01:33:14,390
...regiment immediately,
signed...

779
01:33:15,404 --> 01:33:18,610
...Philip Sheridan.
Commander".

780
01:33:22,124 --> 01:33:23,916
Stand up, Major.

781
01:33:27,967 --> 01:33:31,837
As the new officer in command,
do you have any changes in mind?

782
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:36,010
- Yes.
- I made this command.

783
01:33:37,065 --> 01:33:38,774
I like it that way it is,
is that clear?

784
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:40,642
Yes, sir.

785
01:33:41,322 --> 01:33:44,444
When this Washington
thing is over...

786
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:49,835
...l'll be back.

787
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:52,295
Make no mistake.

788
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:54,249
I'll be back.

789
01:33:59,018 --> 01:34:02,390
Members of the Senate and
the House of Representatives.

790
01:34:04,235 --> 01:34:06,028
I have been listening
your debate...

791
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:08,446
...about the Indian's problem
during nine days.

792
01:34:11,038 --> 01:34:13,282
There is no Indian problem.

793
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:16,789
There is only a white problem.

794
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:21,222
Order! Order!

795
01:34:22,683 --> 01:34:24,142
You ask...

796
01:34:24,603 --> 01:34:26,513
...why are we not hostile
to the tribes one day...

797
01:34:26,648 --> 01:34:28,807
...and kill them the next?

798
01:34:29,486 --> 01:34:31,646
Why we sign treaties
with one hand...

799
01:34:31,781 --> 01:34:33,906
...and shoot them down
with another?

800
01:34:35,454 --> 01:34:37,495
The answer is...

801
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:39,997
...corruption.

802
01:34:41,965 --> 01:34:44,125
Order! Order, gentlemen!

803
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:47,213
The American people
have the right to know...

804
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:49,509
...who's responsible.

805
01:34:50,395 --> 01:34:52,224
The answer is look to those...

806
01:34:52,649 --> 01:34:56,519
...who are reaping in the
profits from this dual policy.

807
01:35:01,456 --> 01:35:03,829
There is no reason in
investigating the military.

808
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,289
You're changing the subject.

809
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,711
I defy you to find
a single rich officer...

810
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:10,761
...in the entire United States
Army.

811
01:35:11,055 --> 01:35:13,594
There is no soldier with his
face stuffed with gold bonds...

812
01:35:13,726 --> 01:35:15,007
...and railroad shares.

813
01:35:15,145 --> 01:35:16,938
Order! Sit down!

814
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,478
For the guilty parties...

815
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:25,738
...you are going to have to look
right here in Washington!

816
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:28,114
Order, order!

817
01:35:28,334 --> 01:35:31,372
And you are going to have
to look in high places!

818
01:35:31,798 --> 01:35:32,913
Order!

819
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,383
I know the men
who are responsible.

820
01:35:38,308 --> 01:35:41,477
And I am going to give you
their names.

821
01:35:41,731 --> 01:35:43,356
Yes! Yes!

822
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:55,076
Excuse me, but Major
the mail just came in.

823
01:35:55,587 --> 01:35:56,667
Good.

824
01:36:00,011 --> 01:36:01,175
Hey, look at this!

825
01:36:01,389 --> 01:36:03,466
The 7th regiment has made
the front page...

826
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:05,844
...of the New York Herald".

827
01:36:05,979 --> 01:36:06,976
Listen to this.

828
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:10,821
"Lmpeachment proceedings
have been taken by Congress...

829
01:36:10,946 --> 01:36:12,857
...against Secretary of War
Belinknapp...

830
01:36:12,991 --> 01:36:15,745
...because of General Custer's
testimony.

831
01:36:16,664 --> 01:36:18,574
Belinknapp has already
tendered his resignation".

832
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:21,118
Can you imagine that?
The Secretary of War?

833
01:36:21,255 --> 01:36:22,715
Listen to this, sir.

834
01:36:23,717 --> 01:36:26,554
"Orville Grant, brother of
President Ulysses S. Grant...

835
01:36:26,681 --> 01:36:28,224
...was accused
by General Custer...

836
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:30,427
...of accepting
a $1,000 bribe.

837
01:36:30,604 --> 01:36:32,479
- Where?
- Here.

838
01:36:33,692 --> 01:36:35,983
Brother's President.

839
01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:38,565
Custer really knows to hit 'em
where it hurts, don't he?

840
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:39,240
Obvious.

841
01:36:39,368 --> 01:36:41,576
I wonder what happens
to the General now?

842
01:36:41,706 --> 01:36:43,996
I'll tell you what happens
to Custer.

843
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:46,619
The big brass won't kick him out
of the Army.

844
01:36:46,756 --> 01:36:48,334
He's too popular for that now.

845
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:51,042
They got their own way
of handling this guy.

846
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:52,385
You know what they'll do?

847
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,090
They'll probably send him off
to Europe to count...

848
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:58,184
...the horses in the Russian
Army. Or just leave him...

849
01:36:58,317 --> 01:37:00,560
...on suspension indefinitely
without pay...

850
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:02,280
...until he rots.

851
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,526
He'll just sit around,
knock on doors...

852
01:37:05,662 --> 01:37:07,739
...write letters,
eat his heart out...

853
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:10,450
...and finally he'll wind up
in some hotel lobby...

854
01:37:10,587 --> 01:37:11,999
...talking to strangers...

855
01:37:12,215 --> 01:37:14,505
...telling them what a big man
he used to be.

856
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:17,636
And it will serve him right.

857
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:31,318
Cold enough?

858
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:34,288
- Did you go for a walk?
- No.

859
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,584
I got as far as the lobby.

860
01:37:37,381 --> 01:37:39,340
Better there he started
explaining to me...

861
01:37:39,468 --> 01:37:41,011
...about the Battle
of Gettysburg...

862
01:37:41,138 --> 01:37:44,057
...so I explained to him
about the Battle of Gettysburg.

863
01:37:47,565 --> 01:37:49,725
Was there any mail?

864
01:37:49,944 --> 01:37:53,113
- Yes, there was a letter.
- War Department?

865
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:56,193
No, from Father.

866
01:38:04,343 --> 01:38:06,800
- Did you see Sheridan?
- No.

867
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,551
No, well he left me word...

868
01:38:09,685 --> 01:38:12,012
...he'd see me this week
for sure.

869
01:38:13,274 --> 01:38:15,482
He doesn't want to see you,
Artie.

870
01:38:25,169 --> 01:38:26,748
What did your father write?

871
01:38:28,091 --> 01:38:31,213
He wants to have a big family
for Christmas.

872
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,508
Why don't you go home
for Christmas?

873
01:38:33,642 --> 01:38:35,683
It would do you good
to get out of Washington.

874
01:38:35,812 --> 01:38:38,102
No without you.

875
01:38:40,153 --> 01:38:43,440
Things are liable to happen
here, I've got to be in town.

876
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:52,542
- Let's go to Michigan.
- No, I've got to stay here.

877
01:38:54,885 --> 01:38:56,926
The Army needs men like me.

878
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,800
Sooner or later
they'll find that out.

879
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:29,767
Well, General, you've seen
our firepower.

880
01:39:30,862 --> 01:39:33,070
Now just take a look
as the armor plate.

881
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:36,202
It's two inches thick,
it'll stop anything.

882
01:39:47,932 --> 01:39:49,131
Why'd you bring me here?

883
01:39:49,267 --> 01:39:50,893
You want your command back,
don't you?

884
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:53,061
- What's this got to do with it?
- Everything.

885
01:39:53,608 --> 01:39:56,279
Tell the gentlemen sponsoring
at the War Department.

886
01:39:56,404 --> 01:39:59,657
Why'd he come to you, why didn't
he come directly to me?

887
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:03,282
Any questions, General,
any suggestions?

888
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:08,006
- And the place for the horses?
- There won't be any.

889
01:40:08,257 --> 01:40:10,382
The cavalry's a thing
of the past.

890
01:40:10,553 --> 01:40:12,843
The object of war is to beat
the enemy, isn't it?

891
01:40:13,725 --> 01:40:17,891
- And it doesn't matter how.
- All right, sir.

892
01:40:18,817 --> 01:40:21,523
Thank you
for the demonstration.

893
01:40:27,414 --> 01:40:29,455
Artie, please
take another look at it.

894
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:32,872
- What for?
- All right, I'll tell you.

895
01:40:33,675 --> 01:40:36,761
It was Sheridan's idea.
He came to me and said...

896
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:39,180
..."Have George
sponsor the train.

897
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:40,970
He'll get the credit for it...

898
01:40:41,271 --> 01:40:43,942
...and that will give me
an excuse to bring him back".

899
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:46,026
But, it's useless.

900
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:48,858
The War Department
will never accept it.

901
01:40:48,992 --> 01:40:52,826
They already have. The contracts
are ready to be signed.

902
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:55,748
What do you need me for, then?

903
01:40:56,045 --> 01:41:00,046
Sheridan's suggestion,
we're just trying to cooperate.

904
01:41:01,053 --> 01:41:02,383
How about it?

905
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,512
War isn't just killing,
you know.

906
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:11,148
It's a contest,
it's a man against a man.

907
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:17,902
That's a machine. Personal
guides wouldn't count...

908
01:41:18,124 --> 01:41:19,322
...honor, duty, loyalty...

909
01:41:19,459 --> 01:41:22,213
...everything a soldier lives by
will be wiped out.

910
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,719
All you have left is statistics.

911
01:41:28,349 --> 01:41:30,889
How many men with the
machine murdered today...

912
01:41:31,354 --> 01:41:33,929
...a hundred, thousand,
ten thousand?

913
01:41:39,492 --> 01:41:42,365
If this is the future,
I don't want any part of it.

914
01:41:45,085 --> 01:41:47,044
Where does that leave you?

915
01:41:51,554 --> 01:41:53,299
With the idiots?

916
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:15,127
Next on the program.

917
01:42:15,678 --> 01:42:18,253
It's not a program, it's
an invitation from Sheridan...

918
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:20,634
...for a party.

919
01:42:20,769 --> 01:42:23,606
- When?
- Tonight.

920
01:42:26,487 --> 01:42:28,777
That would be a good chance
to talk to him.

921
01:42:29,117 --> 01:42:30,197
Yeah.

922
01:42:49,108 --> 01:42:50,272
Help!

923
01:42:53,991 --> 01:42:55,237
Help!

924
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:00,747
Help!

925
01:43:04,968 --> 01:43:06,297
Help!

926
01:43:10,394 --> 01:43:11,805
Help!

927
01:44:12,956 --> 01:44:15,912
If you want to be a soldier...

928
01:44:16,211 --> 01:44:18,621
...join the 7th cavalry.

929
01:44:18,924 --> 01:44:21,333
Don't you fight with
General Custer...

930
01:44:21,554 --> 01:44:24,592
...learn to fight for Kentucky.

931
01:44:24,851 --> 01:44:27,522
You must fight
for Oklahoma...

932
01:44:27,814 --> 01:44:30,271
...and there's Maine
and Tennessee.

933
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:33,406
You must fight
for Pennsylvania.

934
01:44:33,657 --> 01:44:36,031
You must fight for Missouri.

935
01:44:36,829 --> 01:44:39,037
If you want to be a soldier...

936
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,087
...you must fight for Glory-o.

937
01:44:42,255 --> 01:44:44,830
You must fight
with General Custer.

938
01:44:45,093 --> 01:44:47,668
You must fight for Idaho.

939
01:44:47,931 --> 01:44:50,602
You must fight
for Massachusetts...

940
01:44:50,852 --> 01:44:53,475
...Michigan and Delaware.

941
01:44:53,857 --> 01:44:56,350
You must fight for Indiana.

942
01:44:56,612 --> 01:44:58,986
You must fight for Ohio.

943
01:45:20,026 --> 01:45:22,779
If you want to be a soldier...

944
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:25,440
...join the 7th cavalry.

945
01:45:25,827 --> 01:45:28,700
Don't you fight
with General Custer...

946
01:45:28,874 --> 01:45:31,367
...learn to fight for Kentucky.

947
01:45:31,587 --> 01:45:34,376
You must fight
for Oklahoma...

948
01:45:34,633 --> 01:45:37,126
...and there's Maine
and Tennessee.

949
01:45:37,513 --> 01:45:40,136
You must fight
for Pennsylvania.

950
01:45:40,393 --> 01:45:43,064
You must fight for Missouri.

951
01:45:45,234 --> 01:45:46,433
Libby.

952
01:45:52,121 --> 01:45:54,162
Listen, I'm going to put you
in a cab.

953
01:45:55,293 --> 01:45:58,996
- You're going back to the hotel.
- You're not coming with me?

954
01:46:00,593 --> 01:46:02,302
No. I'll go to Sheridan's
party.

955
01:46:03,431 --> 01:46:06,387
Have a whiskey,
be one of the boys.

956
01:46:08,899 --> 01:46:12,352
Not tonight.
You can talk to him tomorrow.

957
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:17,819
No.

958
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:20,201
I need a drink.

959
01:46:30,142 --> 01:46:32,183
Come on, run!

960
01:46:43,289 --> 01:46:44,571
¡Whiskey!

961
01:47:24,775 --> 01:47:25,771
Excuse me.

962
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:55,533
This is the best seat you got.

963
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:57,950
I'm afraid so, sir,
everything else is taken.

964
01:47:59,165 --> 01:48:01,623
- Bring us a bottle of champagne.
- Certainly, sir.

965
01:48:13,731 --> 01:48:16,687
Well,
when did you get here?

966
01:48:19,032 --> 01:48:22,652
Six months ago, but you don't
have time to see me.

967
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,159
Don't tell me George Custer's
been drinking?

968
01:48:27,755 --> 01:48:30,330
I've not only been drinking,
I'm drunk.

969
01:48:31,636 --> 01:48:33,262
Well good, it's about time.

970
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,601
Come on, sit down.

971
01:48:39,441 --> 01:48:40,900
Join the group.

972
01:48:49,249 --> 01:48:51,373
Calm down,
this is not sarsaparilla.

973
01:48:55,384 --> 01:48:57,461
I came to talk with you.

974
01:48:58,347 --> 01:49:01,884
No, George,
this is a party, tomorrow.

975
01:49:03,272 --> 01:49:05,681
My regiment has received orders.

976
01:49:05,943 --> 01:49:09,030
There'll be another war
with the Indians, right?

977
01:49:09,699 --> 01:49:11,444
I tried you to return
to their job...

978
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:14,284
...but after you talked in the
Congress, it was impossible.

979
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:16,161
The President don't want it.

980
01:49:17,295 --> 01:49:20,548
Why the hell talked about
his brother Orville?

981
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,425
Who will be in charge
of my regiment?

982
01:49:29,232 --> 01:49:30,431
I don't know!

983
01:49:31,986 --> 01:49:33,530
You don't know?

984
01:49:33,656 --> 01:49:35,780
You decide that kind of thing.

985
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:39,040
George, during the 9 days that
the Congress session lasted...

986
01:49:39,165 --> 01:49:41,289
...I was waiting for you
to name me.

987
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:43,087
You didn't.

988
01:49:43,297 --> 01:49:45,706
I appreciate that,
I won't forget it.

989
01:49:47,053 --> 01:49:49,131
But I can't with the President.

990
01:49:54,983 --> 01:49:57,310
I never left you in the lurch,
Phil.

991
01:49:59,699 --> 01:50:03,070
During the Civil war
I led 60 charges for you, 60.

992
01:50:03,288 --> 01:50:05,615
I remember all of them.

993
01:50:06,419 --> 01:50:07,748
You only said...

994
01:50:07,879 --> 01:50:11,333
..."Go to defeat them",
and I did it.

995
01:50:12,596 --> 01:50:15,801
I never answer
"I can't with them".

996
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,230
Things have changed.

997
01:50:19,816 --> 01:50:21,857
No, you have changed.

998
01:50:22,404 --> 01:50:24,943
How long is it since
you rode a horse...

999
01:50:25,075 --> 01:50:27,614
...or since they last shot
at you?

1000
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:30,329
You're only a messenger boy...

1001
01:50:30,459 --> 01:50:33,296
...for the railroads
and the politicians.

1002
01:50:34,131 --> 01:50:36,375
You were a soldier.

1003
01:50:39,557 --> 01:50:41,516
I would like to see
your hair...

1004
01:50:41,644 --> 01:50:43,768
...in my house's wall.

1005
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:46,902
Listen to me, General.

1006
01:50:47,988 --> 01:50:50,231
When the war over you came
to me looking for a job.

1007
01:50:50,367 --> 01:50:54,201
I offered several,
but you rejected all.

1008
01:50:54,499 --> 01:50:57,418
You wanted action, that's what
you said. "I want action".

1009
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:01,252
And you get it,
and you get glory too,

1010
01:51:01,928 --> 01:51:04,088
The only thing that
you have cared for.

1011
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:07,227
That's what it is.
You are a glory hunter.

1012
01:51:14,991 --> 01:51:19,371
George, we're a little drunk
now...

1013
01:51:20,876 --> 01:51:23,036
...so we'll forget what
we have said here tonight.

1014
01:51:23,213 --> 01:51:24,494
Go home.

1015
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,639
Maybe you're right, Phil.

1016
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:26,850
Dear, I need pen and ink.

1017
01:52:27,028 --> 01:52:28,856
I got to write a letter.

1018
01:52:37,295 --> 01:52:38,956
A letter to the President?

1019
01:52:39,465 --> 01:52:41,673
Any objections?

1020
01:52:41,927 --> 01:52:43,802
Would you like to dictate it?

1021
01:52:44,056 --> 01:52:48,187
- Yeah.
- Whenever you're ready.

1022
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:54,863
"To his excellency...

1023
01:52:55,784 --> 01:52:59,202
...the President
of the United States...

1024
01:52:59,373 --> 01:53:01,414
...etc., etc.

1025
01:53:01,835 --> 01:53:03,628
Dear Sir...

1026
01:53:04,632 --> 01:53:07,884
...I have written to you during
the past months three times...

1027
01:53:08,054 --> 01:53:11,342
...without the courtesy
of an answer.

1028
01:53:14,022 --> 01:53:16,147
Besides...

1029
01:53:16,318 --> 01:53:18,478
...you have refused me
the interview...

1030
01:53:18,613 --> 01:53:21,106
...which simple justice demands.

1031
01:53:24,498 --> 01:53:28,795
Because of your intervention,
I stand...

1032
01:53:30,675 --> 01:53:33,797
...a man condemned,
a man without trial.

1033
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:38,468
Get all that?
Read it to me.

1034
01:53:43,655 --> 01:53:46,362
"Sir, my regiment
has been ordered...

1035
01:53:46,493 --> 01:53:49,829
...to join the expedition about
to move against the Indians.

1036
01:53:50,667 --> 01:53:52,328
I appeal to you...

1037
01:53:52,753 --> 01:53:55,329
...not as the President
of the United States...

1038
01:53:55,591 --> 01:53:57,965
...but as one soldier
to another.

1039
01:53:58,638 --> 01:54:00,882
Spare me the humiliation
of seeing my regiment...

1040
01:54:01,017 --> 01:54:02,726
...march to meet the enemy...

1041
01:54:02,854 --> 01:54:04,894
...and not share
in it's dangers".

1042
01:54:05,692 --> 01:54:08,648
One soldier to another.

1043
01:54:09,531 --> 01:54:10,813
Libby...

1044
01:54:12,035 --> 01:54:14,195
...I think you might
have done it.

1045
01:54:28,688 --> 01:54:31,940
Attention! Open the gates!

1046
01:54:55,858 --> 01:54:57,270
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you, Captain.

1047
01:54:57,403 --> 01:54:59,195
Welcome back, General.

1048
01:54:59,531 --> 01:55:00,730
Thank you.

1049
01:55:01,534 --> 01:55:03,778
Let's get right to it,
gentlemen.

1050
01:55:04,206 --> 01:55:07,541
Now then, this campaign's going
to be a joint operation.

1051
01:55:08,129 --> 01:55:09,754
General Cook in the South.

1052
01:55:09,923 --> 01:55:11,716
General Gibbons
from the North.

1053
01:55:12,094 --> 01:55:14,218
7th cavalry from the east.

1054
01:55:14,347 --> 01:55:18,182
Geronimo here,
Little Big Horn, June the 26th.

1055
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,054
We should've hit them
three months ago.

1056
01:55:21,276 --> 01:55:24,362
From my scout report, there's
more than a few hostiles.

1057
01:55:24,781 --> 01:55:28,069
True, they're building up
strength everyday.

1058
01:55:28,287 --> 01:55:32,038
Cheyenne, Sioux, the Awpahla
the Munikhanja.

1059
01:55:32,461 --> 01:55:34,751
- Give me the reports, Major.
- Yes, sir.

1060
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:43,890
General, it could be their
big move...

1061
01:55:44,022 --> 01:55:47,191
...to push us clean across
the Mississippi.

1062
01:55:47,444 --> 01:55:48,987
Right, right.

1063
01:55:49,489 --> 01:55:53,074
The picture here in Little Big
Horn will bring the resistance.

1064
01:55:55,624 --> 01:55:58,746
This may be our last chance
to fight, Major.

1065
01:56:07,519 --> 01:56:09,727
You lost a button.

1066
01:56:09,898 --> 01:56:12,022
I'll sew it on to you,
it's only a minute.

1067
01:56:13,446 --> 01:56:16,532
Where's my needle?
I had it a second ago.

1068
01:56:18,245 --> 01:56:20,120
Where is it? I just had it here.

1069
01:56:20,624 --> 01:56:21,870
Doesn't matter.

1070
01:56:23,629 --> 01:56:25,374
Well, it was just here...

1071
01:56:25,507 --> 01:56:26,967
Dear, don't bother about it.

1072
01:56:27,093 --> 01:56:29,669
But it would be so simple
to sew on if I had it.

1073
01:56:54,305 --> 01:56:56,596
Your needle was in my coat

1074
01:57:29,322 --> 01:57:31,565
Forward!

1075
01:57:32,243 --> 01:57:33,620
First squad.

1076
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:38,038
Second squad.

1077
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:42,301
Third squad.

1078
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,651
Come on!

1079
01:58:26,459 --> 01:58:28,417
Come on!

1080
01:58:54,213 --> 01:58:55,792
We're covered a lot
of ground, sir.

1081
01:58:56,133 --> 01:58:57,593
When do we make camp?

1082
01:58:57,719 --> 01:58:59,629
We don't, Lieutenant,
General's orders.

1083
01:58:59,764 --> 01:59:01,841
- Keep the troops moving.
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,267
If we keep pushing at this rate,
we're going to reach...

1085
01:59:05,398 --> 01:59:07,523
...the Little Big Horn a day
before those other two columns.

1086
01:59:07,902 --> 01:59:10,229
He wants to win the war
single handed, Benteen.

1087
01:59:10,407 --> 01:59:12,484
I don't think he cares
whether he wins or not...

1088
01:59:12,619 --> 01:59:14,078
...as long as he's up there
leading that charge.

1089
01:59:20,966 --> 01:59:23,589
Why do you want
to get there first?

1090
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:26,717
Because first is first
and second's nobody

1091
01:59:26,934 --> 01:59:29,177
When we cross the river,
we'll split to three columns.

1092
01:59:29,313 --> 01:59:30,428
Yes, sir.

1093
01:59:30,941 --> 01:59:32,187
Three columns!

1094
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:09,962
Sioux...

1095
02:00:10,674 --> 02:00:12,798
Maybe 3 or 400.

1096
02:00:13,261 --> 02:00:15,588
- Which way are they headed?
- They're just waiting.

1097
02:00:17,435 --> 02:00:19,476
- Sergeant!
- Sir!

1098
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:21,641
Have the men take cover
in those trees and set up...

1099
02:00:21,775 --> 02:00:24,233
...a perimeter defense.
- Yes, sir. Take cover!

1100
02:00:24,488 --> 02:00:25,734
Go to the trees!

1101
02:00:39,096 --> 02:00:41,006
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

1102
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:45,020
There's about 500 Sioux
behind that ridge, waiting.

1103
02:00:46,984 --> 02:00:49,227
- Where's Custer?
- Haven't shown up yet.

1104
02:00:49,613 --> 02:00:52,782
We'll wait. Have your men
deployed in the trees.

1105
02:00:53,954 --> 02:00:55,579
- Corporal!
- Sir?

1106
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,410
- Dismiss the men.
- Yes, sir.

1107
02:00:58,545 --> 02:01:00,788
All forward! Out!

1108
02:01:27,802 --> 02:01:30,473
- Halt! Hawes!
- Sir?

1109
02:01:31,558 --> 02:01:33,635
- You wait here, I'll go ahead.
- Alone, sir?

1110
02:01:33,979 --> 02:01:35,889
- With a scout.
- Could I go with you, sir?

1111
02:01:36,107 --> 02:01:37,519
There might be some action!

1112
02:01:37,735 --> 02:01:39,693
Hot for glory,
ain't you Lieutenant?

1113
02:01:39,989 --> 02:01:43,027
You don't win a General's star
staying behind, do you, sir?

1114
02:01:43,286 --> 02:01:44,532
Your orders are to take over
unless you...

1115
02:01:44,663 --> 02:01:46,953
...hear from me directly, you do
not advance beyond this point.

1116
02:01:47,084 --> 02:01:49,042
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

1117
02:01:50,798 --> 02:01:54,549
Cheer up. You may get your
chance at promotion yet.

1118
02:01:57,184 --> 02:01:58,977
- Scout!
- Halt!

1119
02:02:03,319 --> 02:02:04,648
Halt!

1120
02:03:36,224 --> 02:03:39,346
You just lead your peoples
back to the reservations.

1121
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,276
You must go back.

1122
02:03:44,696 --> 02:03:46,939
I have been waiting for you,
yellow hair.

1123
02:03:49,997 --> 02:03:52,037
There are three armies
on the way.

1124
02:03:52,876 --> 02:03:55,963
They'll wipe you out.
They'll be here tomorrow.

1125
02:04:02,142 --> 02:04:04,302
Today is a good day
for fighting.

1126
02:04:08,820 --> 02:04:10,730
Our fighting.

1127
02:04:11,658 --> 02:04:13,201
It's over.

1128
02:04:14,746 --> 02:04:16,787
It's over, I tell you.

1129
02:04:18,461 --> 02:04:19,742
Trains.

1130
02:04:21,507 --> 02:04:22,837
Steel.

1131
02:04:23,636 --> 02:04:26,307
Guns that kill by thousands,
no horses.

1132
02:04:28,769 --> 02:04:30,146
It's over.

1133
02:04:30,731 --> 02:04:31,930
Steel.

1134
02:04:32,192 --> 02:04:34,519
Yes, steel.
No men.

1135
02:04:36,157 --> 02:04:37,985
It's...

1136
02:04:38,577 --> 02:04:40,286
...finished.

1137
02:04:40,748 --> 02:04:43,121
This is all over.

1138
02:04:46,674 --> 02:04:48,668
Men, for the last time...

1139
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:14,501
Sound the charge, Sergeant!
We're going after Custer!

1140
02:05:14,637 --> 02:05:16,216
But Lieutenant,
he told us to wait!

1141
02:05:16,348 --> 02:05:18,223
I'm in command.
Sound the charge!

1142
02:05:18,352 --> 02:05:21,688
Yes, sir. Troops Ho!

1143
02:06:25,923 --> 02:06:27,632
Stay back, Lieutenant.
I told you to stay put.

1144
02:06:27,759 --> 02:06:30,631
Sounded like you were
being attacked.

1145
02:06:30,931 --> 02:06:33,258
Beef up your flank and get it
in the middle.

1146
02:06:33,393 --> 02:06:34,390
You had to wait!

1147
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:33,026
- Hawes!
- Sir?

1148
02:07:33,285 --> 02:07:35,029
Take a message to Reno
and Benteen.

1149
02:07:35,204 --> 02:07:36,700
I want those men
up here quick.

1150
02:07:36,874 --> 02:07:38,073
Yes, sir.

1151
02:07:38,418 --> 02:07:40,792
You four at the end
of the column, follow me.

1152
02:07:50,688 --> 02:07:51,852
Sergeant.

1153
02:07:53,693 --> 02:07:55,901
We're gonna have to stand here.

1154
02:07:56,657 --> 02:07:58,033
Form a perimeter.

1155
02:07:58,618 --> 02:08:00,659
Okay, give the order.

1156
02:08:01,915 --> 02:08:04,835
- Dis-mount.
- Dismount!

1157
02:08:46,949 --> 02:08:50,236
I can't tell you what's
going on out there, Captain.

1158
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:52,621
He's probably met up with
those Indians...

1159
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:53,830
...he's been chasing so hard.

1160
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,871
He's found what
he's looking for.

1161
02:08:57,967 --> 02:09:00,542
Whatever happens, Captain,
it's his own doing.

1162
02:09:00,763 --> 02:09:03,683
He's getting what he wants.
Most of us never do.

1163
02:09:03,894 --> 02:09:05,270
Captain...

1164
02:09:06,690 --> 02:09:10,143
...you might say he's luckier
than you and me.

1165
02:09:10,989 --> 02:09:12,614
Take your hands off me, Major.

1166
02:09:14,703 --> 02:09:17,112
All right! Go on!

1167
02:09:23,176 --> 02:09:26,629
But don't you forget, Captain,
for the record.

1168
02:09:27,224 --> 02:09:29,551
I'm cold stone sober.

1169
02:09:45,546 --> 02:09:46,662
Halt!

1170
02:09:48,384 --> 02:09:50,711
Back, back!

1171
02:10:34,586 --> 02:10:36,663
Alright, soldiers!

1172
02:10:37,967 --> 02:10:40,804
Hold your fire until
I give the order.

1173
02:11:09,352 --> 02:11:10,812
Fire!

1174
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:17,085
He's saving you for the last.

1175
02:15:18,183 --> 02:15:19,381
I know.

1176
02:15:19,602 --> 02:15:21,679
Don't let him take you, sir.

1177
02:16:28,049 --> 02:16:29,330
Go!

1178
02:16:41,363 --> 02:16:43,606
Charge!
