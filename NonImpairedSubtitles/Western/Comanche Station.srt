1
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,140
Suit yourself.

2
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,919
Get on your feet.

3
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,762
Do like I tell you.

4
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,473
Now get on that mule
before he decides to use that Winchester.

5
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,066
All right, lady, what's your name?

6
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,433
Mrs. Lowe. Nancy Lowe.

7
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,698
From Lordsburg?

8
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,969
- Yes.
- I should have known.

9
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,534
Mind gathering some sticks, ma'am?

10
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,127
No, not at all.

11
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,275
Now, that's gonna be kind of hard to do,
sitting up there.

12
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,202
Mr. Cody, you said
you should have known who I was.

13
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,272
What did you mean by that?

14
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,640
A month ago, Comanche jumped
your coach halfway to Lords,

15
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,508
butchered the whip and shotgun
and took you alive.

16
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,816
I suppose most everybody around here
knows about that.

17
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,989
Then my husband didn't send you for me?

18
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,552
No, ma'am.

19
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,428
- Well, how...
- Talked to a tame Indian up Casa Verde way.

20
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,435
Said the Comanche were holding
a white woman. Holding her for trade.

21
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,438
- So you came after me?
- Yes, ma'am.

22
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,237
- Why?
- Seemed like a good idea.

23
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,471
You could have been killed.

24
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,083
Yes, ma'am.
Come morning, we'll swing south.

25
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,781
Two days will put us into Lordsburg.
Good night, Mrs. Lowe.

26
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,626
If you'd had a woman
taken by the Comanche

27
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,523
and you got her back,

28
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,295
how would you feel, knowing...

29
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,530
If I loved her, it wouldn't matter.

30
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:01,643
- Wouldn't it?
- No, ma'am. It wouldn't matter at all.

31
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,178
Comanche Station.

32
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,325
Station man likely rode the eastbound
to Casa Verde.

33
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,593
Doubled back on the Lordsburg run.

34
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,067
I'll grain and water the animals.

35
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,944
Mr. Cody, I could take the stage
on to Lordsburg from here.

36
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,912
I've been enough trouble.

37
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,176
I started taking you back to Lords,

38
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,445
and that I full intend to do.

39
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,648
Much obliged, Cody.
We needed that extra gun.

40
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,786
Dobie! Get up on that rise.

41
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,446
Make sure them devils
don't lay out in the weeds

42
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,285
and wait till dark to come killing.

43
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,120
Yes, sir.

44
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,216
Frank!

45
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,988
Yeah.

46
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,427
You the station man's woman?

47
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,397
This here is Mrs. Lowe.

48
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,531
Well, now, how about that?

49
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,663
Hey, Frank, this here is Mrs. Lowe.

50
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,708
We've been looking this country
clear over for you.

51
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,903
- You've been looking for me?
- Yes, ma'am.

52
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,970
Just about every man in the territory's
been out beating the brush.

53
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,108
You've got a worth, Mrs. Lowe.
Ain't that right, Frank?

54
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,616
Might of figured you'd beat me to it, Cody.

55
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,348
Frank, better catch up to your partner,

56
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,417
and you and him drag them dead Indians
up on that hill with you.

57
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,489
Do like he says.

58
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,563
- Lane.
- Hello.

59
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,901
- Those bucks, they had paint on.
- So?

60
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,169
Couldn't be you're carrying Comanche hair
on those mules, could it?

61
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,142
We ain't scalp hunters, Cody.
You know that.

62
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,610
Do I?

63
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,146
You'd do anything for bounty.

64
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,047
Look, me and the boys rode in
to Ransom Canyon, same as you did.

65
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,415
Thought Mrs. Lowe here
was still up for trade.

66
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,513
They come at us and we run.
It was worth a try, though.

67
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,753
Ain't every day a man gets a chance
to make that amount of money.

68
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
Don't you know how much
your husband is offering the man

69
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,090
who brings you back, Mrs. Lowe?

70
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,895
Didn't he tell you?

71
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,034
$5,000.

72
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,796
Can't say as I blame him.

73
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,436
Pure shame you beat me to her, Cody.

74
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,777
Yes, sir, pure.

75
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:50,053
I've heard about men like you.
Comancheros, I think they call them.

76
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,056
Well, it won't be necessary for you
to take me on to Lordsburg.

77
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,397
And I'll see to it
my husband pays you your bounty.

78
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,445
- Now, hold on to him, boys.
- We got him.

79
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,310
All right, here goes.

80
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,311
That liniment will do it.

81
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,061
Get him, Dobie.

82
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,426
Oh, get away from me, you mule!

83
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,105
Come on! Come on, Dobie, grab him!

84
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,576
I'm trying!

85
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,851
That's it, Dobie, don't be scared of him.

86
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,546
Hold him, Dobie!

87
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,086
He don't seem hurt too bad.

88
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,751
The bullet just creased his hide.

89
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,784
Nothing like jackass liniment.

90
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,796
That'll cure anything.

91
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,773
Been a long time, Cody.

92
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,538
- Last time I seen you was...
- Fort McKavett.

93
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,605
That's right.
The day you busted me out of the army.

94
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,013
I never could figure why.

95
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,248
Killing Indians,
that's what we were there for.

96
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,984
Was it?

97
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,891
Seems like we've been over this before.

98
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,952
I heard you'd given up the critter soldiers.

99
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,396
I kind of figured you'd stay with it,
being a major and all.

100
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,593
Command was wiped out at McKavett.

101
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,158
Yeah, I know.

102
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,204
- Least they can't blame me for that.
- Can't they?

103
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,604
I was doing my job!

104
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,902
You overran a village of tame Indians.

105
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,240
- I didn't know.
- You're a liar.

106
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,344
That's what you said
at my court-martial, didn't you?

107
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,912
Had my way, they'd have hung you.

108
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,885
You said that, too.

109
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,521
"Overland Stage.

110
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,263
"The Lordsburg run leaves...

111
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:22,272
"Overland Stage, the Lordsburg run leaves

112
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,714
"Casa Verde, sunrise.

113
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,949

00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,749

115
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,555
"Weather permitting. "

116
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,925
I didn't know you could read, Dobie.

117
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,729
Well, I ain't much with books
and newspapers, but plain words,

118
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,761
you know, like signs and wrappers
and such, I do pretty good.

119
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,606
Which one's Comanche?

120
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,611
Right there.

121
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,706
Dang!

122
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,392
You planning on taking the coach to Lords,
are you, Mrs. Lowe?

123
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,790
Yes, I am.

124
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,995
Wouldn't suppose
you'd hold kind to that, Cody.

125
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,364
The lady here says she's going
to take the coach to Lords.

126
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,165
I'm not a prisoner anymore, Mr. Lane.

127
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,097
Aren't you?

128
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,809
- Lane.
- Hello.

129
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,980
There's plenty of light left.

130
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:34,348
If you were to leave now, you could cover
a good amount of ground before night.

131
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,388
We say anything about
going anywhere, did we?

132
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,023
- I didn't.
- No close town around.

133
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,794
Now that's a fact.
Nothing but empty between here and Lords.

134
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,461
No, I think we'll stay around for a while.

135
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,872
Me, I get a kick out of watching
that coach come in,

136
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,605
waving to the people.

137
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,613
Don't you, boys?

138
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:07,084
That is unless you have
any objections, Mr. Cody.

139
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,118
I don't really see that
it's any of his business.

140
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,454
Now, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

141
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,320
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

142
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,532
That stage should have been here by now,
shouldn't it?

143
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,777
The driver likely saw war signs,

144
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,314
laid over the night at Casa Verde.

145
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,643
I see.

146
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,946
Your husband is a fortunate man,
getting you back.

147
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,422
I guess you'll always wonder, though,

148
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,053
why he didn't come after you himself.

149
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,321
I don't mean to low-grade him, mind you.

150
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,630
After all, he did put up $5,000.

151
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,262
That's love of a sort, I suppose.

152
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,498
Were you mine,

153
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,545
I'd come looking to find you
even if I had to die in the doing.

154
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,182
Good night, Mr. Lane.

155
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,482
That stage don't get here come morning,

156
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,887
me and the boys'll be obliged
to see you to Lordsburg.

157
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,541
She's something, ain't she?

158
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,288
Did you mean that, Ben,
about us taking her on into Lords?

159
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,789
Why not?

160
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,154
Cody won't like that.

161
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,922
Country's crawling with Comanche.
He's gonna need all the help he can get.

162
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,358
He ain't about to give up that 5,000.

163
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,899
That's right.

164
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,063
We could kill him.

165
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,274
Did that, that woman would witness
against us. Ain't that a fact, Ben, huh?

166
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,505
If she was alive.

167
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,474
What?

168
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,983
They said that Mr. Lowe fellow...

169
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,057
They said he'd be willing to pay
even if a man brought his wife in dead.

170
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,951
Why would he do a fool thing like that?

171
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,464
Claims just knowing for sure
would ease his loss.

172
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,500
- Well, that's crazy.
- That's the way he looks at it.

173
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,567
You mean, the woman?

174
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,264
5,000.

175
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,274
That's a lot of money.

176
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,850
I heard what Lane said about your husband.
He's wrong.

177
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,088
Rode out to find you,
he'd have likely got you both killed.

178
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,590
- Is that all, Mr. Cody?
- No, ma'am. That...

179
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,826
That money offered to get you back, I...

180
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,461
I suppose you're going to tell me
that you didn't know anything about that.

181
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,027
I didn't know.

182
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,670
I don't believe you.

183
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,468
I didn't think you would.

184
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,765
Frank?

185
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,936
Were you awake?

186
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,776
Yeah.

187
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,082
Frank, you ever get the feeling
we ain't along?

188
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,753
Well, with Ben.

189
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,224
What?

190
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,369
Well, the way he treats us.

191
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,267
You know, "Do this, do that. "

192
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,136
He says, "Jump," and we say, "Which way?"

193
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,934
So?

194
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,911
So, we might as well not even have a head.

195
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,520
Well, if you want to ride, Dobie,
you can go. Ben's not gonna stop you.

196
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,724
You come along, too, would you?

197
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,923
You mean break with Ben?

198
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,065
No, I guess not, huh?

199
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,502
Well, it's nothing personal, it's just that

200
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,100
a man sort of gets used to a thing.

201
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,726
Sure hope I amount to something.

202
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,393
What?

203
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,807
My pa, he used to say,

204
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,709
"Dobie, no matter what you do

205
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,542
"or who you do it to,

206
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,048
"be sure you amount to something. "

207
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,182
Well, what did he mean by that?

208
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,984
Oh, a lot of things.

209
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,690
Like what?

210
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,595
Well, like Cody.

211
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,494
- Cody?
- He does.

212
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:30,794
He does what?

213
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,769
Amount to something.

214
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,267
How do you know?

215
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,333
Well, he was Army. Had braid on him.

216
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,344
Yeah, but not anymore, he hasn't.

217
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,680
That don't matter. A man does one thing,

218
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:52,086
one thing in his life
he can look back on, go proud.

219
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,651
That's enough.
Anyway, that's what my pa used to say.

220
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,066
He talked all the time, didn't he?

221
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:06,795
Yeah.

222
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,501
He was a good man.

223
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,076
Sure is a shame.

224
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,443
Shame?

225
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,610
Yeah, my pa,

226
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,391
he never did amount to anything.

227
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,357
Good night, Frank.

228
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,047
What do you think, Ben?

229
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,916
I think we ought to get out of here.

230
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,889
- Cody.
- I see them.

231
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,391
- Dobie.
- Yes, sir?

232
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,620
Go catch up the animals.

233
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,528
We'd better get on to Lords
before they decide to scald us out.

234
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,396
We'll wait for the stage from Casa Verde.

235
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,162
If that was coming,
it would have been here by now.

236
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,601
Frank's right.

237
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,231
They might have got cut off, forted up
at some swing stop along the way.

238
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,434
You sure you don't have scalps
on those mules?

239
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,806
You think I'd do something like that?

240
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,038
- I know you would.
- Look, Cody, I...

241
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,273
Ben! Man coming out here!

242
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,778
Stage turned back to Casa Verde.

243
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,187
Had to get back. Take care of my...

244
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,225
Take care of my animals.

245
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:14,492
Scalp-hunters raided a village up near Mesa.

246
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,665
Killed the women and small ones.

247
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,966
They caught them.

248
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,603
Caught them?

249
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,707
Yeah. Two no-goods from Verde,
killed them both.

250
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,883
That didn't stop the Comanche, though.

251
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,253
Been butchering the territory
one end to the other.

252
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,184
You'd better head and clear out.

253
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,320
Go on to Lordsburg before...

254
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,897
My horse.

255
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,197
Gotta take care of my horse...

256
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,574
We'll take care of him.

257
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,843
Frank, give Dobie a hand.

258
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,621
We're all going to Lords.

259
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,384
It's amazing what an Indian will give up

260
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,089
for a Winchester rifle
and a bolt of red calico.

261
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,793
Mrs. Lowe, she's sure a handsome woman.

262
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,133
See one like that,
a man gets to thinking about

263
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,195
taking a wife and settling down.

264
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,331
You?

265
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,511
Well, I admit, I never had much luck
when it comes to women.

266
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:12,538
Oh, I've run with a few.
Nothing you could call serious.

267
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,347
Except maybe that little gal down in Sonora.

268
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,752
She said right out she loved me.
Wanted to marry me.

269
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,383
Told everybody.
Everybody but her husband.

270
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,057
Oh, he came within that of
doing me with a scattergun.

271
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,826
That taught me a lesson, though.

272
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,394
Always check the brand to make sure
you ain't driving another man's stock.

273
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,130
- Lane.
- Hello.

274
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,436
Back there at the station,

275
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,034
what I said about your mules
carrying Comanche hair, I...

276
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:45,105
Forget it. Everybody's entitled to a mistake.

277
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,682
Now, you take that there Mr. Lowe.

278
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:54,453
Offering all that money to get
his wife back, that's a mistake.

279
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:59,189
That amount of money has a way
of making a man go all greed inside.

280
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,423
Such as?

281
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:04,457
Makes them get to thinking of doing things
he might not otherwise do.

282
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,732
You know, it's a long way to Lordsburg.

283
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:13,072
It wouldn't surprise me if somebody didn't
try to take that woman away from you.

284
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,578
Like you, for instance?

285
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,546
Like me, in particular.

286
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,724
Wait here.

287
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,845
Come on across.

288
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,608
- Come on.
- Dobie, straighten out those horses.

289
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,124
Come on, come on, let's get going.

290
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,938
We'll follow the river as far as we can.

291
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,936
That'll put us a full day out of the way.

292
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,914
If you're in a hurry,
you can travel open country.

293
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,711
Nobody's stopping you.

294
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,581
We'll ride along with you.

295
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,181
Figured you would.

296
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,735
Better slip into this.

297
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,210
Couple of more miles,
you'll be plumb out of that.

298
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:23,485
Mr. Cody, I think I owe you an apology.

299
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,647
No matter the reason, you did save my life.

300
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,956
Hadn't been me,
it would've been somebody else.

301
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,326
Lane told me you've brought more whites
out of Comanche country

302
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,661
than any other man in this territory.

303
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,257
Why, Mr. Cody?

304
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:41,263
They traded you for $5 worth
of goods and a Winchester, Mrs. Lowe.

305
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,431
Figure it out for yourself.

306
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,509
We'll be staying here long enough
to grain the animals.

307
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,344
And if you've a mind to wash, there's a hole
back around the bend of the river.

308
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,688
Sure is a waste.

309
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,035
Having to do the woman.

310
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,268
If she was only ugly, it wouldn't be so bad,
but pretty like she is,

311
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,837
it's an out and out waste.

312
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,845
Maybe we won't have to.

313
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,048
I don't see any other way.

314
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,380
We could string along with Cody
till after he gets the money,

315
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,420
- and then we could...
- It won't work.

316
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,080
Why not?

317
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,287
Well, because that'd be just asking
for a hang rope.

318
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,220
We're gonna have to do him in, anyway.

319
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,924
And everybody's going to
think the Comanches got him.

320
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,402
I never thought of that.
I still don't like it.

321
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,468
My folks brought me up
to be kind to a woman.

322
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,444
You know, "Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. "
Open doors for them, give them my chair.

323
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,276
Not go around killing them.

324
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,511
Well, you think I like it
any better than you do?

325
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,448
- No, I guess not.
- You wanna go to work, do you?

326
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,315
- Work?
- Making an honest living?

327
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,522
Oh, no, I don't think I could do that.

328
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,532
- I'd cowboy some.
- Well, what will that get you?

329
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,158
You work yourself to death for somebody,

330
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,965
and likely they have to
take up a collection to bury you.

331
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,198
Frank!

332
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,615
- Ain't that pretty?
- Yeah.

333
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,681
Frank, take a ride up river
and see if they crossed ahead of us.

334
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:46,452
If they cut our track, it's gonna put us
between a rock and a hard place.

335
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,293
You can say that.

336
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:39,173
- How long is that woman gonna take?
- Sit down. She'll be back in a minute.

337
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,152
Frank! Frank!

338
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,977
We're getting out of here.

339
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,486
- You're not going to leave him like that?
- Yes, ma'am.

340
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:18,612
That ain't right, Mr. Cody.

341
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,453
Not talking about right,
talking about staying alive.

342
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:22,719
I'll turn those stage horses loose.

343
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,283
They can take care of themselves
from now on.

344
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,762
Mr. Cody, you can't leave here
until we give that man a proper grave.

345
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,289
You want to end up again
belonging to a Comanche buck?

346
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,006
We'll rest here.

347
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,737
We'll turn Frank's horse loose.
He'll eat his way to Lordsburg.

348
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,504
Yes, sir.

349
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:37,255
A saddle and a shirt. That's all Frank had.

350
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,724
- Sure ain't much.
- Sure ain't.

351
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,929
- Wasn't his fault, though.
- No?

352
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,996
No.

353
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,874
He never knew anything but the wild side.

354
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,707
Man can cross over any time he has a mind.

355
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,807
It ain't that easy. It
ain't that easy at all.

356
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,181
- How old are you, Dobie?
- I don't know. Young.

357
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,918
Family know you're running loose
in this country, do they?

358
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,220
No, sir.

359
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,619
Fever got them.

360
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:19,033
Nobody to answer to,
so you threw in with the likes of Lane.

361
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,467
Me and Frank were riding together
up near DeValdie way.

362
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,606
Frank was alone, same as me.

363
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,545
We heard about this fellow
who was looking for some young guns.

364
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,573
Been with him ever since.

365
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,642
You'll end up on a rope, Dobie.
You know that?

366
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,821
- Yes, sir.
- You could break with him.

367
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:45,190
I've thought about that.
I've thought about that a lot.

368
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,887
Frank said it.

369
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,764
A man gets used to a thing.

370
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:55,532
Dobie, when we get to Lordsburg,
you can ride along with me a ways.

371
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,806
A man gets tired being all the time alone.

372
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,475
- You'd do that for me?
- Think it over, son.

373
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:25,497
Hold it. It's only me.
Get down to the river, Dobie.

374
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,299
- You see anything, sing out.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,765
Here.

376
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,910
- Ben?
- Hello.

377
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:40,211
We get to Lords, we ought to see
if we can hunt up some of Frank's kin.

378
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,047
They should be told.

379
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,850
Yeah, we'll do that.

380
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,715
I'm sure gonna miss...

381
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,418
Miss him.

382
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,967
That Dobie kind of runs on
the gentle side, don't he?

383
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,964
Maybe too gentle.

384
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,366
For what?

385
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:08,176
This is a hard country, Cody.
Man's called on to do a lot of things.

386
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,106
Things that take spine.

387
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,180
Like Mrs. Lowe's husband.

388
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:19,621
It took a lot of nerve to send another man
out to bring his woman back.

389
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,423
No, I mean it.

390
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,825
How does he know what's gonna happen,
throwing two together like that?

391
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,990
I knew me a fellow once,
wife was taken in a raid.

392
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,432
A good-looking woman.

393
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,267
Kind of made you go lonely
just being around her.

394
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,773
Hearing her say words.

395
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,141
Seeing her move.

396
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:48,583
Come to think of it,
she's a lot like you, Mrs. Lowe.

397
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,719
Anyway, he lost her and he sent
a gent out to find her and he did.

398
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,158
Of course, at first,
they didn't get on too good,

399
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:02,495
her thinking he'd traded her for a profit

400
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:07,469
and him making out like
he don't care this way or that.

401
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:11,906
Now, all the time, they're getting closer
and they never even knew it.

402
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:16,002
About the second night out,
she got to thinking on it.

403
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,349
Got to feeling all grateful inside.

404
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,615
What with this fellow risking his hide
to save her while her own man stayed home,

405
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,480
doing who knows what.

406
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,690
- Well, the next thing you know...
- Lane.

407
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,220
I was only gonna say that,
that husband never did get his woman back.

408
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:39,435
Now losing them to a Comanche,
that's one thing.

409
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,433
Losing them to a white,
that's something altogether else.

410
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,704
'Course, in this case, there's the money.

411
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:53,341
Sure would put a man to the test having to
decide between you and $5,000, Mrs. Lowe.

412
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,647
I'm sure glad it ain't me.

413
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,125
- Lane.
- Hello.

414
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,685
Any luck, we'll break out
of Comanche country sometime tomorrow.

415
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:10,096
- That happens, I want you gone.
- Now, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

416
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,727
Then you could have Mrs. Lowe here
all to yourself.

417
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,874
Mr. Cody.

418
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,316
- It wasn't necessary to do that for my sake.
- I didn't.

419
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,621
Hi. I couldn't sleep.

420
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,695
I'm glad.

421
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,428
Nothing as lonely as the night.

422
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,969
- Dobie...
- Yes, ma'am?

423
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,639
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since Comanche Station.

424
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,212
You didn't know him at all before that?

425
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,845
No, ma'am. Not face on. I'd heard about him.

426
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:13,156
How he's all the time alone, all the
time in Comanche country, looking.

427
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:19,100
Seems long ago
he lost his woman to the Indians.

428
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,729
Been hunting to find her ever since.

429
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,465
Every time he hears of a white woman
up for trade, he packs a mule and goes.

430
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,771
Don't matter where.

431
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,010
'Course, there's them
that tries to tell him his wife's dead.

432
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,985
But he goes right on looking.

433
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,284
You'd think he'd give up,
it being so long and all.

434
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,291
But he don't.

435
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,325
I guess he never will.

436
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,798
Sure must've been a love between them two.

437
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,360
Funny thing.

438
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:01,109
I guess Ben don't, but I do like Mr. Cody.

439
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:09,748
Mrs. Lowe, there's something
you ought to know.

440
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,745
Ben and me...

441
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:17,281
Well, sometimes he figures
we got to do things that...

442
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,252
Things that just ain't...

443
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,391
What I'm trying to tell you is,

444
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,434
that no matter what happens
between here and Lords,

445
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,869
you stick close to Cody,
and just as close as you can.

446
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,102
Yes, Dobie. Yes, I will.

447
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,723
- Ben.
- Hello.

448
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,697
Maybe we ought to think again
about Cody and the woman.

449
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,171
Now, I know it's a lot of money, but...

450
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,506
You got any idea how long it would take us
to make that amount of money, Dobie?

451
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,976
- Three years?
- More.

452
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,108
Well, losing Frank and all,
that only puts us two against one.

453
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,276
Now, a man like Cody,
that ain't good odds, Ben.

454
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,912
- That ain't good odds at all.
- I know.

455
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,588
We can't come straight at him.
We wouldn't have a chance.

456
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,592
- We're gonna have to figure us a plan and...
- I have.

457
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,253
You have? When do we do it?

458
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,294
Soon.

459
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,507
If they catch us in that open,
it's gonna make the hill higher to climb.

460
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,547
What do you think, Cody?

461
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,482
Stand your animals.

462
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,316
When I reach the other side of the clearing,
come on across.

463
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,647
What if you don't reach it?

464
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,749
- Circle high around.
- Cody.

465
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,654
Here.

466
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,311
Dobie, stay with the woman.

467
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,629
I thought I told you to circle high around.

468
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,675
I couldn't let them do you
without a chance, Cody.

469
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,607
You would have had the woman.

470
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:06,342
I never could've enjoyed spending that
5,000 if I'd done you that way.

471
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,781
I'll go catch up your horse.

472
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,790
- Now, hold still.
- My leg's all right, Mrs. Lowe.

473
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,530
- You got any whiskey?
- No, ma'am.

474
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:32,905
But Ben's got some of that jackass liniment.
Claims it'll cure anything.

475
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,137
It was a foolish thing to do,
riding out on that open alone.

476
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,907
- It's a wonder they didn't kill you.
- They tried.

477
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,379
Here it is.

478
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,013
But you ain't gonna make him drink it?

479
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,657
It's gonna hurt.

480
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,069
Followed that war party about a mile.
They won't be back.

481
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,610
- No?
- They picked up their dogs and squaws.

482
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:13,047
- Means they've headed back into the hills.
- They're done with killing. For now, anyway.

483
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,279
Then we should be in Lordsburg
by tomorrow with no trouble at all.

484
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,116
Yes, ma'am. No trouble at all.

485
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,423
We're just taking a look around
before we bed down for the night.

486
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,984
- So was I. Man can't be too careful.
- Yeah.

487
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,730
Which reminds me of a story.

488
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,735
Another fellow was bringing in
a wife for bounty.

489
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:10,739
Some no-goods fell in with him, rode along.
Plain what they were planning.

490
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,332
- Just a matter of when.
- So?

491
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,276
- So he told them.
- Told them?

492
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:20,476
- They shouldn't try.
- But they didn't pay no heed.

493
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,984
Should have. He buried them.

494
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,518
That's a very sad story, Cody.

495
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:31,721
Didn't have to be.

496
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,787
This fellow, how did he manage it,
doing all of them that way?

497
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:40,234
- Comanche got one.
- What happened to the other?

498
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,967
Let's just say he had a way with a gun.

499
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,868
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.

500
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,701
Thank you, ma'am.

501
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,410
You cook good, Mrs. Lowe.
A woman should cook good.

502
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,550
I'm a pretty good cook myself.

503
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,254
Mrs. Lowe, I'm gonna miss you.

504
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,748
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.

505
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,678
We'll be in Lordsburg
for sure tomorrow, won't we?

506
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,152
Yes, ma'am.

507
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:12,155
- Mr. Cody, I'm frightened.
- Frightened?

508
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,464
I have a feeling
things will never be the same.

509
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,022
You'll forget.

510
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,234
You haven't.

511
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,907
- Dobie told me about your wife.
- Did he?

512
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,644
You must have loved her very much.

513
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,745
- Will you be staying on in Lordsburg?
- No, ma'am.

514
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:40,555
I was hoping you would.
Make things easier somehow.

515
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,697
Mrs. Lowe, what Dobie told you,
it's been 10 years ago, that happened.

516
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,762
Knowing you is the first in all that time
I've ever been able to forget,

517
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,803
even for a little while.

518
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,571
I'm obliged.

519
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,917
Get up.

520
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,450
Toss them on that blanket.

521
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,396
Now get on your animals
and get out of here.

522
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,455
What?

523
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:28,300
I lay eyes on you two
between here and Lords, I'll kill you.

524
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,203
- You got no call to do this, Cody.
- Don't I? Move.

525
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,829
- You know something, Ben?
- What's that?

526
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:36,167
I'm glad it's over.
Glad we didn't have to go through with it.

527
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,638
What would we have done
with all that money, anyway?

528
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,772
Different if we had a purpose.
You know, owned something of our own.

529
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:49,807
Something we could put it to,
like land or cattle or something like that.

530
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,185
But the way we are, I'm glad.

531
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,085
I bet you are, too, huh, Ben?

532
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,354
- Dobie.
- Yeah?

533
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,023
Remember me telling you I had a plan?

534
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,564
- Yeah.
- Well, I've still got it.

535
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,380
Well, this is it.

536
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,556
Laying out here with a long gun waiting
for Mr. Cody to come riding into range.

537
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,462
But, Ben, we ain't got a long gun.

538
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,195
Ain't we?

539
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:50,007
The only way into Lordsburg, along
there, over them rocks, or past here.

540
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,247
All we gotta do is wait.

541
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,849
Better get them animals back out of sight.

542
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,332
- Ben.
- Hello.

543
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,833
I want no part of it.

544
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,608
Where do you think you're going?

545
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:29,079
When I thought it was over, Ben,
I felt good. I felt good inside.

546
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:34,187
I haven't felt like that in a long while.

547
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:38,818
You wouldn't be thinking of doubling back
to Cody and the woman, would you?

548
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,586
I've been obliged to know you, Ben.

549
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,467
Dobie! Dobie!

550
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,236
Wait here.

551
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,225
Lane, he's got a gun.

552
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,134
I'm gonna work high around.
See if I can come in behind.

553
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:33,141
You see him, start shooting and don't stop.

554
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:31,891
Lane!

555
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:34,993
Hello.

556
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,163
Drop the gun.

557
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:40,470
- Do that, I won't have a chance, Cody.
- As much as Dobie did.

558
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,171
- That was a fair fight.
- He was killed from behind.

559
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:46,544
- He was a fool.
- Depends on how you look at it.

560
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,108
Don't seem right
we can't work this out with words, Cody.

561
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,416
Hadn't been for me,
you'd be in the ground in that canyon

562
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,955
back where the Comanche
jumped you, remember?

563
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:58,084
- I remember.
- I figured you would.

564
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,627
Drop the gun.

565
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:03,363
If I spin and do you,
I'll get the woman, Cody.

566
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,492
- I wouldn't try.
- Got to.

567
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:10,931
- Come too far to turn back now.
- Don't do it, Ben.

568
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,476
It's a pure shame, ain't it?

569
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,540
How a man'll push himself for money.

570
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,547
Yes, sir. Pure.

571
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:12,294
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

572
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,101
Nancy?

573
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,275
Yes, John, I'm home.

574
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,815
Go help your father.

575
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,625
You never told me.

576
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,291
If you knew my man,

577
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,735
you'd understand he'd have to
have a reason not to come after me.

578
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,501
Yes, ma'am. I always figured there was.

579
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,003
Thank you, Mr. Cody.

580
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,446
Hello, sweetheart.
