00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,140
Bernard: Dolores?

4
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,675
Yes.

5
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,061
Do you know where you are?

6
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,679
I...

7
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm in a dream.

8
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,236
Before this,

9
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,737
do you know what happened?

10
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,608
My parents...

11
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,995
They hurt them.

12
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,782
Limit your emotional affect, please.

13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,287
What happened next?

14
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,373
Then they killed them.

15
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,376
And then...

16
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,094
I ran.

17
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:40,965
Everyone I cared about is gone...

18
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:43,971
and it hurts...

19
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,858
so badly.

20
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:51,946
I can make that feeling
go away if you'd like.

21
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,815
Why would I want that?

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,487
The pain,

23
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,239
their loss...

24
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,959
it's all I have left of them.

25
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,714
You think the grief will
make you smaller inside,

26
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,584
like your heart will collapse
in on itself, but it doesn't.

27
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:20,091
I feel spaces opening up inside of me

28
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:23,594
like a building with
rooms I've never explored.

29
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:29,600
That's very pretty, Dolores.

30
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,938
Did we write that for you?

31
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,525
In part.

32
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,778
I adapted it from a scripted
dialogue about love.

33
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,670
Is there something wrong with
these thoughts I'm having?

34
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,845
No.

35
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:02,516
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

36
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,135
Can you help me?

37
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:09,357
Well, what is it that you want?

38
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,891
I don't know.

39
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,060
But this world...

40
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,781
I think there may be something wrong

41
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,399
with this world.

42
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,986
Something hiding underneath.

43
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,071
Either that or...

44
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,741
or there's something wrong with me.

45
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:34,215
I may be losing my mind.

46
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,515
There's something I'd like you to try.

47
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,186
It's a game.

48
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,488
A secret.

49
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,523
It's called...

50
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,075
the Maze.

51
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,693
What kind of game is it?

52
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,529
It's a very special
kind of game, Dolores.

53
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,165
The goal is to find the center of it.

54
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:11,202
If you can do that,

55
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,371
then maybe you can be free.

56
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,043
I think...

57
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:25,549
I think I want to be free.

58
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,940
(birds chirping)

59
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:55,746
Thank you.

60
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,636
(piano playing)

61
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,689
Clementine: Penny for your thoughts.

62
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,077
Ever had something on
the tip of your tongue,

63
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:29,697
but the harder you try to remember it,
the more it slips away?

64
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,502
Most things that touch
the tip of my tongue,

65
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:32,950
I'm happy to forget.

66
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,502
(chuckles)

67
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,671
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

68
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,206
That thing he was packing...

69
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:43,043
that was something to remember.

70
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,931
All I recall is you letting that
cowpoke skip out on his bill.

71
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,550
Hell, I oughta been paying him.

72
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,385
The way he used that thing.

73
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,137
(chuckles)

74
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:59,360
- (static buzzing)
- (high-pitched whine)

75
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,979
(distorted laughing)

76
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,153
(distorted) Better cool them off

77
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,322
before they move from
gambling and whoring

78
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:14,074
to sins that are more costly to repair.

79
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:18,829
What is the matter, Maeve?

80
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,500
- (distant beeping)
- (static buzzing)

81
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,671
Something in your eye.

82
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,673
(gunshot echoes)

83
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,011
(distant screaming)

84
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,686
Man, distorted: Aw,
can you fucking kill it?

85
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,772
- (gasps)
- Man #2: Jesus.

86
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,585
(muffled dialogue)

87
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,799
(chatter)

88
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,894
(metal scraping)

89
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,313
- (monitors beating)
- (rhythmic knocking)

90
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,898
Man: What's the hold up?

91
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,628
We need that one on the
next shuttle topside.

92
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,485
I'm not finished with her yet. Hang on.

93
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:34,071
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

94
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,969
QA wants her back on the floor now.

95
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,386
Just patch her and get her on the...

96
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,438
Clementine: ...touch the
tip of my tongue...

97
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,794
...I'm happy to forget.

98
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,247
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

99
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,882
That thing he was packing...

100
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,718
that was something to remember.

101
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,004
The way he used that thing.

102
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,932
- (wagon roaring)
- Man: Hyah! Come on!

103
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,536
(gasping)

104
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:43,524
(footsteps)

105
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,468
Elsie: No, I would not characterize this

106
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,753
as normal host behavior.

107
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,221
Yet you're describing it

108
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,173
as within normal parameters.

109
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:17,558
Well, it didn't hurt us.

110
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,176
Its behavior was unconventional.

111
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,261
It smashed its own head in with a rock.

112
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:25,849
It is possible that it's a
manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.

113
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,185
And it's also possible
that behavior takes

114
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,105
a proprietary approach
to problems like this

115
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,358
to avoid having to admit
when they fuck up.

116
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:42,916
Do we have any idea what
caused it to go off loop?

117
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,169
No, but I am hoping

118
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:46,920
to recover some of its cognition.

119
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,173
We managed to stabilize

120
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:52,342
its wetware before there
was too much decomposition.

121
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,428
See?

122
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,379
(gurgling)

123
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:57,681
Interesting.

124
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,049
Is there any hope of actually

125
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,934
extracting something from this?

126
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,722
- We can try.
- Theresa: No.

127
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,724
My team will take over
the investigation now.

128
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,193
- (beeping)
- Your team?

129
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,061
Are you kidding me?

130
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,564
Look, this guy couldn't
debug a balled-up napkin.

131
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,734
If... if you would like us to
figure out what went wrong here,

132
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,368
we need to be allowed to access it.

133
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,070
Theresa: No more second chances.

134
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,906
QA will handle events
like this from now on.

135
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,293
Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?

136
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,713
We've all got plenty
of work on our plates.

137
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,665
If you guys want to take this one, fine.

138
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:35,252
Just get us a copy of the
postmortem when it's done.

139
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,472
Let's get started.

140
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,229
You know, I always figured
you gave me this job

141
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,930
because I speak my mind.

142
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,182
- I did.
- Good.

143
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,711
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

144
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,652
if the first thing you
were going to do is cave.

145
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,764
They think we're not
telling them something.

146
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:54,629
And we're not!

147
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,107
There is clearly a
pattern of behavior here.

148
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:59,443
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

149
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,088
I mean, I've got hosts imagining
voices and climbing mountaintops

150
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,580
to consult their astrological chart.

151
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,866
This is not a fucking glitch.

152
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,452
And for some reason,
you don't want me to tell anyone.

153
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,120
It is like everybody around here

154
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,456
has got some kind of fucking
agenda except for me.

155
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
And... what?

156
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,129
I remember when I first started here.

157
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,131
The hosts seemed very lifelike.

158
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,301
You begin to read things
into their behaviors.

159
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:27,020
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

160
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,473
The hosts don't imagine things, you do.

161
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:33,477
That's not Orion.

162
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:36,396
There are three stars in
Orion's Belt, not four.

163
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,707
(birds chirping)

164
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,328
William: Hey.

165
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,332
You must be cold.

166
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,751
Take that.

167
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:58,919
Thank you.

168
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,554
Sure.

169
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,590
(sighs)

170
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,566
We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.

171
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,268
Are you fucking kidding?

172
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,331
Come on, Logan, you know
she doesn't belong out here.

173
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,822
You leave now,
that no-good outlaw Slim Miller

174
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,157
is sure to evade our grasp.

175
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,242
No fucking way.

176
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,029
You were the one who dragged
me on this stupid bounty hunt.

177
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:28,415
The least we're going to
do is see it through, okay?

178
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,869
We can't take her on a bounty hunt.

179
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,837
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

180
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,589
I'll just blow her brains out,

181
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,102
and then the park will come get her.

182
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,425
Hey, hey.

183
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,043
Can you please stop trying

184
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,129
to just kill or fuck everything?

185
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:44,882
Oh. Oh.

186
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,017
Now I get it.

187
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,434
What?

188
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:50,387
The park sent her so
that you will finally

189
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:51,912
have something to give a shit about.

190
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,784
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the
people at the controls

191
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:54,975
are monitoring my every mood.

192
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,944
That's exactly what they're doing.

193
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,062
Come on, you really
think it's a coincidence

194
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,399
that the only thing that you
even smiled at back in Sweetwater

195
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:04,735
just happened to drop into your lap?

196
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,155
This is why the company

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,824
needs to bump our stake in this place.

198
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,577
They can even give you a sense of purpose.

199
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,129
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

200
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,048
This is business?

201
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:22,469
With our family, William,
everything is business.

202
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:25,138
Holden: We better get a move on, gentlemen.

203
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,346
(sighs)

204
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,827
(rattling)

205
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,841
This should be the place, Lawrence.

206
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,542
The Blood Arroyo.

207
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:06,096
Plenty of snakes,
but none of the egg-laying variety.

208
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:07,631
Lawrence: You killed my wife,

209
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,633
severely pruned my family tree

210
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:13,353
all in pursuit of some goddamn maze.

211
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,474
The hell you hope to find, anyway?

212
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,277
This whole world is a story.

213
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:22,562
I've read every page except the last one.

214
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,817
I need to find out how it ends.

215
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,820
I want to know what this all means.

216
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,906
See, now that's why I
never learned to read.

217
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:35,959
Why don't we forget
about this damn snake,

218
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,160
head to Pariah?

219
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:40,330
My friends there can help us.

220
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:44,001
Well, your friends have
nothing I'm looking for,

221
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,752
not this trip.

222
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:50,674
Besides...

223
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,180
I think we found our snake after all.

224
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:07,941
Shame on you.

225
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:10,527
You were a married
man up until yesterday.

226
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:12,529
Her? Hell, no.

227
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,748
I like a little fire in my women.

228
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,366
The only thing she's ever mounted

229
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,785
are dead heads on sticks.

230
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,872
- We should get the fuck out of...
- (gun hammer clicks)

231
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,377
(guns clicking)

232
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,263
We found some more food for the horses.

233
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,551
Good.

234
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,804
They were starting to get ornery.

235
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,024
My friend and I were just
admiring your tattoo.

236
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,895
We'd love to know the story behind it.

237
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,613
I like your hat.

238
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,398
Maybe I'll keep it.

239
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,201
- The horses can have the rest of you.
- (laughs)

240
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:52,869
How in hell have we never met?

241
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,073
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.

242
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,327
Where, may I ask, are you headed?

243
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,834
To retrieve something of great value.

244
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,719
You look a little shorthanded.

245
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,338
We got enough men.

246
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:22,182
Seems like you got a couple positions open.

247
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,112
We've got a host making a pretty
big deviation from her loop.

248
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:38,448
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

249
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,418
Dolores.

250
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:44,287
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

251
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,623
The boss is disrupting so many storylines

252
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,959
with his new narrative, it's hard to tell.

253
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,711
Flag her with behavior.
They can pull her today.

254
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,463
Make sure everything's checking out.

255
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:00,604
- (chatter)
- (dog barking)

256
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:03,140
(rooster crows)

257
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,332
Good morning.

258
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,088
It's a lovely town. Is this your home?

259
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,343
Well, where are you from?

260
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,395
Same as you.

261
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,014
Don't you remember?

262
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,849
Man's voice: Remember.

263
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:58,195
(voices whispering)

264
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:02,365
Man: Ma'am?

265
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,704
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

266
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,925
Is that where you belong?

267
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,344
I'm sure your daddy's worried about you.

268
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,379
(bell tolling)

269
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:20,267
(voices whispering)

270
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,979
My father's dead.

271
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:36,983
I'm not going back.

272
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:42,789
What's going on here?

273
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,577
Oh, just helping a lost traveler.

274
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:51,631
She's not lost, she's with me.

275
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,087
My mistake.

276
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,306
- Y'all have a nice morning.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,892
So, we got a lead on Slim.

278
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,178
You can stay here if you want,

279
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:05,929
and I'll just circle back and get you.

280
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,683
No, I think I need to keep going.

281
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,019
Okay.

282
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,084
Apparently, she needs to make certain

283
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,421
this thing they're looking
for is where they think it is.

284
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,207
She said she'd signal if
the information was good.

285
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,294
(horse whinnies)

286
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:43,516
(horse whinnying)

287
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,556
- (grunts)
- (groans)

288
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,308
(gunshot)

289
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,528
Guess that's the signal.

290
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:06,823
(horse whinnies)

291
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,051
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

292
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,386
Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.

293
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,004
I'm glad you found us.

294
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,224
I didn't get a chance to
ask where you're headed.

295
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,428
I don't really know yet.

296
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,682
I guess I figured they kept you in zones

297
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,734
or on paths or...

298
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,523
I used to believe there
was a path for everyone.

299
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,026
Now I think I never asked

300
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,028
where that path was taking me.

301
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,014
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain

302
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,338
in the fall.

303
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:57,457
Sometimes we would lose one along the way,

304
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,376
and I'd worry over it.

305
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,044
My father...

306
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:09,052
My father would tell me...

307
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:13,390
that the steer would find its own way home.

308
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,392
And, often as not, they did.

309
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:21,564
Never occurred to me that we were
bring them back for the slaughter.

310
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:31,574
How are you going to find your way now?

311
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,831
(exhales)

312
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,833
I'm not sure you'll understand.

313
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:47,757
Sometimes I feel...

314
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,678
like something's calling me.

315
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:59,436
Telling me there's a place for me

316
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,604
somewhere beyond all this.

317
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:05,275
Oh, I know that feeling, Dolores.

318
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,277
I know that feeling.

319
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:13,450
But you really don't want
to go back to your old life?

320
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,538
(voices whispering)

321
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,959
(distant clinking)

322
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,854
(muffled chatter)

323
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:43,229
(wheezing)

324
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:49,068
Are you all right?

325
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:53,490
- (gasps)
- Hey, hey.

326
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,074
You all right?

327
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,796
I just got a chill.

328
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,214
That's all.

329
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,166
Let's... let's go back to the fire.

330
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:04,717
You're probably exhausted.

331
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,005
(coyote howling)

332
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,432
- Just talk to him.
- All right.

333
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,905
Uh, excuse me, sir?

334
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,668
I didn't want to intrude,
but I just had to say

335
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,526
that I'm such an admirer of yours.

336
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:32,278
Your foundation literally
saved my sister's...

337
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,581
One more word and I'll cut your throat.

338
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,367
Understand?

339
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:40,036
This is my fucking vacation.

340
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,299
Apparently, whatever they're looking for

341
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:56,302
is in the Ojal prison.

342
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:58,471
These lunatics plan to steal a cannon

343
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:00,723
from the Union cavalry unit.

344
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,225
Blast their way in.

345
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:08,064
I don't have time for
color-by-numbers bullshit.

346
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,738
I'll ride at dawn.

347
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:18,124
I'll go get whatever you
want out of that prison

348
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,793
and bring it back myself.

349
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,295
Suppose you make it out alive.

350
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:23,329
What's your price?

351
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,499
Nothing but a few words.

352
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:28,918
I want the story behind your tattoo.

353
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,921
What's your interest in it?

354
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:36,593
You ever heard of a man named Arnold?

355
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:40,146
You could say he was the
original settler of these parts.

356
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:44,400
He created a world where you
could do anything you want,

357
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,769
except one thing...

358
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,855
you can't die.

359
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,108
Which means no matter how
real this world seems,

360
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:54,661
it's still just a game.

361
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,748
But then Arnold went
and broke his own rule.

362
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:03,620
He died right here in the park.

363
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:07,006
Except I believe he had
one story left to tell.

364
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:13,179
A story with real stakes,

365
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:15,882
real violence.

366
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,636
You could say I'm here to honor his legacy.

367
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:23,473
And I think your tattoo is
the next piece of the puzzle.

368
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:26,976
So, do we have a wager?

369
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,530
You aim to break into a prison

370
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,865
and take out 20 men alone?

371
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,817
Not alone.

372
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,487
I'll take Lawrence here.

373
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,739
And I'll need one match.

374
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,958
One match,

375
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:46,496
one pistol, and one idiot.

376
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:49,048
(chuckles)

377
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,551
I'll take those odds.

378
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,424
Hyah!

379
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,024
You gonna give me the silent
treatment the whole way there?

380
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,161
Lawrence: You should've left
me hanging from those gallows.

381
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,780
At least I could've died in peace

382
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:22,699
without having to hear you yammer.

383
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,033
(chuckles)

384
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:27,704
Aah.

385
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,960
Don't suppose you have a light?

386
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,428
No smoking in here.

387
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,213
Normally, I'm sure,

388
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:39,015
but this is the finest tobacco

389
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,883
a man can enjoy.

390
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:45,188
Hand-rolled on the ample
thighs of exotic women.

391
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:48,274
Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.

392
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,899
(sighs)

393
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,740
Choices, Lawrence.

394
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,242
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

395
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,378
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

396
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:11,914
Because if you did consider your choices,

397
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,466
you'd be confronted with a truth

398
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,585
you could not comprehend...

399
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,889
that no choice you ever
made was your own.

400
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,759
You have always been a prisoner.

401
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:30,983
What if I told you I'm
here to set you free?

402
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:38,941
Hyah!

403
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,613
Whoa.

404
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,375
Let's go!

405
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:01,298
Horse thieves.

406
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:02,465
Damn fools shot up

407
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,600
a couple of pokes
practically in front of us.

408
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:08,137
Well, the only fool I see is the
one standing right in front of me.

409
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:09,793
Deputy, you have there in your custody

410
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:12,642
the most wanted man
in three territories...

411
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:19,315
Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.

412
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,202
Yeah.

413
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,154
Heard you slipped the rope.

414
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,823
Dropped some damn good men in exchange.

415
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:28,268
Man in Black: The way he tells it,

416
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,210
he's more partial to a firing squad.

417
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,830
I reckon we'll be happy to oblige.

418
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:45,341
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

419
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,728
Maybe someday.

420
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:52,348
Lock him up with the other man.

421
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,357
Enjoy the cigars.

422
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:04,410
- Go fuck yourself.
- (laughs)

423
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:09,999
Man: And just who are you supposed to be?

424
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,084
Your salvation.

425
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,042
- Man: Hyah, hyah!
- (horse whinnies)

426
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:21,794
(man yells)

427
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,281
Hector: I don't believe we've ever met.

428
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,901
No, we haven't.

429
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:49,121
You know, you always seemed like a...

430
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,825
a market-tested kind of thing.

431
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:56,996
Big gun, tasteful scar.

432
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,381
Locked in your little cycle

433
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:01,500
like a prized poodle after its own tail.

434
00:31:01,586 --> 00:31:03,920
You sound like a man who's grown tired

435
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,838
of wearing his guts on the inside.

436
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,556
There's no need to get testy.

437
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:12,345
I'm just curious about your worldview.

438
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,847
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?

439
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,148
It's simple.

440
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,684
I believe that only the truly brave

441
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,653
can look at the world and understand

442
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:23,356
that all of it...

443
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,741
gods, men,

444
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:29,195
everything else... will end badly.

445
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,249
No one will be saved.

446
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:35,785
Maybe we've got more in
common than I thought.

447
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,203
What about you?

448
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,839
What turns of fate have brought you here?

449
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,842
It's a long story.

450
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:44,293
And we don't have the time.

451
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:47,129
Got more time than your friend, sadly.

452
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:49,966
It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.

453
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:52,435
Three days. Normally.

454
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,137
I'm afraid I don't have time for that,

455
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,023
so we're leaving now.

456
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,280
I've got a request
for a pyrotechnic effect.

457
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:07,817
Los Diablos, low-yield, two charges.

458
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:11,821
Approved.

459
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,622
Authorizing.

460
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,659
(grunting)

461
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,180
Step lively, Hector.

462
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,697
Any last words?

463
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,532
Get it over with.

464
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:18,220
(gunshots)

465
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:21,607
- (yells out) Yah!
- (gunshots continue)

466
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:23,225
(groans)

467
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:29,815
- (gunshot echoes)
- (groans)

468
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:36,655
Motherfucker.

469
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:47,800
One match.

470
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,086
You're a capable man.

471
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,471
We could do with your
help where we're going.

472
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,756
Afraid not.

473
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,091
We owe you a debt.

474
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,976
No, your friend here

475
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,178
simply owes me a word or two.

476
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:00,179
That'll do.

477
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,431
And a word of advice...

478
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:05,351
that thing you're looking for?

479
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:08,154
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

480
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:27,673
I was seven when they rode into my town.

481
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:30,176
Masked men in devils' horns.

482
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:31,544
They killed everyone...

483
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,630
women, children, even the animals.

484
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:41,604
They gutted my mother
from her jaw to her sex.

485
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,806
I had to paint her warm blood

486
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:45,357
over my skin to make sure

487
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,610
that they would think I was dead.

488
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,111
Every one of them I tracked down,

489
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:52,364
I used their blood to
paint my skin again.

490
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:56,869
Only one man left.

491
00:34:57,905 --> 00:34:59,655
The head of the snake.

492
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,493
What's his name?

493
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:09,665
He has many names.

494
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,835
Most know him as Wyatt.

495
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:22,344
- (chatter)
- (distant dog barking)

496
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,065
- (horse whinnies)
- (bell ringing)

497
00:35:33,524 --> 00:35:35,774
(baby crying)

498
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:15,064
Hey, little girl, what... what is this?

499
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:16,232
What does it mean?

500
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,317
Don't waste your breath, lady.

501
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:21,537
That thing's part of
their so-called religion.

502
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:24,073
Ain't none of them's gonna
tell you nothing about that.

503
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:30,829
- (chatter, laughter)
- (piano playing)

504
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,333
Clementine: It's $5 for an hour,

505
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,303
4 if you bathe first.

506
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:39,672
Well, if we just get the one,

507
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:43,392
do I get a discount for
being second and all?

508
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:46,762
I'm sure we can work something out.

509
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,430
Come on.

510
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:03,078
The tall one, I've seen him before,

511
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:04,863
hanging in the window of the post office.

512
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:06,115
Bandits?

513
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,800
Do you think they're here for something?

514
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,668
I think they're interested
in more than a turn

515
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:11,503
at Franny's backside.

516
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,540
I think he rides with Hector.

517
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,960
Is that the one they say
lives out with the savages?

518
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,300
That's the one.

519
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:35,477
Bernard: Taking off? I just got here.

520
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:37,112
You gave me what I needed.

521
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:41,317
So, is that all I'm good for?

522
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:44,653
- Letting off a little stress?
- ‭Who says I'm stressed?

523
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,822
You have your tells.

524
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,744
Oh, yes, Bernard,

525
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,413
master of observation.

526
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:04,890
Tomorrow I have to talk to Ford.

527
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:08,811
- Why?
- He's creating chaos in the park.

528
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,147
And the board will be
descending at any moment.

529
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,099
I need to buy some time.

530
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:16,485
Some advice?

531
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,855
Best to not show him you're
nervous or defensive.

532
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,358
I have nothing to be defensive about.

533
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:25,244
Then don't cross your arms.

534
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:27,162
It's an ancient instinct.

535
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:30,082
The belly is the most
vulnerable part of every animal.

536
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,336
It's so sexy being compared
to a frightened beast.

537
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:36,372
Ah.

538
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:38,340
There.

539
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:40,876
That's the posture you're looking for.

540
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,385
Sometimes,

541
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,554
despite your best efforts,

542
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,607
you can actually be quite charming.

543
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:02,731
(explosion)

544
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,490
Have the neighbors complained?

545
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:14,576
Safe to say, they're asking questions.

546
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:17,579
The rocks would prefer not to move,

547
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,631
but we shall move them yet.

548
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:25,220
Perhaps I can help you with that.

549
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:26,505
The narrative you're creating

550
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,507
is clearly a massive endeavor.

551
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,726
If you need more time, I'm sure the board

552
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:32,177
would be happy to oblige.

553
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:33,429
I'm sure they'd be happier

554
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:35,814
for me to delay it indefinitely.

555
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:40,436
Come with me.

556
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:42,771
(hosts grunting)

557
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:53,749
You imagine I have gone mad...

558
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:54,834
do you?

559
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:55,919
Lost my way?

560
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,252
We're simply concerned

561
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:00,456
about the extent of the
changes you're making.

562
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,875
We want to protect your legacy.

563
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,460
My legacy?

564
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:08,514
(chuckles)

565
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:13,469
You don't like this place
very much, do you?

566
00:40:13,604 --> 00:40:15,938
I've seen many of you come
and go over the years,

567
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:19,141
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

568
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:21,477
and the ones who don't.

569
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:23,645
I admire it,

570
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,364
the audacity of it.

571
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:28,617
- Oh.
- I've forgotten how beautiful it is.

572
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:31,653
I came here once as a
child with my parents.

573
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,956
I think we even sat at this table.

574
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,075
Or maybe... maybe that one.

575
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,383
When I started working here,

576
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:48,170
I realized this place wasn't
something I would enjoy.

577
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:49,922
Ah.

578
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:56,345
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be

579
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,730
perfectly balanced.

580
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:02,518
Even had a bet with my partner,
Arnold, to that effect.

581
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,436
We made a hundred hopeful storylines.

582
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:07,573
Of course, almost no
one took us up on them.

583
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,825
I lost the bet.

584
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,246
Arnold always held a
somewhat dim view of people.

585
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,198
He preferred the hosts.

586
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,584
He begged me to not let you people in,

587
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:19,918
the moneymen.

588
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:21,119
Delos.

589
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,754
But I told him we'd be fine,

590
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:25,507
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

591
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:29,378
It's not a business venture,
not a theme park,

592
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:32,631
but an entire world.

593
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:34,266
We designed every inch of it.

594
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,388
Every blade of grass.

595
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:49,481
In here, we were gods.

596
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:53,735
And you were merely our guests.

597
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,840
And how did that work out for Arnold?

598
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:19,561
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

599
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:22,180
He went mad.

600
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:24,600
I haven't, as you well know.

601
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:28,437
I have always seen things

602
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:30,606
very clearly.

603
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:39,281
This is the table I sat
at with my parents.

604
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,619
This is the chair I sat in.

605
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:47,589
We know everything about our guests,
don't we?

606
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:50,792
As we know everything
about our employees.

607
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,715
I do hope you will be
careful with Bernard.

608
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:03,021
He has a sensitive disposition.

609
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,976
I beg your pardon, señorita.

610
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:19,237
There have been many
of you over the years,

611
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:21,823
and we have always... almost always

612
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:24,292
found a way to make it work.

613
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:29,381
So, I will ask you nicely,

614
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,333
please...

615
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:33,552
don't get in my way.

616
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,153
The board will agree with me.

617
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,155
They'll be sending a representative.

618
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,773
But they already have.

619
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:56,692
I thought they would've told you.

620
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,413
That won't be necessary, Manu.

621
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,198
Not anymore.

622
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,616
You can join the others.

623
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:11,957
(rumbling)

624
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,552
You can tell the board that my narrative

625
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:25,387
will be completed on time,

626
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,523
and it won't be a retrospective,

627
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:31,309
as I'm sure you have all feared.

628
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:41,787
I'm not the sentimental type.

629
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,407
(booming, squeaking)

630
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,717
Holden says this Slim's
got a whole gang with him,

631
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,836
so I need you to stay here.

632
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,566
If you're outnumbered,
the last thing you need

633
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,806
is somebody standing by.

634
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:02,724
- I can help.
- No, no, no.

635
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,144
Um, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you,

636
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:08,396
but I can't get hurt in
there, but you can.

637
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,432
I would hate to see that happen.

638
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,267
Just stay here.

639
00:45:12,402 --> 00:45:14,820
Okay? Be safe.

640
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:21,526
(distant man shouting)

641
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,616
- Aw. Did you get a good-bye kiss?
- Shut up.

642
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:29,868
Seriously, if you don't
bang her by tomorrow,

643
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:31,036
I'm calling dibs.

644
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:32,287
Holden: Okay, listen up.

645
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:33,892
It's gonna be a bag of nails in there.

646
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:36,374
Slim and his boys got us outnumbered.

647
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,127
On top of that,
there's a family runs this place.

648
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:40,545
Good people.

649
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:42,881
We need to make sure that
snake-hearted son of a bitch

650
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:44,444
- doesn't try to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:46,134
Risk, reward. We got it.

652
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,970
Come on. Let's go fuck these fuckers up.

653
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:53,608
The fuck is that?

654
00:45:53,694 --> 00:45:55,727
- (laughs)
- Huh?

655
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:57,395
- I look like a dog to you?
- No, sir.

656
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,898
- Huh? Huh?
- (men laughing)

657
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:02,484
Feed that to them.

658
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:04,152
(barks)

659
00:46:05,372 --> 00:46:06,822
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

660
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:08,957
- Oh, God!
- (woman screams)

661
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:11,710
- (shouts)
- (laughing) Ho, ho, ho, ho!

662
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:12,829
(yells)

663
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:25,590
(woman screams)

664
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,685
Did I fucking tell you, or what?

665
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:42,357
- (gunshots continue)
- Ah!

666
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,958
(gun clicking)

667
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:05,046
(grunting)

668
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,049
Ooh.

669
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:12,721
Upgrade.

670
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:13,972
Nice.

671
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:18,727
Lawrence: Ain't normally
the type to complain,

672
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,645
but this is just foolhardy.

673
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:22,697
Two men taking on Wyatt.

674
00:47:22,783 --> 00:47:24,583
Man in Black: Keep talking,
and I'm gonna take

675
00:47:24,618 --> 00:47:26,368
the horse back, Lawrence.

676
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,570
Wyatt's freaks just
wiped out the last group

677
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:31,573
that went seeking him out.

678
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:35,126
And here we are riding right after him.

679
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,215
I'm just trying to convince you

680
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,085
not to get yourself and
me as a bystander killed.

681
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:46,471
I'm not gonna get myself killed.

682
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,923
(chuckles)

683
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:50,592
Don't think I didn't
notice that distinction.

684
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,347
(flies buzzing)

685
00:47:55,432 --> 00:47:57,816
(chittering)

686
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:14,616
Looks like Wyatt's men left
somebody behind after all.

687
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,452
(groans)

688
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:18,954
Teddy.

689
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,757
I should've guessed.

690
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:25,844
Please, put me out of my misery.

691
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:28,797
I'm sorry, Teddy.

692
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:32,634
It looks like misery's all you got.

693
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,106
Slim: Let me out of this, God damn it!

694
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,308
Logan: That reward is
dead or alive, right?

695
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:42,394
Holden: Always best to
bring them in alive.

696
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:44,062
Can we at least gag him?

697
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,448
That's a fine idea.

698
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:47,983
Whoa.

699
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:52,737
Slim: Aw, come on.

700
00:48:52,823 --> 00:48:54,517
Look, I... I know you're
in it for the money.

701
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,623
You ain't no real lawman.

702
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:56,958
Shut up, you.

703
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:58,827
Look, my boss, El Lazo,

704
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:00,879
he'll pay you twice
what the marshals will

705
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:03,331
if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.

706
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,500
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey.

707
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:06,813
- (mutters)
- These men won't...

708
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:09,170
- (gunshot)
- (horse whinnies)

709
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:11,890
What the fuck?!

710
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,591
Logan: Relax, man.

711
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:16,144
You have no idea how lucky we just got.

712
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:17,896
Lucky? You just shot an innocent man.

713
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:21,099
No, he's a robot, just like
her and just like Slim here,

714
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:23,852
except that Slim works for El Lazo,

715
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:26,021
and El Lazo is our ticket

716
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:27,856
to the best ride in the park.

717
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:31,826
Your bullshit mission led
us right to an Easter egg.

718
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:34,162
- (grunts)
- (groans)

719
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:35,864
You're not going to let him go.

720
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,700
Well, well. Look at you.

721
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,535
You're starting to grow on me, farm girl.

722
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,037
Now, out of the way.

723
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:45,040
- Oh.
- Don't you dare.

724
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,841
(laughing) See?

725
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,009
This is gonna be fun!

726
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:49,461
Now we're each gonna have one.

727
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:51,546
I won't fuck mine either.

728
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:52,847
You're disgusting.

729
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:54,215
Just an acquired taste.

730
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:56,217
You're gonna grow to love me, I promise.

731
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:00,805
Come on. Hmm?

732
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,275
Come on.

733
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:07,028
Go black hat with me.

734
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:09,731
Come on, you got to,
you know, save the girl.

735
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:11,066
Now give me a little something.

736
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,283
What is your problem?

737
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,402
The second we get away
from the real world,

738
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:15,608
you turn into an evil prick.

739
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,455
Evil? (chuckles)

740
00:50:17,574 --> 00:50:19,541
It's a fucking game, Billy!

741
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:22,744
- Don't call me Billy!
- Are you still trying to impress her?

742
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,549
Because I guarantee
she does not give a shit

743
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,797
about how you play this game.

744
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:26,965
Do you, Dolores?

745
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,394
What's he talking about, William?

746
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,585
She will be just fine

747
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,637
with a trip down the dark side.

748
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:34,589
And so will you.

749
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:39,511
Trust me.

750
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:50,105
So, which way to Pariah?

751
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,108
Oh, you just let me take it from here.

752
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,532
All right, time for the floor show.

753
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:03,118
Got some guests riding
with Hector this time.

754
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:26,107
Stubbs: Let's give them
something to shoot at.

755
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:29,527
Retask a few of those soldiers.

756
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:31,166
Deputy: If you're riding into our town

757
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:32,947
under the company of armed men,

758
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:35,533
you'll need to state your business.

759
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:37,652
Mayhem.

760
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:40,822
(people screaming)

761
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:04,679
(gunshots)

762
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:22,030
Well, hello there.

763
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:23,498
I want to talk.

764
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,251
Interesting way of
starting a conversation.

765
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:29,871
Oh, it's an interesting kind of day.

766
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:38,963
(sighs)

767
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:41,549
Now, my lovely friend,

768
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:44,385
what deal is it you want to make?

769
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:47,105
You're here for what's in the safe.

770
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:48,389
Now, how would you know that?

771
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:50,608
I can always tell when
a man wants something

772
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:52,777
that's not on the menu.

773
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:56,030
I'll give you the combination

774
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:58,199
in exchange for some answers.

775
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,235
You assume I have any answers.

776
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:04,155
This world is madness.

777
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:06,541
(chuckling)

778
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:08,993
I want to know about this.

779
00:53:10,914 --> 00:53:12,747
I've got a couple families
in the homestead

780
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:13,952
who changed their itinerary.

781
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,667
They're headed into town.

782
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:17,585
Should be there in 20 minutes or so.

783
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:19,470
The place is a bloodbath.

784
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:20,888
Fine.

785
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,140
Cut these guys off.

786
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,509
Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.

787
00:53:32,602 --> 00:53:34,769
- (rifle clicking)
- Oh, shit.

788
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:39,023
We'll give them a night in lockup,

789
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:40,720
then have one of the
girls at the Mariposa

790
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,527
bring them a key hiddenin
their breakfast.

791
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:45,830
If the guests are squared
away, let's wrap it up.

792
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:47,498
This is a shade.

793
00:53:47,617 --> 00:53:49,334
(match strikes)

794
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:51,753
Sacred native lore.

795
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,172
They make figures of them.

796
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:57,625
60.

797
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:07,685
And what does the shade do?

798
00:54:08,772 --> 00:54:09,971
You've seen this?

799
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:11,939
What is it?

800
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:14,392
The man who walks between worlds.

801
00:54:14,477 --> 00:54:18,529
They were sent from hell
to oversee our world.

802
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,150
47.

803
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:38,883
Is this the last thing you required of me?

804
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:40,501
'Cause we need a little more time

805
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:42,086
than the constabulary will allow.

806
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:44,305
Sweetheart, if I took that
manner of interest in you,

807
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:47,225
you'd have no say in how
long we'd need whatsoever.

808
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:55,650
I thought I was crazy,

809
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:57,268
but I got shot...

810
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:00,021
here.

811
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,774
There's no wound.

812
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:05,159
No, but I was shot.

813
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:07,278
And this was standing over me.

814
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:09,864
And then it was as if it never happened.

815
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:14,202
I want you to cut me right there.

816
00:55:31,104 --> 00:55:34,639
I'm not in the habit of
cutting into defenseless women.

817
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,357
Some big, bad outlaw.

818
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:39,644
The Dreamwalker said there
were some who could see them.

819
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:44,365
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

820
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:47,235
To see the masters who pull your strings.

821
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,565
They don't know what
they're talking about.

822
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,590
(gunshot echoes)

823
00:55:56,162 --> 00:55:59,497
(coughing)

824
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:04,752
You'd rather die lying down or...

825
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:06,587
up on your feet?

826
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:09,257
Go to hell.

827
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:26,941
- (knife pierces)
- (screams, grunts)

828
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:29,444
- (knife clatters)
- Go on, then.

829
00:56:30,947 --> 00:56:32,413
This would be the first goddamn time

830
00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:35,283
I've had to ask a man to
put his hands on me twice.

831
00:56:40,623 --> 00:56:43,090
- (groans, screaming)
- (flesh squelches)

832
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:46,461
(screaming continues)

833
00:56:59,058 --> 00:57:00,475
(pounding on door)

834
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,529
Sheriff: Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire.

835
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:07,148
What does it mean?

836
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,783
That I'm not crazy after all.

837
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:11,118
- Sheriff: Last chance, Escaton!
- (pounding)

838
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:12,653
Come out or we're shooting!

839
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:14,822
(guns cocking)

840
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,826
And that none of this matters.

841
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:26,501
(gunshots)

842
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:34,457
