6
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,235
The war game is over.

7
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,836
Who are you? Where are you from?

8
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,874
No, it is only a misunderstanding.

9
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,873
What has happened?

10
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,397
He stole my pocket watch.

11
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,875
And he stole my gold ring.

12
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,157
No, there must be a misunderstanding.

13
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,470
Take him back.

14
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,189
Start dancing.

15
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,876
Come on.

16
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,749
Let's have a smile.

17
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,869
Stop him, quick.

18
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,871
I'm going to be rich.

19
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,878
Ching Fong Tin, forgive my action.

20
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,075
I did that so you won't escape again.

21
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,880
You have a thick layer of fat.
You won't freeze to death.

22
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,880
Polar bears
don't freeze to death, do they?

23
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:34,916
Polar bears do starve to death though.

24
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,995
- Have some coffee.
- Thank you.

25
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,565
Loi Fook, take the bag of money
to buy a piece of land.

26
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,875
Release me now and then arrest me later.
It makes no difference.

27
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,033
My main weakness in life
is that I value justice and honesty.

28
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,119
The money is the evidence
to guarantee you a life sentence.

29
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,871
Ching Fong Tin?

30
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,875
Ching Fong Tin?

31
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,158
Ching Fong Tin?

32
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,549
Let me go! Let me go!

33
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,235
Let me go right now or we will both die.
This is very dangerous.

34
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,885
I won't let go!

35
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,036
We are both going to die!

36
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,794
Ching Fong Tin,
I will catch you one day. You watch out!

37
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,678
Listen up, wait for me at the riverbed.

38
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm going to Shanghai to catch the train.
Hijack it when it arrives at the riverbed.

39
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:18,358
We coordinate from the inside
and attack from the outside.

40
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,075
- Remember, avoid monkey business.
- Yes.

41
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,230
You lot come with me,
and you go with them.

42
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,911
Let's go!

43
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,276
Brother Jen,
I hope we didn't come all this way

44
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,115
to watch your brother
playing with the model train.

45
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Shi Yu, please explain
your plan in detail to the brothers.

46
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,878
I need a simple way to explain it. You
might not understand complex details.

47
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,880
We've led a rough life since youth,
pretentious words mean nothing to us.

48
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,845
I am grateful that
brother Jen has found good people

49
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,872
like you from such a class to help out.
I don't have to worry now.

50
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,478
What do you mean? We have always been
honest and open to brother Jen.

51
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,914
- How dare you distrust us?
- Not at all. I was just a bit worried earlier.

52
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,352
Now that I know you all are so outspoken,
my worries were unfounded.

53
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,757
Shi Yu, just get to the point, can you?

54
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
A train will be arriving at Chengdu,
from Shanghai, in 20 days.

55
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,077
Everyone on it is either wealthy
or of high status.

56
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,876
Most importantly, there is
a Japanese ambassador, Yukio Fushiki.

57
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,830
He will be carrying a map
of Qin Emperor's Terracotta Army.

58
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Yukio Fushiki is pretending
to be sightseeing in Chengdu.

59
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,836
His real aim is to smuggle
the map to Guangzhou.

60
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,880
He'll bring the map back to Japan
through Hong Kong.

61
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,030
Once we get the map,
we'll give it to Shi Yu.

62
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,845
We don't ask
what he's going to do with it.

63
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,078
The reward is that you will get
100,000 dollars once you finish the job.

64
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,845
100,000 dollars!

65
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,156
Correct. You will also get
all the valuables of the passengers.

66
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,845
Tell us your plan immediately!

67
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,872
I'll go to Shanghai with you
and catch that train.

68
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,871
Your brothers,
who are waiting under the bridge...

69
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,074
Train robbery attracts the attention
of the police and guards quickly.

70
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,880
Don't worry. There is not a living soul
within a ten-mile radius of the bridge.

71
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:28,873
11 or 12 miles
before approaching the bridge,

72
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,205
there is a small town called Han Shui.

73
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,870
However it is poor and isolated,
it will not create any threat to us.

74
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,873
If robbing a train
will turn us into millionaires,

75
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,080
I won't care if we are chased
by the government army.

76
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,832
Good. Let's make it a deal.

77
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,431
About 350 miles to the west is a town
with magnificent scenery and great talent.

78
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,031
Can you walk slower?

79
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,874
Take your sisters and come with me
to make your living there.

80
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,354
Whatever you say.

81
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,914
I miss you. Do you know that?

82
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,549
You have lost a lot of weight.

83
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,278
You will be rich
after working there for a year or so.

84
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,913
You can even go straight and get married.

85
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,310
I can't wait that long.
I want to get married now...

86
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,549
Calm down.

87
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,005
Calm down!

88
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,871
Someone is watching.

89
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,156
Never mind me, go ahead.

90
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,436
Haven't you seen this before,
you nosy man?

91
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,354
To be honest,
I really haven't seen it before.

92
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,845
I am sorry. We are finishing off,
not warming up.

93
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,873
No need to be so polite.
It is at your discretion after all.

94
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,633
I didn't intend to pay anyway
so don't worry about it.

95
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,075
I'm going home to sleep now.

96
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,871
Stand there, Ching Fong Tin.

97
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
What do you want?
Me to owe you for the rest of my life?

98
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:04,954
What do you owe me?

99
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,993
The kindness of loving.

100
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,114
You just saved five of us.
At least let me offer myself to you.

101
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,193
You are not a man if you
wouldn't accept such a simple thing.

102
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,990
Let me tell you this, I've slept
with every woman I know except you...

103
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,365
and my mother.

104
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,868
Let me keep this dream alive.

105
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,235
I assume you are sincere.

106
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,085
Do I have to wait for you until I am 60?

107
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,953
Am I happy to have head lice
and make out with old ladies?

108
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,315
Go home and get some sleep.

109
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,875
HAN SHUI TOWN

110
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,870
Clear sky and windy, as usual.

111
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
Chief, they are all set and ready.

112
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,720
An order from you to light up a match
and the big fire starts.

113
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:10,473
The firemen are all fast asleep,

114
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,110
so who will put the fire out?

115
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,034
No need to care about that.
We just need to "set" advantage and rob.

116
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,918
It is "take" advantage and rob.

117
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,232
When everyone is trying to put out the fire,
we'll take advantage and get rich.

118
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,755
I will decide when a good time is.

119
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,230
Chief, we are all ready.

120
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,005
What do you mean?

121
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,508
You told us to start a fire.
We are all ready.

122
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,189
To start a fire?

123
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,397
I am the one and only
security chief of this town.

124
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,870
Would I ever
ask anyone to start a fire here?

125
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,952
Chief, Madam Qi is deaf.

126
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
There are no other people around
for you to worry about.

127
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,434
She really is deaf?

128
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,989
Ask her about it.

129
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,515
Madam Qi, I am talking to you.
Can you hear me?

130
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,593
Nothing. I can't hear a word.

131
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
So, be more careful next time.

132
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,670
- What are you doing?
- There is a fire!

133
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,600
Don't be bothered by it.
Let's mind our own business.

134
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,591
The fire is big. Look!

135
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,109
I only care if it spreads here.
Go back to work.

136
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,116
Fire! Fire!

137
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,870
Fire. Come and put it out quickly.

138
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,918
Fire! Fire!

139
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,399
Let's go!

140
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,677
Get out of the way!
Be quick!

141
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,637
Wild Bull, go and find the source.

142
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,228
Sand bucket team,
put the fire out from the left.

143
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,238
Duvet team, rescue people from the right.

144
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,868
- Where is the ladder?
- We took it to catch sparrows last night.

145
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,758
- Find it immediately!
- Yes.

146
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,233
Help! Help! Help!

147
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,755
Prepare the emergency net.

148
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,510
Jump down quickly!

149
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,669
Jump down.

150
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,876
- I am scared!
- Jump down.

151
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,519
Get the stretcher.

152
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,031
Don't worry, I'll get you out of here!

153
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,069
The fire is too big.

154
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,151
Then use the rope.

155
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,075
Catch it.

156
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,268
Siu Lan, you'd have closed your eyes
if you were afraid.

157
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,352
It would make no difference
if I closed them or not.

158
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,525
Get ready!

159
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,313
One, two, three.

160
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,198
- Siu Lan, are you alright?
- I am fine.

161
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,351
Put out the fire quickly.

162
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,155
Get changed and start our operation.

163
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,472
What are you doing?

164
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,870
Covering my face
so no one can recognize me.

165
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,271
Shut up and go!

166
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,879
We'll be rich, very rich!

167
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,400
Things are set and now
you just have to be smart.

168
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:10,879
Grab as many valuables as you can.

169
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,668
Go now!

170
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,953
What are you doing?

171
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,845
- What do you want?
- Don't move!

172
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,519
- True, what do we want by the way?
- Wait for Big Brother to give the order.

173
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,913
Big Brother, come in.
We have taken control of the situation.

174
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,788
- You are having bad luck.
- What do you want?

175
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,245
Too much. I want your mum
to call me her son-in-law,

176
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,953
I want to sleep with your older sister
and have a baby with your younger one.

177
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,709
But I only want to rob the bank right now.
Get on with it.

178
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,875
Siu Hou! Ka Lok!

179
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,917
- What is it?
- Help pump the water!

180
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,793
Quickly, quickly.

181
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,873
Robbery! Robbery!

182
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,279
Come quickly.

183
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,805
Be quick! Be quick!

184
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,913
- Let me help you.
- I can easily stride over, you dumb fool.

185
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,791
- Where are the horses?
- They are all gone!

186
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,313
- What should we do?
- We'd better go too.

187
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,348
Catch them. Don't let them go!

188
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,791
- The security team?
- Why are you so surprised?

189
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,725
I agree.
Chief did it, why couldn't we?

190
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,718
- What should we do?
- Lock them up. Deal with the fire first.

191
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,555
It is as dusty as the Silk Road here.

192
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,836
Didn't you say we were catching the train?

193
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,757
I didn't say that.
I said "jumping on" the train.

194
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,633
We will jump on the train
and go to Chengdu to make a living.

195
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,518
- Are things ready?
- Yes.

196
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,845
Be ready for it but be calm,
the train won't arrive for a while.

197
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,635
- The train doesn't stop here.
- That doesn't mean we can't jump on it.

198
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,590
He is ridiculous.

199
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,709
Mayor, say something,
something that will inspire people.

200
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,992
Like what? It will only be a lie anyway.

201
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,478
There'll be a riot soon
if you don't say something.

202
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,032
Dear brothers
and senior members of the town,

203
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,072
what happened today is a tragedy.

204
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,670
The money that everyone earned
by working hard is all gone.

205
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,951
Your dreams are all destroyed.

206
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,600
The hope of arresting Jook Bo to get
your money back is nearly non-existent.

207
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,669
Han Shui Town has little to offer now.

208
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,159
This is not a place to build a future.
There has to be somewhere else to go.

209
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,117
I hope everyone stays calm
in this disheartening situation,

210
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,870
and goes their own way,
searching for their own path.

211
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,390
Finished.

212
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,189
What's wrong with you?
Those words were discouraging.

213
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,154
I just want to be honest.

214
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,708
Let me say something.

215
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,791
Be quiet, be quiet!

216
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,952
Being our security chief,
Jook Bo should have set us an example.

217
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,519
He is now our enemy.

218
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,874
Yes.

219
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,958
The money Jook Bo took
was earned through our hard labor.

220
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,156
- The money is ours!
- Yes.

221
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,433
We have to defeat our enemy
and get back our money.

222
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,874
Yes.

223
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,668
The problem is we need people
who are not afraid of losing their lives

224
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,871
to participate in this mission.

225
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,097
Who do you think we should ask?

226
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,235
- Mayor, who shall it be?
- You!

227
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,685
OK.

228
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,473
- From now on he is the one in charge.
- Good, good.

229
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,515
My dear,

230
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,638
I'm worried I may get a headache,
traveling for over ten days on the train.

231
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,676
- Headache?
- Yes.

232
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,831
Don't worry,
I will get you some dried prunes.

233
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,671
Be careful. This is Shanghai,
not a rural small town. Act appropriately.

234
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,229
- Don't attract attention.
- OK.

235
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,075
Miss, can I buy
a packet of dried prunes please?

236
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,630
- Of course.
- Thank you.

237
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,870
See you on the train later.

238
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,792
Buy some tangerines.

239
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,074
Miss, I want a tangerine.

240
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,757
- You...
- No need to thank me.

241
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,991
Dear, here come the dried prunes.

242
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,311
What is wrong with you?
I'll get thirsty with so many of them.

243
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,669
Thirsty?

244
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,876
Of course you will.
I will buy you some tangerines.

245
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,910
- I need to buy some tangerines.
- There aren't any more.

246
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,874
Forget it. Here is your ticket.
I'll visit you when there is a chance.

247
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,116
Han!

248
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,989
- Dear, there are no tangerines left.
- Don't worry. Let's go over there.

249
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,313
- What a lovely coincidence, Master Wong.
- Of course, Master Sek.

250
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,635
You are just very lucky.

251
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,872
Fei Hung, greet Master Sek.

252
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,871
Master Sek.

253
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,191
Kin, greet Master Wong.

254
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,110
Master Wong.

255
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,874
Your dear son has grown so much.

256
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,276
What an intelligent lad he has become.

257
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,872
- Father, he has an evil look.
- Shut up.

258
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,111
Sorry, Master Sek, my son has always
been so unscrupulously honest.

259
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,039
Kin, give them a smile.

260
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,917
- Are you keeping well?
- Thanks to the good fortune you brought.

261
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,917
"Stealing peaches"?

262
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,199
- Fei Hung!
- Father.

263
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,112
- Suppress your anger.
- Yes.

264
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,113
- <i>Your attention please, the train... </i>
- Kin, don't be impolite.

265
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,236
- Yes, father.
- <i>... minutes will be leaving. </i>

266
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,198
- <i>All passengers, please board the train. </i>
- Master Sek, after you.

267
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,839
- Master Wong, after you.
- In that case, we will go first.

268
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,269
Silly boy, a monkey steals peaches
like this, not like that.

269
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,877
- Remember this from now on.
- I will, Father.

270
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,711
Where have you been? Get on now.

271
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,235
Let me tell you this,
I want a seat, and a bed to sleep on.

272
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,038
Fine, fine, just get on the train.

273
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,873
- Give me the ticket?
- No need. Just get on.

274
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,874
Chief Inspector, do we really
have to search every compartment?

275
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,999
Of course, this is our job.

276
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,953
Chief Inspector, Shanghai City.
I am conducting a routine search.

277
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,877
You can't carry weapons
unnecessarily on the train!

278
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,753
Did you hear me?

279
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,878
If it's useful, then it's a different matter.

280
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,880
Thanks for your cooperation.

281
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,360
Why has the train started?

282
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:47,874
Excuse me! Excuse me!

283
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
Excuse what, I'm the train chief.

284
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:51,950
Why has the train started?

285
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,880
Of course it has.
Why else would people get on it?

286
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,472
I don't care. I have to get off.

287
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,805
- You want to get off?
- Yes.

288
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,876
I am the Chief Investigator of Shanghai
City. I have many cases to solve.

289
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,395
Let me get off immediately.

290
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,358
You couldn't get off,
even if you were the Emperor.

291
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,397
Then I will book you
for interfering with police duty.

292
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,152
You must get off then.

293
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,916
- I don't care how you do it, I must get off.
- Fine.

294
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,195
Get off then.

295
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,325
What's wrong with
Jook Bo and his people,

296
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,875
their underpants
were considered a public expense?

297
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,473
- Are you done?
- Yes, we are.

298
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,875
Then let's go.

299
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,479
- Curry, you are on night watch.
- Again?

300
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,845
There's nothing to do
except feed the mosquitoes.

301
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,030
That means you have been skiving
every night to catch sparrows?

302
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,277
This is a small town
with everything in sight.

303
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,192
No one from out of town
will bother to come here.

304
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,157
Well, there might be ghosts.

305
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,436
Don't let me see you skiving
or your wage will be deducted.

306
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,510
Yes.

307
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,519
Wild Bull, watch the town gate.
Ga Lok, patrol the streets.

308
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,235
Chief, it is unbearably windy
at the town gate.

309
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,994
And the streets are full of dust.

310
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,873
- How about swapping duty?
- Good...

311
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,600
- It was your fault.
- It was you who screwed things up...

312
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:04,273
Chief, what should I do?

313
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,393
- Pack up things at the fire station.
- Sure.

314
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,029
Big sister,

315
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,431
this is what you called "a town of
magnificent scenery and great talent"?

316
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,880
Whether the scenery is magnificent
or not is a matter of opinion.

317
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:04,872
But this is definitely
a place of great talent,

318
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,949
otherwise it wouldn't have produced
someone as talented as Tin.

319
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,953
Love is blind, didn't I say so?

320
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,676
Watch your mouth and your behavior.

321
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,270
From now on, pretend that you're
from good and prestigious families.

322
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,271
Where is Siu Chui?

323
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,711
Don't play around or they may be
able to tell you are a lady of the street.

324
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,678
- Come on, get in, get in.
- Let's get in then.

325
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,231
Anyone in here?

326
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,870
Is there anyone in here?

327
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,158
- It is so dusty...
- Very dirty...

328
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,436
- How can anyone live here?
- Clean it and it will be fine.

329
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,238
- Do you want a room?
- Five rooms, please.

330
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,595
- Sure. Please come with me.
- Follow him upstairs.

331
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,870
- Tin!
- Go upstairs.

332
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,475
Uncle, I was going to look for you.

333
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,071
Why have you come back here?

334
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,674
You didn't even come back
for your mother's funeral.

335
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,716
Do you know how much the town folks
had to suffer because of what you did?

336
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,870
I promised Mother a triumphant return.

337
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,754
I assume this is the emperor's gown?

338
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,353
Let me through.

339
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,194
- Chief.
- This is Ching Fong Tin?

340
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,999
No, he is just my friend.

341
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,355
No. I am Ching Fong Tin.

342
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,925
Were you the one who blew up the dam?

343
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,520
I just wanted the town folks
to have more water to use.

344
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,757
- What happened afterwards?
- They had no water to use.

345
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,109
You are not welcome here.
Please leave immediately.

346
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,197
This is my home town.
Where else can I go?

347
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,669
I don't care. Leave immediately!

348
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,711
Chief, I heard that he is very good.

349
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,200
It would be an embarrassment for you
if you lost to him.

350
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:06,760
Go now. They won't forgive you.

351
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,269
Chief, let's not make it a big issue.

352
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,645
No!

353
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,750
He should be punished
for what he has done!

354
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,277
Slap, slap.
Now I have punished you. Let's go.

355
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,280
I have taught you a lesson for now.
Watch yourself or I'll arrest you.

356
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:29,191
- Let's go!
- Let us through.

357
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,559
Don't play with fire.

358
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,031
Don't do that.
You'll hurt yourself and others.

359
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,989
What are you doing here?

360
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,596
Do you really believe
that things will get better after my return?

361
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,069
Yes, I always believe you.

362
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,871
- Help her to get up.
- Yes.

363
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,598
Chief, chief.

364
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,474
Ching Fong Tin bought all the shops,
including butcher shops, hotels...

365
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,872
You have said them all.

366
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
What is the fat boy trying to do?

367
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,845
- Cancel the shift system.
- Are we on holiday?

368
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,112
In your dreams. From now on,
everyone has to work all shifts.

369
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,315
That's impossible.

370
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,110
Siu Hou, follow Ching Fong Tin day
and night. Don't let him out of your sight.

371
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,599
Yes.

372
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,632
He must be plotting something.

373
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,789
Wealthy people and their money
will be passing here so be prepared.

374
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,272
Remember, it is quality over quantity.

375
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,874
It is better to rob a bank
then to rob ten grocery stores.

376
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,118
Chief Tsao, can I help you?

377
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,360
As the security chief,
I am just doing my routine inspection.

378
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,157
- Please come in.
- All right.

379
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,839
Chief Tsao.

380
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,791
- Chief Tsao.
- Chief Tsao.

381
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,470
- Why don't you get a chair for the chief?
- Yes.

382
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,759
Let me.

383
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,231
Chief Tsao, please sit down.

384
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,278
Chi, come back over here.

385
00:36:46,313 --> 00:36:48,677
I would like to but I can't.

386
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,640
Chief Tsao is leaning on
my hand with his muscular back.

387
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,278
- I am sorry.
- Thank you.

388
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,356
I don't understand why you ladies
came all the way to this poor town?

389
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,718
Obviously, we would like to broaden
our knowledge by traveling here.

390
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,845
Chief Tsao, even though we are women,
times have changed

391
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,952
and we must broaden our knowledge
to serve society in future.

392
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,754
- What a great aspiration.
- Not me.

393
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,400
I'd like to get married to a good man
and be a good wife and a good mother.

394
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,868
- I bet you do.
- What did you mean by that?

395
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,430
Sorry to have bothered you.
I am going now.

396
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,953
- Bye.
- Come by when you have time.

397
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,270
Everything is arranged now.
The big customers are coming soon.

398
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,877
From now on, wear more make-up and
perfume. Prepare for future business.

399
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,350
- You bring all these girls to...
- Doing business is not a crime...

400
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,389
- One occupation is as good as another.
- Yes. After all, we run a beauty salon.

401
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,519
That's a prestigious business.
Isn't that right, Chief Tsao?

402
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,591
True.

403
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,870
Chi, keep him occupied
so that he doesn't have time to bother me.

404
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,868
I'll make sure
that he even has to find time to breathe.

405
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,515
Be careful,
I treasure my status of lady.

406
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,874
Chief Tsao.

407
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,630
Tsao Cheuk Kin!

408
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,637
Tsao Cheuk Kin, I haven't seen you
for 15 years and you haven't changed.

409
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,994
Miss, when have I ever met you?

410
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,875
I didn't say that.
I just said I hadn't seen you for 15 years.

411
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,359
15 years?

412
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,469
You don't remember this.
We met in a dream 15 years ago.

413
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,876
We were holding hands
and strolling in the rain.

414
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,390
It was so romantic.
Unfortunately it was in a dream.

415
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,273
You remembered we met in a dream
for all these years?

416
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,845
Miss, are you all right?

417
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,917
Yes. Only my heart may not be.

418
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,991
Miss, I think you have a high fever.

419
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,354
Not really. I just have a fever for you.

420
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,595
- I am in love with you...
- Stop there...

421
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,877
I am busy
and I shall leave you to your dreams.

422
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,996
Don't go away!

423
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,756
By the way, no one
would believe you if you were crazy.

424
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,640
But if you were just after lust,
I assume I have satisfied you.

425
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,108
But I am sorry
if you wanted to become rich.

426
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,870
Working for the government,
I'm only paid peanuts.

427
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,956
Give me a kiss.

428
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,758
Truly after lust.

429
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,877
I'll rape you, you bitch.

430
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,831
What did he just say?
Who understands English? Tell me.

431
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,075
He said the Chinese are sons of bitches.

432
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,710
Chief ordered us not to get into trouble.
Give me some face.

433
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,068
No way, he insulted the Chinese.

434
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,599
Insults are made
to those who deserve them.

435
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,725
We clearly saw all that happened.

436
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,878
We are brothers and we shouldn't fight
each other over small disputes.

437
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,998
He was right to do this
but he was a bit rude.

438
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,912
He will be punished for that.

439
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,796
Be more polite next time.

440
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,873
Go back to where you were working.
Don't ever start any fights again.

441
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,791
Master Sek,
no need to lose your temper.

442
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,074
Of course, of course.

443
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,879
- Fei Hong, suppress your anger.
- Yes.

444
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,280
- Fei Hong.
- It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

445
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,874
Little boys aren't that strong.

446
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,913
It's shameful to kick
when you're wearing leather shoes!

447
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,845
An eye for an eye.

448
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,792
Gentlemen,
food will be ready at the canteen soon.

449
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,231
- How many more tunnels will there be?
- No more, no more.

450
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,193
If there were,
I would have changed into a short tunic.

451
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,990
How can you panic
at such a crucial moment?

452
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,845
How can I trust you?
You are not even as good as a horse.

453
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,792
What about you? You rode me instead
of a horse. I got so many injuries.

454
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,031
I didn't want to injure my horse.
It'll be useful when the train arrives.

455
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,235
Stupid!

456
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,356
Then pray that the horse doesn't panic.

457
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,880
The horse won't collapse like I did when
you fell, so you'd roll under the train,

458
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:09,832
would be cut into pieces,
your eyeballs gauged out,

459
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:12,750
your limbs dismembered
and your head chopped off.

460
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,711
Your ears cut off
and your nose ripped off. Your brain...

461
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,872
Shut up!
Spit out all the bad luck and say it again!

462
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,080
Big brother,
why are you polishing rusty metal?

463
00:44:42,115 --> 00:44:44,355
It's not the rusty metal, it's a magnet.

464
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,869
What is it for?

465
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,880
So that I don't have to worry
if the horse panics or whatever.

466
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:52,872
I'll definitely be able
to get on the Chengdu train.

467
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,878
Are you done yet?

468
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,151
- Yes.
- Hard work?

469
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,991
Let me see.

470
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,151
Give them all to me.

471
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,751
- Are you done yet?
- Yes.

472
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,231
Ready?

473
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,845
I thought only opposites attract.

474
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,560
- I think only one person can use them.
- You are right. You are definitely right.

475
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:50,314
- How have I been treating you?
- Good, like a real younger brother.

476
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,869
You will give them up
for the younger brother?

477
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,838
Are you crazy? The younger brother
should always respect the older one.

478
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,839
Shut up and stop arguing.
It could damage our good kinship.

479
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,350
- Good view up here.
- Yes, it is quite beautiful up here.

480
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,110
For how long can you follow me?

481
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,432
How clever of you to uncover
my expert shadowing technique.

482
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,875
I am now going to vanish immediately.

483
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,350
Chief!

484
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,160
I had been following him very closely...

485
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:27,151
- You let him off.
- Yes.

486
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,559
You fat boy!

487
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,996
I will catch you sooner or later.

488
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,795
Ching Fong Tin, I have always known
you are up to no good.

489
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,509
Do you not know how many lives will
be at risk if you blow up the track?

490
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
Do you know how many people
live in Han Shui Town?

491
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,005
I want the train to stop here

492
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,634
so all passengers from the Millionaires'
Express stay in Han Shui town,

493
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,037
and stay in our hotels,
buy our products and the food we make.

494
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,480
And spend money on hookers.

495
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,205
The money is not for me. The money
stays here when there is a profit.

496
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,472
The town folks would rather starve
to death than promote a hooker business.

497
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,076
Tsao Cheuk Kin, this is my only
chance to pay the town back.

498
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,549
Don't even think about stopping me.

499
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,830
Come on.

500
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,192
You want to escape?

501
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,515
Come on!

502
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,274
We'll be arriving at the riverbed soon.
Everyone go and get ready.

503
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,069
Check how many passengers
there are on the train.

504
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,435
Walk on the roof.
Stop the train when you get to the front.

505
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,794
Yes.

506
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,673
Hold, hold, hold...

507
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,797
Hold, hold...

508
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,519
Han, why are you holding?

509
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,525
Hold...

510
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,757
Use the toilet if you are desperate.
There is no need to hold it.

511
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,871
Of course. I didn't think of that.

512
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,195
Han.

513
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,477
- How are you?
- I am fine. And you?

514
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,868
I am fine.

515
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,150
- But I have to leave now.
- So soon?

516
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,914
It's stolen love, after all.
I am leaving now.

517
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,595
- I'll be back soon.
- Be careful.

518
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,671
See you later.

519
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,871
Feeling much better?

520
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,793
- Why are you making that sound?
- I couldn't go before.

521
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,948
- I think I can go now.
- Then go to the toilet right now.

522
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,395
- Remember not to get so close to me.
- Fine.

523
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,671
It is coming!

524
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,513
Ride, ride. Get away from me.
I told you not to get that close to me.

525
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,749
Don't worry, I'm not magnetic.

526
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,553
You're still putting me off.
Go away.

527
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,871
My feet are caught.

528
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,797
Help!

529
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,874
Help!

530
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,715
Help!

531
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,478
Help! Help!

532
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,871
Help!

533
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,555
- Someone is here.
- Don't worry, he might not see us.

534
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,836
And even if he did,
he might not know what we want to do.

535
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,671
You two, what are you doing?

536
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,155
See, he really doesn't know
what we are doing.

537
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,114
- We are just taking a stroll.
- Taking a stroll?

538
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,155
Be calm. He might not have
seen that we are handcuffed.

539
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,788
Even if he has,
he won't know what we want to do.

540
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,916
Go somewhere else to break the chain.

541
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,877
Damn, he knows.

542
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,196
So what? He might not understand why.
Go further away.

543
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,632
Move over here.

544
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,115
Move back over there.

545
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,869
Lie down straight.

546
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,673
Excuse me, something doesn't seem right.

547
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,835
- What is it?
- There are two rail tracks here.

548
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,870
How do we know
which one the train will come on?

549
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,674
Stupid, left is for coming
and right is for going.

550
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,955
So is the train coming or going?

551
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,873
- It could be either.
- Of course.

552
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,758
Excuse me, excuse me.

553
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,870
On second thoughts, let's stay on the
same side so we'll be in the same boat.

554
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,718
- As you wish.
- Good.

555
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,037
BEWARE OF TRAINS

556
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,231
- It is getting very loud.
- Put some stones in your ears.

557
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,950
Why the hell has the train stopped?

558
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,991
What has happened?

559
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,869
Help! Fat lady, come
and help me down please, quickly.

560
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,275
You are the fat one.

561
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,868
My dear?

562
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,755
I am here, my dear.

563
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,872
- What are you doing there?
- I am coming.

564
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,845
You said you were going to the toilet.

565
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,749
The toilet stinks
so I went over there instead, you know.

566
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,875
Help! Help!

567
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,878
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

568
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,871
Get up!

569
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,352
Chief, they escaped from the prison.
What shall we do to them?

570
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,870
Catch them too.

571
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,075
Welcome to Han Shui Town,

572
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,714
a place of magnificent scenery
and great talent.

573
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,074
Despite being held up on your journey,

574
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,152
the town folks have already
prepared food, accommodation

575
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,039
and entertainment for you all
so that you can relax and enjoy.

576
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,758
Please come with me.

577
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,919
- Shall we go with him?
- We might as well.

578
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,753
Please come with me.

579
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,396
It is very near. Please come with me.

580
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,235
Watch them and I'll catch him.

581
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,270
What shall we do now?

582
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,159
Send someone to the riverbed
and bring the brothers here.

583
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,878
We will carry out the plan
in Han Shui Town.

584
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,871
Wai, you go.

585
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,155
Get someone to watch the Japanese.

586
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,880
Get on the train and watch them.

587
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,320
He is trouble. He always gets in the way.

588
01:01:51,355 --> 01:01:53,231
I'll get rid of him.

589
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,471
Since when have you become
so heartless?

590
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,231
A woman will do whatever she can
to ensure her happiness.

591
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,845
Everyone has a room but me.

592
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,078
Don't worry. I will sort that out.
Drink some tea first. Come on.

593
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,871
Where is it?

594
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,515
Sir, where is room five?

595
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,950
- Room five.
- Room five?

596
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,394
Probably at the other side.

597
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,471
- Thank you.
- Han.

598
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,845
- Who was that? You know her?
- Not really.

599
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,394
- She asked me where room five was.
- Idiot. Come this way.

600
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,873
Yes.

601
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,550
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

602
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,916
Getting rid of the mosquitoes.

603
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,395
Go back to the room.

604
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,845
I have found out
the Japanese are staying in room seven.

605
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,395
Room five is next to room seven,
which is occupied by a single female.

606
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,270
It'd be easy to spy on the Japanese
if we could swap rooms with her.

607
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,078
Let me deal with it.

608
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,920
- What is your plan?
- Rape first, murder later.

609
01:03:09,955 --> 01:03:11,876
I thought that was your plan.

610
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,308
This is not our territory. Hold back
until the brothers from the riverbed arrive.

611
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,877
Kung, go and check out the town.

612
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,356
Kung, you will only see into the distance
if you stand on top of the roof.

613
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,356
My dear, I want to have a bath.

614
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,351
Let's have it together.

615
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,845
Come on, let's play in the water together.

616
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,737
- Together?
- We used to do that all the time.

617
01:03:47,772 --> 01:03:50,595
My dear, have a look.
The bath tub is that big...

618
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,594
As big as me.
You are growing bigger everyday.

619
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,997
The tub will not expand to fit both of us.

620
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,909
OK, stop whinging.
I'll let you have it first.

621
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,035
Hi!

622
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,591
Who are you...

623
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,911
The smoke really works.

624
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,316
Get her into the bathroom.

625
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,311
Get him into the bed.

626
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,677
How are things?

627
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,159
- What are the Japanese saying?
- Do you understand Japanese?

628
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,551
- No. What about you?
- Nor can I.

629
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,016
Anybody in there?
Just checking the room.

630
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:19,713
- Quickly, quickly
- Anyone in there?

631
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,440
Come in. There's no one in here.

632
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,872
- Do you usually steal things?
- Only love.

633
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,953
I haven't slept in a bed
for a whole week.

634
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,438
- Have a bath first.
- Do you really have to be that hygienic?

635
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,236
Did you fall out of the bed?

636
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,514
Another one?

637
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,511
Come out.

638
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,951
Come out.

639
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,594
My jacket has caught on something.

640
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,751
Lai, I am coming in.

641
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,512
Quick, hide!

642
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,433
Leave me alone.

643
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,672
Are you angry that it took me so long?
It was difficult to get out.

644
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,319
Come on, don't be angry with me.

645
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,672
- Be quiet.
- How dare you do this behind my back!

646
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,360
I will kill the vixen first
then I will my husband.

647
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,748
My dear, calm down.

648
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,552
I caught you having an affair
and you give me no explanation.

649
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,393
- You bitch!
- My dear.

650
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,750
- Stop shaking her.
- Mind your own business.

651
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,836
- How dare you?
- Han.

652
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,714
Shut up!

653
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,877
We cannot lie to her anymore.

654
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,111
You are right.

655
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,190
Are you all right?

656
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,876
Our country is important,
but so are our families.

657
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:07,715
We sacrifice ourselves
only to protect thousands of families.

658
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,875
Han, what do you mean?

659
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,836
My dear, I am a special agent
from the Central Office, 002.

660
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,525
Han, you are a special agent?

661
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,758
Correct. Do you remember
we saw the Japanese on the train?

662
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,845
I do, I do.

663
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,352
They are smuggling our national secrets
out. Me and 003 came here to stop them.

664
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,110
Dear, don't do it. It is extremely
dangerous for two people to stop them.

665
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:43,796
Dear, don't worry.
We also have 004 and 005.

666
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,392
And also 006, 007 and 008,
who will all join in to help in the mission.

667
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,477
- I am 006.
- And I am 007.

668
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,314
008...

669
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,833
- 009.
- 0010.

670
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,872
- 0011.
- 0012.

671
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,845
0013.

672
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,189
Reporting to 002.

673
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,560
He was the one
who used the smoke on me.

674
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,551
0013 had no choice.

675
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,279
Everyone, get back to their rooms.

676
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,238
- Let's forget about the whole thing.
- Yes sir. Let's go.

677
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,073
I've checked the situation outside.

678
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,118
0014 never releases national secrets.

679
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,236
- Go now.
- Who's 0014?

680
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,310
Go now.

681
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,876
You might as well save energy
and keep warm, Jook Bo.

682
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,439
I know what you are like.

683
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,878
Chief, it is so chaotic out there
and we cannot catch Ching Fong Tin.

684
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,880
Let me deal with him.
I will definitely catch him.

685
01:09:39,915 --> 01:09:40,869
- Go out and patrol.
- Yes.

686
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:41,877
- Let's go.
- Yes.

687
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,553
Curry, watch them.

688
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,151
Who the hell is Ching Fong Tin?
Why don't you let me help you?

689
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,880
Shut up. I will catch him
so you will have company.

690
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,475
Ching Fong Tin, do you know it is a crime
to kill a security chief?

691
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,874
Who are you?

692
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:09,228
Do you know you get life imprisonment
if you injure a government agent?

693
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,871
Do you know what this is?

694
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,325
- No.
- No? It's is an international license.

695
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,319
- But you know about this one, right?
- Interpol, CIA.

696
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,432
I'm glad you can read.

697
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,880
I came to arrest Ching Fong Tin.

698
01:10:26,915 --> 01:10:28,871
- So I am.
- Not anymore.

699
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,445
You have to assist me.

700
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,711
Ching Fong Tin is resourceful and tricky.
It is hard to catch him.

701
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,845
Don't be so pessimistic.

702
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,510
Let's cooperate. Ching Fong Tin
is good at hiding behind peoples' backs.

703
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,474
Expose yourself to him.

704
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,674
And I will catch him afterwards.

705
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,876
Isn't my role a bit passive?

706
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,436
That suits your talent and intelligence.

707
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,716
Let's go. That's an order.

708
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,871
- Brother Tin.
- Try hard.

709
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,636
That is a bit too stupid.

710
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,635
I'll go see what Tsao Cheuk Kin is up to.

711
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,713
- Long time no see.
- Don't move...

712
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,871
or you will get a hole in your head.

713
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,511
Make sure it's locked.

714
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,845
Is it real?

715
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,872
- Should I try it out on you?
- That's not necessary.

716
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,753
I was the security chief for ten years
and I only ever used knives.

717
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,509
I have never seen a firearm before.
Can I take it and have a look?

718
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,871
Thank you.

719
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,838
Shoot him, it was him who taught me.
He deserves it.

720
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:21,797
This has nothing to do with us.
We are only morons.

721
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,916
So am I.

722
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,915
I want my mum.

723
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,072
I want to go home, I want my mum...

724
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,031
Get more people to watch them.
They are tricksters.

725
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,718
Commander,
we only have a few guards altogether.

726
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,075
- It is also chaotic out there.
- You and I will deal with it.

727
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,358
I am going to gather more evidence of
the crimes committed by Ching Fong Tin.

728
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,556
That will put him away
for at least 200 years.

729
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,869
200 years?

730
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,714
You will be a fossil by then.

731
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,953
- What do you want?
- Our big sister has something to say.

732
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,880
- Ladies, what can we do for you?
- What would you like?

733
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:25,791
Tell them, big sister.

734
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,714
Yes, sister. These gentlemen are
officers and they must be reasonable.

735
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,845
Please tell us.

736
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,996
- I...
- Let me tell them.

737
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,869
Sir, my big sister was betrothed
to Ching Fong Tin when she was born.

738
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,878
There were so many difficulties,
and they rarely managed to get together.

739
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,469
And now that Ching is in prison,
who knows if he'll ever come out again.

740
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,553
So big sister wants to go to him
in the hope she will bear him a boy

741
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,792
and produce an heir for the Ching family.

742
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,560
It sounds ridiculous but there really
isn't a choice. It has to be done.

743
01:13:58,595 --> 01:14:00,516
I hope you gentlemen will let her do this.

744
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,873
What a joke. In any event, we don't have
the authority to release Ching Fong Tin.

745
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,549
We are not asking you to release him.
Just to let big sister into his cell.

746
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,868
There are many eyes watching in the cell.

747
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,840
Please. Maybe you can order
the other prisoners to face the walls?

748
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:16,877
As for you officers,
you can always turn a blind eye.

749
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:20,789
Ladies, we are not logs.
To watch them being together we may...

750
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,873
Get too happy? That's why
we will all accompany big sister.

751
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,196
To accompany her
and to be your company.

752
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,870
- What do you think?
- I have an open mind.

753
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,673
Well, we really should
allow an heir to be produced.

754
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,750
Follow me.

755
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,631
Tin.

756
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,836
- Siu Hon.
- My dear Tin.

757
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,632
No need to be so subdued.

758
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,712
Ching Fong Tin, work hard on this
and score in the first round.

759
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,234
- I can't work this out.
- No, you are making out, with her.

760
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,513
Stop watching!

761
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,756
Everybody face the walls.

762
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,071
Leave immediately.

763
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,918
Not you.

764
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,037
- Big sister, you should leave too.
- OK. I'll leave.

765
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,805
Siu Hon, I have no choice. I have to leave.

766
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,958
I am not changing my mind.
I am coming with you this time.

767
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,670
It is better to be separated
then to be fugitives together.

768
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,273
There is a chance of reunion
if we are separated.

769
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,560
Think about it. If we are separated
for another three years,

770
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:54,553
we will be so excited
when we see each other again.

771
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,878
Ching Fong Tin,
fate always seems to separate us.

772
01:16:00,913 --> 01:16:04,997
Fate is God's will,
but people can change their path.

773
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,112
Maybe this is a chance
to once again test fate

774
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,716
so you'll know if we belong together.

775
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,713
I hope you will think of me
whenever you see this.

776
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,991
Take good care.

777
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,989
Goodbye.

778
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,845
Big sister.

779
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,270
You are quite a character after all. Get in.

780
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,359
Why come back?

781
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,845
How could you let this happen?

782
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,872
You let a few girls save Ching Fong Tin.
What should we do now?

783
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,872
It will take a long time to get him back.

784
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,149
You go that way.

785
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,030
Follow me.

786
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,956
Sir, do you need a room?

787
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,479
Surrender the map of the Terracotta Army.

788
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,913
Don't discuss it.

789
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,876
Don't move, this is a robbery.

790
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,279
Give me all your money.

791
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,199
Don't move.

792
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,440
<i>Ask yourself this. Are you asking</i>
<i>someone to wait for you her whole life?</i>

793
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,752
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>
<i>The God of Romance?</i>

794
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,873
<i>What more do you want when you have a</i>
<i>devoted woman hanging around for you?</i>

795
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,356
<i>You can't hesitate for too long. </i>

796
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,873
<i>What shall I do?</i>

797
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,845
<i>What to do?</i>
<i>Go back for her and love her. </i>

798
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,871
<i>It makes more sense to love her</i>
<i>when she is in love with you</i>

799
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,880
<i>than to beg for her love</i>
<i>when she has already given up. </i>

800
01:19:06,915 --> 01:19:08,472
<i>Less effort is needed. </i>

801
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,876
<i>There really is no reason</i>
<i>to make more effort than is necessary. </i>

802
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,875
Hey, fat Tin.

803
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,871
Heaven, heaven...

804
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,078
Shut up. Stop.

805
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,519
Tsao Cheuk Kin.

806
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,551
- Use the saw.
- They will hear us.

807
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,552
That's the intention.

808
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,233
Do it now.

809
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,275
- Attract their attention.
- OK.

810
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,871
Officer. They're sawing the gate
and trying to escape.

811
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,594
- You want to escape?
- So what?

812
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,400
- Give me the saw.
- No way.

813
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,311
- Have a go.
- Yes.

814
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,633
Don't do that. Give me the saw.

815
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,000
- Give me the saw immediately.
- I don't have it.

816
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:44,594
- Come in and help me.
- Go and help out.

817
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,872
- Here it is.
- Give it to me immediately.

818
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,359
I don't have it.

819
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,154
- Give it to me.
- I don't have it.

820
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,872
Ching Fong Tin.

821
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,318
Do it quickly.
Are you really such a moron?

822
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,599
Come quickly.

823
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,349
- Why did you...
- Because of you.

824
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,040
It is chaotic out there.
There must be over 100 mountain thieves.

825
01:21:32,075 --> 01:21:33,553
They took all the hotel guests.

826
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,639
So we have to work as a team
to save Han Shui town.

827
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,270
- Allow me to command.
- So who is in charge for this town?

828
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,995
Him.

829
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,965
Right, it is you.

830
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,877
You, bring your team
to save the travelers.

831
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,991
You go with him. And you work with
those two to lure the thieves into the trap.

832
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,835
As for you, you should leave here
and go as far away as you can.

833
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:58,511
Don't worry. I am not
arresting you now and I will help you.

834
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,871
Come on.

835
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,191
What about us?

836
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,350
Take them to hide somewhere safe
and don't get in the way.

837
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,554
What is that?

838
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,393
You are lucky. It was meant to be
used against you. Let's go.

839
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,320
We will show them that
women can protect themselves.

840
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,998
We are free, we are free...

841
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,192
Freedom, freedom. We are free now.

842
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,515
- Freedom, freedom. We are all free...
- Catch them immediately.

843
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,470
Stop right there!

844
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,832
Get down.

845
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,951
Load the gun.

846
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,555
Damn, the barrel has overheated.
Do you have any water?

847
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,870
Water?
Yes.

848
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,993
They are running out of bullets.

849
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,309
Charge, charge.

850
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,515
Come on, shoot them.

851
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,672
- Have you got any more?
- I don't think I have nephritis!

852
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,632
So what are we waiting for?

853
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,799
Be quiet. Untie them.

854
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,872
Leave quickly now. Quickly.

855
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,030
Be quick.

856
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,392
Go that way. Be quick.

857
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,071
- We must get the map back.
- Yes.

858
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,595
- Get them.
- Yes.

859
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,678
- He looks tough.
- Then let's fight him together.

860
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,029
- Very tough.
- Let's go.

861
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:54,909
Give me the map.

862
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,871
Catch them.

863
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,514
Chase them.

864
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:55,835
Harder.

865
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,831
Still want to escape? You little bastards.

866
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,875
Attack him.

867
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,873
We'll crush you to death,
we'll crush you to death.

868
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,871
- What next?
- Push him out.

869
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,675
We'll crush you to death,
we'll crush you to death.

870
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,875
Why have you become a thief, killed
people and burnt down their homes?

871
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,713
Don't do it ever again.

872
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,598
Yes, OK? Forget it.

873
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,836
We are on the same side.

874
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,869
Are you all right?

875
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,872
Are you all right?

876
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,873
- Fine.
- Let's go.

877
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,845
- You can't take the map with you.
- What?

878
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,997
- That map belongs to the Chinese people.
- What?

879
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,876
- So you can't take it away with you.
- What?

880
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:39,273
The map belongs to the Chinese so
you can't take it away. It must stay here.

881
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,718
Give it back.

882
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,713
- Are you giving it to me?
- "Are you giving it to me?"

883
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,871
Yes or no?

884
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,275
Haven't you got hold of it?
Why are you asking him?

885
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,000
If he didn't want me take it and I took it,
I am just a thief.

886
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,917
- Are you going to give it up?
- Yes, are you?

887
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,876
Let's leave.

888
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,958
What did you ask him to give you?
Why didn't he want to?

889
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,112
This is the map of the Terracotta Army.
Please give it back to the government.

890
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,912
I'm going to be rich!

891
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,045
Ching Fong Tin, I was meant to arrest you.

892
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,310
Since you have rendered a great service
to the nation, I'll let you go.

893
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,791
I am leaving now.

894
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,470
There are less people in this town now.

895
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,845
Don't worry, we can start making some.

896
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,314
Yes, she goes with you
and I keep these four.

897
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,268
You don't have a chance.

898
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,991
- How about us?
- No.

899
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,237
It's lonely watching the train
leaving on the never-ending rail tracks

900
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:30,875
How many turns do you have
to make on the dusty journey?

901
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:37,405
Quietly watching the train
vanishing into the darkness

902
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,276
Only the night, a shadow
and the long sighs are left behind

903
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,874
Perhaps you are trying to escape
from yesterday's burdens

904
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:56,275
or maybe
he is looking for a better tomorrow

905
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:03,000
Tired eyes are yearning for
the unknown future

906
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:09,349
The journey may be never-ending,
a lifetime spent exploring it

907
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,235
The unending journey, mountain valleys,
the sharp wind and stone-cold rail tracks

908
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,874
The tearful farewell erased happy
memories, it was disheartening

909
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:27,875
When will we meet again?

910
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:33,879
So that we will hold hands
and talk and kiss away the tears

911
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,875
Station after station,
they all seem familiar

912
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:50,235
Yet untold tears were shed
when each train departed

913
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:56,556
Did men build the railway to reduce
the distance between one another?

914
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,870
Or did they build it to prolong the swelling
sentiments of each departure?

915
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:09,234
The unending journey, mountain valleys,
the sharp wind and stone-cold rail tracks.

916
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,870
The tearful farewell erased
happy memories, it was disheartening

917
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:22,114
When will we meet again?

918
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,396
So that we will hold hands
and talk and kiss away the tears

919
01:37:37,397 --> 01:37:40,197
