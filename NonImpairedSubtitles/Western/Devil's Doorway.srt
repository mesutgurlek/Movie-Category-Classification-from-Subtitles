1
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,386
- Yes, Sir. What will it be?
- Is your beer cold?

2
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:55,629
- Lance... Lance Poole!
- How are you, Bob.

3
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,695
I heard that the rebels
had you for breakfast.

4
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,229
Zeke!

5
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,391
Look who's here.

6
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,998
- I'm glad to see you, boy.
- Same to me, Zeke.

7
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:11,271
- Look like cows and chewing.
- Well, I came making 1,800 miles.

8
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,762
Let's get to welcoming you.

9
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:22,192
I bought that trick for $ 10
from a guitar player in Cheyenne.

10
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:25,095
It defies all laws of engineering.

11
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,761
With the teeth.

12
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:37,465
It looks like you did good in the army, huh?
You got a Medal, stripes. Are you a Sergeant?

13
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:40,738
- Sergeant Major.
- When I was in the army...

14
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:46,301
The regular army. We were 
particular who wore th0se stripes.

15
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:51,689
- Lance, which way did you come back?
- The Overland trail.

16
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,981
- Did you see the UP railroad? - Yes,
every 75 miles east of Fort Carney.

17
00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:00,695
That railroad is gonna make
a lot of changes, Lance.

18
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,555
I can remember when your dad and 
I trapped Wind River country.

19
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:07,945
A man could walk a week and 
never see a living human.

20
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:11,340
Just them mountains, big...

21
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:16,700
Yeah, it's all getting crowded.

22
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:20,139
Well, I'm gonna get rolling.
I am anxious to see the old man.

23
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:25,349
- If I guess he's on his way in now.
- How could he know Lance has come back?

24
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,957
The wind maybe, but he'll know.

25
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,275
Thanks, Bob. See you, Zeke.

26
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:36,687
- A fine boy. He'll do all right.
- Will he?

27
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,912
Why not?

28
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:43,549
He never left his father alone, why
should they treat him any different?

29
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,081
Did you notice how sour the haircut?

30
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:50,911
You can always smell them.

31
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,173
- Zeke, who is that fellow?
- He's a lawyer.

32
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:08,898
The name is Coolan. He's now here
for his health. He has lung fever.

33
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,436
Look who's coming!

34
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,915
Hello, Father!

35
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,509
Is my father forgotten 
the language of the white man?

36
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:39,469
I use it little.

37
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,519
- Your health?
- Good.

38
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,278
We will go home.

39
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,946
Goodbye, Zeke.

40
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:47,518
- Gee, it's pretty.
- Sweet Meadows.

41
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:49,963
Here you belong.

42
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,340
It's gonna be all right.

43
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,438
You must be Jimmy!

44
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:41,318
- I am seven. - Well, you're gonna 
make us a good foreman someday.

45
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,211
- Have you been seeing a doctor?
- No.

46
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,828
Then you don't know 
what is wrong with you.

47
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,050
In the winter the leaves falls from 
the tree. No medicine can stop it.

48
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,012
Your business is driving cattle.
Let the doctor decide.

49
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,307
My blood grows cold, soon I will die.

50
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,145
I couldn't kill you with an ax. As soon as 
you getting better, we're gonna work together.

51
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,774
I got a saddlebag full of dreams 
I made around the campfires at war...

52
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,526
...when the night was quiet.

53
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,727
I'll let the valley 
soak in the sunlight.

54
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:31,327
Nurse it, pet it, until Sweet Meadows is a ranch 
where we can live and all our kids after us.

55
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:36,957
It will be ours Father. 
Warm, plenty to eat, nothing but peace.

56
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,585
To any man who comes along which 
has run out of luck we'll say:

57
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,255
Grab a chair and eat with us.
Stay until you ready to leave.

58
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,968
No men red nor Whites will ever 
be turned away from our door.

59
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,679
The war has changed you.

60
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:55,226
It changed the whole country.
Men didn't die for nothing.

61
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:59,401
Those who left want to get
along peaceful. Like me.

62
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:03,525
- We lost our taste for fighting.
- May you find your peace.

63
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,153
Why should anyone bother me now?

64
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,490
You're tired, Father.
It's time for you to go to bed.

65
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,284
I'll get a doctor here tomorrow
to look you over.

66
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,121
Do you think the white doctor 
cares if I live or die?

67
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,957
I think so, yes.

68
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:25,089
The whites outnumber us, father.
All wars are over. Even yours.

69
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:30,302
The country is growing up. They gave me
these stripes without testing my blood.

70
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:35,808
I led a squad of whites, slept in the 
same blankets and ate from the same pan.

71
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,979
Held their heads when they died.
Why should it be any different now?

72
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,066
You are home.
You are again an Indian.

73
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,374
Broken Lance.

74
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,797
There are scales on the arise
so that you are blind.

75
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,008
The truth will tear you.

76
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:14,346
- What is the truth?
- Our people are doomed.

77
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:19,268
- The white man knows great hate for us.
- The doctor will come.

78
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,772
You think you can live with the white man.

79
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:27,651
There's only one way. Be strong.

80
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:32,114
- Land, flocks of cattle...
- Don't tire yourself now.

81
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:37,161
Drop my body into the deep shaft.

82
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:43,417
Then you must keep 
this earth always,

83
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,128
...for I am part of it.

84
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,840
An Indian without land loses his soul.

85
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,510
His heart veins.

86
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,891
Sweet Meadows, our mother... the earth.

87
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:45,271
- 15, 2, 15, 4 and a run of 3
- I got 15 without a 15.

88
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,193
- Dr. MacQuillan?
- I'm here.

89
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,779
Could you come, right way?
My father is very sick.

90
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,489
Is that so?

91
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,201
I sent one of my men. 
I guess you didn't understand.

92
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:07,710
- Please, hurry doc. Tell me where your
horse is. I'll get him saddled. - Nine.

93
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:11,755
- 15-2. - 23. - 31...
I got patients here in town.

94
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:19,847
- But I'm afraid my father is dying. - It wouldn't 
be right for me to leave my patients in town for...

95
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:25,185
- Do you know you're disturbing 
the game? 14. - 20.

96
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:31,734
- You're not coming? Why don't you dig
up the Shoshone medicine man? - 30.

97
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,988
You're coming with me! Hurry!

98
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,674
That man is dead.
May I go now?

99
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:46,183
You didn't tell me how much 
I owe you, doctor.

100
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,269
Nothing. Nothing at all.

101
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,442
I send you my father, to 
the land of the great mystery.

102
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,906
And you ride with him on the north wind.

103
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:16,240
- Good day, sir!- Where are you heading? 
- I'm looking for grazing land for my sheep.

104
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:22,423
- There on that way is but my land. 
- But Mr. Coolan said... - It belongs to me.

105
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,489
VERNE COOLAN
Attorney At Law

106
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,174
The sheep must belong to that man 
there. But they got to have land.

107
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:07,509
Somebody else's land.

108
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,987
Sorry I crowded up
your beasts, cowboy.

109
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:32,201
I didn't mean to push you on up the 
sidewalk, but this is cattle country.

110
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,760
- Hello, Zeke!
- Howdy, son!

111
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:57,309
- Hey, pretty. - It's not my idea.
Governor Campbell persuaded me.

112
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:02,773
- Somebody got to be Marshall. - Fine.
- How did you do? - $36 a head.

113
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,193
- What are you gonna do with all 
that money? - Just put in the bank.

114
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,863
Did you ever deposit 
$ 18,000 in the bank?

115
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,657
Every week.

116
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:17,413
You put down the check, the man looks 
if it is good, looks at you...

117
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:21,834
And all of a sudden he respects you.
That is what $ 18,000 will do.

118
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:28,173
- Lance, I wanna talk to you.
- Shoot.

119
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:33,929
No one is gladder than me what you've 
done so good in the past five years.

120
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,432
- People are starting to talk.
- Go ahead.

121
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,467
It ain't no use in grubbing it in.

122
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,720
Am I not one of the 
leading citizens?

123
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:48,193
Wyoming is now part of the United States.
There is a different kind of people here.

124
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:52,615
Shop keepers, railroad men...
They are not used to...

125
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,159
Rich Indians?

126
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,207
Lance, you know what I'm trying to say.
Watch yourself.

127
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:09,381
- Alright, Marshall, I'll buy you a drink.
Shot of moose milk. - No thanks, it's too early.

128
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:15,387
- Come on! - You don't want to drink.
- Come on! It will do you good.

129
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,936
- Hello. Bob!
- Hello, boys!

130
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,231
Reach down under the bar
and bring up my friend.

131
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,237
What's the matter? 
Has the well gone dry?

132
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,109
No liquor allowed for Indians!

133
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:44,166
- How did it get there?  
- I put it there. Territorial law.

134
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,255
That's your job, Zeke.

135
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:53,092
Civilization is a great thing.

136
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,346
- The law no says I can't buy you
a drink, Lance. - No, thanks Bob.

137
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:05,177
- How about you, Red Rock? - I'd choke. 
- We take soda water. - Huh?

138
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:10,818
- There's no law against an Indian
drinking water, is there? - Sure.

139
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,619
Speaking of law, Mike, an 
interesting situation has developed

140
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:20,369
with the formation of the Territory and 
the opening of the Regional Office in Wyoming.

141
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:24,999
All this land around here is
open to homesteading.

142
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,335
- A real interesting development.
- Yes, yes.

143
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:35,175
It's of particularly interest to sheep men, Nebraska 
and Kansas. The ranch has been burning up there.

144
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:41,285
So I thought it only fair to pass the word
there is plenty of feed and water right here.

145
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:46,885
On land that's open for homesteading.
They should be headed this way now.

146
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:52,401
- I've been thinking on a piece of land myself.
- You have never seen Sweet Meadows, have you?

147
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:55,529
- No.
- It's like the laugh of a beautiful woman.

148
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,660
You ride through the Devil's Doorway, 
and the wind is cold.

149
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,862
And then you see Sweet Meadows.

150
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:09,919
Somehow the sky is a deeper shade
of blue and the grass is greener.

151
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:19,428
It's a dream all men have
when they ache for home.

152
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:24,475
That's where I'm gonna file.
On Sweet Meadows.

153
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:33,234
- Is that alright with you, Indian?
- Now, I don't want any trouble in here.

154
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:37,488
You're quite an 
Indian-lover, ain't you?

155
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:43,942
Mr. Coolan, there is only one 
solution to the Indian problem.

156
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:50,734
You don't think it's right for an Indian 
to control 20,000 acres of the best land?

157
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:57,675
No, I don't even think it's right for an Indian
to stand at the same bar with a white man.

158
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,434
You'd better back up 
a little from the bar.

159
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,607
I think you better stand 
back a little more.

160
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:22,575
You let them in saloon and the first thing 
you know they wanna mix with them socially.

161
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:26,954
- Five.
- It's a nice head of hair, redskin.

162
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,833
It'll be good hanging from my belt.

163
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,754
Six.

164
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,690
You're a sick man, Mr. Coolan!

165
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,466
That's enough.

166
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,518
Give me that drink.

167
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,066
Have one on me!

168
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:45,593
What about this homesteading?

169
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:49,847
- We better find out about it.
- How?

170
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,567
See a lawyer.

171
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,954
Coolan is the only lawyer.

172
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,841
There must be another one someplace.

173
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,863
You bring the horses.

174
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,778
A. MASTERS
ATTORNEY AT LAW

175
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,969
Come in!

176
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,978
How do you do?

177
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:44,193
- I'm looking for Masters, ma'am.
- I am Masters.

178
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,445
Lawyer?

179
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,572
Yes.

180
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:51,575
Excuse me, ma'am.

181
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,387
Come in.

182
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:22,314
I don't blame you for being surprised. Most 
people are discovering A. Masters is a women.

183
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,191
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,857
Is there anything I can do for you?

185
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:31,832
My name is Broken Lance.
I am an Indian!

186
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,912
I see.

187
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,086
Please sit down.

188
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:55,045
- I wanna find out about home settling. 
- I read the law. What is it you want to know?

189
00:25:55,097 --> 00:26:00,978
- If I haven't got titled to my land, other 
people can homestead without demanding me? - Yes.

190
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,859
Can I homestead my own land? Make the 
law work for me instead of against me?

191
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:11,363
- That's what most people are doing.
- That's what I want to do.

192
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,826
- Will you take care it for me?
- Yes.

193
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,288
The first thing to do is 
to prepare a statement.

194
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:25,336
- That's a bad cut.
- Yes, ma'am.

195
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:28,380
What do we say in this statement?

196
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:35,638
- You're over 21. Are you head of the family? 
- No, ma'am.

197
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,226
- Not married. Are you a veteran?
- Three years.

198
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:46,023
- Organization?
- The third Pennsylvania. Cavalry.

199
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,111
Major battles?

200
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:57,004
Mechanicsville, Antietam, Gettysburg.

201
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,454
You've had your share.

202
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:05,084
- Any decorations?
- Congressional Medal of Honor.

203
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:12,007
You shouldn't have any trouble.

204
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:16,136
- Has your land be surveyed?
- No, ma'am.

205
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,810
That's the first thing. Since you can homestead only 
65 ha. you want to file the land the house is on...

206
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:25,312
And on a big water hole.

207
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:30,609
It costs $ 10 to file a claim.

208
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,407
- How much for you?
- There's not much to this.

209
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:40,578
- Let's say $ 10.
- When will I know about this?

210
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:47,877
It will take a little time. I'll send a surveyor 
out as soon as possible. - Thank you, ma'am.

211
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,004
Thank you.

212
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:57,261
Wait a minute.
I'll get some water to stop that bleeding.

213
00:27:57,313 --> 00:27:59,889
No, thanks, ma'am. It will stop.

214
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:08,929
Mother, what do you think of
my first client?

215
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,391
I think you're crazy.

216
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,214
- I see that I don't need to tell you about
our confidential discussion. - No, I heard all.

217
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:22,853
I can't think of a better way of driving away
business than to take the case of an Indian!

218
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:27,374
You're probably right.
I thought about it.

219
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:31,702
Well for Heaven's sake, why did 
you do it?! We got to be practical!

220
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:37,368
Father was the best lawyer I ever knew.
I always think how he'd handle the situation.

221
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,647
Well, he wouldn't... Your father...

222
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,925
Oh yes, he would have too.

223
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,718
He'd reach in his drawer, 
pulled out a bottle,

224
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:53,776
poured a couple of drinks and said: 
Alright, son. What's your trouble?

225
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:59,563
I think he would have been 
interested in Broken Lance.

226
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:06,163
Well, if we don't eat regular, I guess
losing a few pounds wouldn't emaciate me.

227
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:23,055
- Mother, take that gun back!
- Orri, we're in Wyoming.

228
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:26,882
We're going 50 miles from 
nowhere to an Indian camp.

229
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:32,314
- I don't know what might happen, 
neither do you. - This is ridiculous!

230
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:38,571
If you'll give that Indian Lance Poole the 
news, he might blow up like a powder cake.

231
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:40,698
Go ahead!

232
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,067
It helps when somebody groans for you. 
I wouldn't have finished otherwise.

233
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:59,544
Well, we're homesteaded.

234
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:10,227
- Hello! 
- Are these your men? - Yes.

235
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:16,901
- They're just curious. How are you, 
Miss Masters?  - I'm not sure.

236
00:30:26,035 --> 00:30:29,663
- Do you like to sit on the porch?
- Yes, thank you.

237
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:35,284
- My, this is a beautiful valley.
Is it all yours? - Yes, ma'am.

238
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:39,811
- How big is it?
- It's a circle, 10 miles in diameter.

239
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,095
It's a great deal of land.

240
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:46,019
- Not for 5,000 cattle.
- You have that many? - No.

241
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:48,188
But I will have.

242
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,937
Thank you.

243
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:04,723
I heard from the Land Office.
I'm afraid I have bad news.

244
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:08,994
Your homestead application 
has bee turned down.

245
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:14,299
As an Indian, you don't qualify
under the terms of the Act.

246
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:16,007
Why not?

247
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,917
Well, you see... It wasn't...

248
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,799
- The law...
- Yes?

249
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:28,430
Under the law, you're not cast
as an American citizen.

250
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,726
What am I?

251
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:36,105
You're a ward of the Government.

252
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:44,238
So that's it.

253
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,621
I'm sorry, Mr. Poole.

254
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:58,127
I have got an idea. 
If you got some men, white men...

255
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:04,133
And they'll homestead on my land, 
and afterwards I can buy it back from them.

256
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:06,427
I'm afraid we can't do that.

257
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:10,517
- We can't?
- No, you see that's against the law.

258
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:17,938
I know how you must feel, but
there was nothing I could do.

259
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,014
It's the law and we have 
to obey it.

260
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,207
- I see your point.
- Do you?

261
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:27,488
- Oh, I hope so.
- Sure.

262
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:33,277
I envy you, ma'am, for being a lawyer.

263
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:39,370
You got a faith, something to go by.
Like a religion. With you is the law.

264
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:43,130
My father wanted me to study law.

265
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:45,925
- It means a great deal to me.
- Yes, it must.

266
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:52,680
I've always wanted something like that.
Something to tell me what is right or wrong.

267
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:56,852
- I'm glad you feel the way you do. - Because 
then you don't have to bother about conscience.

268
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:03,692
It's written out. No matter what 
it does to people. It is the law.

269
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,780
Changing the law is something 
you don't have to worry about.

270
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:14,954
- You probably want to go now. I'll ride with you. 
- That won't be necessary! - We are armed.

271
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:21,418
I'll take you to the other side. I wouldn't 
want anything to happen to you on my property.

272
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,768
Don't touch him!

273
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:43,491
- But he needs help!
- He has to make it to the house alone.

274
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,405
Come on, boy! On your feet!

275
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,041
- Aren't you gonna help him?
- I can't.

276
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,087
Just a little more, Jimmy. 
Come on, Jimmy!

277
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,718
Come on, boy.

278
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,284
That was close.

279
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:41,186
You probably want to know 
what it is about.

280
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:45,044
Every Shoshone boy has to go 
through that, it's a test.

281
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:47,786
Before a boy turns into a man,

282
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:51,460
- the tribe wants to know if he's an adult.
- What does he have to do?

283
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,534
He's given a knife.

284
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:58,590
Nothing else. No food, no water.

285
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:05,022
He has to go up in the mountains above the 
snow line, bring back the claws of an eagle.

286
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,983
He has three days to do it in.

287
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:15,306
He has to be back on the third day 
before the sun is going down.

288
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,536
Isn't it rather cruel?

289
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:25,960
It depends on your point of view. Shoshones 
were a small tribe. Every man counts.

290
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:31,955
Suppose one day that boy had to fight 
for his people... Wouldn't it be good idea 
if they knew they could depend on him?

291
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:36,720
But he's not living with the tribe now.
He'll never have to face that test here.

292
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:38,681
I hope not, ma'am.

293
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,564
There is our warrior.

294
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,777
That's a fine set, Jimmy.

295
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:56,073
They are yours. 
You've earned them.

296
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:03,030
You made it, Shining Spear.
You're a man now. We're proud of you.

297
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:07,293
Whatever the trouble,
you will be sleeping tonight.  

298
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,506
That boy has a good home.

299
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,062
Don't worry, ma'am. They are Shoshones.

300
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:35,154
They ran away from the reservation 
20 suns past.

301
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,576
Their hearts are dying because 
they have no freedom.

302
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,249
They have no milk and 
the children weep.

303
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:53,954
- They heard that Broken Lance has much land.
- Why do you bother to translate?

304
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:58,135
- Do you care what I think? 
- They have broken the law.

305
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:00,804
I thought you might wanna know.

306
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:10,095
He says they want a place
to live. They want a home.

307
00:37:10,147 --> 00:37:13,258
- What do you say now?
- What do you think I say!?

308
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:16,643
I'll tell them to go away and 
tell them I don't own my land.

309
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:20,324
They stay, they will 
only add to my troubles.

310
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:22,566
(You can not stay.)

311
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:25,996
(I want peace with the white man.)

312
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,131
(We salute you.)

313
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:42,305
This is Thunder Cloud.

314
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:47,385
I remember when I was a child he was the 
greatest hunter and the bravest warrior.

315
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:56,426
Once I fought as a mountain lion 
and hunted as the eagle.

316
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,531
Now my spirit is dead.

317
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:05,286
Even my eyes are dead.

318
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,211
We will die, but we'll never 
go back to the reservation.

319
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:48,954
- What did you say to them? - I told them
they haven't to go back to the reservation.

320
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,897
I told them they were home.

321
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,075
You're the only people 
who know they are here.

322
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:59,609
- No one will find out from us.
- No one.

323
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,675
We'd better be on our way.

324
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,314
I will leave you here.

325
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:23,597
Lance, will you come to the house?
I want to talk with you.

326
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:28,577
It wouldn't be a good idea for you 
to be seen with me after dark.

327
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,871
If you think so.

328
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:36,669
Lance, I guess I deserved what 
you said about the law.

329
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:40,130
I understand now what that law means.

330
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:46,595
I want you to know, if you let me, 
I'll work for you to get it changed.

331
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:52,685
I don't know if there's much 
I can do, but I want to try.

332
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:55,385
That's good to hear.

333
00:39:55,437 --> 00:40:00,451
We haven't lost this fight. I've 
been thinking about filing a petition.

334
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:03,277
Yes, Orri, yes. That's the idea.

335
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:07,533
If we can get enough signatures here,
The Land Office will have to take notice.

336
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:12,580
- I have faith in people. If they hear 
your side of the story... - They will sign.

337
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:15,749
I'll write a few letters 
to Congress myself.

338
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:18,002
It sounds... just fine.

339
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,880
Thank you.

340
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,676
- Good night, Lance.
- Good night.

341
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,930
- Good night.
- Oh, Mrs Masters... - Yes?

342
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:34,293
The next time you carry a gun
for protection against Indians,

343
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:38,898
- you'd better make sure the firing 
pin is not rusted. - The... what?

344
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,779
That damn thing!

345
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:07,635
Through that pass you will find green
pastures and clean water for your sheep.

346
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,178
Mr. Coolan!

347
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,594
I caught that man with the sheep 
trying to come at my place.

348
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:28,937
I scattered the sheep,
they can be roundup later.

349
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:33,035
The other side of that pass
belongs to me. Stay off it.

350
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:37,798
That's a big horse you're riding.
And it's a long fall of it.

351
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,834
Like you said. It is a big horse.

352
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:53,722
There you are. unless it rains, your 
sheep will be wiped out within a month.

353
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:58,065
- And it never rains in Wyoming 
in the summertime. - Mr. Coolan...

354
00:41:58,217 --> 00:42:02,304
It was your idea for us to come here.
What do you suggest now?

355
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:07,152
Through that pass the rains never dries 
up, the mountains keep the wind out.

356
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:10,906
There is a waterhole in there big 
enough to float a clipper ship in.

357
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:13,868
And the grass... it's belly high.

358
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:20,656
It's a place for home.
I'd like to live there myself.

359
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:26,005
Alright lawyer, we paid you good money
to tell us what to do. What's your answer?

360
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,285
My answer is in effect 
the answer of the Land Office.

361
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:34,430
They informed me that Indians are 
ineligible for benefits of the homestead law.

362
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:39,794
- The rest is up to you, gentlemen.
- Indians have always fought for their land.

363
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:45,107
- Poole doesn't strike me to be afraid. 
- It's my duty is to tell your rights.

364
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:48,360
For the rest, of course, you have 
to attend to yourselves.

365
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:50,905
Fear didn't enter into
my considerations.

366
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:56,035
Why get your head blown off
if there is another way?

367
00:42:56,187 --> 00:43:00,706
I'd like to talk with Poole.
Maybe we can make a deal.

368
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:07,400
We want grazing and watering rights. 
We'll rent, lease or buy.

369
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:13,010
- Go on. - Legally, we can 
go in Sweet Meadows right now.

370
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:18,599
- Why don't you?
- We'd rather do it without fighting.

371
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:21,769
I see.

372
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:29,794
Those men are not going to
let their sheep starve to death.

373
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,984
Would you care to go with me 
to talk with Mr. Poole?

374
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,475
- When can we leave?
- Right away.

375
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,885
Not a foot, mister. I hope you will 
do alright, but not on my land.

376
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:50,339
- You do realize we have the right to 
homestead on Sweet Meadows? - I do.

377
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:54,009
Lance, as your attorney, 
I recommend some sort of agreement.

378
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:58,847
I wanna follow your advice 
wherever I can, but not this time.

379
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:02,518
May I speak with you alone?

380
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:18,073
Don't be in a hurry about this. 
It is serious.

381
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:24,206
- Why did you bring him here, Orri?
- Because I want you to understand your position.

382
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,834
This is the time for compromise.

383
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,921
The Shoshones had a chief
who compromised.

384
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,800
He even fought alongside the 
white men against his own race.

385
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:40,096
Today my tribe is on a
reservation, shut in like animals.

386
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,589
There are a few of us left 
who won't go to a reservation.

387
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,060
We'll stay and we won't compromise.

388
00:44:55,154 --> 00:45:00,701
Would you compromise if the Land Office 
reversed its decision about you?

389
00:45:00,753 --> 00:45:05,028
- What's going to make them change their minds?
- Maybe my petition will.

390
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:11,053
If you had a legal claim to even a part
of Sweet Meadows, you'd be better off.

391
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:15,666
Alright, I'll make a deal with you.

392
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:20,018
If your petition is works,
I will talk to the sheep men.

393
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,089
Thank you.

394
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:33,943
- Time is running out. You'll have to do something. 
- I promised to see what happens with the petition.

395
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:37,796
Let me tell you something about 
Miss Masters. In the first place...

396
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,444
She is emotionally involved
with that Indian.

397
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,247
In the second place she's a shrew. 
I regard her for, professionally.

398
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:52,486
But her petition is a fraud.
An attempt to stall the time. No chance.

399
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:54,411
Where did you get 
all the confidence?

400
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:58,801
I've been talking with the Land 
Commissioner in Cheyenne yesterday.

401
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:04,357
- What did he say? - If that petition 
would have all signatures of everyone

402
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:07,450
...it wouldn't change 
the decision one bit.

403
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:14,383
- But the Indian would still fight.
- I doubt that. Why should he?

404
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:20,222
If you went out there and stake the claim
you'd be doing yourself and the Indian a favor.

405
00:46:20,374 --> 00:46:23,876
I think it
resigned itself to be inevitable.

406
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:29,540
- Maybe you're right. 
- This petition could drag on months. - Yes.

407
00:46:29,592 --> 00:46:34,253
And I don't have to remind you 
that sheep die easily.

408
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,382
Excuse me.

409
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:45,514
- When did you go to Cheyenne?
- Last... 

410
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:50,311
Just before the war. Nine years ago.

411
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:06,836
- It looks like the kid swallowed it. - I admire 
that boy. He follows the advice of his elders.

412
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:11,373
I'll go back in town and see how the 
young lady's petition is getting on.

413
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:14,168
You'll follow in discrete distance

414
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,770
and bring me news of the battles
as quickly as possible.

415
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:22,585
This Indian will chew that kid 
and spit him out.

416
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:31,819
A couple of sheep herders down at
the waterhole, they're driving stakes.

417
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:13,394
It will save yourself a lot of grieve, 
if you just get out of here.

418
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:19,087
My lawyer tells me this is land in the public
domain and I have the right to homestead it.

419
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:23,953
- I've already told you once.
- We can't let the sheep die?!

420
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,189
That's your luck out.

421
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:30,160
- Don't come any further.
- Anytime you're ready.

422
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:38,419
If you want that kid of yours
out here alive, move!

423
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,087
What's it gonna take
to teach you, guys?!

424
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:52,108
And I want to remind you that Mr. Poole
fought long and gallantly for his country.

425
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,227
He certainly earned the right to live.

426
00:48:56,562 --> 00:49:01,575
If the citizens of Medicine Bow 
show confidence in this man

427
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:06,606
and help him by giving him the guarantee
to be sure of just a portion of his land,

428
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:11,585
I'm sure he'll not be unreasonable
about the rest of it.

429
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:16,074
As it is, he has every right 
to be suspicious.

430
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:20,416
The law says an Indian got
no more rights than a dog.

431
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:24,454
That's the law 
I've sworn to enforce.

432
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:29,928
I'll do my best, even so I knew
Lance Poole since childhood.

433
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,951
He has always been a good boy, he
never made any trouble for nobody.

434
00:49:35,403 --> 00:49:38,502
He's just trying to 
hang on to his land.

435
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:43,204
As soon as he fights, I got to 
go out and try to stop him.

436
00:49:43,556 --> 00:49:47,903
A Marshall, I reckon, should 
not mix up in any politics

437
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:53,994
but I feel pretty bad the way things are and 
there's nothing saying the law can't be changed.

438
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,625
- Give me the pen. 
- One moment! Please, Miss Masters!

439
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:06,207
There's one thing that concerns me. If we sign 
and the government entitles the Indian his land,

440
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,811
can you guarantee that he will 
live in peace with his neighbors?

441
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:14,857
- Not to go to savagery?
- Of course.

442
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:20,396
Well, in that case, I'll be 
delighted to sign your petition.

443
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:35,169
Coolan! Coolan! That Indian just
shot one, the MacDougall kid.

444
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:39,331
This must be some mistake!

445
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,081
Rod, I'm sorry about what happened.

446
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:22,932
So am I.

447
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:30,766
- Well, I guess nothing can stop it now.
- What do you mean? Stop what?

448
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:37,348
A fight. We're at the end of our rope. We 
got to make a move. We just can't take anymore.

449
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,172
Hello.

450
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:19,682
I just came from the sheep camp shepherd. - You're
worried about them. -They have a right to live.

451
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:25,677
- It's just as terrifying for them to be 
without a home as it is for you. - Alright.

452
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:33,028
- I'm afraid. They can only endure so much,
then they'll fight. - That's their choice.

453
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,576
- Lance, can't you see if they'd fight 
you'll be destroyed? - What can I do?

454
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:43,278
Give in an inch.
Make a few concessions.

455
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:49,044
Lance, they're coming west all the time.
This is a question of survival for you.

456
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:56,385
The Land Office refused our petition.

457
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,808
Orri, I want to ask you a question.

458
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,478
- Will you be honest?
- I'll try.

459
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:11,567
Do you believe in your heart that
they have a right to my land?

460
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,777
Answer me, Orri.

461
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:21,702
I believe they are human beings and
that everyone has the right to live.

462
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:27,499
- You didn't answer me. - What can they do?!
- Do you think they have a right to my land?

463
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:30,127
Yes, yes! To a part of it anyway!

464
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:39,762
- Let me explain, Lance. Just...
- Never mind, Orri. I understand.

465
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,632
It's hard to explain how an 
Indian feels about the earth.

466
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:52,575
It's the pumping of our bloods.
It's the love we got to have.

467
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:57,163
My father said the earth is our mother.

468
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:01,692
I was raised in this valley
and now I'm part of it, like...

469
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:07,773
Like the mountains, and the hills,
deer, pine trees and the wind.

470
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:15,005
Deep in my heart I know 
that I belong here.

471
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:21,720
If we lose it now, we 
might as well all be dead.

472
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:47,037
Don't feel bad, Orri.
You've tried to see it my way.

473
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:49,246
You've been a good lawyer.

474
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,842
I'll ride home with you.

475
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:20,736
Marshall, you've solved
as long as you can.

476
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:24,748
You've deliberately ignored your duties as 
a peace officer and a servant to the people.

477
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:28,479
The Indian's petition has been denied.

478
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:36,045
Are you going to give these men the homestead
protection they're entitled to or you aren't you?

479
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:40,297
- I guess I ain't got much choice.
- All right.

480
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:44,804
Some of you get the sheep moving,
and the rest come along with me.

481
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:55,272
- You notice how pretty the 
mountains look today? - Yeah.

482
00:55:55,523 --> 00:56:02,571
I've always wanted to die with my boots off, in 
bed with people standing around, crying over me.

483
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,082
Don't come any closer, Zeke!

484
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:20,691
Don't!

485
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:25,446
You wouldn't hurt me, Lance.

486
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:46,884
They'll never be any closer as that.

487
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,838
Bring all the sheep!

488
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:18,072
Gentlemen, in my hand I hold the
telegram from the Governor of Wyoming,

489
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:22,250
appointing me temporary the U.S. Marshall.

490
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:26,814
I need hardly remind you of
the purpose of our assembling.

491
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:32,987
Who could blame us if we dangle Poole and 
his Indians from the telegraph poles as

492
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:36,330
...a warning to other redskins?

493
01:02:36,482 --> 01:02:42,945
The volunteers of this expedition will have first 
choice in the homesteading of Sweet Meadows.

494
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:47,184
Commanding Officer of Fort Laramie.

495
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:54,617
Temporary U.S. Marshall forming 
posse to attack Sweet Meadows.

496
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:03,205
Strong possibility that Indians of 
State reservation hiding there.

497
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:10,174
To prevent mass violence, urgently 
request present here Federal troops

498
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:13,419
to deal with the situation.

499
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:16,505
Please reply immediately.

500
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:59,573
How can I fight without a gun?
I can shoot a shovel.

501
01:03:59,725 --> 01:04:02,635
- You'll get a gun soon enough.
- I hope so.

502
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:36,210
- We'll be ready by sundown.
- Good. They probably will hit at night.

503
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:41,757
- Indians aren't supposed to fight at night. 
- You'll need sleep.

504
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:44,269
We'll need more than that.

505
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:53,185
All right, men! Let's go!
Don't hurry! Take your time.

506
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:16,000
- Is that the answer?
- No, that's a call from Rock Springs.

507
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:30,806
This is it! It's from Fort Laramie.

508
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:09,042
The Indians have build themselves a good 
defense. They probably got about 18 guns.

509
01:06:09,194 --> 01:06:13,516
If we get them from all three sides, 
each group will face about six Indians.

510
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:19,313
It shouldn't be difficult. It'll be 
dark in 20 minutes. We'll wait.

511
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:40,609
All right, men! It's dark enough. 
Let's get this over with!

512
01:06:40,761 --> 01:06:43,379
Wait! I have news!

513
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:51,845
- You should be glad to hear this!
- It can wait. We have work to do.

514
01:06:51,997 --> 01:06:54,630
Jenkins, you take 12 men
and encircle to the north.

515
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:59,838
I see no need for you men to get all shot up
when the U.S. cavalry is willing to do the job.

516
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:02,619
What's cavalry got to do with this?

517
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:11,448
I'm dispatching immediately Troop B, 
to dispose uprising Medicine Bow Indians.

518
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,952
Signed:
Major B. Haskins, Commanding Officer.

519
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,899
This is a local problem and the solution
lies entirely under my authority as Marshall.

520
01:07:20,051 --> 01:07:24,211
Of course, Mr. Coolan.
I was just thinking of your men.

521
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:29,231
The trained soldiers are 
willing to do the job!

522
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:33,996
I think you're right. There's still some 
work we can do before the troops get here.

523
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:37,026
We can soften up the Indian a little.

524
01:07:37,818 --> 01:07:40,410
He... seems to favor dynamite.

525
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:45,434
- What's the lady lawyer doing?
- It's hard to tell.

526
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:48,319
Coolan will make a move soon.

527
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,266
- Not yet.
- When?

528
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:57,953
Now!

529
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:39,995
Red Rock!

530
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,944
Get them out of here!

531
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:52,424
- Back to the reservation! Go on!
- Why, Lance?

532
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:56,960
If they are not here, I might have
a chance to save this place.

533
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:59,854
They brought all the trouble here.
Send them back to the reservation!

534
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:03,338
If you want to save their lives,
why don't you say so?

535
01:09:03,696 --> 01:09:08,758
- They haven't got a chance. Tell them anything,
just get them started. - You know they won't go.

536
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:14,119
- Do as I say!
- All right, but they won't go.

537
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:58,574
They won't go.

538
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:03,337
All right.

539
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:07,833
If they want to stay, 
they're set on dying.

540
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:12,690
Let's make it count!

541
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,049
Let's go after them!

542
01:10:29,355 --> 01:10:30,665
Hey, Ed!

543
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,442
Ed, you're there?

544
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,117
Are you deaf? Wake up!

545
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:47,831
Ed Johnson has been knifed!

546
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:01,947
Jimmy!

547
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:08,996
Here's the gun you wanted.
Take good care of it.

548
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:26,180
Let's go!

549
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,506
The U.S. Cavalry?

550
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:07,044
- Who's in command here, Miss? 
- Stop this attack on innocent people!

551
01:13:07,196 --> 01:13:11,022
Everyone in that house will e dead.
There are women and children.

552
01:13:11,462 --> 01:13:14,601
I don't like it any better than 
you do, but I have my orders.

553
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:18,872
- The Indians can stop at any time they 
want to by surrendering. - All right.

554
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:23,783
Make the posse stop this slaughter,
and I'll go in to talk to them.

555
01:13:23,935 --> 01:13:28,742
- I used to be Lance Poole's attorney
- I'll stop the posse, but I still got my orders.

556
01:13:28,894 --> 01:13:34,498
- The Indians must go back to the reservation. 
- Thank you.  - Good luck!

557
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,527
In there.

558
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,466
Well?

559
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:02,261
0h, Lance!

560
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,459
You think it's all over with us,
we might as well give up.

561
01:15:06,931 --> 01:15:10,684
With the cavalry here, it's hopeless.

562
01:15:11,047 --> 01:15:14,504
- You got any suggestions?
- Yes, I have.

563
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:19,649
If you surrender to the Federal
Troops you'll get a fair trial.

564
01:15:19,922 --> 01:15:22,396
You still got your religion, haven't you?

565
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:27,499
What do you think the court will do with
a bunch of Indians who fought for their land?

566
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:34,058
At least as you give up to the cavalry, you'll
get a trial. That's more that Coolan would've done.

567
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:37,392
That's why I telegraphed Fort Laramie.

568
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:41,004
I wondered how to troops got here. 
That was thoughtful of you.

569
01:15:41,659 --> 01:15:43,730
Coolan wanted to lynch all of you.

570
01:15:43,865 --> 01:15:46,977
Does it make much difference which way?

571
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:52,207
If you're determined to die,
that's your choice.

572
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:55,377
But what about the women and children?

573
01:15:55,524 --> 01:15:57,441
What about them, Orri?

574
01:15:57,897 --> 01:16:01,480
- They have a right to live.
- On a reservation?

575
01:16:02,638 --> 01:16:04,906
All right. On a reservation.

576
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:13,847
The children were happy here.
They didn't want much to be happy.

577
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:17,615
They've to eat, medicines 
if they got sick...

578
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:21,896
...listen to the old men 
stories about the past.

579
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:28,182
They speak their own language, worship 
their own God, know they were loved.

580
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,984
You tell them to go back
to the reservation.

581
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:39,433
But be sure you tell them they don't get any 
of those things there. Tell them to go back.

582
01:16:39,634 --> 01:16:41,810
You tell them something too.

583
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:47,915
Try to tell them why they die and
see if the babies understand you.

584
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:53,940
- Even a baby has a right to know why he's dying.
- Dying because... - Because you say they should!

585
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:58,780
Who are you to ordain who 
shall live and who won't?

586
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:04,722
It's good to have advice. It's just
what I needed. Especially now.

587
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:09,320
Nothing an Indian needs like a speech
from a lawyer telling him to give up.

588
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:13,179
Well, now you made it.
Your conscience is clear.

589
01:17:14,552 --> 01:17:17,690
It's much more than conscience, Lance.

590
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:21,280
And it's more than
the women and children.

591
01:17:21,652 --> 01:17:24,861
If you're trying to say 
it's feeling for me,

592
01:17:24,962 --> 01:17:26,162
...than I don't believe you.

593
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:31,569
The color of my hide means just as much 
to you as it does to them out there.

594
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:38,304
If you've found out that I could be lonely for 
a woman, you stay on the safe side of the fence.

595
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:44,582
How much does my life mean to you, Orri?

596
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,836
What would you give to see me live?

597
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:53,340
Would you let an Indian
put your arms around you?

598
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:58,496
Would your conscience say
it's worth kissing me?

599
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:10,024
You better go back now.

600
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:12,735
What are you going to do?

601
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:17,665
Tell Lieutenant he'll have 
to come and get us.

602
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:22,119
But Lance, can't you see?
Don't you understand?

603
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:03,577
Don't cry, Orri. A hundred years
from now it might have worked.

604
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:09,900
Poole! Poole, it's over! 
Get out. Give yourself up!

605
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:13,521
We'll give up...

606
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:18,680
... If you let the women and 
children go back to reservation!

607
01:21:19,255 --> 01:21:21,215
It's a deal!

608
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:35,688
Jimmy!

609
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,032
You're the man now, Jimmy.

610
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:53,998
- Take them back to the reservation.
- I'd rather stay and fight.

611
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:01,080
You're the only man left.

612
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:03,849
Take good care of the children.

613
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:22,611
Where are the others?

614
01:23:25,821 --> 01:23:28,370
We're all gone.

615
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:40,204
It would be too bad, 
if we ever forgot.
