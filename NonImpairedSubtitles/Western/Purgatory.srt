1
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
Now, watch this.

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,880
Cavin.

3
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
I thought you said that nephew of
yours was gonna be worth a damn.

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
Wanna see that again?

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
I'll set him straight.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,800
This ain't no barn
social. You understand?

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,240
I spoke up for you, Sonny.
You best do right by me.

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,040
All right.

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
He'll do right.

10
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,320
All right. Let's get it done.

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Everybody, grab the ceiling.

12
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Just keep your damn trap
shut, nobody has to get killed.

13
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,920
Good boy.

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Open the safe.

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't know the combination.

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,800
- Cavin.
- Damn city boy.

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,880
Now, you wanna keep
the other nine fingers?

18
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,880
Open the safe.

19
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Excuse me, ma'am.

20
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,880
You're Dolly Sloan, aren't you?

21
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,120
How would a green kid like you
be knowing something like that?

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,040
I know all about you.

23
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,680
Look, I got it in here somewhere.

24
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,480
Dime novels, huh?

25
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,400
Harlot With a Heart, right here.

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Well, you take it from
one who's been there, boy.

27
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
They don't always get it right.

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,880
Even so, I'd be much obliged
if you'd mark my copy.

29
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
Company, right!

30
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,520
Coming around!

31
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Maybe some other time. Hey, boys.

32
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,520
Well, what brings you to town today?

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
There's blue boys out there.

34
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,160
At a walk!

35
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,960
Company, halt!

36
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,800
Company, dismount.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
How was your ride?

38
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,440
It was over two
days. How do you ride?

39
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
- Hurry up.
- Hurry, let's go.

40
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Quit your squirming!

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,960
Cover me!

42
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
That's them!

43
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,240
Miss Sloan.

44
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Let's ride. Come on.

45
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't let me die.

46
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,600
- Come on!
- Wait for me.

47
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
Sonny!

48
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,640
Badger!

49
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,920
Get up! Come on! Come on!

50
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,040
Go! Get up here.

51
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,800
All right, throw
those bags on Ginger.

52
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
- What went wrong?
- Nothing. Hell, it went real good.

53
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,440
Knox, where's the rest of them?

54
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,800
Butch went down. Waco too.
I didn't see nobody else.

55
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,680
Listen up, we got a hard road ahead of
us. And some of you ain't gonna make it.

56
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,320
I can ride, Blackjack.
You ain't gotta worry none.

57
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Any man who can keep up with
me, I'll see in Chihuahua.

58
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,520
The rest of you,
I'll see you in hell.

59
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
They're coming.

60
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,320
Let's keep pushing it.

61
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,560
- What about Badger?
- What about him?

62
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,800
He's hurt bad. He's
gonna need to rest.

63
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,280
Well, why don't we make camp
so he can have a nice long nap.

64
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,920
He's your brother.

65
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Think I give a damn? We got a posse
of men behind us on fresh horses...

66
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,520
...just itching to hang us all.
- I'm all right, kid.

67
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Time's a-wasting, Blackjack.

68
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,480
I can keep up!

69
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,080
Let's go.

70
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Badger, give me your reins. Come on.

71
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,720
Hold on to your saddle horn.

72
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't see any quit in them.

73
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,360
All right, we'll ride through
the night. Let's pick it up.

74
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, we're the Blackjack Britton Gang.
Ain't a bunch a quitters here, eh, boys?

75
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,920
Let's go.

76
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,480
- Badger's down!
- Hold it up.

77
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

78
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,920
I reckon it's over for me now.

79
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,680
Appears so, Badger.

80
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,000
Do me a last kindness,
Jack, and end it.

81
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,560
I can't spare the bullet.

82
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,040
Cavin, will you?

83
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,440
- We gotta ride.
- We're just gonna leave him here like this?

84
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
What do you suggest, boy?

85
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Well, at least wait until...

86
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,480
Until what? Until
that posse rides up?

87
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,680
Hell, you wanna read
him a prayer, go ahead.

88
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
So long, Badger.

89
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,640
So long, Blackjack.

90
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
Let's go.

91
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,240
We're moving out. Get up.

92
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
Don't be a fool. Go with them.

93
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
It just ain't right.

94
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,600
Not much in life is.

95
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,600
It sure as hell ain't
like them dime novels...

96
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,640
...you got in your saddlebag, is it?

97
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,560
There's a way out of
this if you act quick.

98
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,160
I ain't never shot nobody before.

99
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,760
Maybe you're worth a damn after all.

100
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,000
I wanna go home.

101
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
It's a little too late for that.

102
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
Come on, now. Get out.

103
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
Come on, you hear me?

104
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,600
Sonny!

105
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,640
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Let's go.

106
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,920
Go! Go!

107
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,640
Son of a bitch!

108
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Come on!

109
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,160
It's not worth dying for! Blackjack!

110
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,880
Blackjack! Let's
get out now! Come on!

111
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,560
This sure as hell ain't Mexico.

112
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,480
Winds must have got us turned around.

113
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
Let's move it.

114
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,640
It must go somewhere.

115
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,960
Anywhere's better than where we been.

116
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,040
All right, we're heading
out. Let's keep a sharp eye.

117
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
It looks like we got
us a town up ahead.

118
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,720
So ride in nice and easy.
And be ready for anything.

119
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,080
Oh, my, would you look at that.

120
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
I think I'm gonna like this town.

121
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,000
Keep your mind on business.

122
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Here comes the law.

123
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,120
Welcome to Refuge, strangers.

124
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,040
Thank you, sheriff.

125
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,680
You look like you've
seen some trouble.

126
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,480
Ain't that a fact.

127
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,320
We're drovers. We was moving
a herd up from Chihuahua...

128
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,720
...when Apaches attacked
us. They stole the herd.

129
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,480
They killed some of us, they wounded
others, then they drove us in here.

130
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,440
We wasn't due to get paid till we
delivered the herd to Sweetwater.

131
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
So we're a little short on money too.

132
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,120
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

133
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,880
You'll find Refuge is a charitable, friendly
little town. You can stable your horses.

134
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,880
Your men can have free drinks in the
saloon. Bed and table in the hotel.

135
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,920
That's mighty neighborly of
you, sheriff. Ain't it, boys?

136
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,440
You can stay as long as it takes to heal
your wounded and get back on your feet.

137
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm much obliged.

138
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,640
Can you tell me where the telegraph office
is? I need to contact the owner of the herd.

139
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,240
We're a little off the beaten track here.
There's no telegraph office, no newspapers.

140
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,760
In fact, aside from the occasional
strangers, such as yourselves...

141
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,760
...we don't have much contact
with the outside world.

142
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,200
- That a fact?
- Deputy Glen...

143
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,360
...you show these gents where
they can put up their horses.

144
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
Doc Woods will treat your wounded.

145
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Rose, would you show them
to the doc's office, please?

146
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,280
Imagine the rest of you boys
have built up a mighty thirst.

147
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,400
Saloon's right over there.

148
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,200
- All right, boys, let's un-ass these
saddles. - There is just one thing.

149
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,640
- What's that?
- I would appreciate it...

150
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,400
...while you're in Refuge,
that you don't curse.

151
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,120
Except for the saloon, of course.

152
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,600
- Of course. Thank you.
- Did you hear that?

153
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,080
Right this way, gentlemen.

154
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
- Come on.
- Let's go get some of that water.

155
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,040
The water's over here.

156
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,360
Well, lads, what
will be your pleasure?

157
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Bottle of whiskey.

158
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,680
- This is the whole bottle.
- This one's on me.

159
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
Who are these people, anyway?

160
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
What are they doing in
the middle of nowhere?

161
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,200
Maybe they's Mennonites.

162
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,120
I heard they had colonies
scattered all over the place.

163
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,160
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

164
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,480
So it's a beautiful
little town you got here.

165
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,720
Yes, it is beautiful.

166
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,240
How long is it that
you have lived here?

167
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Five years, one week and two days.

168
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,320
That's amazing how you just know
that, like, exactly to the day.

169
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,160
Well, I know it's silly, but I tend
to keep track of things like that.

170
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
It appears I'm back in business.

171
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,320
Hello, Doc.

172
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,200
Step inside, gentlemen.

173
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,360
I recognize that sheriff from
somewhere, just can't place it.

174
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,720
Lucky he didn't place you.

175
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
- Yeah, you notice he wasn't packing.
- Neither was the deputy.

176
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
I didn't see a gun in
the whole damn town.

177
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
You thinking what I'm thinking?

178
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,200
All right, you're next, son.

179
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
I think it's just a flesh wound.

180
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,800
I'll tell you what it is.

181
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
- Well, you're lucky.
- I don't feel lucky.

182
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
You just lost a few
inches of baby fat.

183
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,640
What are you looking at?

184
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,040
- Have you ever been in Wichita?
- Why?

185
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,400
- Is that where you're from?
- Yeah, from just outside of there.

186
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,640
My mama's got a little farm.

187
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,680
Why, you been there?

188
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,640
I was there once.

189
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
It was long before you were born.

190
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,400
How many men have you killed?

191
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,040
Why would you ask me
a question like that?

192
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
Your ramrod said you
were drovers, right?

193
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,680
That's right.

194
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,520
And that your cattle was
stolen by the Indians.

195
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,760
That's what he said.

196
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,800
Did they steal your ropes too?

197
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,080
Our ropes?

198
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,240
Yeah, I see your horses, and
I only see two or three ropes.

199
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,720
No branding irons. Aren't cowboys
supposed to have a lot of ropes?

200
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,920
You sure do ask a lot
of questions yourself.

201
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,640
Well, I guess you wanna be
joining your friends now.

202
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,520
I only killed one man.

203
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,520
He...

204
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,320
He begged me to do it.

205
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Forty-five.

206
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,040
Forty-four-40.

207
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,520
Forty-five. And...

208
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
...45.

209
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,120
Not many Indians use a.45.

210
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,920
- Well, we knew they wasn't drovers.
- So, what are we gonna do about it?

211
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
We'll walk softly. Give
them plenty of room.

212
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,800
Maybe they'll leave peacefully.

213
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,280
And maybe they'll drop us a
thanks note on the way out of town.

214
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,640
Don't work that way, sheriff. You
should've told them to keep on riding.

215
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,680
This job's yours if
you want it, Glen.

216
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,640
I'd just as soon go off and sit under
a big tree. Believe me, I'd rather.

217
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,960
Forrest, nobody'd
blame you for it either.

218
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,880
Look, the last man we want
handling this thing is Glen.

219
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,880
Why, he'd shoot the eyes out of a
dove for singing too early in the day.

220
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,224
Brooks is right.

221
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:38,509
If we got a hope of getting out of
this jackpot, I'm pinning it on Forrest.

222
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
That bunch, just ride out?

223
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,280
We got about as much chance of
that as a one-legged man at a...

224
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,240
...rat stomp.

225
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,200
We got any other choice?

226
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,160
You had your sorry moments...

227
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,560
...but all in all, I'd say you
did the family real proud today.

228
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,240
I did?

229
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,120
Yeah, you acquitted yourself
real good for a green farm boy.

230
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,800
Next time I write Esther
I'm gonna tell her so.

231
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,320
Excuse me.

232
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,680
- You're the doc, right?
- And you are...?

233
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,040
Smith. Jack Smith.

234
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
I just wanna thank you
for patching up my boys.

235
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,640
Think nothing of it.

236
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,840
Come on in. Let me
stand you to a drink.

237
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,360
That's mighty tempting...

238
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,680
...but I don't drink anymore.

239
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,480
Well, that's a shame.

240
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,800
Nice to meet you, Mr. Smith.

241
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,440
You know, it's the damnedest thing...

242
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,680
...but I swear I seen
that man somewhere before.

243
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
He was in Wichita once.

244
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Excuse me, Mr. Smith, I
have to go for an hour...

245
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,360
...so please tell your men to help
themselves to whatever they'd like.

246
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,640
Yeah, you see, I told you the whole
damn town is full of Bible-thumpers.

247
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,040
He's right, boss. Nothing but
a bunch of damn cheek-turners.

248
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,760
It's gonna be real easy.

249
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
What's gonna be easy?

250
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,800
It's none of your damn business.

251
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,560
How's the leg?

252
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,120
It hurts.

253
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,680
Bullets tend to do that.

254
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,880
Evening, miss. May I have a minute?

255
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,920
What do you want?

256
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,720
Listen, the man I shot...

257
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,120
...he was dying in the desert and
begged everyone to shoot him...

258
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,120
...but no one would. I mean, they
were gonna leave him to the buzzards.

259
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,240
Why are you telling me this?

260
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,000
Because I don't want
you to misjudge me.

261
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,520
Why should you care
what I think of you?

262
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,880
Because I like you.

263
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
What's your name?

264
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,720
Leon...

265
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,080
...Miller.

266
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,800
But most everyone
just calls me Sonny.

267
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,520
What's your name?

268
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
Rose.

269
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,080
Rose, huh?

270
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,560
That's a mighty pretty name.

271
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,320
Rose what?

272
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,200
It's just Rose.

273
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
Well...

274
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
...I reckon it fits you pretty good.

275
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
You know, your grammar is terrible.

276
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,080
You know how to read?

277
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,760
Yeah, read all the time.

278
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,840
In fact, l...

279
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,200
- It's a dime novel.
- Yes, it's dime novels.

280
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,720
Hey, Sonny.

281
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,160
Why don't you bring
her over for a drink.

282
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,400
- This is the damnedest saloon I ever saw.
- Who's that?

283
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,760
My uncle. He gets
mean when he's drunk.

284
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,320
Where the hell are all the women?

285
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm getting real Ionely.

286
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,640
Did you hear what I said, boy?

287
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Mean when he ain't too.

288
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,880
Look at you, hogging all the whores.

289
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,120
She ain't a whore, Uncle Guthrie.

290
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,760
I don't care if she's a
nun. They're all whores.

291
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,320
You know, you shouldn't be
walking around with boys...

292
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,880
...when there's real men in town.

293
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,720
How about me and you
crack some calico?

294
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,120
No. Please.

295
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,200
Don't.

296
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
No, Forrest. You can't.

297
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,880
What's the matter, sheriff? You
know what this is, don't you?

298
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Sorry.

299
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
It's not your fault.

300
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm obliged for that, son.

301
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,720
- You gonna put him in jail?
- We don't have a jail.

302
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
What? Every town's got a jail.

303
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,320
Well, this one doesn't.

304
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
Why's everyone just standing here?

305
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,000
Why didn't you draw your gun?

306
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
You best get him to bed.

307
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,600
Good night, Sonny.

308
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,000
Y'all go to bed!

309
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,840
Sonny, what the hell happened here?

310
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,120
I didn't see. I think...

311
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,640
I think he fell.

312
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,320
More likely, somebody felled him.

313
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,600
Get him off the street.

314
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
Glorious day, Glen.

315
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,680
Yep.

316
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Beautiful morning, Brooks.

317
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,200
Indeed, Brother Lamb.

318
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,680
Morning.

319
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,840
Morning, Sonny.

320
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,400
Hi. Morning, sheriff.

321
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,840
Mr. Smith up and about?

322
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,920
I ain't seen him yet.

323
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,160
I'd like to speak to
him when you see him.

324
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
I'll make sure to tell him.

325
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,120
Hey, sir?

326
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,600
How long have you been
sheriff of this town?

327
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,520
Oh, better part of 10 years, why?

328
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,480
- Nothing.
- You know...

329
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,720
...you don't seem as
seasoned as the rest.

330
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,840
How'd you fall in with
this bunch, anyhow?

331
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,280
I begged my uncle to
come along with him.

332
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
On the cattle drive?

333
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,440
Bet by now you wish you hadn't, huh?

334
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes, sir.

335
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,240
I feel like I was ate by a
coyote and crapped off a cliff.

336
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,240
Hey, Sonny!

337
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,680
Did you see which one of them
Bible-thumpers bushwhacked me?

338
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,600
No, sir.

339
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,440
Cavin, I want you to take your
nephew and check the general store.

340
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,520
We're gonna need ammo.

341
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,440
- Probably don't have any.
- Check anyway.

342
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
What will I use for money?

343
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,280
Your imagination.

344
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,120
- Sir?
- What?

345
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,960
The sheriff said he
wanted to see you.

346
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,320
- He say what about?
- No, sir.

347
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,200
All right.

348
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,480
We got company.

349
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,560
Morning.

350
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,240
The boy said you wanted to see me.

351
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,800
Care for a cup of java?

352
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
Be obliged.

353
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,120
So how do you like our little town?

354
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,200
It'll do.

355
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
So, what's this all about?

356
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,880
One of your men got
out of line last night.

357
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,080
Used foul language
toward one of our women.

358
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,440
- That'd be Cavin.
- Yes, I believe it was.

359
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,160
I wish you'd speak to him.

360
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,920
I'll do that sheriff, but Cavin
seemed to have a grievance of his own.

361
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,960
Seems that one of your
citizens hit him over the head.

362
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,200
Well, I doubt if it
was one of my people.

363
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
You calling him a liar?

364
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,520
No, I only said I didn't
see one of my people do it.

365
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,960
Now, he was blind drunk.

366
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,640
Maybe he passed out and just
didn't wanna own up to it.

367
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,960
Yeah, maybe so.

368
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
So you will talk to him?

369
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,160
Look, he gives you any more trouble,
why don't you just throw him in jail?

370
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,040
That is, if you got the sand.

371
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,960
I had hoped it wouldn't
come to that, Mr. Smith.

372
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,160
We have extended our hospitality.

373
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,880
You're damn right we have.

374
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,440
That's enough, Glen.

375
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,600
The least we can expect in return
is for you to control your men.

376
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,640
I can promise you one thing, sheriff.

377
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
My men do exactly
what I tell them to.

378
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,200
That's all I'm asking. Everything
else all right at the hotel?

379
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,440
- Your wounded being tended to?
- Everything's fine.

380
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,800
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Not at all.

381
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,680
In all my years on the frontier, I never
run across a sheriff that wasn't armed.

382
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
How come you ain't packing?

383
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,480
Well, we never found
the need in Refuge.

384
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,960
What? There are no
guns in this whole town?

385
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,440
- We have our own ways here, Mr. Smith.
- Damn right.

386
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,920
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Pleasure.

387
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,840
You are walking a thin line.

388
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,560
That man all but slapped you in
the face with a glove, sheriff.

389
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,800
That's not what I'm talking about.

390
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,720
You said "damn" twice.

391
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,600
Just keep him busy for a while.

392
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,880
Morning, gents. What
can I do for you?

393
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,560
We's just looking.

394
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,080
Please, look.

395
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
Right.

396
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,800
Sure got a lot of stuff here
for being so far from anywhere.

397
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,280
Yes, we have the
latest of everything.

398
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,480
- Hey, you got any dime novels?
- No, I'm sorry...

399
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,720
...but we do carry all the classics.

400
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,200
You might want to check
out the classics, son.

401
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,920
Get a whole lot more out of them
than you would those dime novels.

402
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,160
I never had much use for reading
myself before I came here.

403
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,680
Now I find that l...

404
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,280
What's the matter, son? Do I
have a smudge of flour on my face?

405
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,600
No, I'm sorry.

406
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,920
Did anyone ever say that you
kind of look like Jesse James?

407
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,520
Well, now that you mention it, a
man in Tulsa once said that to me.

408
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Why, did you...? Did you know Jesse?

409
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,000
Well, no, but I read quite a bit
about him, and I saw some likenesses.

410
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,600
Although, I think he was a
little bit taller than you are.

411
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,880
Yeah, that's what the
man in Tulsa said too.

412
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
Nice shop you got here.

413
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,600
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm rather proud of it.

414
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,120
Like I said, we just looking.

415
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,560
Of course.

416
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,240
Thank you, sir.

417
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Help yourself, boys.

418
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,840
This town's easy picking.

419
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
You didn't get away as
clean as you thought.

420
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,280
So what?

421
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
I don't see no bold
moves being made our way.

422
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,920
I don't think they got an ounce
of bold between the bunch of them.

423
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,760
I'm sick and tired of acting polite.

424
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,720
Tell the boys they can have
their way with this town.

425
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,800
I like to watch that Danny
ride, I'll tell you what.

426
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
Get our people off the street.

427
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Your men seem to have a
lot of time on their hands.

428
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,120
Yeah, what of it?

429
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,440
Maybe they'd like to split some
wood. Sort of earn their keep.

430
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,680
Earn their keep?

431
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,040
Yeah, it seems like a
reasonable suggestion.

432
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,280
I'll split some wood. It's the least...
- You ain't chopping nothing, boy.

433
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,840
Anything else, sheriff?

434
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,880
Yes, please ask your men
to slow down these horses...

435
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,120
...and stop throwing
knives at our church.

436
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,920
Why don't you tell them?

437
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,680
I doubt they'd listen to me.

438
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,720
Then you got yourself
a problem, sheriff.

439
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,480
Yes, it appears I do.

440
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,320
You miserable little bastard, I ought
to pistol-whip you. You listening?

441
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,720
Get us some whiskey. Go on.

442
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,640
- You owe me another 5.
- There's a barn out at the edge of town.

443
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,760
You can take your
knife-throwing there.

444
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,400
No, that's too far to walk.

445
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,200
What if I set a plank up
in the middle of the street?

446
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,360
We're doing just fine right here.

447
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,320
I am asking you nicely to stop
throwing knives at our church.

448
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,160
Now, I'm asking you to stop.

449
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,680
This ought to be interesting.

450
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,600
Five bucks says you can't
put it right in the windpipe.

451
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,120
That sheriff is either lucky or...

452
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,560
Or what?

453
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,480
Let's go inside and drink.

454
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,800
Go on! Go on!

455
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,800
Go on!

456
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,160
Come on! Come on!

457
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,160
Come on!

458
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,920
Whoa! Whoa!

459
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Where are we?

460
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,320
There's nothing to be
afraid of. Come inside.

461
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,520
- All right, folks.
- Forrest?

462
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,600
I got a message for you.

463
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,720
It's time you packed your grip, son.
Come noon Sunday, you're going home.

464
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
Go on!

465
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,840
Come on!

466
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,560
Don't you just feel joyful?

467
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,640
Why, I see you got a saloon.

468
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,040
Yep, but you can't go in there.

469
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,600
One step through those
doors, and it's all over.

470
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,360
- Seems like a lot of damn rules.
- No cursing either.

471
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,920
You came in last night
on a stagecoach, right?

472
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,480
This is no concern of yours.

473
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,160
I wanna know how she can
be alive and breathing...

474
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,240
...when I saw her dead in Sweetwater.

475
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,200
- Maybe you were thinking of someone else.
- No. She died in my arms.

476
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,880
The first person I ever saw got killed.
I ain't likely to be mistaken about that.

477
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,840
Do you deny it? You're Dolly
Sloan, harlot with a heart.

478
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,920
Dolly Sloan?

479
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,320
Oh, you mean the lady gambler? Yeah.

480
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,360
I've been told I look a lot like her.

481
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,760
Sorry, young man, but my name is...

482
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,560
- Ivy.
- I know what I saw.

483
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,920
What about that stage that
disappeared into thin air last night?

484
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,080
- Please, just let it be.
- I can't.

485
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,720
You have to, Sonny.

486
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,160
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we're showing Ivy the town.

487
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,240
Good day.

488
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,200
Holliday, draw!

489
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,040
That's a pretty dangerous
game you're playing there.

490
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,880
You gonna deny you're Doc Holliday?

491
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,560
A man sneaks up on you and calls
you out, you're gonna react.

492
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,280
I don't care if they call
you Mary, Queen of Scots.

493
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,160
Don't think I don't know
what's going on here.

494
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,880
Suppose you tell me.

495
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,040
Well, somehow, I don't have
that whole thing figured out...

496
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,600
...but y'all ain't dead
the way people think.

497
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,120
This town some sort of hole-in-the-wall
for famous outlaws looking to retire.

498
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,520
You don't say.

499
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
You're damn right, I do.

500
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,360
See, Forrest, he's Wild Bill Hickok, and that
deputy of his looks just like Billy the Kid.

501
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,240
How about the guy who owns
the general store there?

502
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,840
- Brooks?
- Yeah, Brooks.

503
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,400
If he ain't Jesse
James, I'll eat my hat.

504
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,640
Except I always thought
Jesse was taller.

505
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,000
And then there's that farmer.
He looks just like Lefty Slade.

506
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,000
And what famous outlaw is Rose?

507
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,800
I don't know. She ain't
in any of my books, but...

508
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,400
What don't make sense to me is...

509
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,080
...if you are all those people,
why y'all eating Blackjack's crow?

510
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,960
You could handle him easy.

511
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,360
Blackjack? You mean Mr. Smith?

512
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,480
So that's Blackjack Britton?

513
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,080
I've heard of him. He cut a
real wide swath through Missouri.

514
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,800
What's a farm kid like you doing
riding with the likes of him?

515
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,520
I wasn't supposed to let
on. You're not gonna tell...?

516
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,840
- You're not gonna tell Forrest, are you?
- Forrest isn't as dumb as you think.

517
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,920
I suggest that you reflect real
hard on your situation, Sonny.

518
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,600
A few bad choices and
a man can lose his soul.

519
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,640
Morning.

520
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,200
Morning there, young fella.

521
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,400
You seen Rose?

522
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,760
No. Haven't seen her.

523
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,120
You're Lefty, aren't you?

524
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,560
- Lefty?
- Lefty Slade.

525
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,400
Excuse me?

526
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,920
You were killed in Tombstone. Three shots
to the chest and one to the left wrist.

527
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,480
My name's Lamb.

528
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, then what's that?

529
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,880
- I killed men for less than that.
- I know.

530
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,200
Cyrus Beaudry in Dodge
and Peewee Winters...

531
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,960
...when he laughed at your shoeshine.
- It wasn't over any shoeshine.

532
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,080
It's in <i>The Blazing
Gun of Lefty Slade.</i>

533
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,000
That fool writer never even talked to
me. Besides, I got nothing to say to you.

534
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,000
Hey!

535
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,320
Hey! Get out of there!
That's my garden!

536
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,920
Get out of my garden!

537
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,400
Get out of there!

538
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,240
You son of a...

539
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,840
Lamb? Lamb, what have you done?

540
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,600
Eight years.

541
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,880
I thought I was beyond it, but...

542
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,880
- I'm so sorry, Lamb.
- Me too.

543
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,440
Blackjack Britton!

544
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,000
- How'd you know?
- That's not important.

545
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,400
You're no longer welcome in Refuge.
Collect your men and ride out.

546
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,080
Sheriff?

547
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,600
You know what you need?

548
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,640
You need yourself a good
old-fashioned pistol-whipping.

549
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,520
Come on, boss, bring him down.

550
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,400
- Come on, Blackjack.
- Glen, no! No. No.

551
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,760
To hell with this.

552
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Blow him away, Blackjack.
Nobody will do nothing.

553
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,680
The whole town is full of cowards.

554
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,680
What the hell is that?

555
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,400
I want every man jack
in the saloon, right now.

556
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,960
Hey, not you.

557
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,040
Drink up, boys. Come sunup, we're
gonna ride back into that desert...

558
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,760
...and head south for Chihuahua.
- What about supplies?

559
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,320
Take whatever the hell you can carry.

560
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,720
Anybody makes a fuss, kill them.

561
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,800
Except for that little girlfriend of
my nephew's. Y'all just leave her to me.

562
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,760
Y'all know where Rose is?

563
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,360
Rose.

564
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,880
- Sonny.
- I gotta talk to you.

565
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,920
You can come on out.
I promise I won't look.

566
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,160
You can turn around.

567
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,080
Listen, there's...

568
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,080
What is that around your neck?

569
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,760
Lefty Slade had something
like that on his wrist.

570
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,360
I suppose Forrest would have one
of those on the back of his head...

571
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,520
...where Broken Nose Jack
McCall shot Wild Bill Hickok.

572
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,760
Rose?

573
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,080
Is that how you died?

574
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,920
Yes.

575
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,440
I was the first woman ever to be
hanged in the Arizona Territory.

576
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,080
I was 19 at the time.

577
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,040
You're Betty McCullough.

578
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,320
The one who hacked her father
to death with a meat cleaver?

579
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,040
Everyone forgot to mention how he had his
dirty hands all over me since I was 12.

580
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,880
Is Refuge like a place where
you get a second chance?

581
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,440
Last chance is more like it.

582
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,680
Listen, I was thinking that I might
stay behind when the rest leave.

583
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,520
- But...
- I like you, Sonny. A lot.

584
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,240
But you're gonna have to ride out
with them when they leave tomorrow.

585
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,160
That's why I came here.
They're gonna tear up the town.

586
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,320
I heard them say it. If y'all
don't do something about it...

587
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,920
...y'all might end up dead
by the time they leave.

588
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,640
Dying's not what bothers us.

589
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,120
That was the easy part.

590
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,080
If you've figured it out
like you say you have...

591
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,160
...you know it goes way beyond that.

592
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,680
Okay, maybe I can help.
I'll talk to Forrest.

593
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,920
Maybe I can convince
them to do something.

594
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,800
No. It wouldn't do any good.

595
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,120
Okay.

596
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,440
All right. I'll ask them.

597
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,240
I'm not promising anything.

598
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,360
- When?
- Tonight at church.

599
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,040
I'll be waiting outside.

600
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,840
You're a nice young man, Sonny.

601
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,920
I wish I had met you
at a different time.

602
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,000
Well, I'll be waiting
outside the church.

603
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,320
I bet it was him
who let my name slip.

604
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,920
That little bastard.

605
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,120
Ask Ivy. She was in Sweetwater.
She knows what they'll do.

606
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,280
I can't believe you're all just gonna stand
around and let yourselves get slaughtered.

607
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,080
You come from a world of
options, and we have none.

608
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,120
- There's only two ways out for us, Sonny.
- Amen.

609
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:09,040
Refuge is where the marginally good
are gleaned from the hopelessly wicked.

610
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,400
All the temptations that we faced
in our previous lives are here.

611
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,400
The saloon, the guns,
the rotten people.

612
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,520
You lift a gun one time,
it's over. For all of us.

613
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,680
If each of us holds out for
10 years, neither inflicting...

614
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,040
...nor attracting harm, we're
spared the fate of Brother Lamb.

615
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,400
Forrest has been here the longest
and has less than 24 hours...

616
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,920
...before he enters
this house justified.

617
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,600
If we go up against
them armed, we're doomed.

618
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,080
If we just stand and let them
shoot us down, we're doomed.

619
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,600
Either way we're going to hell.

620
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,720
Then stand up to them and take
a few of them down with you.

621
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,640
We can't, Sonny. -The longer
we're here, the meeker we get.

622
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,440
Even if I was willing, I don't
reckon I have it in me anymore.

623
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,320
Except for Glen, none of us do.

624
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,880
After what happened to
Brother Lamb, I ain't about to.

625
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,080
And to think some of
you used to be my heroes.

626
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,280
Where you going, boy?

627
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,320
- You bastard!
- Hit him again.

628
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,440
I'm gonna crush you!

629
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,200
Sonny!

630
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,040
You want him, you got him.

631
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,760
Sonny.

632
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,960
Sonny? Oh, Sonny.

633
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,960
Doc, is he okay?

634
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,680
- Sonny.
- Doesn't look good.

635
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,480
Let's get him over to my office.

636
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,120
He's coming around.

637
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,920
Sonny? Can you hear me?

638
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,000
- Rose?
- Yes, Sonny.

639
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,520
- Am I dead?
- No.

640
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,760
That's too bad.

641
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,960
Maybe you and I could've...

642
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,760
Welcome back, kid.

643
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,160
I can't tell you how much it pains
me that we weren't able to help you.

644
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,080
It's okay. I understand.

645
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,400
I'm not gonna let them do it to you.

646
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,920
I'll take them all on myself.

647
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,400
Not now, Sonny. You have to rest now.

648
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,080
Not much else we can do, Doc.

649
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,360
Don't you worry.

650
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,040
All right, let's get a move
on, you bunch of desert rats.

651
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,520
In 15 minutes, we start knocking
this town over one door at a time.

652
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,200
Fifteen minutes is all I need.

653
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,480
You'll have your fun later, Cavin.

654
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,960
Sheriff! He's gone.

655
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,720
- Sonny?
- Yeah, he's gone.

656
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,080
Shape he was in he
couldn't have gone far.

657
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,160
He was there an hour ago
when I looked in. -He's gone.

658
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,120
Sonny.

659
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,280
You should be in bed, son.

660
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:41,200
What are you doing? -I can't let
them do it, Rose. I promised you.

661
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,520
I'll be damned, the
kid's on his feet.

662
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,400
And don't he look like he
wants some action, though.

663
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,360
Sonny, don't be stupid. Get
out while you still got time.

664
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,840
I ain't going nowhere. And I don't
think you're gonna try and make me.

665
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,960
Do you even know how
to shoot that thing?

666
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,080
Of course I do.

667
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,600
Oh, yeah, they'll be
quaking in their boots.

668
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,800
I'm gonna chop off his ears,
hang them on my saddle horn.

669
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,080
Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

670
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,680
This is the last chance you
got, son, to change your mind.

671
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,160
Come on, honey.

672
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,640
Sonny, you don't have to do this.

673
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,840
That's not true. I
don't have any choice.

674
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,880
We've gotta go.

675
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,080
I love you.

676
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,840
We gotta go.

677
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,720
We best be going in.

678
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
Yeah.

679
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,600
Forrest, you're coming?

680
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,960
No, you go on.

681
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,720
What?

682
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,760
The only thing I've been thinking
about the last 10 years is myself.

683
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,920
"I'm gonna get through this.

684
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,120
Just like I did my whole life."

685
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,560
And this green kid comes along...

686
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,240
...stands here, ready to
die for the woman he loves.

687
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,160
No thought to himself.

688
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,160
Kind of makes a man think.

689
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,160
Makes me think you're loco.
You've only got five hours left.

690
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,160
Yep.

691
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,880
You go on, Doc.

692
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,760
You got three bells to get inside.

693
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,840
What do you think you're doing?

694
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,040
Down the hole's down the hole.

695
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,240
I might as well have a
little fun on the way.

696
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,320
What the hell?

697
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,800
That's exactly what it is.

698
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,800
Hope you're ready to meet it.

699
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,440
Well, welcome aboard, Jesse.

700
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,800
I was planning on holding out
till my brother got here...

701
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,880
...but the old buzzard
just refuses to die.

702
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,120
Yep, no matter what else they said about
you, Billy, I always knew you had sand.

703
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,080
Sorry for what I said.

704
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:17,360
It's okay, son. You
were right all along.

705
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,520
- Who are they?
- I guess they ain't Mennonites.

706
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,680
The way the man wears those guns
puts your mind to Wild Bill Hickok.

707
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,840
He's been dead 10 years.
Everybody knows it.

708
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,280
Let's get it done, boys.

709
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,120
They ain't budging, boss.

710
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,120
Let's give them a little prodding.

711
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,400
Hank, do it.

712
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,720
Come on.

713
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,520
Get ready.

714
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,280
Well, let's get to it.

715
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,440
- Yeah!
- Here.

716
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,080
This is your last invitation
to turn around and ride out.

717
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,520
Sheriff, your mother's a whore.

718
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,840
I have no mother.

719
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,360
It's still our 16 to your four,
sheriff. The odds are against you.

720
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,000
The odds are getting better.

721
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,440
Draw your gun! Come on!

722
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,320
Draw your gun! Shoot the damn thing!

723
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,880
Shoot him!

724
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,840
He shot me.

725
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,400
Yeah, it's a long
way from your heart.

726
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,040
Go! Now!

727
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,280
Go! Go! Go!

728
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,640
Get back!

729
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,520
- Sonny!
- Rose!

730
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:16,240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

731
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,080
It's funny.

732
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,920
It don't hurt none.

733
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,000
How come I'm not dead?

734
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,760
Welcome to Refuge, son.

735
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,960
Wild Bill Hickok.

736
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,760
I reckon the odds are against me now.

737
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,640
Put that gun belt back on.

738
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:33,200
We got one thing left to
settle. That's you and me.

739
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,200
Look at me, you son of a bitch.

740
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,240
Look at Blackjack Britton.

741
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,800
I guess I'm one of you now.

742
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,720
I wouldn't count on it.

743
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,240
Come on!

744
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,680
Come on!

745
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,640
Come on!

746
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,840
Come on!

747
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,680
Whoa!

748
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,120
Time to go home, folks.

749
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,960
The Creator may be
tough, but he ain't blind.

750
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,200
Climb aboard, Sonny.

751
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,080
- Do I have to?
- Well, you got nothing left to prove.

752
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,280
I'm gonna stay.

753
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,360
Refuge is a place
of hard rules, Sonny.

754
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,480
I know what it is.

755
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,920
And I think I'm gonna make it.

756
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,600
Well, good luck to you, son.

757
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,240
Your seat will be
here when you want it.

758
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,160
Come on!

759
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,280
