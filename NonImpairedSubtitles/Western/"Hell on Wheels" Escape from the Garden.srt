00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,465
You, sir, are under arrest

340
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,534
for murder of the first degree.

341
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:25,975
Hey! Hey!

342
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:28,378
- What's this, then?
- He was tryin' to swindle me.

343
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,679
Ain't that many 6s in no deck of cards

344
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:33,316
- I ever heard of. 
- Who are you?

345
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,353
Mickey Mcginnes,

346
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:38,086
the owner of this casino
and the mayor of Cheyenne.

347
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,624
And I'm your new federal marshal.

348
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,196
I'm charging this man with murder.

349
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,097
Check him, Mickey. He had 6s all day.

350
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,367

You're caught cheatin' around these parts,

353
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,954
you're liable to get what you're gonna get.

354
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,390
It's the rule of the law.

355
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,895
[Chuckles] The rule of the law?

356

Aye.

357
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,895
Everybody knows that.

358
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,935
You ever heard of such 
a rule of law, judge?

359
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,573
Can't say I have. Huh?

360
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,975
How shall we proceed, your honor?

361
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,477
I believe a trial is in order.

362
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:39,745
A trial?

363
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,579
An expeditious trial.

We'll see about that.

Out the way with ya!

367
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,640
Cheyenne has been touted

368
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:17,314
as the magic city of the plains.

369
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:20,617
It's my job to govern it into a new era,

370
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:23,987
as I did in the South following the war.

371
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,424
You were part of Johnson's
reconstruction effort?

372
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,758
Yes.

373
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:30,427
Part of that success. I was comm...

374
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,199
Uh, which success would that be?

375
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:36,038
Restoring rich, white southerners
back into power

376
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:39,408
or the persecution of the newly freed negro?

377
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,312
I was a corrective

378
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:47,517
to president Johnson's
lack of resolve in Atlanta.

379
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,054
We bent the city to the national will,

380
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:54,859
as I intend to do in Cheyenne...

381
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,296
With or without the help of Thomas Durant.

382

[Gunshot]

383
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,866
Gunshots are a common
occurrence in Cheyenne,

384
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,570
Mr. Campbell.

385
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:08,540
Regarding Mr. Durant,
may I quote you on that?

386
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,044
I wish you would.

387
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,556
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

388
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,257
Only you know my heart.

389
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,092
From the moment you saw me, you knew me.

390
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,393
I bear the mark of Cain.

391
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:28,428
Please forgive me.

392
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,963
I'm a sinner,

393
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,465
a killer of men,

394
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,836
enslaver of the sons of Adam.

395
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,805
I have defied not only God, but you as well.

396
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,775
Please...

397
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,843
I beg you...

Forgive me.

00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,448
Yes, my son.

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,519

Lead me to your heart,
I pray you, Bishop Dutson.

403
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,980
Father of the ward, gracious one,

404

you know me as you've known
me when heaven was young.

Yes. Yes, I know you.

406
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,958
I know your sinful ways.

407

Come with me

408

away from that path,

409
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,829
in God's glorious name!

410

By your hand, I beseech you
to remove my sin debt...

You are evil!

So long God has wanted me to
punish you for your atrocities.

00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:59,055
And you have. I'm indebted
to your righteousness.

You died and yet you were born.

No matter what cost,
no matter what sacrifice,

437
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,803
it was justified.
