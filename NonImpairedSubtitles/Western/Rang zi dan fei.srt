1
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,441
"To the end of horizon,"

2
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,784
"four corners of Earth,"

3
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:35,617
"scattered one's true friends."

4
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:41,665
"A bottle of wine for remaining joy,"

5
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:47,067
"as sun sets among the mountains."

6
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,934
Brilliant...

7
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,006
Counselor!

8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,768
You prefer the food or my singing?

9
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,878
I love them both!

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,809
Outstanding!

11
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,415
Brain and brawn have helped me far,

12
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,054
that's why I am so unique!

13
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,351
One must learn to live in style!

14
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,096
Governor, with your style and poise,

15
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,058
you remind me of...

16
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:20,604
a modern-day Robin Hood!

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,770
Bullshit!

18
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,203
Robin Hood is a common thief!.

19
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,310
with Samson's might and Solomon's wisdom!

20
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,980
- Bullshit!
- Yes, bullshit!

21
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,113
Counselor,

22
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,340
if you're trying to flatter me,

23
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,076
you must first woo my wife!

24
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,550
Compose a poem in her honour.

25
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,554
It must have a tempest, food,

26
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,886
a hotpot, some mist,

27
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,928
pretty maidens, and a mule!

28
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,741
Get up!

29
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,343
Let's eat, sing and be merry!

30
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,242
Sir, we are the elite Republican Guards,

31
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,177
here to ensure your safe passage!

32
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,146
We -

33
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,978
don't - need - to - eat!

34
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,351
You missed?

35
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,488
Let the bullets fly...

36
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,878
Two and Three come with me.

37
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,569
The rest round up the horses.

38
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,247
Raining hot pot?

39
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,261
Pop, we've looked all over.

40
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,235
There is absolutely nothing!

41
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,702
Should we just kill the two survivors?

42
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,246
Tell me where the money is?

43
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,276
Or I'll cut off your head,

44
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,317
when the alarm goes off.

45
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,282
Stop it!

46
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,487
Tears won't stop it from ticking.

47
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,656
You'd better come clean with them.

48
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,961
Who might you be, ma' am?

49
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,599
I'm the Governor's wife.

50
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,201
Forgive my impudence.

51
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,166
So you must be the Governor.

52
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,839
Yes, of course! There's money!

53
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,170
We're on our way to inauguration.

54
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,641
He ruined it all by getting drowned!

55
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,508
But we can still hit jackpot

56
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,183
if we take his vacant post.

57
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,313
I'll give you another chance. Tell me more.

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:56,988
$200,000...

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,088
- Where is it?
- Bought the post with it.

60
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,280
- What for?
- To make more money.

61
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,550
- How much?
- Twice as much.

62
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,818
- How long will it take?
- A year.

63
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,188
I've to wait one year?

64
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,626
A month, if you're in luck.

65
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,561
- Who will be the governor?
- Me.

66
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,631
- And who might you be?
- I'm a counselor.

67
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,030
You dare to impersonate the Governor?

68
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,171
They've never met him.

69
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,704
- Done this before?
- Twice a year.

70
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,874
- Since when?
- Eight years ago.

71
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,067
You've made more than $6.4 million?

72
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,303
That's what the "Governor" made.

73
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,744
I only get the small change.

74
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,575
Ever failed?

75
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,752
We use our brains, not brawn.

76
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,215
Where are you heading to?

77
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,479
Goose Town.

78
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,657
How do you explain
the hold-up and the bodies?

79
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,190
I bought the train and hired the soldiers.

80
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,759
No one will ever find out.

81
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,926
Don't take it off!. Leave your mask on!

82
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,688
I know the rules.

83
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,956
No one lives after seeing a bandit's face.

84
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,929
Just wait here for me.

85
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,966
I'll bring you the money once I have it.

86
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,159
We came to rob a train,

87
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,337
we can't go empty-handed.

88
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,063
No, you can't.

89
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,606
If you die for peeking at me...

90
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,038
That's even worse.

91
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,007
Can I borrow those bodies?

92
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,773
Yes. These bullies deserve no better.

93
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,712
But what do you want to do with them?

94
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,079
They can be more useful than the living.

95
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,585
Take a look at me.

96
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,189
Look at me!

97
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,120
Just one look!

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,827
- What's your name?
- I...

99
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,723
- What's your bloody name?
- Tang.

100
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,397
I'll be the Governor,

101
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,758
and you'll be my counselor!

102
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,194
Let's go and rule Goose Town.

103
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,131
Ma'am, coming with us?

104
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,966
Well, why not?

105
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,574
Brothers, let's move on to Goose Town!

106
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,267
Goose Town here we come!

107
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,170
We've messed up badly.

108
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,714
End up drowning your husband.

109
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,142
I feel bad about it.

110
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,979
I've already been widowed four times.

111
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,888
Don't let there be a fifth time, then!

112
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,647
That's all up to you.

113
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,087
What's important for a couple?

114
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,160
In love.

115
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,955
I can't hear you.

116
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,290
In love.

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,660
Six, come greet your Mom.

118
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,029
I wish you well, Mother.

119
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,238
You bring your son to battles?

120
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,464
His father was a comrade. Died in battle.

121
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,506
So I adopted him as my god son.

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,769
Now you're my mother.

123
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,946
After we're done with Goose Town,

124
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
you must come and join our gang.

125
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,574
Then you can continue to play mother.

126
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,546
One should always aim high.

127
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,911
After serving as county governor,

128
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,177
I can't return to banditry.

129
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,684
I won't be able to handle it.

130
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,652
Once you've scaled Mount Everest...

131
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,756
Such eloquence!

132
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,948
Then what should we do?

133
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,553
"Bring him back from the front for a laugh! "

134
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,653
We can continue to be civil servants!

135
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,593
Use your brain, not brawn.

136
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,427
Think twice before you make a move.

137
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,795
Got it.

138
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,771
Counselor!

139
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,001
We're government officials now.

140
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,405
We can't act like bandits!

141
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,013
What is a good governor's virtue?

142
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,477
Forbearance.

143
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,179
"Goose Town"

144
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,684
You've escaped once.

145
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,049
Try this one more time...

146
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,657
You'll have me beheaded!

147
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,198
Let's go!

148
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,301
City girls are so fair and delicate!

149
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,205
"Wanted, Dead or Alive! "

150
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,877
Pop, look!

151
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,444
Look what they've made of you!

152
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,274
The less it resembles me, the safer I am!

153
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,927
Welcome, your honour!

154
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,301
Appointment Warrant!

155
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:08,201
Ma Bangde is appointed Goose Town Governor

156
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:14,368
by authority of the Provincial Chairman,

157
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,176
on this 28th day of February,
the 8th year of the Republic...

158
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,048
Master Huang has arrived!

159
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,224
Greetings to Master Huang!

160
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,485
Good fortune to Master Huang!

161
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,186
Huang Silang is the local godfather.

162
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,266
Made his fortune
from opium and human trafficking.

163
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,334
Master is currently engaged.

164
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,528
So he sends his majordomo, Hu Wan!

165
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,607
And his militia coach, Wu Zhichong!

166
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,267
To welcome you, sir, with his hat!

167
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,574
Who dares win!

168
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,717
Do you dare?

169
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,533
He's here, sir.

170
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,532
Who's here?

171
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,367
Yourself!.

172
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,732
Long live Master Huang!

173
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,374
Greetings from Yang Wanlou!

174
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,544
A remarkable fake!

175
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,072
A remarkable fake!

176
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:22,804
Take a few steps.

177
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,243
Take a few steps.

178
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,414
Walk purposefully.

179
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,111
Purposefully...

180
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,313
Walk with spirit.

181
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,254
Spiritedly...

182
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,428
Walk pensively.

183
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,859
Pensively...

184
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,270
Why isn't she afraid?

185
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,839
She must be daft.

186
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,575
Know why we shot these bandits?

187
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,612
It's because they ambushed the Governor.

188
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,410
Let this be a lesson to all!

189
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,677
Never mess with the Governor!

190
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,754
Hail the Governor!

191
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,984
Peace and justice is here!

192
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,834
Great speech!

193
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,597
Remember what I told you?

194
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,704
The dead can be really handy.

195
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,669
You're absolutely right.

196
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,778
Such arrogance!

197
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:33,610
He's trouble.

198
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,480
A show of force!

199
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,316
This one is a tricky customer!

200
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:39,914
Should we strike first?

201
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:40,922
No hurry.

202
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,758
Let's toy with him.

203
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,327
No hurry, let's toy with him!

204
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,224
Cut it out!

205
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,693
Cut it out!

206
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,266
Cut it out!

207
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,304
Cut it out!

208
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,066
Cut it out!

209
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,833
Cut it out!

210
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,533
Cut it out! Cut it out!

211
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,235
Cut it out! Cut it out!

212
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,278
Cut it out...

213
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,347
Cut it out...

214
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,781
Cut it out!

215
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,916
Cut it out!

216
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,522
Cut the bloody hell out!

217
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,253
Butler!

218
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,554
Yes sir!

219
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:18,994
Take him to the dentist.

220
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,893
Fix him up with gold teeth like mine.

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,032
Yes sir!

222
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,064
Madam!

223
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,566
The reason I am here,

224
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,803
is to get rich,

225
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,831
not to get laid.

226
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,500
We share a bed,

227
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,670
but not our dreams.

228
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,480
Here's a pistol.

229
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,384
Just in case,

230
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,683
I overstep my mark,

231
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,717
shoot me between the eyes.

232
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,251
But if you have that urge,

233
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,655
then yours truly,

234
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,694
would be happy to oblige.

235
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,568
Let's sleep!

236
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,047
Husband and wife - even for a day...

237
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,368
I've always wanted to be a governor's wife,

238
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,066
and I don't care who the governor is.

239
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,033
So, brother, be my guest!

240
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:39,973
Your guest?

241
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,907
Go ahead!

242
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,546
You make me blush!

243
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,010
Well, do I?

244
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,014
Then I must oblige.

245
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,683
We're late!

246
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,616
Previous governors

247
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,052
have levied tax for the next 90 years!

248
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,489
So everyone has paid up to 2010!

249
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,025
We've come to the wrong place!

250
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,091
I like this town, though.

251
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,131
But people here have nothing left.

252
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,734
I never take from the poor.

253
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,871
Who are your victims, then?

254
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,596
The rich, of course.

255
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,637
Ever been a Governor?

256
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,672
No.

257
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,104
Listen carefully!

258
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,506
You have to devise ways to raise money,

259
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,704
Make the rich pay first,

260
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,680
townsfolk will follow suit.

261
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,911
Then reimburse the rich with what they paid,

262
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,522
and split the rest 30-70!

263
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:26,782
We only get 70?

264
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,653
No, the rich get 70.

265
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,489
We get 30 at Huang's discretion.

266
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,391
At whose discretion?

267
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,656
Him.

268
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,491
Him?

269
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,292
I come all this way,

270
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,266
only to become his running dog?

271
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,563
Correct.

272
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,268
It's hard enough robbing your train,

273
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,374
and play-act governor.

274
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,872
I still have to play
boot-licker to the rich,

275
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,603
make up silly excuses,

276
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,846
and do things at his whim.

277
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,674
Doesn't that make me a beggar?

278
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,147
If you want to put it that way...

279
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,583
Many would love to be in your position,

280
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,451
but few could afford to buy a post.

281
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:11,465
Do you know why I became an outlaw?

282
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,402
It's because
my legs are not built for kneeling!

283
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,833
If you want to make money standing tall,

284
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,375
ride back to the mountains.

285
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,871
I don't get this.

286
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,705
I am now governor,

287
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,578
how can I be worse off than a bandit?

288
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,446
You may be a governor to the townsfolk.

289
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,050
But in the eyes of Huang,

290
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,949
you're a mere beggar!

291
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,091
This is only business. There is no shame.

292
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,490
The hell there isn't!

293
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:39,921
It's shameful!

294
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,156
Do you prefer to stand tall,

295
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,357
or do you want to make money?

296
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,264
I want to do both.

297
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,062
No way.

298
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:46,794
Why not?

299
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,938
It's impossible.

300
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,069
Can I make money with this?

301
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,766
Yes, but only as a bandit.

302
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,670
Or with this?

303
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,610
Yes, but only on your knees.

304
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,581
Combining the two,

305
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,448
can I make money standing tall?

306
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,286
Mr. Nine, who exactly are you?

307
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,360
"Pocky" Zhang!

308
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,230
Stop it! This is not a tree!

309
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,460
It's an ancient magisterial drum!

310
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,761
Totally neglected,

311
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,063
it's taken root and sprouted leaves.

312
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,330
Pop said to me,

313
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,440
we need this to convene court.

314
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,041
He wants to try a case.

315
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,370
What case?

316
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,843
Has someone filed a complaint?

317
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,139
It's been here for 100 years.

318
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,679
If you now unveil the drum,

319
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,373
who knows what case it may bring?

320
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,609
Where's your old man?

321
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,751
In bed.

322
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,047
At this hour? Who with?

323
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,555
What happened?

324
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,358
Where is it going?

325
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,096
Look what you've done!

326
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,896
Drum...!

327
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,241
Out of my way!

328
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,705
It's homing in on me!

329
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,515
Help! Help!

330
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,007
My wine is ruined,

331
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,145
my mood destroyed!

332
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,506
Everything's spoilt!

333
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,379
I'll deal with you another day.

334
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,385
The drum is shattered!

335
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,548
So there must be a case to try!

336
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,725
Court!

337
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,269
How have you been wronged?

338
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,305
I'm not.

339
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,438
If no one is wronged, case dismissed!

340
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,509
Sir!

341
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,011
I have wronged Master Wu.

342
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,182
I was careless.

343
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,977
I ran into him and knocked over his wine.

344
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,847
Completely ruining his day.

345
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,285
I need to kowtow and apologise. Sorry!

346
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,515
That was nothing.

347
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,284
How dare you say nothing?

348
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,192
Kneel!

349
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,987
He coaches Huang's militia.

350
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:25,595
Go easy on him.

351
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,321
During the reign of the last Emperor,

352
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,000
I was bestowed a Martial Scholar.

353
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,964
My rank was higher than yours.

354
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,104
You should kneel in front of me!

355
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,499
Kneel!

356
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,903
Kneel!

357
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,268
This is bullshit!

358
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,973
The last Emperor? Have I ever met him?

359
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,341
If you'd been a Literary Scholar,

360
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,982
he'd have to kowtow 200 times.

361
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,778
But as a Martial Scholar,

362
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,011
you'll get only 100 kowtows.

363
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,483
Since he has already done 200,

364
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,419
you've to return 100 kowtows.

365
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,387
But I've only kowtowed twice!

366
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,788
Does it really matter?

367
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,421
Do it!

368
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,688
Flog him!

369
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,330
That's no good.

370
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,162
This is more effective.

371
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,738
Stop! I'll do it.

372
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,772
Splendid!

373
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,135
You kowtow, and you do the counting.

374
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:21,279
One, two, three, four...

375
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,351
Hail, Governor!

376
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,715
Stand up everyone!

377
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,051
No one is worth kneeling to.

378
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,187
Least of all to me!

379
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,589
I've brought three things to Goose Town.

380
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,695
Justice,

381
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,333
justice,

382
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,594
and god-damned justice.

383
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,829
Hail, Governor!

384
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,234
Stand up! No kneeling!

385
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,207
That's better.

386
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,872
No kneeling?

387
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,673
He was not only flogging me,

388
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,975
he was slapping you in the face!

389
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,879
When my butts stop hurting,

390
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,082
I will personally avenge you.

391
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,318
Summon the noodle vendor.

392
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,161
If our governor loves to try,

393
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,823
we'll give him a case to try.

394
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,467
Pop, you were brilliant today.

395
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,333
Flogging that martial scholar was a hoot!

396
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,036
I'd love to be a governor one day.

397
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,507
I don't want you
to be a bandit or politician.

398
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,339
When your father entrusted you to me,

399
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,486
I promised I'd raise you properly.

400
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,417
Then what should I do?

401
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,858
Study and learn to enjoy this.

402
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,354
There is no sound!

403
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,561
Politicians only know how to bully.

404
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,359
This gramophone was broken,

405
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,232
Now it is fixed.

406
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,735
Once we're done here,

407
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,429
I'll let you study abroad.

408
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,299
3 years in the east,

409
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,000
3 in the west,

410
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,039
and 3 more in the south.

411
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,770
How about 3 years in the north?

412
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,314
No, you're born in the north.

413
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,909
Who is this by?

414
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,050
I think it's Wolfgang.

415
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,820
Sometime known as Amadeus.

416
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,791
We call him M-o-z-a-r-t.

417
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,522
You can tell by listening?

418
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,996
It depends.

419
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,668
On what?

420
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,235
If his name was printed there.

421
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,744
Pop, this Mozart...

422
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,710
How did he get the sound in there?

423
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,943
You'll learn by studying abroad.

424
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,151
Where's this Mozart?

425
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,328
How can I find him?

426
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:50,128
He is far away from us.

427
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,394
Know what you have to do?

428
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,229
Yes.

429
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
Who ordered you to do this?

430
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,310
Who, sir?

431
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,302
Did I tell you to do it?

432
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,505
Yes, sir. You did.

433
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,341
No, it's "me"!

434
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,141
You?

435
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,148
You, you yourself!.

436
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,253
Yes, me and me alone.

437
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,581
I can't hear you.

438
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,779
It's my own plot.

439
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,255
There are no co-conspirators.

440
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,360
Saviour! My saviour!

441
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,691
Saviour!

442
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,098
You're addressing me?

443
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,063
Since when have I become your saviour?

444
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,801
You spared my life,

445
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,774
and I'll save yours in return.

446
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,072
Do tell.

447
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,180
Never sleep with a widow.

448
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,550
It's very bad luck!

449
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,718
She?

450
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,298
Is she really a widow?

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,690
She doesn't act like one.

452
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,628
But I witnessed her husband drowned!

453
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,871
If she really is a widow,

454
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,640
Then I must not...

455
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,250
leave her alone un-comforted.

456
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,085
That's my first move.

457
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,358
Within three...

458
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,054
they'll either leave with tails
between their legs,

459
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,766
or stay and become our poodles!

460
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,868
Right, absolutely right.

461
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,769
You're looking for me, sir?

462
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,440
Have you entertained our new officials yet?

463
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,369
Not yet.

464
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,736
The Governor doesn't frequent brothels?

465
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,038
He'll never make a good governor.

466
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,578
I don't indulge much in sex.

467
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,443
So you won't make a good governor either.

468
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,320
Why is that so?

469
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,319
The two bear no comparison!

470
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,048
Governors come and go.

471
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,227
But you, sir, will always be our godfather!

472
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,591
You speak well!

473
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,425
I'm sure they will come.

474
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,298
Eavesdrop their every conversation,

475
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,407
report their every move.

476
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,301
Yes.

477
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,775
Go now. Just don't become a Mata Hari!

478
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,408
Who's Mata Hari, Master?

479
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,650
What kind of whore are you?

480
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,051
She's the world's
most infamous double agent!

481
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,021
You two can leave.

482
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:41,037
Now the Governor is in bed with his wife.

483
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,533
Let him enjoy one more night in peace!

484
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,777
The Governor's boy is in trouble,

485
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,345
your presence is requested at the teahouse.

486
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,847
Why don't they convene at the magistracy?

487
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,348
The magistracy is just for show.

488
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,647
All cases are tried at the teahouse.

489
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,117
Master Six,

490
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,154
you've eaten two bowls of jelly,

491
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,418
and paid only for one.

492
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,118
Bullshit! I have only eaten one bowl!

493
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,729
And I paid him for one.

494
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,830
How many bowls did he eat?

495
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:08,965
Two...

496
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,259
No way!

497
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,958
Master Six is the Governor's godson,

498
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,831
why would he want to cheat you?

499
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,939
But he ate two bowls and paid for one.

500
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,601
The Governor brings justice to our town.

501
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,870
Good!

502
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,139
And justice is what I seek today!

503
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:24,940
Hear hear!

504
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,517
From the Governor's son, of course.

505
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,848
Ate two bowls, paid for one!

506
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,991
That's so wrong!

507
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,251
Since his boy is guilty of unjust,

508
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,053
the Governor's crusade is bullshit!

509
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:38,922
Screw you!

510
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,759
Master Six...

511
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,128
Master Six is the Governor's godson!

512
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,737
Would he cheat over a bowl of jelly?

513
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,702
Did you see it with your own eyes?

514
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,173
You double-crosser!

515
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,538
What's wrong with you?

516
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,973
You're thinking with your butts?

517
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,816
It's not about my butts.

518
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,412
We're here for the truth!

519
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,179
One or two bowls?

520
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,412
No beating about the bush!

521
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,183
I admire your courage, sir.

522
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,559
I know how to count!

523
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,856
I ate only one bowl!

524
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,533
You ate two and paid for one.

525
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,566
If you can't afford it, my treat!

526
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,896
I can afford all the jelly in this world!

527
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,303
But I pay only for what I ate.

528
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,775
How many bowls did he eat?

529
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,538
Let's be frank.

530
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,716
He wants to be treated fairly.

531
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,180
It's wrong to bully a commoner.

532
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,029
Are you an honest person?

533
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:46,797
Yes, I am...

534
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,159
How many bowls did I eat?

535
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,767
Tell him!

536
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,396
Speak up!

537
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,805
Stop threatening this poor man with a gun!

538
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,000
Who doesn't carry a gun around here?

539
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,374
Noodle vendor!

540
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,475
How many bowls did he eat?

541
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,582
Everyone in this teahouse,

542
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,123
will bear witness on your behalf.

543
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,088
Speak up! How many?

544
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,196
Two bowls.

545
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,776
You're nasty!

546
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,817
But I dare you to match me!

547
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,346
Take a good look!

548
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,787
If there are two bowls of jelly in me,

549
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:48,924
I'll die!

550
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,186
If there's only one,

551
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,125
I'll die.

552
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,594
If he has two bowls in him,
I'll die with him!

553
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,470
Where's the jelly?

554
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,240
Deeper! I can't see.

555
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,809
Very gutsy, sir!

556
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,109
Try sliding the blade sideways,

557
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,251
so that we can all see.

558
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,081
Show us if there is one or two bowls.

559
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,654
Out with it!

560
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,595
Here's a bowl, sir.

561
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,536
See! Can you see?

562
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,106
One bowl!

563
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,836
There's only one bowl, right?

564
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,244
Hang in there! I'll get a doctor!

565
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,553
There's only one bowl, right?

566
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,883
There's only one bowl, right?

567
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,093
Your turn!

568
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,467
I knew it all along.

569
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,132
You fell for it.

570
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,636
You mustn't kill him! No, I won't!

571
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,940
Tell me why I should spare him,

572
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,702
or I'll shoot you, too.

573
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,813
Don't let Six die in vain!

574
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,609
I didn't do it. He stabbed himself.

575
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,716
We'd a wager.

576
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,886
He lost.

577
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,620
Let me blast his head off!.

578
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,756
You wouldn't dare! You can't do it.

579
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,857
Huang is provoking you.

580
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,219
He wants you to lose your head.

581
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,190
We'll lose if we kill him now.

582
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,090
Let him go.

583
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,731
You must destroy Huang's soul!

584
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,558
- Pop, he's right.
- Let him go!

585
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:48,137
He stabbed himself?. What about the jelly?

586
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,335
Yes

587
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:50,510
and no...

588
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,707
Tell me if it was still jelly.

589
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,543
Yes, it was.

590
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,083
Come over here.

591
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,681
And...

592
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,979
is he dead?

593
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,520
Yes.

594
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,859
Did you implicate me?

595
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,793
I did invoke your name.

596
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,261
Were they scared?

597
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,867
They said to kill, a person's soul
must first be destroyed.

598
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,369
Murder? Soul destruction?

599
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,241
How awful.

600
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,814
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

601
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,418
Brother, I swear I'll avenge you!

602
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,430
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

603
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,068
Two is drunk. I am pledging for him.

604
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,999
He will avenge your death, too.

605
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,413
Brother, I swear to avenge you!

606
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,874
Two is sober, he's just pissed off!.

607
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,840
Chief doesn't want to risk our lives.

608
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,020
Are we boy scouts or what?

609
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,249
Chief should have ignored Tang.

610
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,424
He is a good-for-nothing!

611
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,729
Huang kills without lifting a finger!

612
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,803
We must retaliate by destroying his soul.

613
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,463
We can't jeopardise our chance to get rich!

614
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,119
Six...

615
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,013
I do not care about being rich.

616
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,986
But I must come up with a game plan

617
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,121
to rid of Huang once and for all

618
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,360
Give me time,

619
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,799
Pop will avenge your death.

620
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,904
Show your respect!

621
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,201
Have a safe journey, Six.

622
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,675
Safe travel, Six!

623
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,085
How should I play my hand?

624
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,250
Banquet, kill him or throw him to the dogs?

625
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,085
I'd say kill him!

626
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,090
No!

627
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,319
No?

628
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,295
Host a banquet!

629
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,693
Dinner invitation! It's a death trap!

630
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,165
Our ploy is working!

631
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,632
I have another idea: delay tactics.

632
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,931
The longer we drag this on the better!

633
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,199
Huang will end up kneeling here.

634
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,706
What kind of banquet is this?

635
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,502
It's just a meeting between two thugs!

636
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,270
It's like MacBeth hosting Banquo.

637
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,709
What'd become of Banquo the guest?

638
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:38,506
His son became king.

639
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,842
And MacBeth the host?

640
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,412
So we should go.

641
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,482
We can also sound out Huang,

642
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,684
and see if we can work together.

643
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,654
"Bring the guns. "

644
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,165
"Dress up as Huang's militia and follow me. "

645
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,164
Got it!

646
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,768
"Kill Huang and avenge Six! "

647
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,302
Understood!

648
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,306
You see Six's death
as a shortcut to bonanza?

649
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,713
Perhaps your severed head can make us more.

650
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,970
What do you mean?

651
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,179
Let's go and meet your new pal.

652
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,750
Attention!

653
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,947
Governor, counselor! Welcome!

654
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,208
Master's citadel dominates Goose Town.

655
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,978
It is simply impregnable.

656
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,390
An intrepid governor, an erudite counselor.

657
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,821
What a dream team!

658
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,925
Master Six has died heroically.

659
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,365
I've invited you here today

660
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,869
to witness how justice is done.

661
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,904
If I'm proven to be the instigator,

662
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,337
I will follow Master Six's footstep,

663
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,340
and disembowel myself!.

664
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,241
I invite you to be my second,

665
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,575
to ritualistically cut my head off

666
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,887
and hang it from the restaurant.

667
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,617
If I'm proven innocent,

668
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,955
those who slandered me

669
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,955
and shamed you in the process...

670
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:37,765
will have to kill themselves.

671
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,302
It's me against these three.

672
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,303
I am ready.

673
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:53,041
You should use this for disembowelment.

674
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,875
The full blade is for your second.

675
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,110
Really?

676
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:03,925
It's great to have an expert as my second!

677
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,826
This way, please.

678
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,466
I bought this governorship.

679
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,101
Sole purpose is to get rich.

680
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,739
But I don't take from the poor.

681
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,601
Then who are you targeting?

682
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,708
Only the wealthy people.

683
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:20,673
Who are the wealthy?

684
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,106
Such as you.

685
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,817
Whatever you fancy, help yourself.

686
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,383
I'm no bandit. I'm a governor.

687
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:38,289
I make my fortune the proper way.

688
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,224
Well said!

689
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,359
Goose Town has two big families.

690
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,467
They sell people
to America to build railroads,

691
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,160
in return for dollars!

692
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,770
What do you mean by dolls?

693
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,602
No, d-o-l-l-a-r-s! American money.

694
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,834
Dollar! You know?

695
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,410
Oh, dollars!

696
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,276
I can smell it in your presence!

697
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,679
- Let's drink to that!
- Great, cheers!

698
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,252
Cheers!

699
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,355
Master Huang is so modest.

700
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,619
It is an open secret that,

701
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,022
in Goose Town,

702
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,088
Master Huang is our real boss!

703
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,166
It is hard to be a boss.

704
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,905
Hundreds of people everyday

705
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,573
waiting to be fed.

706
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,072
There is little left for me.

707
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,940
If you're looking to make a fast buck,

708
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,274
I know exactly what to do.

709
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,517
Please tell.

710
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,944
Pocky Zhang!

711
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,924
One of them just died!

712
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,973
Pocky Zhang?

713
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,340
Yes, Pocky Zhang!

714
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:08,382
What has he got to do with us?

715
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,451
Or with our money?

716
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,622
Everything!

717
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,813
Is he here in Goose Town?

718
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,185
Well, yes...

719
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,493
and no!

720
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,793
Master Huang speaks in riddles!

721
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:31,202
Where is he, then?

722
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,969
Let Master Huang enlightens us.

723
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,141
He has grabbed Goose Town by its balls!

724
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,406
- Know what I mean?
- No

725
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,208
Know what I do for a living?

726
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,043
No.

727
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,152
Half the opium smokers in this nation

728
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,117
rely on Master Huang for their supply!

729
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,225
No, I'm only a pawn for General Liu.

730
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,657
I'm just one of his runners!

731
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,955
How many runners does Liu have?

732
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,632
Three.

733
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,896
And Master is the most able one!

734
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,831
Yes, the strongest one!

735
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,402
But this runner,

736
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,663
is now crippled!

737
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:03,596
Crippled?

738
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,331
What happened?

739
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,739
Zhang has seized nearly all my goods.

740
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,345
Imagine what he can make from them.

741
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,573
He must be very well off!.

742
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,148
I wonder if this is true.

743
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,212
You can write your own cheque,

744
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,912
if you can take him out!

745
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,989
We wouldn't dare to!

746
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,717
But if this can make us rich,

747
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,988
I wouldn't mind having a go!

748
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,369
Then blame yourself for your timidity!

749
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,298
But I would be happy to assist.

750
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,565
I can put up money as a bait.

751
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,506
The families have to match my contribution.

752
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,180
We're hoping you'd say that.

753
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,713
How about $800,000?

754
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,680
No! I'll put up $ 1.8 million!

755
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,751
The more the merrier!

756
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:55,585
Yes, we'll pay you back $ 1.8 million,

757
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,627
and split the dollars from the others.

758
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,399
There's no need to pay him back!

759
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,361
We'll hit these bandits hard!

760
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,798
Whatever they seized in the past,

761
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,131
we will retrieve for the Master.

762
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:10,835
Look at the bigger picture,

763
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,306
the $ 1.8 million bounty
is but a strand of hair.

764
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,308
Surely you won't mind!

765
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,505
We'll get rid of Pocky Zhang!

766
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:19,414
Cool!

767
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:20,584
- Cool enough?
- Very cool!

768
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,116
We can discuss that later.

769
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,980
The only thing I want to do now

770
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,952
is to fix Master's crippled leg.

771
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,622
Pocky Zhang's such a nuisance.

772
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,421
He shouldn't have messed with Master Huang!

773
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,319
Let's top up.

774
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,263
I believe in taking our time,

775
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,902
doing things step by step!

776
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,696
I don't want to break my balls

777
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:42,903
by over-stretching!

778
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,098
We should agree on the split first,

779
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,469
before thinking of how to fix his leg.

780
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,611
If you want to settle the split now,

781
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,041
then just carry on.

782
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,072
Counselor, you decide.

783
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,277
About the dollars,

784
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,749
let's do a customary 30-70 split.

785
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,354
How can you even say that?

786
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,082
Master Huang is so instrumental.

787
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,659
And you give him only 30%?

788
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,621
Let's go 50-50!

789
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,500
My apologies, Master Huang.

790
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,635
So inconsiderate!

791
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,827
Counselor,

792
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,440
I'll go along with that: 50-50.

793
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,610
If you've the guts to take on the bandits,

794
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,677
the dollars from the two families,

795
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,808
are but strands of hair!

796
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,539
Strands of hair!

797
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,445
May not be even that!

798
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,586
I know you have the courage.

799
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:31,955
But ability-wise...?

800
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,149
How do I know if you can overcome Zhang?

801
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,096
May I ask you a question, sir?

802
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:40,820
Go ahead.

803
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,556
If Zhang can seize your goods,

804
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,701
why can't he break in here?

805
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:49,361
My citadel is impregnable.

806
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,167
There's no way that he can get in.

807
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,367
Are you sure

808
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,604
that we're the only ones here?

809
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,954
An order to retreat!

810
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,623
- Split?
- You sure?

811
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,859
Let's split.

812
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,853
Did you hear that?

813
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:15,826
Yes.

814
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,400
Where Pocky fails to breach, I succeeded!

815
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,800
I can kill him
when he is least expecting it.

816
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:28,811
Another one bites the dust!

817
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,004
Implicate me for all you like.

818
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,973
I couldn't care less!

819
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:37,119
Governor. I sense that you're special.

820
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:37,844
I am flattered.

821
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,580
But those who waged war on the bandits,

822
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,349
none has survived.

823
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,858
Why not?

824
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,690
Pocky Zhang is a tough cookie.

825
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,900
I met him once 20 years ago.

826
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,263
Isn't that fate?

827
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,106
How did it happen?

828
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,574
He stood by a lantern and turned towards me,

829
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,547
and I was standing in the shade.

830
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,176
He was well lit up,

831
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,351
and you're in the dark!

832
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,752
Quiet, quiet...

833
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,150
So it was there and then...

834
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:22,128
A bit like, here and now!

835
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,429
What a coincidence!

836
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,163
Exactly!

837
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,973
But you're missing something.

838
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,237
You mean his facial scars?

839
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,539
Of course not.

840
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,108
Then what is it?

841
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,943
You don't know how to play act.

842
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,778
Exactly!

843
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,284
A fortune teller told my mother

844
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,547
before I was even born!

845
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,418
He said my Achilles heel

846
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,321
would be my inability to play act!

847
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,154
Can I change it?

848
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,126
No way! It's in your genes!

849
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,198
But our counselor is a born actor!

850
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,596
Confusing dollar with dolls?

851
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,929
What is dollar?

852
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,402
American money!

853
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,373
A genius when it comes to play acting.

854
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,171
Counselor, cheers!

855
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,980
Thanks for your compliment, sir.

856
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,174
Allow me to play the fool for once.

857
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,514
After defeating the bandits,

858
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,656
we'll take just 20% of any opium recovered.

859
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,792
No, I insist 50-50!

860
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,587
To show my sincerity,

861
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,787
I'll send over $ 1.8 million now.

862
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,762
That's too soon. We haven't started yet!

863
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,299
Marie, Claire!

864
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,271
Master, I can't take women.

865
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,340
No interest in money or women,

866
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,568
what do you want?

867
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,939
A runner.

868
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,381
What runner?

869
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,517
Master Huang's
a runner of exceptional courage!

870
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:49,816
- Brother!
- Brother!

871
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,578
We can run side by side!

872
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,484
We'll run for our lives!

873
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,489
Roads won't exist in this world of chaos,

874
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,458
unless people like us run on them!

875
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,126
I see, I see...

876
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,631
Yes, me too.

877
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,001
Stupid bitch!

878
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,105
While flowers can blossom again,

879
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,304
time lost will never return.

880
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,873
This girl is as delicate as j ade.

881
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,417
Please don't be mad at her.

882
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,413
Master Huang, easy easy...

883
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,834
Shame we didn't meet until now!

884
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,062
Diamonds, the girl - they're all yours.

885
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,240
I've brought my wife with me.

886
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,908
So I can't take her home.

887
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,407
Then take the diamonds for your wife.

888
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,306
I accept them on her behalf.

889
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,605
Get up.

890
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,818
I thought you'd summoned two girls.

891
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,010
How come there's only her?

892
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,747
You mean she is Marie-Claire?

893
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,255
You are really naive!

894
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,120
She's adopted a fashionable name.

895
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,354
It's Marie-Claire!

896
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,097
There goes the last of them!

897
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,791
A wise counselor!

898
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,196
A tough governor!

899
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,032
Master, you're both wise and tough.

900
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,936
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

901
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,736
Supposing that you are.

902
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,374
You've already made a fortune

903
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,777
from "crippling" Liu's runners.

904
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,280
Why bother with Goose Town?

905
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,655
But if you are someone else...

906
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,489
Saviour?

907
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,877
Kill the chicken and take the eggs.

908
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,346
Let him die in his own bed.

909
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,949
Don't kill him on his way home

910
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,022
after dining as my guest.

911
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,123
Understood!

912
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,054
Who is the "chicken"?

913
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,851
The Governor.

914
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:11,789
And the "eggs"?

915
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,963
I'll cut his balls off!.

916
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,333
Diamonds!

917
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,764
My two diamonds!

918
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,130
Don't worry, sir!

919
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,533
I'll retrieve your diamonds.

920
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,366
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,566
My pleasure, sir.

922
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,440
Know why I'm sending you?

923
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:31,375
It's because I'm already dead.

924
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,412
Do you know why?

925
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,844
I shouldn't have implicated you.

926
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:38,420
Right! If you are alive,
you'll eventually die.

927
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,385
But if you're dead,

928
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,583
you may live on forever!

929
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:44,726
Understood.

930
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,121
Kill the chicken, take the eggs!

931
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:48,957
Where's Chief?.

932
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,258
Punch drunk!

933
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,695
Where is he?

934
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,870
We're still chatting just now!

935
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,295
I must be drunk, too!

936
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:55,994
I'll sort you out later.

937
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,698
He must've fallen off the horse.

938
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,279
I heard that you slept.

939
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,918
Look up when you speak.

940
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,549
I heard that you slept last night.

941
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,192
I sleep every god-damned night!

942
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,686
Look at me when you speak.

943
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,490
You slept with the bandit?

944
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,758
Do you want a blow-by-blow account?

945
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,333
Tell me more.

946
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,369
When a seasoned pro meets a bandit chief,

947
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,337
anything could happen!

948
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,144
What now?

949
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,685
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

950
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:43,782
What did you call me?

951
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,979
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

952
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,686
If I'd more time,

953
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,520
I'll put you in your place!

954
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,854
Come on!

955
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,525
I dare you!

956
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,861
You're all talk!

957
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,260
A perverted, dirty old man.

958
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,529
Could you have bought the post

959
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,138
without my money?

960
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,899
Don't piss me off!.

961
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,167
I think the bandit is more able!

962
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:09,869
What do you mean?

963
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,012
He's got more balls than you!

964
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,977
He's good at getting drunk!

965
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,181
These will make your day!

966
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,188
Three of Huang's dogs died today.

967
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,292
I know they're not worthy of you.

968
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,758
I was going to lead our brothers,

969
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,095
engage Huang in a deadly duel,

970
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,361
and avenge your death.

971
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,904
But I've changed my mind.

972
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,103
I can't take revenge this way.

973
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,577
I can't risk more lives.

974
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,477
Chief, we're looking for you.

975
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:48,946
Why did you signal retreat?

976
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,915
Huang heard your whistling.

977
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,884
I knew that I was safe.

978
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,291
Leave, I want to spend time alone with Six.

979
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,857
It has finally dawned on me,

980
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,227
why I became a bandit in the first place.

981
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,269
I was no match for these people.

982
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,663
But I must take them
on at their own game now,

983
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:12,968
and to win for you.

984
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,680
What the heck?

985
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,585
You stole my diamonds.

986
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,891
They're not meant for you.

987
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,118
They're a gift for Mrs. Governor!

988
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,830
Which of us is the Governor?

989
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,196
Who's the Governor?

990
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,668
Tell me who's the Governor!

991
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,568
You want to kill me?

992
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,173
Or to sleep with me?

993
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,937
Is there a difference?

994
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,239
It's different!

995
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,507
I can bed you first, and kill you later.

996
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,648
Then you'd better kill me now.

997
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,945
I don't sleep with dead bodies!

998
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:08,397
I won't take drunken advantage of a widow,

999
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,129
so I'll just sleep next to you,

1000
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,069
not with you!

1001
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,345
Holy smoke! I was fooled!

1002
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,384
You and Wu both faked death!

1003
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,283
That's right.

1004
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,252
Why dressed up as a bandit?

1005
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,755
I'm a bandit. "Pocky" Zhang's my boss!

1006
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,484
What's your rank, then?

1007
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,354
I am Three!

1008
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,052
Three, you've hit big time!

1009
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:14,992
You've got yourself a fake!

1010
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,961
Chief, don't listen to his bullshit!

1011
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,327
He plotted Six's death.

1012
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,433
Let me shoot him now!

1013
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,193
Chief?.

1014
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,995
Were you sent by "Pocky" Zhang?

1015
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,729
Or by Master Huang?

1016
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,032
I want the right answer!

1017
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,976
- Master Huang.
- Why?

1018
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,237
We commit crimes posing as bandits,

1019
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,213
forcing governors to launch expeditions.

1020
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,905
Creating more chances for Huang to swindle.

1021
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:34,674
And then?

1022
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:35,544
- That's all.
- Really?

1023
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:36,719
I don't know anything else!

1024
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,353
Why did you target my bed?

1025
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,080
Master said you're arrogant,

1026
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,280
a threat!

1027
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,858
Take him a message:

1028
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,052
While he likes people to fake death,

1029
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,722
I'm fond of killing people more than once!

1030
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,128
Letting me off again?

1031
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,802
He can only understand words you say.

1032
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,232
Chief, you're...

1033
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,030
Yes, "Pocky" Zhang.

1034
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,537
Where are your pockmarks?

1035
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,232
Does your boss have "Huang"
inscribed on his face?

1036
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:02,674
That's true.

1037
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,107
My friend,

1038
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,414
you must not tell anyone,

1039
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,243
that I am "Pocky" Zhang.

1040
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,076
You have my word!

1041
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,380
I never want to be a governor,

1042
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:17,184
but you still bought me this post!

1043
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,558
The position has been usurped,

1044
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:27,162
and now you're dead too.

1045
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,397
Huang has brought his militia.

1046
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,971
Wanting to fight bandits with us.

1047
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,539
She was my wife.

1048
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,573
- I am the governor!
- Let him in.

1049
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,269
I am Ma Bangde!

1050
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,785
Is the Governor okay?

1051
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,181
Give chase! Don't let anyone get away.

1052
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,060
Those god-damned bandits!

1053
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,093
Scum of the earth!

1054
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:58,424
The Governor has only just arrived...

1055
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,135
Said I didn't want to be a governor,

1056
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:10,404
but you still bought me this post!

1057
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,880
The governorship is now mine,

1058
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,112
but you've left me on my own.

1059
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,381
She was my wife.

1060
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,489
I am the governor!

1061
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,856
I am Ma Bangde!

1062
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,628
You're too hot-headed.

1063
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,798
You shouldn't have shot those bandits.

1064
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,268
They'll take revenge for sure.

1065
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,133
Don't cry.

1066
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,539
She died for Goose Town.

1067
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,381
She deserves a proper burial!

1068
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,511
Invite every townsfolk to attend.

1069
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:55,054
Certainly. I'll take care of it.

1070
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:05,765
"Here lies Madam Governor"

1071
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:11,532
"Master Six rests here in peace"

1072
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,641
...to be relieved of life's burden.

1073
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,905
Thus we commit their bodies to earth.

1074
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,879
From which they came,

1075
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,221
and do now return.

1076
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,448
We know we can place ourselves,

1077
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,029
in the hands of our Father in Heaven,

1078
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:39,201
who has promised us eternal life.

1079
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,838
We're from "Pocky" Zhang's gang.

1080
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,771
We're here for the money.

1081
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,106
Sorry for the intrusion!

1082
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,606
We're looking for...

1083
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,372
Huang, heads of families, show yourselves!

1084
00:55:58,955 --> 00:55:59,785
Hu Wan?

1085
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,085
Father, our apologies.

1086
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,082
Ladies and gentlemen,

1087
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,023
the rest has nothing to do with this.

1088
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,127
Leave!

1089
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,495
Gag them!

1090
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,098
Get up!

1091
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,826
I'm the governor of this county.

1092
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,005
I volunteer to be your hostage.

1093
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,173
Just shut up!

1094
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,001
We spare you to deliver our ransom.

1095
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,938
Three days, pay up and they go home.

1096
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,508
- If not, they die.
- Shoot me first!

1097
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,043
- Stop it!
- Shoot me first!

1098
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,043
You're asking for it.

1099
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,580
Beat him up!

1100
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,376
You talk too much!

1101
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,786
I'll teach you a lesson!

1102
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,350
Stop messing with my mask!

1103
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,288
Don't screw things up.

1104
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:39,553
Take them away!

1105
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:41,924
- It's him.
- Three!

1106
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,064
Pack them!

1107
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,596
No one goes until we get his ransom.

1108
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,463
Butler, stay calm!

1109
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,872
One, two, three...

1110
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:55,708
Huang is in there!

1111
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,539
One, two, three...

1112
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,073
You plotted this scheme

1113
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,181
over my wife's dead body?

1114
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,282
I am impressed!

1115
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,316
We'll kill the hostages in 3 days!

1116
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,149
Remember, I am Nine!

1117
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,516
That was quite a show.

1118
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,059
- Almost pass for real!
- Sure.

1119
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,754
It'll be more convincing with some blood.

1120
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:16,989
Right!

1121
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,799
Was that necessary?

1122
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,301
Was that really necessary?

1123
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,574
Shoot! Give them hell!

1124
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,976
Butler, hold your fire!

1125
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,015
We need time to prepare the ransom.

1126
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,780
Otherwise they will kill the hostages.

1127
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,014
Let them kill the hostages.

1128
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,523
In fact, I want them dead!

1129
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,525
Why do you think I need a double?

1130
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,925
I'll not pay any ransom.

1131
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,124
But the families will pay up.

1132
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,962
You'll get your money for sure.

1133
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:55,996
Brother,

1134
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,173
I'm fine.

1135
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,706
Don't worry about me.

1136
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,879
Hu Wan must have defected to Zhang.

1137
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,013
He must be found,

1138
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,946
dead or alive!

1139
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,187
A double is useful. Find me one, too.

1140
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,948
Pocky, have you no shame?

1141
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,352
The game's up!

1142
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,082
Really?

1143
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,157
Yes, game's up.

1144
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:22,354
The fun has only just begun.

1145
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,328
Amen!

1146
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:35,706
Release them.

1147
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,346
Here's a souvenir. Don't look back. Scram!

1148
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:46,615
Ma' am, if you're still alive,

1149
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,791
you'd see this for yourself.

1150
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,688
If she was alive, there'll be nothing here.

1151
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,728
She traded her life for this.

1152
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,631
Doesn't Six's life count?

1153
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,561
It's different.

1154
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:58,563
God-damned it isn't!

1155
00:58:58,768 --> 00:58:59,393
My wife.

1156
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,091
Whose wife?

1157
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:00,928
Mine.

1158
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:01,603
What about her?

1159
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,669
She was murdered by Huang.

1160
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,865
But Six died at his own hands.

1161
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:08,505
I'll shoot you dead,

1162
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,645
for demeaning our Six!

1163
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,178
Two, put down your gun.

1164
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,314
Stop pointing your gun at me!

1165
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,643
I've never seen bandits as dumb as you!

1166
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,587
Stop laughing! Cut it out.

1167
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,623
I didn't belittle Six! He had courage!

1168
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:24,884
He was a hero!

1169
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,391
Yes, he was heroic.

1170
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:32,796
My wife went to sleep and died in bed.

1171
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,761
Don't cry! Your wife was heroic, too.

1172
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,970
Brothers, why are we here?

1173
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:38,970
To get rich!

1174
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:39,766
Have we succeeded?

1175
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,000
Yes, we have.

1176
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:42,574
So let's leave!

1177
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,336
Let's go.

1178
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,274
Why are you still in tears?

1179
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,139
I'm overjoyed.

1180
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,679
Chief, when do we leave?

1181
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,408
We're not.

1182
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,821
This is not Huang's money.

1183
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,855
But the money's still good!

1184
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,357
I want Huang's fortune.

1185
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,560
You refuse to take money from rich or poor...

1186
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,496
The blood debt of Six and Madam,

1187
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,830
must be repaid by Huang!

1188
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,336
You're gambling with our lives!

1189
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,599
You call this a gamble?

1190
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,835
Yes, and you'll end up a loser!

1191
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,474
We're not leaving.

1192
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,076
We don't want this money either.

1193
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,217
Give them away.

1194
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,613
But Chief...

1195
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:27,682
Who do you want to give this to?

1196
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,156
To the poor.

1197
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,084
Who are the poor?

1198
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,162
Those in dire need.

1199
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,379
You wore "Nine" when you ambushed me.

1200
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,614
What am I wearing now?

1201
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,018
Feel it for yourself.

1202
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,620
"One"!

1203
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:07,185
Fun, isn't it?

1204
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,295
Brilliant!

1205
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,965
Haven't you always wanted to play God?

1206
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:10,792
Yes.

1207
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,298
What has it got to do with Huang?

1208
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,631
If I am God,
ridding him should be a piece of cake.

1209
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,783
I think I know her.

1210
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,146
So do I!

1211
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,753
Let's give her some money.

1212
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:34,956
Hang on!

1213
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,820
She is not exactly poor, is she?

1214
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,188
So who are the poor?

1215
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,888
Those who're forced
to sell their own children.

1216
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,194
Correct! She was sold by her parents.

1217
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,700
Make sense!

1218
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,710
So you're bandits in disguise!

1219
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,481
We've come to give you money.

1220
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,287
Kill her. No option!

1221
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,764
Whoever sees a bandit's face has to die.

1222
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,401
It's your own rule.

1223
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:21,797
Counselor.

1224
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,665
The first to see our faces

1225
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,171
was you!

1226
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,211
Our mission is only half accomplished,

1227
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,403
and we're bickering over a broad!

1228
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,855
You're the lead drummer at my inauguration?

1229
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,834
What's your name?

1230
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,196
Call me Flora.

1231
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,529
Are you related to Huang?

1232
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,502
No, he bought me.

1233
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,973
There are posters by the city gate.

1234
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:06,940
Know what they're for?

1235
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,245
Bounty offers for "Pocky" Zhang.

1236
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,387
I am "Pocky" Zhang.

1237
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,755
The bandits were behind this.

1238
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:22,491
Is it because of the masks?
We have masks too!

1239
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,266
Then it must be the Governor!

1240
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,931
He is giving money to the poor?

1241
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,532
No bogus governor would do that.

1242
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,013
I want you to dress up as bandits.

1243
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,808
Exactly like them.

1244
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,816
What they give out, you take away.

1245
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,178
Let's cause havoc!

1246
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:47,486
Understood.

1247
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,784
I'll have him checkmate in 3 moves!

1248
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,461
But we've made 3 moves already.

1249
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:55,596
Really?

1250
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,663
Driving Six to death,
killing the chicken for the eggs...

1251
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,299
Those were old moves!

1252
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,493
I'm talking about 3 new moves!

1253
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,571
First, check out the Governor.

1254
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,868
He doesn't act like someone
who'd buy a post.

1255
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,875
At least, he's not Ma Bangde.

1256
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,543
Have you found Hu Wan?

1257
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,478
Hu Wan? Not yet.

1258
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,345
How come he is still missing?

1259
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,614
Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.

1260
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,086
Do you know...

1261
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,528
how much I miss him?

1262
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,801
On master's order, let's wreak havoc!

1263
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,509
Let's show how we can mess things up!

1264
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,644
Did you get your share?

1265
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,318
Yes.

1266
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,918
How are you going to thank us?

1267
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,781
Any way you like.

1268
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:00,657
Any way I like? Great, you said it!

1269
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,834
Know why we gave you money?

1270
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,693
It is because you're benevolent.

1271
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,031
Benevolent?

1272
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,831
We can do even better!

1273
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,676
Batter! Batter!

1274
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:34,060
Governor, we want justice!

1275
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,288
It's all over! We're finished!

1276
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,400
Even rabbits wouldn't do this.

1277
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,067
Six men, in front of her husband,

1278
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,363
and in broad daylight!

1279
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,472
Disgusting!

1280
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,142
I've never even done this with lights on!

1281
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,506
If you're desperate, paid for it!

1282
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,074
Be extravagant!

1283
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,039
Visit a brothel!

1284
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,841
It won't cost much!

1285
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,552
You don't even have to be discreet.

1286
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,145
This is stupid!

1287
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,050
You're worse than bandits!

1288
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,252
And we'd wanted to leave a good impression!

1289
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,486
One word comes to mind: revolting!

1290
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,460
Our scheme is now in ruin!

1291
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,632
Disgusting!

1292
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,127
Filthy, nauseating...

1293
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,903
Revolting!

1294
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,677
You know me.

1295
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,315
When it comes to this sort of thing,

1296
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,544
I prefer to be passive...

1297
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,280
You know me,

1298
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,020
I am a lone wolf,

1299
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,619
always acting on my own.

1300
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,156
You know me,

1301
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,626
If it was me,

1302
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,233
she wouldn't have lived to squeal.

1303
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:50,898
You know me.

1304
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,699
I may be the eldest,

1305
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,042
but I am...

1306
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,275
still a virgin.

1307
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:03,946
Stop staring at me!

1308
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,121
You know me well.

1309
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,820
If I was responsible,

1310
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:09,557
the one on the receiving end,

1311
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,817
would have been her husband!

1312
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,870
Each of you is so unique.

1313
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,166
But...

1314
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:26,302
I've been betrayed.

1315
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,635
By who?

1316
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,172
Tang!

1317
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,348
How could he overlook the obvious?

1318
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,708
Huang is behind this scam.

1319
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,184
Tang's not behaving properly.

1320
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,149
He must be up to something.

1321
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,457
Come out! Stand up!

1322
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:54,025
Who have you been seeing lately?

1323
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,303
Master Huang?

1324
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:56,468
Don't move! Raise your legs.

1325
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,105
- Who's there?
- A boy, my child!

1326
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,365
- Your child?
- Yes, mine.

1327
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,437
You're a child?

1328
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,869
- How old are you?
- Eight!

1329
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,403
Come out!

1330
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,609
He's eight?

1331
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,408
I find it hard to believe myself!.

1332
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,984
As tall as Mom when he was three.

1333
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,748
Taller than me when he was five...

1334
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,456
Screw you!

1335
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,321
Mom, mom!

1336
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:20,586
Screw you!

1337
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:21,961
Hands off my boy!

1338
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,429
- Screw you!
- Screw you, too!

1339
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,999
Screw you!

1340
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,230
She's your mother?

1341
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,167
Yes, she is.

1342
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,032
And he's your dad?

1343
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:34,573
None of your god-damned business.

1344
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,266
Stop it!

1345
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,108
Ma' am, what's going on?

1346
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,339
I come for money.
I won't leave until he pays.

1347
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,516
He owes you?

1348
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:45,585
It was eight years ago in Shanxi.

1349
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,621
This crook made me pregnant.

1350
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,018
He is a man of poor repute.

1351
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,448
Ran up a mountain of debts,

1352
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,649
then vanished without trace.

1353
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,626
Creditors kidnapped my younger son.

1354
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,061
He'll die if I don't clear his debts.

1355
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:58,891
He's not my child!

1356
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:00,068
He is!

1357
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,429
- He isn't.
- He is!

1358
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,571
He is! I counted the days!

1359
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,039
He swindled someone.

1360
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,375
His victims tracked you down,

1361
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,135
and kidnapped your younger son.

1362
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:11,774
Threatening death...

1363
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,778
Yes, so I need the money.

1364
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,972
Pay her.

1365
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:16,746
Money! The stones...

1366
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,048
Just a small gift,

1367
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:21,851
to mark our acquaintance.

1368
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,891
I don't want these. I want real money.

1369
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,493
You stupid idiot...

1370
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,497
These diamonds are worth a fortune!

1371
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,632
No kidding?

1372
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,527
Bicycle!

1373
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:36,636
I can ride that?

1374
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,602
We rode one once in Shanghai.

1375
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,301
You have been to Shanghai?

1376
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,439
Pudong!

1377
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,542
I'm sure you'd fall over.

1378
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,839
Come on. Try it.

1379
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,011
Hop on!

1380
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,453
Let's go!

1381
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,329
Bicycle!

1382
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:09,869
Bicycle!

1383
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,876
made of flesh and bones...

1384
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,346
Have I come to the wrong place?

1385
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,711
Or at the wrong time?

1386
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,744
Serve your customers.

1387
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,645
They're my customers.

1388
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:24,978
We're here first.

1389
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,017
Have they paid?

1390
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,213
The " bicycle ride" doesn't count.

1391
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,253
Show them out.

1392
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,188
But I've paid my dues.

1393
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,056
With what?

1394
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,623
Money you received through the window?

1395
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,235
Isn't that bandit money?

1396
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:45,135
I wonder if they are also bandits.

1397
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,208
No, they work for the Governor.

1398
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:51,945
How dare you
pay their tab with bandit money?

1399
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:53,978
Cut the crap! Let her go!

1400
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,248
White knights to the rescue!

1401
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,819
White knights to the rescue!

1402
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,852
I'm no damsel in distress.

1403
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,294
They're no knights in shining armour.

1404
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,481
After all, they're customers.

1405
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,718
I've already settled their bills.

1406
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,585
You taught me yourself,

1407
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,560
customers are always supreme!

1408
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,389
Isn't that right?

1409
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,294
Yes!

1410
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,030
Correct!

1411
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,454
Instead of knights coming to your rescue,

1412
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,188
they are being saved by a damsel.

1413
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,694
You're turning into a Mata Hari.

1414
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:33,306
You've just pissed him off.

1415
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,844
He doesn't need to be pissed off.

1416
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,449
If he wants you dead,

1417
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,051
you die!

1418
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,050
I should've put a bullet through his head.

1419
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:41,950
That would be the end of it.

1420
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:43,590
Don't be silly.

1421
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,784
Chief wants to go after his fortune.

1422
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:50,797
If you're here for the money, then...

1423
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,101
why are you giving it away?

1424
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:55,326
Is this the right colour?

1425
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,834
Lower the umbrella.

1426
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,839
The red is fine. Come over here!

1427
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,941
First apply green, then red.

1428
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,043
Okay, got it.

1429
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,474
Understand?

1430
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,041
Don't forget to lock up.

1431
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,547
- Bring the shovels.
- Got it.

1432
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,947
- Six shovels!
- Got it.

1433
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,282
Chief, how do I look?

1434
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,393
Hair is fine. F ace is flushed. Come here...

1435
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,992
Apply that to a dead man's face

1436
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,425
will turn it into pinkish red.

1437
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,122
- Got it.
- Good.

1438
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:26,265
Green.

1439
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,597
Come here.

1440
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,364
Green is the base colour.

1441
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,697
Add that and you'll get this!

1442
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,470
- Oh, I see...
- Got it?

1443
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:36,541
You want shovels like these?

1444
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:37,803
Shorten them and put them in the bag.

1445
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:38,502
How short?

1446
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:39,772
Short enough for the bag.

1447
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,449
Hurry up! Six shovels!

1448
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:42,708
Where are you going?

1449
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,283
What's with the make-up?

1450
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,783
Are you leaving for good?

1451
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,123
Come with us to give out money?

1452
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,485
No, what a waste!

1453
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,591
- So you're not coming?
- No.

1454
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:58,194
Now listen.

1455
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,163
This time, I may come back,

1456
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,529
but, then again, I may not.

1457
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,671
If I do, you can leave with us.

1458
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:06,500
If not, you plan your own getaway.

1459
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,539
Aren't you just giving out money?

1460
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:09,608
Yes, we are.

1461
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,006
By the way,

1462
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,745
at midnight tonight,

1463
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,249
someone may come calling.

1464
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,012
Engage him in conversation.

1465
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,779
Whatever the topics,

1466
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,919
just chat along with him.

1467
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,656
But...

1468
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,762
you have to stay calm,

1469
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,989
make it nice and slow.

1470
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,623
You saw it with your own eyes?

1471
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:34,734
Indeed.

1472
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,737
You saw the Governor leading his men out?

1473
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:39,600
Yes, with my own eyes.

1474
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,969
They've gone to give out money?

1475
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,166
Yes, indeed.

1476
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,367
Which mask does he wear?

1477
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,137
"Nine".

1478
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:49,215
Splendid. Tonight we shall only kill!

1479
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,043
Our target?

1480
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:51,344
The Governor, wearing "Nine"!

1481
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,148
Masked or not, consider this done!

1482
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,416
All of you, put on your masks!

1483
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:00,125
"Firefight with bandits,

1484
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,888
intrepid Governor killed! "

1485
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,630
That would be music to my ears!

1486
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,106
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1487
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,372
"Nine".

1488
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,309
Let's all change to "four"!

1489
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,313
Kill anyone who is not a "four"!

1490
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,455
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1491
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:29,783
"Four".

1492
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,583
Know what we'll be wearing, then?

1493
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:32,691
Got it.

1494
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,886
Let's get rid of "Nine"!

1495
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,781
Master Huang, what brings you here?

1496
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,487
Can I not visit the magistracy?

1497
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,252
Light it!

1498
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,651
When the cat prowls,
the mouse seizes control!

1499
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,059
Sit down!

1500
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,103
Where's the Governor?

1501
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,301
Everyone is a "Four"? I'm confused!

1502
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,410
I'm confused, too!

1503
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,706
It's bad to stay out in a thunderstorm.

1504
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:27,779
Yes, it's awful.

1505
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,814
Let's reschedule. Split!

1506
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:30,916
Be in touch!

1507
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,017
What now?

1508
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,482
It's back to square one.

1509
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,384
Yes, square one.

1510
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,021
Split! 1, 2, 3.

1511
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,397
Listen! Someone's been shot.

1512
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,404
Soon someone will mourn.

1513
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:59,744
Mourning will lead to confessions.

1514
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:02,945
Confess!

1515
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,845
You've at least three confessions to make.

1516
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,780
I shouldn't have given your diamonds away.

1517
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,924
Try again.

1518
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,699
I suggested "to kill someone,
first destroy his soul".

1519
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,263
Not that either.

1520
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,512
We should have hosted the banquet instead.

1521
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,804
The banquet?

1522
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,014
I can't hear you.

1523
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:44,917
I can't hear you!

1524
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,151
There was a shoot-out.

1525
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:49,489
Six killed. We're unscathed.

1526
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,069
Counselor, come take a look.

1527
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,379
Your saviour may be among them.

1528
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,674
No, you are my saviour.

1529
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:12,685
If that is the case,

1530
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,480
remove his mask,

1531
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,486
and have a good look.

1532
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,750
Come on, lights!

1533
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,264
What's going on?

1534
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,435
What's happening here?

1535
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:31,930
It's Hu Wan!

1536
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,400
Hu Wan?

1537
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,041
How come it's Hu Wan?

1538
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,134
This is weird!

1539
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:39,011
All those wearing "four"

1540
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,272
are my men!

1541
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,540
Where are the bandits?

1542
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,409
Where are they?

1543
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,415
Hu Wan was a bandit!

1544
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,918
He was one of them!

1545
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:51,790
Murderers and kidnappers,

1546
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:54,018
those who terrorised Goose Town,

1547
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,721
were led by your own Hu Wan!

1548
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,761
I wondered why
you didn't fund the expedition.

1549
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,268
You may even be the bandit chief himself!.

1550
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,140
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1551
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,410
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1552
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,847
Do you want a shoot-out?

1553
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:21,118
Take a good look at a bandit's fate!

1554
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,587
I'd still have him shot

1555
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,387
if he was my father...

1556
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,922
sooner or later!

1557
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,934
You just shot Hu Wan 5 more times.

1558
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,127
You want to show justice?

1559
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:38,863
Or to make sure he's dead?

1560
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:43,738
Only "Pocky" Zhang
would want to silence him.

1561
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,544
If you'd only wanted to show justice,

1562
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,512
why not fund my expedition instead.

1563
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,774
Done deal!

1564
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:56,547
You shall receive a nice surprise in 3 days.

1565
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:59,625
He was Hu Wan's boss.

1566
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,020
Now he's your boss, too.

1567
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:03,689
Please act as our interpreter.

1568
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,831
What is a "nice surprise"?

1569
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,698
Interpret for me.

1570
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:09,961
There's nothing to interpret

1571
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:13,471
What on earth is a "nice surprise"?

1572
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:14,835
It is what it is.

1573
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,271
You just don't get it, do you?

1574
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,140
Go ahead and interpret. What is it?

1575
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:19,870
A nice surprise!

1576
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:21,070
Translate for me!

1577
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,945
What is this "nice surprise"?

1578
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:28,054
What is this god-damned "nice surprise"?

1579
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,156
What is this "nice surprise"?

1580
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:31,689
It means that in 3 days,

1581
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,794
I'll put up $ 1.8 million for your campaign,

1582
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,190
to fix my crippled leg!

1583
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,524
Is that clear?

1584
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,199
That's the "nice surprise"!

1585
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,232
Interpret.

1586
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:45,062
Interpret.

1587
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,070
The nice surprise is that,

1588
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,403
he will give you $ 1.8 million in 3 days,

1589
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:51,977
to fund an expedition to fix his broken leg!

1590
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,474
What a nice surprise!

1591
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:57,444
I'm willing to wait 3 days.

1592
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:01,988
Master Huang.

1593
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,815
I adore my Counselor,

1594
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,124
I can't let you have him.

1595
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,359
F air enough.

1596
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,299
Six.

1597
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:24,036
We're almost there.

1598
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:26,477
Say, 70% done.

1599
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,645
I've asked Two to take off first.

1600
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,814
He'll wait for us at Emerald Creek.

1601
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,619
I will keep my promise.

1602
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:39,889
Know what you have to do?

1603
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:41,690
Yes.

1604
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,927
When $ 1.8 million is in hand,

1605
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:50,332
I'll consider Six avenged.

1606
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,200
I feel that...

1607
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,868
my wife's death is also avenged.

1608
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:05,278
Saviour, you still want to kill Huang?

1609
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,614
I'm not your saviour. Huang is.

1610
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,393
You're my saviour. Not him.

1611
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,953
Did you think I was lying dead back there?

1612
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:17,063
No, of course not.

1613
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:17,731
Sure?

1614
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,524
Never crossed my mind.

1615
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,106
I've to hand this to you.

1616
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,209
Abracadabra, and Hu Wan magically appeared!

1617
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,776
But I really didn't get it.

1618
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:33,671
Those six bodies,

1619
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,474
such a distance, so little time,

1620
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,811
how did you move them so quickly?

1621
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,146
Huang and I took the shortcut.

1622
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:41,379
You've to carry six bodies.

1623
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,022
How did you manage?

1624
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,554
They weren't buried at the magistracy.

1625
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,452
The bodies were buried there all along.

1626
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:52,728
I ensure the standoff
was at their burial site.

1627
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:56,635
That's where I led Huang to.

1628
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,132
I'm convinced you're "Pocky" Zhang.

1629
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,036
Sit down.

1630
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,147
My name is Zhang.

1631
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:11,181
I know that.

1632
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:12,546
Zhang Muzhi.

1633
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,278
A fine name!

1634
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,650
It has auspicious meanings.

1635
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:21,258
You father must have high hopes.

1636
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,287
After graduating from military academy,

1637
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:27,101
I enlisted in General Cai's army.

1638
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,593
Served as captain of his riflemen.

1639
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:31,302
How old were you then?

1640
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,700
Seventeen.

1641
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,872
A youthful genius!

1642
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:39,308
Cai was wounded during the Battle of Luzhou,

1643
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,948
and later died in exile in Japan.

1644
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,446
I came back alone.

1645
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:50,419
The country was in total chaos.

1646
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:54,823
So I became a bandit.

1647
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,397
They nicknamed me "Pocky".

1648
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:03,667
Shame! You're so handsome.

1649
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,772
People have an odd way of thinking,

1650
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:09,268
that bandits shouldn't have proper names.

1651
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:11,942
They love calling their bandits "Pocky".

1652
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,012
Not only that,

1653
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:18,582
they want their bandits scarred and scary.

1654
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,886
People can be so ignorant.

1655
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:27,926
My own story started like this...

1656
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:32,963
I too was a tenderly 17,

1657
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:36,164
and so was she.

1658
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,099
Stop, I'm not interested.

1659
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:43,243
I don't confess to just anyone.

1660
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,512
I've to continue now that I started.

1661
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:46,873
Take it back!

1662
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,073
It's all made up anyway.

1663
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,016
You're a conman!

1664
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,715
In our part of China,

1665
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:04,125
There are only two such landmines.

1666
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:06,029
Both limited edition.

1667
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:20,475
Made in U. S.A. - 1910!

1668
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:26,179
Bang and everything's in smithereens!

1669
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:31,848
So if it doesn't take some lives with it,

1670
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:36,562
it'd be such a waste.

1671
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:38,258
Well...

1672
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,794
where's the other one?

1673
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:41,661
It exploded.

1674
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:42,427
Really?

1675
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,730
The first bang during the 191 1 Revolution!

1676
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,531
Oh yes, I've heard!

1677
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,402
It went off at Xinhai!

1678
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,939
Xinhai's not a place!
It's a revolutionary icon!

1679
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,912
You should've said so earlier.

1680
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:57,982
Now, tell me about this one.

1681
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,710
You must stay focused.

1682
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:02,545
I want it to shake the world,

1683
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:06,193
I want it to rock and roll!

1684
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:07,086
Understood.

1685
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,455
Pick a good spot,

1686
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:10,562
find an auspicious time...

1687
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,562
So, who's our target?

1688
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:13,961
You should've asked...

1689
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:14,897
"Where"?

1690
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:16,400
Where, then?

1691
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,572
Where the expedition force must pass.

1692
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,170
Yet another expedition?

1693
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,034
Can I have a bigger cut this time?

1694
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:26,179
You can have it all
if you're the real Pocky!

1695
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,973
No problem, sir. I'm a fake.

1696
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,310
I'll take whatever you can spare.

1697
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,482
When do you want it to blow up?

1698
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,848
That's our denouement!

1699
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:38,386
Let's play out our second act slowly.

1700
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:39,784
Hold still!

1701
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,553
Let her speak.

1702
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,960
Two left without saying goodbye.

1703
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,491
Now Three is leaving too.

1704
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,565
You are tearing us apart!

1705
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:52,632
You're doing this for Two or Three?

1706
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,171
Shut up!

1707
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:56,740
I know your left hand's intention,

1708
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,139
I know your right hand's intention.

1709
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,211
But both hands together... I don't get it.

1710
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:02,076
I'd rather be dead!

1711
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:03,011
Typical Scorpian!

1712
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,642
Shut up!

1713
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:06,845
Sit down, all of you.

1714
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:08,719
Let me talk to her.

1715
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,022
You were bought by Huang?

1716
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:13,751
Yes.

1717
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,122
- Been mistreated?
- Yes.

1718
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,422
- Have I ever laid hands on you?
- No.

1719
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,689
- Hate him?
- Yes.

1720
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:18,695
- And me?
- No.

1721
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,868
Then why threaten me with a gun?

1722
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:21,694
Because you're a good person.

1723
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,063
What?

1724
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,402
What kind of stupid logic is that?

1725
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,302
You threaten me because I'm good?

1726
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,543
Flora, Chief is right!

1727
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,277
Go back! Sit down!

1728
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,006
You bunch of idiots!

1729
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,274
I told you to give money to the poor.

1730
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:37,348
And you gave it to her?

1731
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,952
I warned you but nobody listened.

1732
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:41,883
Shut up! You're a born cheat!

1733
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,489
Always plotting to swindle me.

1734
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:45,454
Working with Huang behind my back.

1735
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,719
When a bandit confronts a godfather,

1736
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,089
the outcome should be simple.

1737
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,231
How can you screw up so badly?

1738
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,059
How dare you still point your gun at me?

1739
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:54,801
If I don't dare to draw a gun on you,

1740
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,664
I'll never make a good bandit.

1741
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,496
I dare you all!

1742
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:04,140
Whose quirky idea is this?

1743
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,704
Whose?

1744
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,273
I was just teasing her.

1745
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,321
You want to become one of us?

1746
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:18,356
Yes, to give money out to the poor,

1747
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,426
to hear and share their joy.

1748
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:24,795
You're now one of us.

1749
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,125
But I am not prepared.

1750
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,323
No need!

1751
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:28,695
Did you make preparation?

1752
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:29,767
No.

1753
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,528
How about you?

1754
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,865
I was eating hotpot and singing songs.

1755
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:35,736
My train plunged and I ended up here.

1756
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,941
We're leaving Goose Town soon.

1757
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:42,110
But you have to stay.

1758
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,215
No.

1759
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,746
A bandit must have discipline.

1760
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:47,352
Chief is right.

1761
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,255
But she has a point, too.

1762
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:58,728
I have an important mission for you.

1763
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,230
I think you can manage.

1764
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,760
This is our nice surprise!

1765
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,330
A nice surprise indeed.

1766
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,537
He is not Ma!

1767
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,147
Now that we know,

1768
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:20,649
My next move can be more leisurely.

1769
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,186
Leisurely?

1770
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,691
Impersonating a governor
warrants capital punishment.

1771
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:27,588
His whole clan dies with him!

1772
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:29,285
Master, just you wait.

1773
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,158
I'll go and blow him away!

1774
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,424
No!

1775
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:33,622
Before they die,

1776
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:36,395
I want to toy with these circus monkeys.

1777
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:37,730
But Master,

1778
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:40,037
they're not worth your while.

1779
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,732
No, I must toy with them!

1780
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,408
Otherwise, I couldn't get others to pay,

1781
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:50,573
the Governor couldn't go
and fight the bandits,

1782
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:55,151
and they wouldn't trot on my landmine!

1783
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:56,751
Huang has a double.

1784
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,255
They are indistinguishable.

1785
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:02,486
I can't tell if this is really Huang.

1786
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:04,255
I need you to check for me.

1787
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:09,692
He's a fake.

1788
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,201
He's not Huang.

1789
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,431
Told you I'm not Huang!

1790
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,575
I really am not him.

1791
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:16,539
I'm certain.

1792
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,177
Let me go.

1793
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:20,438
Keep an eye on him until our return.

1794
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:23,242
If you have to, use your guns.

1795
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,108
I've never used a gun.

1796
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:26,920
Three, show her how.

1797
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:46,606
Is that your photo?

1798
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:47,772
Yes, it's mine.

1799
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,138
Sure?

1800
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,401
Yes,

1801
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,609
I was slimmer then.

1802
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,378
I don't think it's you.

1803
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:56,842
It isn't?

1804
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:57,879
No, it isn't.

1805
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,552
I don't think so either.

1806
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:01,881
No, that ain't me.

1807
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:04,317
What is this all about?

1808
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,425
I was totally baffled myself.

1809
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:10,555
When I bought the post, I needed papers.

1810
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,132
I had my picture taken at a gallery,

1811
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:15,799
and that's what they gave me.

1812
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:18,198
I said the man in the photo wasn't me.

1813
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:22,031
They insisted that it was.

1814
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,138
I've no choice but to use it.

1815
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:25,805
Is that so?

1816
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,580
Bullshit!

1817
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,813
That's obviously me!

1818
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,009
I am the real Ma Bangde.

1819
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:34,487
Is that so?

1820
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:38,216
I was ambushed by bandits on my way here.

1821
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,953
He saved my life.

1822
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,892
So I let him take the post.

1823
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,692
After all, he's my nephew.

1824
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,232
Uncle, we shouldn't be telling him this.

1825
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:49,494
Shut up!

1826
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:53,139
I've travelled all over China,

1827
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,366
I have been governor in 9 counties.

1828
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:59,569
I excel in confusing facts with fiction!

1829
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:01,441
So, Governor Ma...

1830
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,547
Yes?

1831
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:04,615
He's addressing me.

1832
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,320
You were saying?

1833
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,489
Just as I uncover the truth,

1834
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:10,954
you blow your own cover!

1835
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:11,882
What a coincidence.

1836
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:16,393
" Stop frowning to dispel ill feelings,

1837
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:18,428
and brush aside quarrels with a smile. "

1838
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,066
Want to make peace?

1839
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,396
Splendid. Where's my double?

1840
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:25,605
Return him and we'll call it quits.

1841
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:26,932
We've killed him.

1842
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:29,766
Which asshole ordered his execution?

1843
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,740
You're that asshole!

1844
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,511
I dare you to pull your trigger!

1845
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,150
Lay down your guns!

1846
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:40,780
I know I could take you out first.

1847
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,786
Put down your guns on my count of three!

1848
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,688
One, two, three!

1849
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:50,895
Huang, put it down!

1850
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:52,759
He may be a brute, but you too?

1851
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:57,699
You're the worst!

1852
01:32:58,205 --> 01:32:59,365
When are you leaving for your expedition?

1853
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,629
We aren't.

1854
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:02,170
We can't leave without funding.

1855
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:03,775
We can't fight without leaving!

1856
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,475
You've failed to live up to your promise.

1857
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:08,012
You had agreed to

1858
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:09,341
lead the contribution

1859
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,381
in order to make the others pay.

1860
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,178
Not only have you not put up any money,

1861
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:16,550
you've also fought us posing as bandits!

1862
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,920
Wrong! You saw my men dressed up as bandits.

1863
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,493
I saw yours posing as bandits, too.

1864
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:24,096
But when the others see these bandits,

1865
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:26,027
they wouldn't know that they're fakes.

1866
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,497
Now is the time to pay for the expedition.

1867
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:32,104
If I pay, others will follow suit.

1868
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,705
Where's your money?

1869
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,475
It's all here.

1870
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,680
I've money stowed away everywhere!

1871
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,214
It's all here?

1872
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:49,821
This is only half of my share.

1873
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:54,084
Each family will have to put up the same.

1874
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,489
Uncle, this is a trap.

1875
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:57,396
A trap?

1876
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,494
After all these confrontations,

1877
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:01,497
he has not put up a dime.

1878
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,567
Why so generous all of a sudden?

1879
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:04,829
Did I surprise you?

1880
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:06,230
Yes, you did.

1881
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,634
I surprised myself too!

1882
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:08,907
Want to know why?

1883
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,468
Come here.

1884
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,410
I - want - to - be -

1885
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:15,406
Governor!

1886
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:16,640
You?

1887
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:18,284
I won't make a Governor?

1888
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:20,413
Don't I look the part?

1889
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,146
Yes, you can swear in as soon as we leave.

1890
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,756
Goose Town?

1891
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,722
I bought governorship of 6 more counties!

1892
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,089
I can't handle all on my own!

1893
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:31,791
That is why...

1894
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,057
Get out!

1895
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,932
Leave us.

1896
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,903
I need you to govern three of them for me.

1897
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,336
Brilliant! I'm good at governing.

1898
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,600
Hey, wait...

1899
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,801
What about me, then?

1900
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,172
You...

1901
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,239
can play "Pocky" Zhang!

1902
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:52,545
Great idea!

1903
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,418
Since the abdication of the last Emperor,

1904
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,688
Goose Town has 51 governors.

1905
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:37,193
They're all bastards, parasites and leeches!

1906
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,333
But our beloved Governor Ma,

1907
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,659
is neither a bastard, parasite,

1908
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,338
leech, nor a beast!

1909
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:49,407
He risks his life to combat the bandits.

1910
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:53,041
He is our hero!

1911
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:57,544
Counselor, please.

1912
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:03,648
It's time for heroes to take centre stage!

1913
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:06,985
It's time for heroes to show their mettle!

1914
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,652
We must rid ourselves of these bandits.

1915
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:12,364
We don't have a choice.

1916
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:15,397
Imagine, if you take your wife out,

1917
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:19,539
singing, eating hot pot and be merry,

1918
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:22,903
when bandits jump on you from nowhere!

1919
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:25,906
I long for a world without thieves,

1920
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,178
for days of wine and roses!

1921
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:30,642
Governor, please!

1922
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,980
March!

1923
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:50,566
Saviour,

1924
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:52,269
want to check this out?

1925
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:54,797
Isn't that the warrant?

1926
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:56,271
Read it out loud.

1927
01:36:57,878 --> 01:37:00,403
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed...

1928
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:01,478
Read on!

1929
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,343
8th month of the 8th year of the Republic...

1930
01:37:03,551 --> 01:37:04,882
Don't miss out the words in between...

1931
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:08,384
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed
Kang County governor...

1932
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:09,986
Hang on...

1933
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:12,056
Kang County?

1934
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:14,092
Not Goose Town?

1935
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,887
It has always been Kang County.

1936
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:16,585
You bastard!

1937
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:17,695
Blame yourself!.

1938
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:20,628
When you dumped me in the river,

1939
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,201
scared as I was, I had an inspired moment.

1940
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:25,964
I brought you to Goose Town.

1941
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:29,472
What's their difference?

1942
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:32,305
Kang County is affluent.
Goose Town is deadly.

1943
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:33,946
Why Goose Town for me?

1944
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:35,706
You're a tough cookie, aren't you?

1945
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:39,682
There can only be two outcomes.

1946
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:42,856
Either Huang kills you dead,

1947
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,922
and I'll move on to Kang County.

1948
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:47,992
Or we sort out Huang instead,

1949
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,389
like what's happening now.

1950
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:51,531
Very clever!

1951
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,460
You god-damned crook!

1952
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,497
One day Pocky will get you,

1953
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:55,760
and blast you to hell!

1954
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:56,766
You won't.

1955
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:58,438
You love me too much.

1956
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,335
You still think I'm "Pocky" Zhang?

1957
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,669
If not, the real one
must be somewhere around.

1958
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,744
We're doomed if we run into him!

1959
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:11,880
Speak of the devil!

1960
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:19,148
Tell our men to hold their fire!

1961
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,291
Scatter! Run for the peak.

1962
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:27,530
"Hold your fire. Scatter! "

1963
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:34,470
"Run for the peak. Grab their leader. "

1964
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:41,612
10 to the west.

1965
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:43,206
6 to the south.

1966
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:45,107
Another group to the east.

1967
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:46,478
Tell Seven to join Three!

1968
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:47,978
Secure our west flank.

1969
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:56,187
" Seven and Three to secure west flank! "

1970
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,832
"I'm there! "

1971
01:39:04,538 --> 01:39:05,630
"There are 1 1 of them, not 10! "

1972
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:08,933
"No sweat, let's share them! "

1973
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:19,215
"Done! "

1974
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,853
Message from Three. West is secured.

1975
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,856
These pheasant calls really work wonder!

1976
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:25,650
Tell them!

1977
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,918
Three joins Four to secure our south.

1978
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,459
Seven back to protect the Counselor.

1979
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:34,699
"Three and Four to secure the south. "

1980
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:38,360
" Seven back to guard the Counselor. "

1981
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:52,181
"I'm out-flanked. "

1982
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:56,587
"Throw the hats on my signal! "

1983
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:58,849
"I'll take the east. You the west. "

1984
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:17,540
Three and Four are done.

1985
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:19,873
I'm back. I'm back.

1986
01:40:21,482 --> 01:40:22,278
Stay with the Counselor!

1987
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:23,381
Understood.

1988
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:24,742
Counselor, come!

1989
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:29,019
Three!

1990
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:31,481
It looks like Two.

1991
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:34,317
Pocky Zhang is here.

1992
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:39,596
- Leave your money...
- It's Two.

1993
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:42,126
Is he dead?

1994
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:51,204
God-damned it!

1995
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:57,916
Tell everyone to go east.

1996
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,410
Bring one in for interrogation.

1997
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:01,679
I'll kill their leader myself.

1998
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:03,912
Let's move.

1999
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:09,761
Where's your leader?

2000
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:11,453
In the north, with a pockmarked face.

2001
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:12,824
Go north! On the hill.

2002
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:18,837
Am I dead?

2003
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:19,869
No, you're still alive.

2004
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,167
Do you want to signal a message?

2005
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:24,771
How do you whistle?

2006
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:35,449
Can you lead the way?

2007
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:37,487
No, I can't run any more.

2008
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,214
Follow me, then.

2009
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:39,517
I can't run.

2010
01:41:39,726 --> 01:41:40,852
You've only blown up your cheeks.

2011
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:43,020
Your legs are fine.

2012
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:50,000
"Chief is dead! Chief is dead! "

2013
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:52,303
The Chief is dead?

2014
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:56,106
You just signalled the Chief' s death!

2015
01:41:56,677 --> 01:41:58,167
Five, go check it out.

2016
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,838
Chief!.

2017
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:02,615
Chief!.

2018
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:04,441
Chief!.

2019
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:06,117
They said you're dead.

2020
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:09,084
Bullshit! Am I not alive?

2021
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,718
"Chief is alive and well! "

2022
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,091
Why missed out signalling " bullshit"?

2023
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:15,886
"You're full of shit! "

2024
01:42:16,096 --> 01:42:17,120
Hear that?

2025
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:19,857
He said we're full of shit.

2026
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:23,024
Wait.

2027
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:28,068
They caught the fake!

2028
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,536
You're "Pocky" Zhang?

2029
01:42:31,011 --> 01:42:32,205
Where are your pockmarks?

2030
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:33,443
No one asking that question has survived.

2031
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:34,909
Oops! I take it back.

2032
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:37,779
I've got something special.

2033
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,050
You can have them,

2034
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,618
in exchange for my life.

2035
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,121
What happened to them?

2036
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,088
If I tell you, will you spare me?

2037
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:47,692
Speak!

2038
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,056
I sawed the legs off the tall one.

2039
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,060
And the short one?

2040
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:52,163
She died of fright at the sight!

2041
01:42:55,702 --> 01:42:56,134
Counselor.

2042
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,394
Counselor...

2043
01:42:57,604 --> 01:42:58,536
Who's behind this scam?

2044
01:42:58,739 --> 01:42:59,797
Master Huang.

2045
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:01,731
Nice pockmarks!

2046
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:02,533
He burnt them.

2047
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:03,710
How many governors have you robbed?

2048
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:05,139
Will you spare me?

2049
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:05,902
Speak!

2050
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:08,741
I've killed five governors,

2051
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:10,211
and shared the loot with Master Huang.

2052
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:11,406
What's that?

2053
01:43:11,618 --> 01:43:13,449
A governor's silver umbrella.

2054
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:14,814
Take it!

2055
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:16,918
- Which way to Shanxi?
- I have four more.

2056
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:18,352
I know the way.

2057
01:43:18,559 --> 01:43:19,617
Will you spare me if I tell you?

2058
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:20,793
God-damned it! Speak!

2059
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:22,689
To the east, to the east!

2060
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:26,556
Come back! You mustn't go that way!

2061
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,831
But Shanxi really is to our east.

2062
01:43:37,244 --> 01:43:38,336
East...

2063
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:51,016
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

2064
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,055
Yes, I am.

2065
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:54,853
I am about to kick the bucket,

2066
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:57,291
don't lie to me.

2067
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,058
Don't worry.

2068
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:01,400
I really am "Pocky" Zhang.

2069
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,632
Pocky!

2070
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:06,896
My ass...

2071
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:09,668
it hurts.

2072
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:13,638
Counselor.

2073
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:15,841
Your ass is on that tree.

2074
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,914
You can't feel it.

2075
01:44:20,754 --> 01:44:25,851
On my ass over there,

2076
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:28,220
I have another five warrants.

2077
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:30,524
Take them.

2078
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:35,501
Promise never to return to Goose Town.

2079
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:40,667
You can't beat Huang.

2080
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:44,037
Take the money and run.

2081
01:44:44,478 --> 01:44:46,810
Don't worry, I won't go back.

2082
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:52,847
I lied about two other things.

2083
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:54,849
No big deal.

2084
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:56,545
No.

2085
01:44:57,257 --> 01:45:01,216
I must confess before I die.

2086
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:03,658
What was the first lie, then?

2087
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:08,229
Can I confess my second lie first?

2088
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,561
Yes.

2089
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:13,602
Do you still remember...

2090
01:45:56,216 --> 01:45:59,276
I can't quite figure you out.

2091
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,587
Counselor Tang or Governor Ma?

2092
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:04,524
Now that you're gone,

2093
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,623
"Pocky" Zhang, too, is no more.

2094
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:11,897
F act or fiction no longer matter now.

2095
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:19,072
For you, I'll go back and finish this war!

2096
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:21,799
Brothers!

2097
01:46:22,509 --> 01:46:23,703
March on Goose Town!

2098
01:46:28,348 --> 01:46:29,781
This "Pocky" Zhang

2099
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,210
has killed his impostor.

2100
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:36,281
But instead of fleeing with the money,

2101
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:39,315
he wants a showdown with me.

2102
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:41,323
Let's get reinforcement.

2103
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:43,223
I've sent Hu Bai to fetch troops.

2104
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:46,922
Cavalry will arrive in 3 days.

2105
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:52,065
Governor swears to behead Huang,

2106
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:58,544
public enemy number one.

2107
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,782
Trades in opium and human misery,

2108
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,845
Huang has killed five governors.

2109
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:15,793
The money that's been given out,

2110
01:47:19,332 --> 01:47:21,892
is but one-tenth of his hoard!

2111
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:27,803
In memory of his dead comrades,

2112
01:47:31,311 --> 01:47:36,044
Ma will parade Huang's head in 3 days!

2113
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:44,288
He gave away all his money to the poor.

2114
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:45,651
Disgraceful!

2115
01:47:46,827 --> 01:47:49,227
The money is not being taken!

2116
01:47:49,896 --> 01:47:54,299
No one dare to go near except those geese!

2117
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:04,376
I'll go and find Flora!

2118
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:06,546
Bring her and Huang's double back.

2119
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,179
We only have three days.

2120
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:10,474
What is on his mind?

2121
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,151
They're a bunch of clowns!

2122
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:14,320
We simply want them... dead!

2123
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:15,916
He has sworn publicly,

2124
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,855
to behead me in 3 days.

2125
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:22,290
Some said I'd win the lottery too!

2126
01:48:26,766 --> 01:48:28,427
Can the four of us

2127
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:30,799
kill Huang in three days?

2128
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:31,903
Yes.

2129
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:33,094
We've been telling everyone that.

2130
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:35,740
We can't back out now!

2131
01:48:35,942 --> 01:48:37,068
What are our chances?

2132
01:48:38,445 --> 01:48:39,343
"30%"

2133
01:48:39,546 --> 01:48:41,036
30%? Are we out of our mind?

2134
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:44,283
Time for a nap. Keep watch.

2135
01:48:58,298 --> 01:48:58,764
Queen!

2136
01:48:58,965 --> 01:48:59,522
Knave!

2137
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,030
Bingo!

2138
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:03,360
Chief, the money is gone.

2139
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,127
I could see that.

2140
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:05,326
We must have a 40% chance now!

2141
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,164
50%?

2142
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:07,340
70%?

2143
01:49:08,108 --> 01:49:08,802
Surely not!

2144
01:49:09,009 --> 01:49:11,239
Still only 30% after they took the money?

2145
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:12,877
If things are that simple,

2146
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:14,376
our efforts will be in vain.

2147
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:16,513
Send the carriages!

2148
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,251
I'll show you how to
" borrow arrows with a straw boat"!

2149
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:27,358
But we just sent horses, not straw boats.

2150
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:29,189
Idiot!

2151
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,365
It's only a metaphor!

2152
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:33,897
You're almost metaphysical!

2153
01:49:55,956 --> 01:49:57,355
Huang has taken all the silvers.

2154
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:00,022
We've no chance of winning.

2155
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:03,425
"60%"

2156
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:04,927
Huang didn't even have to show up,

2157
01:50:05,131 --> 01:50:06,928
everyone has surrendered their money.

2158
01:50:07,133 --> 01:50:08,122
How can it be 60%?

2159
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:09,393
Well said!

2160
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:10,194
So why 60%?

2161
01:50:10,403 --> 01:50:11,301
It's because of fear.

2162
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:12,869
What lies beneath fear?

2163
01:50:13,573 --> 01:50:14,733
Rage!

2164
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:18,070
We need to bring forth their rage!

2165
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:28,785
As guns and ammo's wait for you,

2166
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:31,748
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2167
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:34,450
As guns and ammo's wait for you,

2168
01:50:35,795 --> 01:50:37,490
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2169
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:05,555
Never-say-die!

2170
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:06,258
I like that!

2171
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:09,257
Those are guns! Send carriages?

2172
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:13,990
Money incites greed. But guns are seditious!

2173
01:51:14,467 --> 01:51:15,866
They wouldn't dare.

2174
01:51:17,303 --> 01:51:19,771
The money's gone, but the guns remain!

2175
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,338
What do we do now?

2176
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:22,735
What are our chances?

2177
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:24,833
"70%"

2178
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:28,476
Huang has taken all the money.

2179
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,774
But no one takes our guns.

2180
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:31,143
How come it's 70%?

2181
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:34,114
If he hadn't taken the money,
I wouldn't have to distribute the guns!

2182
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:37,214
... wouldn't have distributed the guns!

2183
01:51:37,424 --> 01:51:38,516
I...

2184
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,451
need a nap.

2185
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:53,672
King!

2186
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:55,238
- Queen!
- Bingo!

2187
01:51:59,112 --> 01:51:59,976
I got it!

2188
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,546
You were inciting rage and anger!

2189
01:52:02,982 --> 01:52:03,880
Collect the guns.

2190
01:52:18,598 --> 01:52:19,530
You missed?

2191
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,362
Let the bullets fly!

2192
01:52:26,139 --> 01:52:26,969
Shots were fired!

2193
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:28,333
Look!

2194
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:33,902
They're all raging mad!

2195
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:39,877
How dare they shot my horse?

2196
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,708
Those with guns follow me.

2197
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:22,954
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2198
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,895
Those with guns follow me.

2199
01:53:27,133 --> 01:53:31,035
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2200
01:53:31,237 --> 01:53:33,933
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2201
01:53:35,775 --> 01:53:37,436
Those with guns follow me.

2202
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:42,547
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2203
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,942
Those with guns follow me.

2204
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:53,024
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2205
01:53:53,726 --> 01:53:55,159
Those with guns follow me.

2206
01:53:55,361 --> 01:54:00,765
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2207
01:54:00,967 --> 01:54:02,525
Those with guns follow me.

2208
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:07,331
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2209
01:54:14,714 --> 01:54:16,375
Those with guns follow me.

2210
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:19,074
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2211
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:27,624
Kill Huang and storm his citadel...

2212
01:54:35,435 --> 01:54:36,459
Chief, look.

2213
01:54:36,669 --> 01:54:38,330
Only they have come this far with us!

2214
01:54:39,172 --> 01:54:41,072
We're on our own!

2215
01:54:42,175 --> 01:54:43,369
I see.

2216
01:54:43,576 --> 01:54:45,134
They will only side with the victors.

2217
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:48,108
We can't overcome Huang's 400 men!

2218
01:54:48,348 --> 01:54:49,645
Shoot! We can win!

2219
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:51,077
What's our target? There's only a gate.

2220
01:54:51,317 --> 01:54:52,511
Let's blast the gate, then.

2221
01:54:58,491 --> 01:54:59,856
How many people have they brought?

2222
01:55:00,059 --> 01:55:00,855
Just the four of them.

2223
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:01,583
You're kidding!

2224
01:55:01,794 --> 01:55:02,624
and also...

2225
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:04,296
fifty geese.

2226
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:06,328
Great! Let them shoot!

2227
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,561
Let them god-damned shoot!

2228
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:28,581
It's almost day break.

2229
01:55:28,788 --> 01:55:30,278
If Three doesn't return in time...

2230
01:55:32,392 --> 01:55:33,950
I know what's on your mind.

2231
01:55:34,227 --> 01:55:35,285
Can you draw an exclamation mark?

2232
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:38,159
Let's do one on the gate!

2233
01:55:38,364 --> 01:55:39,422
Right on.

2234
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:44,597
What's that? Where's the dot?

2235
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:47,035
You missed!

2236
01:55:47,907 --> 01:55:48,566
Move over.

2237
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:52,867
A hook stroke?

2238
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,876
Look again!

2239
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:57,416
A question mark!

2240
01:55:58,584 --> 01:56:00,984
If you can shoot straight,

2241
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:02,415
you'll have nothing to worry!

2242
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:03,816
Empty your guns

2243
01:56:04,023 --> 01:56:05,422
at the question mark!

2244
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:06,853
Okay!

2245
01:56:09,028 --> 01:56:10,791
Chief, chief...

2246
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:15,167
Speak up!

2247
01:56:15,368 --> 01:56:16,164
I'm back!

2248
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:16,994
Three days,

2249
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:17,794
one mission!

2250
01:56:18,037 --> 01:56:18,867
Where are they?

2251
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,039
They're here.

2252
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:22,773
You're back, at last.

2253
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,137
I'm not Huang! I'm just an actor!

2254
01:56:25,345 --> 01:56:26,073
What happened?

2255
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:28,270
He ran away and I chased after him.

2256
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:29,243
We ran a long way!

2257
01:56:29,449 --> 01:56:30,347
I caught up with them.

2258
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:32,711
He finally succumbed after I'd him cornered.

2259
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:35,144
That was it?

2260
01:56:35,355 --> 01:56:36,652
Yes, that simple.

2261
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:37,584
Brothers!

2262
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:39,416
To mark Three's return,

2263
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,115
let's go and empty our guns!

2264
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:42,555
- Right.
- Let's go!

2265
01:56:42,762 --> 01:56:43,353
What about me?

2266
01:56:43,563 --> 01:56:44,086
What about me?

2267
01:56:44,297 --> 01:56:45,229
Squat!

2268
01:57:00,713 --> 01:57:01,771
Just four of them?

2269
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:03,474
Go and take a look.

2270
01:57:03,683 --> 01:57:04,911
Someone will die!

2271
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:07,219
There will be fatalities!

2272
01:57:09,455 --> 01:57:10,922
At least one of them will die!

2273
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:13,490
Hoist!

2274
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:17,757
Brothers! We've won the war!

2275
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:18,360
Understood?

2276
01:57:18,564 --> 01:57:19,121
Understood!

2277
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:19,889
Say it out loud!

2278
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:21,828
Yes, victory.

2279
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:23,024
Let's parade him.

2280
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:24,467
Follow me.

2281
01:57:32,412 --> 01:57:34,243
Huang's been captured.

2282
01:57:34,914 --> 01:57:36,939
Huang's been captured!

2283
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:41,613
Huang's been captured.

2284
01:57:56,135 --> 01:58:00,401
Kill!

2285
01:58:10,683 --> 01:58:12,116
Shit, we're in trouble!

2286
01:58:12,985 --> 01:58:14,213
I've died as my double!

2287
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,218
Reclaim what's yours from the citadel!

2288
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,163
Come with me!

2289
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:29,632
Charge!

2290
01:58:44,383 --> 01:58:47,580
Charge!

2291
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:55,859
Follow me!

2292
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:19,076
The citadel's been breached?

2293
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:20,115
Yes!

2294
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:21,684
Huang's been captured!

2295
01:59:21,888 --> 01:59:23,253
Yes!

2296
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:25,983
They took him for his double.

2297
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:28,090
You've ended Huang's reign.

2298
01:59:29,061 --> 01:59:30,494
What do we do with him now?

2299
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:31,555
Let him go?

2300
01:59:31,764 --> 01:59:34,733
You bastard, go over here! Over there!

2301
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:35,491
Stand properly!

2302
01:59:35,701 --> 01:59:36,895
My fellow townsfolk!

2303
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:38,764
Huang has died!

2304
01:59:39,038 --> 01:59:40,835
But he has got off lightly!

2305
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:42,233
Swoosh!

2306
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:44,375
He was fell in one blow

2307
01:59:44,577 --> 01:59:46,477
by that stupid Governor!

2308
01:59:46,846 --> 01:59:49,906
That was stupid! That was ignorant!

2309
01:59:50,116 --> 01:59:50,980
That's not justice!

2310
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:52,014
No! It's not!

2311
01:59:52,218 --> 01:59:53,344
Can you let this pass?

2312
01:59:53,553 --> 01:59:54,485
No!

2313
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:55,450
I am not him.

2314
01:59:55,655 --> 01:59:56,553
I know you're his double.

2315
01:59:56,756 --> 01:59:58,485
But you shared his life
and committed his crimes.

2316
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:01,319
So you should be punished

2317
02:00:01,527 --> 02:00:02,391
as if you were him!

2318
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:03,789
- Kneel down!
- I really am not him!

2319
02:00:03,996 --> 02:00:05,725
Kneel down! Kneel!

2320
02:00:05,932 --> 02:00:06,899
Don't make me mad!

2321
02:00:07,099 --> 02:00:07,690
On my count of three!

2322
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:08,764
One!

2323
02:00:10,436 --> 02:00:11,528
Two!

2324
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:13,034
One!

2325
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:14,303
Two!

2326
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:16,634
What the...? Who's the son-of-a-bitch?

2327
02:00:16,842 --> 02:00:18,469
Want your ass kicked again?

2328
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:20,168
Am I bothering you, sir?

2329
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:22,313
Say the word and I'll disappear.

2330
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:24,847
If not, I'll just carry on.

2331
02:00:25,918 --> 02:00:27,044
Go away.

2332
02:00:27,253 --> 02:00:28,982
Right, we're going.

2333
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:30,951
Just yell if you need me.

2334
02:00:31,157 --> 02:00:32,249
Always at your service, sir.

2335
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:35,256
Goodbye, sir. Beat it!

2336
02:00:47,974 --> 02:00:49,271
What's next for you?

2337
02:00:49,475 --> 02:00:51,841
Take my place here?

2338
02:00:54,247 --> 02:00:55,475
I'm not a caged bird.

2339
02:00:56,749 --> 02:00:58,011
You're a predator.

2340
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,624
The day of your inauguration,

2341
02:01:07,927 --> 02:01:11,124
had I greeted you in person,

2342
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:14,162
would things have turned out differently?

2343
02:01:14,467 --> 02:01:17,027
It was a nice hat. I liked it.

2344
02:01:17,336 --> 02:01:20,396
I have nicer ones at home.

2345
02:01:21,507 --> 02:01:22,599
I can give them to you.

2346
02:01:25,745 --> 02:01:27,474
Everything's gone in a flash.

2347
02:01:29,282 --> 02:01:31,307
You've totally wiped me out.

2348
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,848
It's not that bad.

2349
02:01:35,054 --> 02:01:36,612
You're still having a smoke,

2350
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:38,713
still chit-chatting.

2351
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:44,919
But Six, Two, Counselor and his wife...

2352
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:47,423
I can no longer hear their voice.

2353
02:01:47,767 --> 02:01:50,793
Never ever again.

2354
02:01:52,638 --> 02:01:54,230
Their four lives,

2355
02:01:55,107 --> 02:01:57,132
in exchange for my heirloom,

2356
02:01:57,943 --> 02:01:58,739
isn't that enough?

2357
02:01:58,944 --> 02:02:00,878
That's none of my business.

2358
02:02:01,247 --> 02:02:02,214
To me,

2359
02:02:02,782 --> 02:02:05,182
they are separate issues.

2360
02:02:05,618 --> 02:02:07,882
You could have kept the money.

2361
02:02:09,388 --> 02:02:11,185
But why did you give it away?

2362
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:15,483
Master Huang, let me ask you a question.

2363
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:16,692
Shoot!

2364
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,489
Which is more important to me?

2365
02:02:19,732 --> 02:02:20,960
You or your fortune?

2366
02:02:22,168 --> 02:02:23,260
Me.

2367
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,164
Think again.

2368
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:30,572
Can it be the money?

2369
02:02:31,711 --> 02:02:33,008
Think again.

2370
02:02:37,917 --> 02:02:39,248
I still think it's me.

2371
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:42,546
Neither matters to me.

2372
02:02:44,323 --> 02:02:45,483
Then what is?

2373
02:02:49,495 --> 02:02:52,589
To rid of you is more important.

2374
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:04,607
Looking for a light?

2375
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:05,704
No.

2376
02:03:05,911 --> 02:03:07,344
You must be...

2377
02:03:08,314 --> 02:03:09,645
looking for this.

2378
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,850
You're a man of honour.

2379
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:27,727
There's only one bullet left.

2380
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:30,528
That's enough.

2381
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:32,397
Wait.

2382
02:03:32,972 --> 02:03:34,200
Any message for Tang?

2383
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:36,170
Right, tell him...

2384
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:38,807
I owe him an apology.

2385
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:40,410
I lied to him.

2386
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:43,079
What was your lie?

2387
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:45,647
I said I wouldn't come back.

2388
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:47,016
But here I am.

2389
02:03:47,586 --> 02:03:48,518
You...

2390
02:03:48,721 --> 02:03:50,245
You should have kept your promise.

2391
02:03:50,456 --> 02:03:52,253
Yes, I let him down.

2392
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:55,391
But when it comes to you,

2393
02:03:56,195 --> 02:03:57,856
I'll definitely keep my words.

2394
02:04:02,802 --> 02:04:03,962
Understood.

2395
02:04:05,704 --> 02:04:07,228
Understood...

2396
02:04:16,415 --> 02:04:17,780
Governor...

2397
02:04:18,384 --> 02:04:19,851
These chairs are mine.

2398
02:04:26,559 --> 02:04:28,459
Chief...

2399
02:04:32,164 --> 02:04:33,153
Easy...

2400
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:34,258
Can I ask you a question?

2401
02:04:34,467 --> 02:04:35,331
Sure.

2402
02:04:36,802 --> 02:04:38,702
You fancy Flora, right?

2403
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:41,162
Governor,

2404
02:04:41,373 --> 02:04:43,204
may I interrupt?

2405
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:44,941
I overheard everything.

2406
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:47,178
Huang is not an honourable man.

2407
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,045
I gave him a pistol.

2408
02:04:49,849 --> 02:04:51,783
He can take his own life.

2409
02:04:52,184 --> 02:04:54,618
If he doesn't, lend him a hand.

2410
02:04:54,854 --> 02:04:55,718
Understood.

2411
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:57,479
I have 9 ways to skin this cat!

2412
02:04:57,690 --> 02:04:58,850
Nine ways!

2413
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:01,721
You'll hear my roar!

2414
02:05:02,628 --> 02:05:04,528
Maybe just a little. Why?

2415
02:05:09,235 --> 02:05:10,600
Don't say I tipped you off.

2416
02:05:15,374 --> 02:05:17,569
Chief, we're off to Shanghai.

2417
02:05:17,877 --> 02:05:19,105
Not riding back with me?

2418
02:05:19,311 --> 02:05:20,369
Still want to resume banditry?

2419
02:05:20,579 --> 02:05:22,069
You're too old for this.

2420
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:25,147
You should've given me a heads-up.

2421
02:05:25,684 --> 02:05:27,379
That's what we're doing!

2422
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:30,752
Didn't you want to be one of us?

2423
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:32,583
I just helped to dish out the money.

2424
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:34,315
I've never had a more satisfying day!

2425
02:05:34,593 --> 02:05:36,026
I'm even dressed for the part!

2426
02:05:37,229 --> 02:05:38,287
So...

2427
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:40,395
you've changed your mind?

2428
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:41,998
That goes without saying!

2429
02:05:44,436 --> 02:05:46,461
What's your plan, Three?

2430
02:05:47,506 --> 02:05:49,235
I'm going to marry her, on behalf of Two.

2431
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:53,708
Two...

2432
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,040
Chief, I'm Three!

2433
02:06:00,052 --> 02:06:02,384
Three, it no longer thrills you

2434
02:06:03,656 --> 02:06:05,590
- to ride with me?
- Yes!

2435
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:07,217
But...

2436
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:09,355
it's been hard going lately.

2437
02:06:11,230 --> 02:06:12,254
- What about you?
- We've had...

2438
02:06:12,464 --> 02:06:13,829
better days.

2439
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:15,062
Seven?

2440
02:06:19,638 --> 02:06:21,538
Chief...

2441
02:06:23,108 --> 02:06:24,405
Flora,

2442
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:26,878
hold your guns like this,

2443
02:06:27,513 --> 02:06:28,673
makes you look even cooler.

2444
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:35,344
They're yours.

2445
02:06:38,023 --> 02:06:39,615
Chief, we've got to go.

2446
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:40,291
Goodbye, Chief.

2447
02:06:40,492 --> 02:06:40,890
Go!

2448
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:42,788
Bye, Chief!.

2449
02:06:43,362 --> 02:06:45,091
Give me a heads-up next time.

2450
02:06:45,297 --> 02:06:46,730
Chief, take care.

2451
02:06:46,966 --> 02:06:47,398
Take care.

2452
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,624
Goodbye, Chief!.

2453
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:51,268
Bye, Chief!.

2454
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:55,432
Bye, Chief!.

2455
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:03,714
"Pocky" Zhang!

2456
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:29,004
Six, Two, Counselor, Madam...

2457
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:30,607
Did you see that?

2458
02:08:19,158 --> 02:08:21,592
Three, Shanghai or Pudong?

2459
02:08:22,428 --> 02:08:24,896
Three, Pudong or Shanghai?

2460
02:08:25,264 --> 02:08:27,198
Shanghai is Pudong!

2461
02:08:27,666 --> 02:08:30,328
Pudong is Shanghai!
