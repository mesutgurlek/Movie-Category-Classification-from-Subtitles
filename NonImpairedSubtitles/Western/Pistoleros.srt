1
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,542
- Martin speaking.
<i>- What the hell are you doing?</i>

2
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:39,715
- I was sleeping.
<i>- It's 2 p.m., sleepyhead.</i>

3
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,952
I was working on the script
all night.

4
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,222
<i>I have good news.</i>

5
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,491
<i>I heard about an expert</i>
<i>on Frank Lowies.</i>

6
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,828
<i>I've arranged to meet him.</i>

7
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:56,374
<i>- We get the story for 5000 kroner.</i>
- 5000? Have you lost your mind?

8
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,240
- Who the hell is this guy?
<i>- He's called Crazy Uffe.</i>

9
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,905
<i>But we better not call him that.</i>
<i>He hates it.</i>

10
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,056
- You're late.
- I had to get the money.

11
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,560
- Do you have it?
- 3000.

12
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,632
- He wants 5000.
- I'm a student. When is he coming?

13
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,735
He's sitting right over there.

14
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,369
Christ, he's a drunk.
Will he want to talk to us?

15
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,237
Come on.

16
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,310
My name is Camilla.

17
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,180
I'm the producer
of the short we're making.

18
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,685
- Who's this joker?
- Martin, the director.

19
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,452
He's also writing the script.

20
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,458
Oh. Do you have the money?

21
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,761
We have 3000.

22
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,935
Then forget it.

23
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,405
Fine. We're leaving.

24
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,775
<i>I'll take the 3000.</i>

25
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,718
<i>- But you're buying the beers.</i>
- That's a deal, Crazy...

26
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,550
I mean...
What should we call you?

27
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,419
Just call me Crazy Uffe.

28
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,256
<i>All the assholes do.</i>

29
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,193
I'll pay the bill later. Okay?

30
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,960
Have you ever heard
of Frank Lowies?

31
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,165
I've done some research on him.

32
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,835
Frank was the toughest guy
in Copenhagen.

33
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,711
And because he was the toughest,
people always challenged him.

34
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,390
So my sons stole some motorcycles,
and you're going to beat them up?

35
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,994
It's because you owe us money,
you bastards.

36
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,303
- Brian?
- You had fucking six months to pay.

37
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:16,780
When you owe my sons money,
you pay up. And I don't like threats.

38
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,907
Let's take this outside. Now!

39
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,516
Come on, guys.

40
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,324
Shall we get started, ladies?

41
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,662
Get him, Dad.

42
00:05:54,821 --> 00:06:00,418
- Aren't you exaggerating a bit?
- He beat up at least 4 or 5 guys.

43
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:09,932
I suppose you want to hear the story
about the money Frank stole and hid.

44
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,199
- Isn't that just an urban legend?
- You want to hear it or not?

45
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:22,915
I got mixed up in that shit
because I owed Yugo Ivan money.

46
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,315
- Did you know Yugo Ivan?
- I worked for him.

47
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:34,090
Here's the story that I told Ivan.

48
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,667
Tell me the story
from the very beginning.

49
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,205
Frank Lowies, the smuggler
from the '60s. Remember him?

50
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:54,905
Sure. He buried 10 million kroner
somewhere or other.

51
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,709
- It's an urban legend.
- No, it's true.

52
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,378
Frank robbed a money transport
vehicle 7 years ago.

53
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:08,256
Together with Ramirez,
a South American,

54
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,487
and a guy called Shameer.

55
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:17,629
Paki Shameer? And the seven
Dalton brothers from Pakistan.

56
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:27,475
Hand over the money!
This isn't a joke!

57
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,103
Open the register!

58
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,388
What was that?
Don't give me any lip.

59
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,073
Those are my kind of guys.

60
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,707
Shameer got greedy in the getaway
car, and they had an accident.

61
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,912
They fled, but were caught
and put away like that.

62
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,583
All the money wasn't recovered.
Frank was released first...

63
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:18,486
...and rumor has it
that he hid some of it.

64
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:25,095
- 10 million?
- No, only 5. But it's money.

65
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:29,572
- 5 million?
- Frank is said to have a tattoo.

66
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,041
On himself?

67
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,909
Frank has one, and three
other people have one, too.

68
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:40,951
Together they show where the money
is hidden. Like a treasure map.

69
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,357
<i>Shameer got out of prison</i>
<i>two weeks ago.</i>

70
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,930
He came straight here to get
the money he'd been cheated out of.

71
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,556
He'd heard the South American
had a tattoo.

72
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,101
<i>He visited him first.</i>

73
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,222
I've been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

74
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,860
But I'm kind of happy.

75
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:42,145
So I'm giving you a chance.
What are the other numbers?

76
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:04,429
Hey, Latino. Try cheating death
just like you cheated us.

77
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,542
Sorry to interrupt,
but who fired the gun?

78
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,676
Shameer's little brother. Pucha.
Aren't you listening?

79
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,079
Sorry, do go on.

80
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,067
<i>Frank didn't know</i>
<i>Shameer was back.</i>

81
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:16,038
I have always been
the best card player. Three.

82
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,143
Not so fast, kid.

83
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:26,409
- What the hell?
- There goes your welfare check.

84
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,579
- You cheated. I'm sure of it.
<i>- The hell I have.</i>

85
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,887
Relax, Frank.
You're just a fucking bad loser.

86
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:40,988
Screaming Pete, you saw him cheat,
right? Why don't you ever talk?

87
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,728
He hasn't talked since Christmas.

88
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,897
I'm leaving before you rob me
of my last 50.

89
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:57,042
- Hi, brother. Can I have a word?
- All the smugglers are back together.

90
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:03,088
- Hi, Brian.
<i>- What the hell? It talked. It spoke!</i>

91
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:13,489
- You guys been popping Viagra?
- Shut up. What are you doing here?

92
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,669
- Aren't you picking up Sonny?
<i>- He'll be released tomorrow, Dad.</i>

93
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,941
- Uncle wants to talk to you.
- Need to borrow more money?

94
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:34,179
No. At least not right now.
I need to talk to you. It's important.

95
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:39,012
Keep your hands off my whisky.

96
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,458
I heard that Paki Shameer is out.

97
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:49,033
He and his crazy brother
are looking for you.

98
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:55,573
- Him as well? Who told you?
- It's the talk of the town.

99
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:00,038
- You cheated him out of some money.
- I've never cheated anyone.

100
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,778
- He says he'll blow you away.
- Those punks don't scare me.

101
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,421
The five are still there,
aren't they?

102
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,618
Yes, sure.

103
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:22,667
- How much have you taken?
- Not much.

104
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:28,431
- How much, you fat slob?
- 200.

105
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:34,144
- 200?
- Two hundred... thousand.

106
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,272
Keep your hands off it.
You got that?

107
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,347
The two Pakis know
about the tattoos.

108
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,090
What will you do now?

109
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,291
I'm going for a meal.

110
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,626
- Good idea.
- Alone.

111
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,199
What's up, Shameer?

112
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,397
<i>What idiot let you out?</i>

113
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,641
Can't say that I've missed you.

114
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,765
I heard about what happened inside.

115
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,426
Your dad's a fucking thief.

116
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,075
Sonny has a hot temper.

117
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,809
Hand over our money.

118
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:21,575
"Our"? What does the jerk
mean by "our money"?

119
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,764
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Show us your tattoo.</i>

120
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,931
Where's Ramirez?

121
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,909
Do what you came to do, Shameer.

122
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,210
The only thing you'll get
out of me is blood.

123
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,686
Shit!

124
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,163
<i>Sonny will get you,</i>
<i>you Paki bastard.</i>

125
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,790
<i>Hey, Sonny!</i>

126
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,533
Free as a bird!

127
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:24,712
What's up, little brother?
You look good for a jailbird.

128
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,342
- Your bike's ready at the shop.
- Did you get hold of Dad?

129
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,185
- He's probably on a binge.
- What about Ramirez?

130
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,157
Shameer almost killed him.
What does he want?

131
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:40,197
- Where's my hash, you fag?
- Come on. Let's find Dad.

132
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,008
<i>Dad?</i>

133
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,484
<i>- Open up. It's Sonny.</i>
<i>- And Brian.</i>

134
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,748
<i>Open the damn door!</i>

135
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,062
What do we have here?

136
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,201
My two useless brats.

137
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,645
Call an ambulance.

138
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,950
Forget it.
I'm done for.

139
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,023
Shut up, Dad.

140
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,855
Call a fucking ambulance now!

141
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,655
<i>Did Shameer do that to you?</i>

142
00:17:50,569 --> 00:18:00,535
Get hold of Michelle.
Get the money before that Paki...

143
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,815
Sonny...

144
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,054
- What's he saying?
- Okay.

145
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,687
The ambulance is on its way.
Don't talk.

146
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,805
Dad! Don't die.

147
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,841
Don't die, Dad!

148
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,284
Shit!

149
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,197
- What did Frank whisper to Sonny?
- In a minute.

150
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,510
Ramirez kept his word to Frank
and stayed away for two years.

151
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,443
But now he wanted to find the money
and get back at Shameer.

152
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,985
- Who do you go to for spare parts?
- Tuki.

153
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,681
Tuki? Tuki?

154
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,518
Ramirez, my friend!
How are you?

155
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,152
What happened?
Did you get hit by a truck?

156
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:59,497
Funny, Tuki. Very funny.

157
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,160
Come on.

158
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,896
<i>Do you want some tea?</i>
<i>Or food?</i>

159
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,336
I just made some farsouli.

160
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,135
Tuki's best.

161
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,611
No food. Spare parts.

162
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,497
Come, I'll help you.
Tuki always helps his friends.

163
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,125
Bullets?

164
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,665
I heard that Shameer
is in Copenhagen.

165
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:21,740
Tell me, Ramirez,
is there really any money?

166
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,941
Everyone talks, but no one knows.

167
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:30,351
Michelle, the English girl.
Know where she is?

168
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:35,757
Frank's old lady?
I saw her at the new strip club.

169
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,991
- The one that black guy owns.
- I know the guy.

170
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,193
By the way,
did you hear that Frank is dead?

171
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,406
You know too much, Tuki.

172
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,013
Do you need help?
Shameer is dangerous.

173
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,845
He's like a snake.

174
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,987
Shameer's days are over.

175
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:34,513
- What the fuck?
- Where's Crazy Uffe?

176
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,383
Taking a dump.

177
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,329
Get the boys! Now!

178
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:00,769
Hey, Sonny!
What do you want?

179
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,187
- Where does Michelle live? Don't lie.
- I haven't seen her for ages.

180
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:14,020
She's a stripper in town. She dumped
me just like she dumped your dad.

181
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,616
Fucking whore.

182
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,996
- Then what the hell did you run for?
- I still owe you that money.

183
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,372
- You bum. Where's Shameer?
- I don't know.

184
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,374
- Where is he?
- He's looking for Michelle, too.

185
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,478
Sonny! Let him go!

186
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:40,340
You're a dead man.
Not like in the old days.

187
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:30,730
Guess we showed you, ladies.
Fucking punks!

188
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,568
Howdy, boys!
How y'all doing?

189
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:10,471
- Y'all looking for some action?
- Where's Michelle?

190
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:18,448
Michelle? She's a wild one, all right.
Yes, sir. Whoa!

191
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,578
But it ain't going to work out. Sorry.
She only dances for the big boss.

192
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,783
Shut up, Lucky Luke,
and get Michelle.

193
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,100
What the fuck?

194
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,473
These bastards wanna talk
to Michelle.

195
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:49,903
Sorry, boss.

196
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,413
They whupped me good.

197
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,716
Whoa, whoa!
Easy, man. Easy.

198
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,192
Shameer?
I haven't seen your ass in years.

199
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,828
What the fuck are you doing here?

200
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,994
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

201
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,032
Oh, yeah.

202
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,694
Frank's kid gave him a nice cut there,
so this asshole can't talk.

203
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,306
You know these fuckers?

204
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,240
Yap, yap, yap.

205
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,608
You talk too much, bitch.
Speak, when spoken to.

206
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,082
- Frank gave you a tattoo, right?
- What's it to you?

207
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,247
Yeah.
Frank paid for this stupid tattoo.

208
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,857
I don't know what the fuck it means.

209
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:49,037
Five and five. 55.

210
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,303
Draw Michelle's tattoo.

211
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,851
What?

212
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:09,626
What the fuck is that?
55...

213
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,392
<i>What the hell are you doing,</i>
<i>Michelle?</i>

214
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,791
Are you showing him
your fucking ass?

215
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,193
Shut your face!

216
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,393
You got my money?

217
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,992
<i>Frank owes me money,</i>
<i>and I got shit.</i>

218
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,038
- You got it?
- You ain't getting jack shit.

219
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,909
- Who the fuck is this?
- Ramirez?

220
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:32,244
- Going to kill your girlfriend?
- Let her go, chico cabrón.

221
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,875
You can only
cheat death once, Latino.

222
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,027
You fucking bastards!

223
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,683
- We'll take what we need.
- Of course! Help yourselves.

224
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,224
<i>This is better than Christmas, man.</i>

225
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,791
That's a quality piece.
Smith & Wesson.

226
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,993
<i>Wise choice.</i>

227
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,672
- Tuki, bring the bullets.
- They're in the case.

228
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,514
Sonny.

229
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,488
I'm sorry about your father.

230
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:04,397
Frank was a good man.
I never liked Shameer.

231
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:11,039
Tell me, Sonny,
did Frank cheat him or what?

232
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,907
Watch what you say about my father,
you dirty dog.

233
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,809
Easy.

234
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:33,893
Brian, blow the bastard away.
Do it now!

235
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:40,930
Sonny, your brother's been playing
with bandits behind your back.

236
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,830
What the hell is he going on about?

237
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,718
Christ, Sonny.
There are 5 million out there.

238
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,477
And I want my share.

239
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,284
Dad told me about it
when he was drunk.

240
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,724
He said you'd know where to look
when you figured out the tattoos.

241
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,194
And you told that rat?

242
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,097
I was always left out.
Where is it?

243
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,759
He killed Dad.

244
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,235
This isn't part of the deal, Shameer.

245
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,706
Brian...

246
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:32,485
Sonny, where's the money?
Think fast.

247
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,284
I'm sorry, Sonny.

248
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,655
- I'm sorry.
- Wait.

249
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:56,612
My uncle... My uncle's wrecking yard.
That's where the money is.

250
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,255
Brian?

251
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,994
- Find the money before it's too late.
- I don't care about the money.

252
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:26,405
- I want Shameer to die like a rat.
- Can you forgive me?

253
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,582
Brian? Brian?

254
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,153
Not you, too.

255
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,706
I got it!

256
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,437
It's an American car.
A '55 Cadillac.

257
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:10,419
And it's at Uncle's Wrecking Yard.
Is the money there?

258
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,921
- Don't you want to hear the rest?
- I'm asking. Is the money there?

259
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,356
In the fucking '55 Cadillac?

260
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:23,257
<i>When the sun rose the following day,</i>
<i>things got busy at the junk yard.</i>

261
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:05,699
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a '55 Cadillac.

262
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,313
Oh, no. Are you one of the idiots
on a treasure hunt?

263
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:16,510
Where is the Cadillac?
There's something of mine in it.

264
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,953
Listen.
I only have old junk cars here.

265
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,685
There isn't a Cadillac.
And there isn't a treasure.

266
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:31,130
Just get the hell out of here.
And that toy doesn't scare me.

267
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:38,031
- Take it easy, for Christ's sake.
- Do you love your dog?

268
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,507
Pingo?

269
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,404
Bang!

270
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,603
Look at him.

271
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:54,009
Buy some more beers.
Camilla, you do it.

272
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,813
- Are you taking all of this down?
- Of course.

273
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,288
Brian was a creep.
He betrayed his own family.

274
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:08,355
- I'll get the beers. Got any money?
- No, I'm broke.

275
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,094
You directors never have a cent.

276
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,584
I don't have time, Krelle.
I'm talking to some movie people.

277
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:35,556
- What movie people?
- Hey! What did I say about cameras?

278
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:43,361
Can't you see he's filming me?
No one wants to see your ugly mug.

279
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,699
Making a movie?
How about using me?

280
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,366
- Here are the brews.
- Great.

281
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:56,344
Your producer
has a handle on things.

282
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,506
- Are you a producer?
- Yes.

283
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,845
Hi.

284
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,615
My name is Krelle.
Call me Krelle.

285
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,725
And you can call me Camilla.

286
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,260
- Can I be in your movie?
- Shut up, Krelle. Beat it.

287
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,593
If you can use him,
you can use me.

288
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:21,296
- Crazy Uffe isn't going to be in it.
- Uffe's telling us about the money.

289
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:26,843
- Everyone is looking for it.
- Is he telling that same old story?

290
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,744
Jesus Christ!
Why didn't you come to me first?

291
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,440
Shut up and leave, Krelle.

292
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,884
I bet he didn't mention Frank's heist.

293
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,957
They don't want to hear it.
Beat it.

294
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:41,752
I do.

295
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:48,092
- Me too.
- Your movie should be about it.

296
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:52,066
- I'll tell you for a beer.
- What about the rest of my story?

297
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:02,543
In his heyday, Frank had
everything a man could want.

298
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:10,313
Money. Power.
Beautiful women. Cars.

299
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,788
Frank was sitting at this table
when he heard about the heist.

300
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:20,789
Frank, are you sure
we should include Shameer?

301
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,990
He can't be trusted.

302
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,469
- He's an idiot.
- Let's hear what the man says first.

303
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:33,510
- I don't like him. He's a snake.
- A little shit.

304
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,470
And he smells of curry.

305
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,674
- Yes, he's a slimy bastard.
- Speaking of curry.

306
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:44,516
A big homemade burger
with lots of dressing...

307
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,453
Shut up.
You and your food.

308
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,083
Hey, Shameer!
How are you doing?

309
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:54,892
- What's up, Frank?
- So, son.

310
00:38:54,999 --> 00:39:00,494
- What's this? You smell good.
- Fats. Go feed your face.

311
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,539
I'm hungry anyway.
See you later.

312
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,166
Fuck off!

313
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,242
Move over. I hate people
sticking to me like glue.

314
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,489
- Long time, no see, Ramirez.
- Not long enough.

315
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,092
What's on your mind?

316
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,961
What do you think of 20 million?

317
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,363
I know where we can get it.

318
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,503
And we split it three ways.

319
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,198
Why us?
Why do you need us?

320
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:43,746
You're the best in the business.
And there's your niece. Interested?

321
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,952
20 million is a lot of money.

322
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,063
There she is.

323
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,499
Hi, honey.
Have a word with Uncle Frank.

324
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,703
- I have a job.
- Give me a second, uncle.

325
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,384
- You haven't called in a week, jerk.
- I've been busy.

326
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,854
Do you prefer this whore?

327
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,720
Don't call me a whore!

328
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,351
Shut the fuck up, Tina.
She's my lady.

329
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:38,534
What the fuck are you doing, bitch?

330
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,568
Well done, Tina. That oughtta hurt.

331
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,608
Shut up, Dad.

332
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,943
What's this job
you're talking about, uncle?

333
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:03,158
- Frankie, aren't those your boys?
- Stop, Tina.

334
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,698
- We have to be at Shameer's soon.
- When I say stop, you stop.

335
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,929
- Hurry up.
- I've almost got it.

336
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,267
What are you morons doing?

337
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,304
Hi, Dad.

338
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,342
What are you doing here, old man?

339
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,670
Are you trying to steal this car?

340
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,349
No, we forgot our keys.

341
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:32,853
- No wisecracks. All right?
- Okay. We're trying to steal it.

342
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:38,757
- But I can't jimmy the lock.
- This is a bit embarrassing.

343
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:44,465
What would my friends think?
Did you lure Sonny into this?

344
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,594
No, he was the one...

345
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:54,304
I don't want to see this again.
You got that, you brats?

346
00:41:55,312 --> 00:42:00,306
- Yes, Dad.
- Give me that.

347
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:04,682
This is the last time
I'm showing you. Watch carefully.

348
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,002
- Did you get that?
- Way to go, Dad.

349
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:31,471
Damn brats!

350
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:44,359
- Hi, Shameer.
- Hi, Frank. Ramirez.

351
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:50,024
- It's not like you to be late.
- He had to help his kids steal a car.

352
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,592
Shut up
and make some coffee, Tina.

353
00:42:53,737 --> 00:43:00,404
- You're sure the money is there?
- It will be smuggled out tonight.

354
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,206
20 million.
The money is just waiting for us.

355
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:08,116
- Where does it come from?
- Tonight at midnight...

356
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,093
- Who the hell is that?
- Blondie.

357
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,299
Don't you remember me?

358
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:29,302
- My little brother Pucha.
- Do you want the money or not?

359
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,304
- I'm all ears.
- Tell him.

360
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,815
Once a year
money is transported to Germany.

361
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:45,217
And tonight
it is the largest sum ever.

362
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:52,261
<i>I saw it while I was at work.</i>
<i>I recognized Yuri at once.</i>

363
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,325
<i>Yuri is Albanian.</i>

364
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:00,062
<i>I did his little sister,</i>
<i>so I understand some Albanian.</i>

365
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,697
<i>Every year there's</i>
<i>a Wild West Show in Hamburg.</i>

366
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:10,110
<i>Yuri supplies all the props</i>
<i>for the show, including an old safe.</i>

367
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,513
<i>I did some research and found out</i>
<i>that the safe has been camouflaged.</i>

368
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:22,616
<i>It looks like a prop,</i>
<i>but inside there's a real safe.</i>

369
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:26,423
<i>The 20 million are smuggled</i>
<i>to Hamburg tonight.</i>

370
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,799
<i>This time we'll score</i>
<i>a fucking jackpot.</i>

371
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,803
Isn't this just our kind of thing?

372
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,566
Yeah.
What about the car?

373
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,643
I've got one, and Pucha will drive it.

374
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,246
Why Pucha?

375
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,781
If anyone's driving that car, it's me.

376
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:51,185
- What about dynamite?
- It's all set. But Pucha's driving.

377
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,915
What's wrong with Tina?

378
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:57,550
- She's on Antabuse.
<i>- Bullshit!</i>

379
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:04,123
Antabuse, schmantabuse.
Never heard of it. Tina is a cow.

380
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:09,228
- Plus, I'm a better driver.
- You're not driving. Tina is.

381
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,067
Got that?

382
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,074
Unless she breaks her foot,
she's driving.

383
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,877
Son of a bitch!
What was that for?

384
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,677
Now her foot's broken!

385
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:28,319
Who the hell brought
that psycho here? This is ridiculous!

386
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,927
Are you all right, baby?

387
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:37,664
- You're out. We'll do it ourselves.
- If anyone's out, it's you.

388
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,896
Don't threaten me, Paki.

389
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,767
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be a dishwasher.

390
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,808
I came up with the plan,
so it's my plan.

391
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,541
Easy, Shameer.
We're not at war.

392
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,809
We're working.
We're professionals.

393
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,750
<i>Comprende?</i>

394
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:03,921
<i>Frankie, qué pasa?</i>
This is our big chance. 20 million.

395
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,395
Don't just stand there!
Help me, you assholes!

396
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,467
Relax, Frank.

397
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,463
Okay.

398
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:18,064
We'll do it.
Get the dynamite.

399
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,368
- How is she?
- What the hell does it look like?

400
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,379
Get her foot seen to.
You're driving the car.

401
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:32,884
I don't ever want to see
your little brother again. Got that?

402
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,192
We'll meet here at exactly 11 p.m.

403
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,763
You dickhead!

404
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,349
All right, handsome.
What do feel like having today?

405
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,619
Well...

406
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,729
I think I'll...

407
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,626
I'll take the usual.

408
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,667
I think I can pretty much guess
what that is.

409
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:28,669
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get your ass up on stage.

410
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:33,512
You're up next.
Go and get ready.

411
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:39,455
Sorry, Frank.
I didn't see you. I thought...

412
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:44,151
That my girl was on some jerk's lap?
Is that it, faggot?

413
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:48,788
My mistake.
How about a drink on the house?

414
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,262
Michelle, get...

415
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:58,764
- No, I'll get you a Jack Daniels.
- Get the drinks and stop kissing ass.

416
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,106
Fucking asshole!

417
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,940
Don't worry about it, baby.

418
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:07,573
After tonight we won't need
to be in this fucking dump no more.

419
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,845
Are you sure about that?

420
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,979
Trust me, baby.
You're gonna be rich.

421
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:19,427
Yes, finally. Diamonds,
and a fur coat. I want it all.

422
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,729
Dad? What's the job tonight?

423
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,064
Shut up, Brian.
You know we don't discuss that.

424
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:39,379
- More?
- I'd like some more.

425
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:45,215
- Where's the car?
- Sold.

426
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,654
- Sonny needs the money for his bitch.
- She isn't a bitch.

427
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,854
I want to get her
a nice birthday present.

428
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,625
She's fleecing you.
Just like Dad's women.

429
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,764
You're so gross,
you can't even get a girlfriend.

430
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:06,535
I don't need a bitch. Fuck them.
Nothing but headaches.

431
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:11,080
Quiet! Let's have a quiet dinner.
Sonny's right.

432
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:16,419
Treat the ladies well.
I taught him that.

433
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,455
What are you getting her?

434
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,922
I'm thinking of a ring.
I have a picture.

435
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,829
- Cool, isn't it?
- A gay ring.

436
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,136
Shut up! It's too expensive anyway.
I'll find something else.

437
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:43,974
- No. How much do you need?
- Five.

438
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,355
- Here's 5000.
- Thanks.

439
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,722
What about me, Dad?

440
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,797
<i>Here's 50.</i>

441
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,740
Buy a porn mag and some
toilet paper, you little wanker.

442
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:19,108
- Fuck you.
- Brian, wait.

443
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,182
<i>Of course 50 isn't enough.</i>

444
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,376
Here's another 50.

445
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,318
Go buy some lubricant
and a wrist protector.

446
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,586
- Hi, uncle.
- My little wanker!

447
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,155
Fuck you, too.

448
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,690
Been teasing Brian again?
He can't take it.

449
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,601
Hi, Sonny.

450
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,739
- What's up, uncle?
- What's up?

451
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,408
What the hell are you doing here?

452
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:59,546
These are damn good.
You should be a chef.

453
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:04,751
Instead of those stupid heists.
You're too old anyway.

454
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:10,023
Stop stuffing your face!
What do you want?

455
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
Leave us.

456
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:26,441
- What?
- I need some cash.

457
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,010
I knew it.

458
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:34,449
I know, but it's for gas
and some hot dogs, you know.

459
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:41,190
- Here's 100.
- That won't fill the septic tank.

460
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,858
Here we go.
I knew I could count on you.

461
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,698
Yes, but you're a fool.

462
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:58,175
- See you. Thanks a lot. Kiss, kiss.
- Put the main key back.

463
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,753
Hello, darling.

464
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:21,994
I know I haven't been here
for a while, but I've been busy.

465
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:35,205
I miss the sound of your voice,
and I miss you telling me off.

466
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,708
Especially tonight.

467
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,457
I'll come back soon.

468
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,890
Bye, darling.

469
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:25,127
You've got to be kidding.
What happened?

470
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:30,760
- She drank a whole bottle of tequila.
- And you let her, you idiot?

471
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,635
I'm not her father.

472
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:44,177
- Give me that bottle.
- No! Give it back!

473
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,441
<i>- Shut up, Tina!</i>
- Get me out of this shitty car!

474
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:56,047
What do we do? She isn't
capable of blowing anything up.

475
00:54:56,993 --> 00:55:01,293
What about Shameer?
Did he get any dynamite?

476
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:05,334
Shameer can't get jack shit.
No car, no dynamite.

477
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:10,931
- Give me that bottle!
- I'm going home.

478
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:15,740
Shameer mentioned a name.
Let's go now.

479
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:17,142
I've got it under control.

480
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,996
- I'll show you.
- He's okay, Frank.

481
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:43,533
Look. Panasonic. Best in town.
Code-free. No code.

482
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:49,009
You can see in every country.
Clint Eastwood. Bang, bang!

483
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:54,547
Thanks, but what I want is...

484
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,148
This?

485
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:07,161
Very good. Try. Gypsy King.
I give for you. 200.

486
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:13,433
- No thanks.
- For you. Special. 150.

487
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,764
Listen, we want a big boom-boom.

488
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:24,511
- I have, you want.
- He understands.

489
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,614
Christ, forget it.

490
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:39,351
- Where did you find that camel rider?
- He's a friend of Shameer's.

491
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:44,522
I know some Arabic.
I can try to speak to him.

492
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,044
We need dynamite.

493
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,974
We are Shameer's habibis.

494
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:07,155
- Do you know Shameer?
- Oh, Shameer...

495
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,363
Dynamite. Big boom.
Best boom.

496
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:27,100
- Show off.
- Give me that.

497
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:34,415
- Tuki always has the best.
- Okay. Thank you.

498
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:41,716
I have this.
No drinking? Party!

499
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,827
Here. Thank you.

500
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,625
More money.

501
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,833
Shut up. That's plenty.

502
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,174
Tina, have you lost
your fucking mind?

503
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,827
What the hell
are you two morons doing?

504
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,969
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

505
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,138
Come on, Tina. Get up.

506
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,005
You've got to be kidding!

507
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,423
Give me a hand, Shameer.

508
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,164
Pull yourself together.

509
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,582
Shameer, over here!

510
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:06,229
- It's true! It's a safe!
- We're rich, my friend!

511
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:17,571
You pig. You won't see a cent.
I hate you to the bone.

512
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,839
Wipe that smile off your face.

513
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,508
I'll take it all,
and you'll rot in jail.

514
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:27,452
Are you going
to blow the safe or fuck it first?

515
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,056
Let's do it.

516
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,827
And Tina?

517
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,225
Tina is drunk as a skunk.
You do it.

518
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:39,232
- Are you crazy? I can't.
- Then I'll do it.

519
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:43,203
I'll check on Tina.
She's swimming in her own vomit.

520
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:50,810
- Are you sure you can do it?
- What am I? An amateur?

521
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:17,872
- What?
- It's ready.

522
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,481
I need water.

523
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:56,072
- It's going to blow.
- We have five minutes to empty it.

524
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:02,241
- Give me some water.
- What do you think this is? A hotel?

525
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,185
Hey...

526
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:14,186
- Where's the tool bag and weapons?
- Where are they?

527
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,500
Did you use all the dynamite?

528
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,337
- Huh?
- The whole lot.

529
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,978
Fuck.

530
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:45,722
- Shit!
- What are you doing, you idiot?

531
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:05,706
Fuck.

532
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:30,571
Holy shit!
It didn't get a scratch, Frank.

533
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:35,401
- Move! Is it open?
- Let's get out of here.

534
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:41,675
- No way! Not without the money.
- Are you planning on carrying it?

535
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:45,547
The cops will be here
in five minutes. It's over.

536
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,522
I'm going home.

537
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:37,705
- What did I tell you?
- We're rich!

538
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:43,907
We're going on vacation!
I love money!

539
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:12,270
Hide, for fuck's sake! Hide!

540
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:20,582
I'm going to jail!
I hate money!

541
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,110
Shut up, Tina!

542
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,590
What do we do now?

543
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:50,568
- Shameer, what are you doing?
- What do you think?

544
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:57,208
Since I blew it up, I get two bags.
See you, boys.

545
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:01,619
Let him go. He won't get far.

546
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:10,062
Take the two bags and hide them.
See you at the meeting point.

547
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,127
Stop whining.
We have to get out of here.

548
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,706
Frank! Frank! Shit!

549
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,994
- Pucha.
<i>- Trying to steal my money?</i>

550
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:05,716
- Where have you been?
- I said to meet at the parking lot.

551
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,085
This is it.

552
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:18,463
- Shameer, you bastard.
- I'll send you a postcard from Spain.

553
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,442
Come on!

554
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,149
<i>Get him!</i>

555
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:48,754
<i>Deck him!</i>

556
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,663
Let me go, pig!

557
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:06,979
Get up, Tina! Come on!

558
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,943
Run, Frank!

559
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,126
Get him on the ground.

560
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,247
Damn!

561
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:57,126
<i>Over here!</i>
<i>He went this way!</i>

562
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:24,556
What?

563
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,927
Stop! Kurt, stop!

564
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:42,442
- What the hell is this?
- It's like a rocket. It's a Diablo.

565
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,413
- Where's the fucking car?
- The tank was empty.

566
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:50,610
You idiot!
Let's get out of here.

567
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:54,780
Move, fat ass.
I can't get on.

568
01:09:54,924 --> 01:10:00,658
If you touch a cent of that money,
you're dead meat. Go!

569
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,128
Move it!

570
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:42,227
Hands up!
Step away from the car!

571
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,473
Listen, girls.

572
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:50,409
If he drops his toy gun, I promise
not to kick you in the balls.

573
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:55,347
- Shut up, Frank. You're under arrest.
- Take it easy!

574
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,284
They arrested the whole gang.

575
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,083
But the police
never found the last bag.

576
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:06,321
According to the tattoos,
the money was in the '55 Cadillac.

577
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,090
I'll tell the rest.

578
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:35,910
<i>The greedy Tuki took off</i>
<i>to look around for the '55 Cadillac.</i>

579
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,551
You're not that fast, Tuki.

580
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,259
Ramirez, my friend.

581
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:40,169
Ramirez, my friend.
There are five million here.

582
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:49,013
Let's split it.
2 million for you, 3 million for me.

583
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,813
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

584
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,717
What do you say?

585
01:14:53,889 --> 01:15:00,158
Ramirez! You know what you are?
You're a son of a dog!

586
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:04,722
Tuki.
Wasn't I just your best friend?

587
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:08,769
I'll shoot you! I will!

588
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,965
That's my money, Ramirez!
You son of a big chamuta!

589
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,933
Is the money there?

590
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:48,709
Answer me!
Are the 5 million there?

591
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,378
Is the money in there?

592
01:15:55,250 --> 01:16:00,813
Ramirez, my friend.
Your mother isn't a chamuta.

593
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:04,357
Of course, she isn't.
I like your mother.

594
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:09,192
I've had dinner at her place.
She makes great empanadas.

595
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:14,530
Ramirez, let's split the money.
You and I.

596
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:21,667
There's plenty for both of us.
You're my best friend. My brother.

597
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,110
You and I are partners,
and we're rich now.

598
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,115
Here's your money.

599
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:44,255
- You're shitting me.
- Good-bye, Tuki. Have fun.

600
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:51,670
<i>Ramirez, my friend! Ramirez!</i>

601
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,390
Was the money there?

602
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,547
The money is still there.
They didn't find it.

603
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,487
- Where is it?
- In a different car.

604
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,822
Michelle had two tattoos.
I've seen one of them.

605
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,397
<i>The first time she danced for me,</i>

606
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:01,268
<i>I found out that the old bandit</i>
<i>gave her two tattoos, not just one.</i>

607
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,122
It's in an old Peugeot.

608
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:18,953
<i>If we get it,</i>
<i>we could pay off my old debt.</i>

609
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:24,088
<i>- The 400,000.</i>
- You totaled my Mercedes. 200,000.

610
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:28,201
You came back from Thailand
without 242,000.

611
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,804
My 242,000.

612
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:37,639
Add the two amounts,
and that makes 442,000.

613
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:43,217
- Then you'll get 442,000.
- Thanks.

614
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:47,018
There's 5 million.
I only want half.

615
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:56,263
You're an idiot, Crazy Uffe.
A big idiot.

616
01:18:56,498 --> 01:19:00,958
Did you forget what I told you
about people and money?

617
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,763
I'm people, too.

618
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:13,680
- What do you mean, Ivan?
- Have another shawarma on me.

619
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:18,684
- What's going on?
- Stay here. I'll be back.

620
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:24,516
Look who's here. Tuki.

621
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,359
<i>Hey, Tuki!</i>

622
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,761
Come have a brew.

623
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,962
Come and have a beer.

624
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:41,231
- Can I film him?
- Sure. He's high, but harmless.

625
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:49,073
- Tuki. Sit down and have a beer.
- I can't. I have to leave.

626
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:53,184
I don't have time.
Important things to do.

627
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,483
Have a beer. Relax.

628
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,786
This is Tuki.

629
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:07,833
- Have a beer.
- Thanks.

630
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,507
<i>Tuki, this guy wrote a movie</i>
<i>about Frank</i>

631
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:20,375
and the money
and all that shit you got up to.

632
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,948
<i>Isn't that cool?</i>

633
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,976
<i>This is Martin.</i>

634
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,122
Hi, I'm Camilla.
I'm the producer.

635
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,156
- Tuki's the expert on the story.
- I know a lot, too.

636
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:40,529
You don't know jack shit.
You make it all up.

637
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,159
<i>Tuki was there.</i>

638
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:48,265
- He almost got the money, right?
- I know the money's still there.

639
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:55,475
And I'll find it.
I know it's there somewhere.

640
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:00,110
What about Ivan?
Didn't he find it?

641
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,588
Wasn't it in the Peugeot?

642
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,922
If Tuki's fan club will shut up,
I'll continue.

643
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:25,538
Cadillac!

644
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:49,064
[Ivan swears uncontrollably]

645
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:09,047
What the hell? Ivan, old boy.
What are you doing here?

646
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:20,330
- Did you think there was money in it?
- Crazy Uffe said it wasn't the Caddy.

647
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:26,373
- It was supposed to be in here.
- There isn't any money in there!

648
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:33,312
Christ, Ivan. There isn't any money.
It's an urban legend.

649
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:37,407
I'll only ask once.
Where's the money?

650
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:40,620
You just don't get it, do you?

651
01:22:55,203 --> 01:23:02,302
Sleep well, fatso.
Crazy Uffe...

652
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:09,116
- What about you and Ivan?
- Luckily the police arrested him.

653
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:12,448
And the guy in the shawarma place
fell asleep, so I took off.

654
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:18,688
- What happened to Tina?
- And the Mexican and Sonny?

655
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:23,025
I haven't heard.
I think they moved abroad.

656
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,158
- I think Ramirez moved to Paris.
- No, that's not true.

657
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:32,797
You don't know a thing.
Are you all stupid?

658
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:38,712
- Did you forget about Yuri?
- Yuri? Were the 20 million his?

659
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:44,217
He smuggled the money to Germany,
and Frank stole his money?

660
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:50,986
Yes. Yuri wanted his money back.
He went to Copenhagen to find Frank.

661
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:55,156
That was a couple of days
before Shameer, the snake,

662
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:59,892
and his damned brother
stabbed Frank.

663
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,770
Are we interrupting something,
Frank?

664
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:25,787
What are you up to?
The town is buzzing with excitement.

665
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:33,833
Now all the robbers and conmen
are looking for my 5 million.

666
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:39,464
I want my money back. Pronto!

667
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:43,273
Find it and give me a call.

668
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:48,815
- I don't have your money, Yuri.
- Three days, Frank.

669
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,490
She's hot, isn't she, Sonny?

670
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:17,695
You know why I'm here.
I'm giving you one chance.

671
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:24,138
If I tell you where your money is,
will you take your old mug away?

672
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:30,181
- Maybe. There's no guarantee.
- I didn't think so.

673
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:34,049
I don't know where your money is,
and even if I did,

674
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,987
I wouldn't tell you.

675
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:41,528
So take your girlfriend and beat it.

676
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:04,149
Do you have to be as stubborn
as your father, Sonny?

677
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:14,254
I'll beat it,
but my girlfriend will stick around.

678
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,898
Have fun, you two.

679
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:43,406
That's the end of the story,
and all the assholes are gone.

680
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:50,182
And the money's still there.
I have to go.

681
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:57,497
I'll find it.
It's only a matter of time.

682
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,064
I have to go.

683
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,394
See you, Tuki.

684
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:10,667
- You got yourselves a great story.
- You bet.

685
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:18,583
- Are you guys looking for the money?
- Frank took it to Spain.

686
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,984
- Isn't Frank dead?
- Yes. He's dead.

687
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:25,684
- Is not.
- Is too!

688
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:32,999
Frank is alive and kicking.
I have to take a piss.

689
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,826
- Want to come?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

690
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:44,042
Don't come back, you sponger.

691
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,926
- Camilla!
- Wait a minute.

692
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,194
- Isn't that guy in the corner...?
- Who?

693
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:17,500
- Come on! Quick!
- What's up?

694
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:29,388
- What are we looking for?
- I thought I saw...

695
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:32,559
It could have been...

696
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:36,495
Never mind.
Another beer?

697
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,188
Yes.

698
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:56,877
IF YOU SCRATCH ME, YOU DIE!

699
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:15,159
Stop it! I told you not to film me!
You got that, dickhead?

700
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:23,508
- Tina, I was reading that.
- I'm sweating bullets, Dad.

701
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:30,574
- Can't we go? I hate sitting here.
- Break it off, Sonny. We're leaving.

702
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:39,888
Brian, get out of the car now!
I'm the only one who drives this car!

703
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:46,523
- No one else. You got that? Out!
- Take it easy, Dad.

704
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:51,867
- Dad, can I drive to Hamburg?
- Of course, my boy.

705
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:58,241
- Why will you let Sonny drive?
- It doesn't matter who drives.

706
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:01,109
Stop it, or I'll smack you.

707
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:05,584
Don't go more than 120 mph
until we hit the motorway.

708
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,347
Hand me that bag.

709
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:14,821
Brian, pay for the gas.

710
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:21,766
Dad wants all the change back.
Did you get that? Did you?

711
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:27,273
Brian, get a couple of hotdogs
for uncle. Brian! I'm hungry.

712
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:31,139
No more food for you.
We're going to the beach in Spain.

713
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,180
I don't want to lie
next to a beached whale.

714
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:40,652
I haven't eaten all morning.
I'm hungry.

715
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:46,421
- I think I've lost some weight.
- You haven't lost an ounce.

716
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:53,626
- Tina, I love you. Give us a kiss.
- Forget it!

717
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:59,536
- Tina, baby...
- Ramirez! Knock it off!

718
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:06,068
We're leaving, Brian.
Get in. Hurry up.

719
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:14,214
I only let you come along
if you wouldn't film me! Hand it over!

720
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,822
- My camera!
- Fuck the camera!

721
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,289
I need it to make my movie.

722
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:29,101
- Your mother told me to watch you.
- She gave me the camera!
