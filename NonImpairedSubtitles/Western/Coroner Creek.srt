1
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,331
Howdy, Danning.
- Find any of them?

2
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:02,328
You're lucky, the buck wants to
buy him a new wife.

3
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:05,771
He's a Chiricahua Apache
so he'll take your money.

4
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:10,441
You better give me that gun,
it's hard to keep your temper
if you ain't used to them.

5
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,251
They'd aggravate the flies off of a buffalo.
- I'll keep my temper.

6
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:19,781
You been an Indian scout as long as
I have, you learn to be patient.

7
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:25,456
I've been patient. For 18 months.
Let's go.

8
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,938
He wants to see
the colour of your money.

9
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,971
How can I be sure he was in on
the hold-up?

10
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:21,027
That's where he got this withered
arm, he caught a chunk of lead.

11
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:30,205
Smoke him out.

12
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:47,588
He was with a bunch of young bucks
led by a renegade Indian named Tona,
a white man hired them.

13
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,398
What about the white man?

14
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,991
This white man who used to work for
a stage and freighter line

15
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,012
knew about
a mine payroll going through.

16
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:00,995
Filled Tona and his bucks full of
fire juice so they'd raid the coach.

17
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,631
Promised to make them all
rich Injuns,

18
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,230
only he made most of them
dead Injuns.

19
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,706
He got away with all the money
for himself.

20
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,181
What about the passengers?

21
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,852
The white man shot them right there.
All except the girl.

22
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,046
What happened to her?

23
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:31,575
He kept her prisoner for three days,
then she killed herself with this.

24
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:36,487
It's the white man's knife.

25
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,383
The white man, what did he look like?
Everything he can remember.

26
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,822
Big.

27
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,699
Strong.

28
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,849
Yellow hair.

29
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:56,403
Blue eyes.

30
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:02,862
A scar on his right cheek and spoke
Apache like it was his own language.

31
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:07,568
That's all he knows.

32
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,948
Big, strong, yellow hair,

33
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,901
blue eyes
and a scar on his right cheek?

34
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:20,355
Let's hightail.

35
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,128
How much I owe you, Mac?
- Not a thing.

36
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:39,034
If I'm not being too nosey, you working for
the mining company that lost the payroll?

37
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:40,114
No

38
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:42,808
Then what's your personal interest?

39
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,236
Like you said, personal.
- I doubt if you'll ever catch him.

40
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:49,696
I got the rest of my life to try.

41
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,047
And if you do?

42
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,394
I'm going to kill him.

43
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:56,989
That girl on the stage coach maybe?

44
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,101
Maybe.

45
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,635
'Big, tall, blond,
a scar on his right cheek.'

46
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:25,864
'A stage and freighter man.
A stage and freighter man.'

47
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:47,942
'Tombstone, we'll keep going.'

48
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:51,486
'A stage and freighter man.'

49
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,812
'A scar on his face.'

50
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:57,506
'Now for Tucson.'

51
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:20,809
'Big valley.'

52
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:25,644
'He speaks Apache.'

53
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:28,442
'We'll keep going.'

54
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,063
Howdy.
- Howdy.

55
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,335
Rub him down and feed him.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:55,914
Hand me that gun. Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

57
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,960
What do you want?

58
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:36,751
According to the book, room
number nine is supposed to be empty.

59
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,957
If you look at your key
you'll find it's room number six.

60
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:42,925
Oh. I had it upside down,
excuse me.

61
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,322
You're new in Coroner Creek,
aren't you?

62
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:50,038
Yes, just got in.
- Perhaps you can help me. Will you come in?

63
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:59,624
What's the matter with her?
- She, er...

64
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:05,425
She doesn't feel well.

65
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,472
Why, she's drunk.

66
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:12,499
I know. I've got to get her
back to her ranch.

67
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:17,078
Her buggy's in the alley at the
back, if you could take her home -

68
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:22,253
If she drove in, she can drive back
when she sobers up.
- I didn't want her to go home alone.

69
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:27,442
I suppose it is a favour to ask.
- I need sleep, I've ridden a long ways today.

70
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:31,507
Then I'm sorry I mentioned it,
your sleep is far more important.

71
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:33,945
Your room's across the hall.

72
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,626
It's alright, I'm Kate Hardison,
I run this hotel.

73
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:40,182
You run this place?
- What's so strange about that?

74
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:43,773
Oh, nothing, lady, nothing.
My name's Chris Danning.

75
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,125
Abbie? Abbie, wake up!

76
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,112
Abbie!

77
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,505
That's Apache talk.

78
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,705
She learned it from her husband.

79
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,817
Who is her husband?
- Younger Miles.

80
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:09,860
Miles, Younger Miles.

81
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:15,527
Is he the man that runs the freight
line across the street?
- Yes it is.

82
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:17,618
Now if you'll excuse me...

83
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:21,425
You misunderstood me a moment ago,
I'll see that she gets home safely.

84
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:25,406
I was just thinking it funny you
trusting a stranger to take her.

85
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:29,406
I didn't want to shame her by asking
someone she knows. Besides, if her

86
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:33,514
husband comes looking for her I want
to be here to tell him a lie or two.

87
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:40,422
Just where is this Rainbow Ranch?
- At the south edge of town,

88
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:45,614
the alley leads to the road that
passes it, the horses will take you.
- I'll find it.

89
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:23,015
You alright, Mrs Miles?
- Yeah, she's alright.

90
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,599
Who are you?
- I might ask you the same question.

91
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,538
Get out before I kick you out.
- I'll do my talking from here.

92
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,195
You will, huh?!

93
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:09,256
Now maybe you'll talk, huh?

94
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:13,575
What where you doing with her?
- Kate Hardison asked me to take her home.

95
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:16,361
She's been that way
since I first saw her.

96
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:20,949
Then why didn't you say so sooner?
Saved us both a lot of trouble.

97
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,602
You should have asked me.

98
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:29,184
You men take Mrs Miles home.
I'll see you back to town.

99
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,846
Much obliged,
I get awfully scared in the dark.

100
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:36,307
Yeah, I'll bet.

101
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,883
Hey, Mac!

102
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,383
Take care of them.
- Right, Ernie.

103
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,928
Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

104
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:14,473
What do you figure, riding on
through or stop over for a while?
- That depends.

105
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,906
If you want to stick around,
Miles can always use

106
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:21,527
another man-sized hand out at the
Rainbow. He's a good boss too.

107
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,559
I'll think it over.
- Good.

108
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,224
About tonight, like I said,
I made a mistake.

109
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,361
Ah, forget it. Match?
- Thanks.

110
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:35,357
About Mrs Miles, what happened
tonight is Younger Miles'

111
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:38,542
private business. If you're smart
you'll keep it that way.

112
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,805
If he was smart he’d keep her home.

113
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:02,863
Mr Danning? You couldn't have made
it to Rainbow and back, who'd you meet?

114
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,676
The Rainbow crew, they took over.

115
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:08,190
Oh, Abbie will be alright then.

116
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,969
Which one of them hit you?
- Ernie somebody.

117
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:15,005
You came back in pretty good shape.
You must have hit him too.
- I got in a couple.

118
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:18,988
Good for you, everybody wants to
hit Ernie but nobody ever does.

119
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,874
Is that why you asked a stranger
to take her home?

120
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,866
I didn't know you'd run into them.
I'm glad you're not hurt.

121
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:27,325
Yeah, I'll second that.

122
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,450
You must be hungry. I got a large
platter of steaks and apple pie.

123
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,881
Well, well, what are we waiting for?

124
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,810
Kate! Oh, would you do me another
favour first?

125
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,711
Well, I...
- Come with me.

126
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:46,511
There's someone outside
I want you to help me with.

127
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:51,926
Another drunk?
- Oh, no, I've handled
my last one of those for tonight.

128
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,494
This is my father, Walt Hardison.
Dad, this is Chris Danning.

129
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,708
How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

130
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,575
So you the hand Ernie Combs wants
for Rainbow?

131
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:07,770
You've got good ears, Mr Hardison.
- A cripple's pastime.

132
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,087
Thank you.

133
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,198
The Good Book is also a cripple's
pastime, a very pleasant one,

134
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:18,543
although some people try to run away
from it. That's very hard to do.

135
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,213
It's your bedtime, Dad.
I think you'd better come in now.

136
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,862
Abbie. Abbie!

137
00:18:55,752 --> 00:19:01,167
When are you going to stop
this sort of thing?
- Nobody saw me.

138
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:05,793
You let a strange man bring you
home, didn't you?
- I don't remember.

139
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:08,423
That's the trouble,
you don't remember.

140
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:12,622
I've told you a dozen times,
drink yourself into a stupor,

141
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,087
but do it in your own room.

142
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:19,356
I don't want anyone seeing you.
Of course you don't.

143
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:23,700
Because a respectable wife
keeps nice folks from talking.

144
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,849
That couldn't have been the reason
why you didn't marry that girl
you moved to Brush Flats, could it?

145
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:33,034
Because it hasn't stopped you from
making regular visits over there.

146
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,419
You and your pretence
of respectability.

147
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:41,203
And respectable is what
we're going to be. To the people
outside this house anyway.

148
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,125
I've worked too long and too hard
to build up my position around here.

149
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,245
I didn't get married to have
a drunken wife pull me down.

150
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:52,723
Of course you didn't, you married me
because you thought I was pretty

151
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:58,626
enough to dress up this house
and wear fashionable clothes
and impress people you could use.

152
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,389
That's why you married me.

153
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:04,695
Can you blame me
for trying to forget that?

154
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:07,816
Can you?

155
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,157
Is Miles around?

156
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,536
No, he hasn’t come in yet. He spends
most his time at the ranch.

157
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:48,603
You McKeogh, his partner?
- No, I'm Charlie, Charlie Weatherby,
and there ain't no partner.

158
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:52,481
Miles left McKeogh's name on the
sign when he bought him out.

159
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,985
I seem to remember the deal now,
quite some time ago.

160
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,547
Oh, not so long ago,
a year and a half.

161
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:01,196
18 months, eh?
- About that.

162
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:13,355
Hey, look out there, mister!

163
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,715
Whoa!

164
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:24,428
Thank you.

165
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:27,555
I'm going to see Kate for a minute,
you wait here.

166
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:31,297
Well if I ain't exactly in eyeshot
when you want me, Miss Harms,

167
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,909
just give one whistle like this.

168
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:38,718
Easier than that, I'll poke my head
in that door of that saloon.

169
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,697
You're sure set on running me down
one way or another.

170
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,758
I extend my apologies, mister.

171
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,420
And to show you I'm sincere,
I'll buy you a drink.

172
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,982
You made a deal, mister.

173
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:12,085
Here's to an easy saddle
and good riding, friend.

174
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:15,625
May your boots never get dusty
and your guns never get rusty.

175
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,416
Longfellow, huh?
- I reckon.

176
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,507
How are you, boys?
Hello, Jack.

177
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,991
Step up, men, first round's on me.

178
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:29,313
Take care of the boys at the card table.
- Sure, Ernie.

179
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:32,069
Hello, Danning.

180
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:35,409
Oh, now, Jack, you know better.
Get that stuff with the beat on it.

181
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:39,739
The best is none too good for
my friends. That's a little better.

182
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:43,005
Must be lush country when ranch hands
can toss money around like that.

183
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:47,151
Ranch hands, ha! They're Younger
Miles’ personal gun hands.

184
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:49,959
Them's the fellas
what's keepin’ him in business.

185
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:55,021
This Miles must be pretty big around
here. What kind of a man is he?

186
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:58,521
Judge for yourself,
he's coming in the door now.

187
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,560
Set them up again, Jack,
a special for the boss.

188
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,780
That fellow Danning around?
- Over in the corner with Andy.

189
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:22,852
'Big, strong, yellow hair, blue eyes,
and a scar on his right cheek.'

190
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,929
I'm Younger Miles.

191
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,368
Ernie says you can't make up
your mind about working for me.

192
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,418
That's what I told him.

193
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:33,382
Ernie wants to buy you a drink.
- Huh?

194
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,051
Oh, I see.

195
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:39,864
When I pay a man I expect him to be
loyal enough to keep his mouth shut.

196
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:42,097
And if you don't pay him?

197
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:45,588
He still gets paid, some other way.

198
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:53,583
Hey, you there, you know Mrs Miles?
- Sure.

199
00:23:53,574 --> 00:23:56,964
I took her home last night,
she was drunk.

200
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,374
Dead drunk.

201
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:08,883
Alright, everybody. I'm serving a
notice on all you evildoers to make

202
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,874
yourselves scarce 'cause
the majesty of the Law just arrived.

203
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,189
Well, just in time!
- Yes, Sheriff, just in time.

204
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,009
How's that lovely daughter of mine, Miles?
- Abbie's fine, Sheriff.

205
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:23,875
We were just talking about her.
- Good. You couldn't talk about a nicer girl.

206
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:28,167
I've never seen you before,
you're a stranger, aren't you?

207
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,836
Welcome to Coroner Creek.
I'm Sheriff O'Hea. Any friend
of Miles is a friend of mine.

208
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:36,474
Come over and have a drink with us.
- Some other time, Sheriff.

209
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,100
Why'd you let him get away with it?

210
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,122
He wanted me to draw.
I wonder why?

211
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,619
'Yes?'
- May I see you a moment?

212
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:35,076
Who is it?
- I'm Della Harms.

213
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,937
I said, what do you want?
- I wonder if you could help me?
- I doubt it.

214
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,552
I need a man to run my ranch.
- Not interested.

215
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:52,113
The work wouldn't be too hard.
- Sorry.

216
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:56,275
So am I. After all, I suppose it was
foolish of me to think

217
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:59,343
you'd be interested in my fight
with Younger Miles.

218
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,751
Wait, who did you say you were?

219
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:05,206
Della Harms.
- Why do you particularly
want me to work for you?

220
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,690
I heard you talking to Miles,
he's never taken that from any man.

221
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,388
That's why I thought you'd be
the one to stop the Rainbow crowd.

222
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:18,318
Stop it?
- Yes, stop Younger Miles. He came here with
money and it's given him means to make more.

223
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:23,046
The stage line, Rainbow Ranch, now
he's after my place - the Box H.

224
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:27,144
If you have title he can't steal it.
- He has ways that he can, legally.

225
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:32,403
There isn't enough open range
for both our outfits.
And he's trying to squeeze me out.

226
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:38,022
But with you on my side we
might do the squeezing.
- Yes, we might.

227
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:40,783
Thank you so much.
Chris, isn't it?

228
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:44,309
We'll show Miles
that he can't bluff us.

229
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,528
Kate, congratulate me.

230
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,890
I've hired him.
- He's a stranger here, Della, a drifter,
you don't know anything about him.

231
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:12,544
I know enough about him to want him
to work for me and that settles it.

232
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:15,653
Well, Kate,
how do you like the new material?

233
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:18,402
It's beautiful, would make a lovely dress.

234
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:23,182
Must have been expensive.
- It wasn't cheap, the best in Kansas City.

235
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:26,913
When Roy was alive he used to say
"Every time you get a new dress,

236
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:30,542
I have to cut out a dozen
head of cattle to pay for it."

237
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:33,107
Speaking of cattle, I gotta get back.

238
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:36,585
Tell Chris to hurry. Goodbye, dear.

239
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:42,460
Andy?

240
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:44,787
Are you ready, Miss Harms?
- Yes.

241
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:47,053
Andy, you ride Mr Danning's horse.

242
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:50,158
Huh? Yes, ma'am.

243
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,719
Hey, tell me something will ya, how
comes Miss Harms hired that drifter?
Don't tell me, I know,

244
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,919
most women ain't got no more sense
that a sheep herder.

245
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:09,907
What did you expect to gain by
insulting Abbie Miles in public?

246
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,211
What has she ever done to you?
- Nothing.

247
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:18,290
Was it to get at Younger Miles?
Cos if it was you've hurt her much
more than you could ever hurt him.

248
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:21,128
For the room.

249
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:24,313
And now you're gonna work for Della Harms?
- That's right.

250
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:29,504
Have you stopped to think what you'll start?
- From what Miss Harms told me that's already started.

251
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:33,490
What are you after anyway?
- Now that's my business.

252
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,359
From what I've seen of your business
it means nothing but trouble here.

253
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,988
Why don't you ride on through?
- When I'm ready.

254
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:43,542
You're sick with hating, aren't you?

255
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,111
Why don't you finish it now and go?

256
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:49,863
I'll finish it. A little every day.

257
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:01,811
Mr Danning, you ride with me.
Andy will bring your horse.

258
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:05,838
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:31,007
Well, there goes another foreman of
Della Harms we'll have to run out of
this part of the country.

260
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,757
What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

261
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,046
His spirit is dead,
you can see it in his eyes.

262
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:50,219
They're ugly, but his face isn't.

263
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:53,019
He just doesn't care.

264
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:57,796
Then why should you?
- I don't.

265
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:12,266
All of that as far as you can see
is the Rainbow Ranch.

266
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:15,903
With Younger Miles sitting at
the end of the Rainbow, eh?

267
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,347
That's right, Mr Danning.

268
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:22,483
I don't imagine he's a man who'd take
kindly to losing that position.

269
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:25,582
Losing is the one word that drives
Younger Miles crazy.

270
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,539
Crazy?

271
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,431
You know, Miss Harms, that's an idea.

272
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,452
That green patch there
starts at the Box H.

273
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,404
Take care of Mr Danning's horse.

274
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:02,214
Since when -
- Andy, do as I say.
- Yes, ma'am.

275
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,084
Thank you.

276
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,517
Well, how do you like it?

277
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:17,708
Pretty fancy.
- I just can't stand disorder.

278
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,754
Nice layout, did you and your husband
build it together?

279
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:28,032
No, he had it running when I met him.
- Where was that?

280
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:30,997
That was eight years ago.
He's been dead for over two.

281
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:33,725
Must have been pretty tough
for you alone?

282
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,755
It has been lately.

283
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:39,323
I'll take these in the house.
You wait here, I want to introduce

284
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:41,598
you to the rest of the hands.
- Yes, boss lady.

285
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:46,836
Chris, I want you to be happy
and comfortable here.

286
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,358
Leach? Frank?

287
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:09,584
I want you to meet my new foreman,
Chris Danning.

288
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,777
Chris, this is Frank Yordy
and Leach Conover.

289
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:15,094
How do you do?
How do you do?

290
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:19,545
I'll leave you all to get acquainted.
After supper we'll discuss our plans.

291
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:26,258
Foreman, huh?

292
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:31,123
Andy's been telling us about you.
- Yeah?

293
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:34,114
Yordy, I looked at them
west boundary fence posts,

294
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:37,986
they don't need fixing for another
couple of weeks yet. Besides, I got

295
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:40,738
to paint some cupboards for the
kitchen tomorrow.

296
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:44,455
Say, who's going to transplant them
flowers? Yordy?

297
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:47,679
I said who's gonna transplant
them flowers she wanted done?

298
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:51,346
Maybe Mr Danning will do it.
He likes to throw dirt around.

299
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,924
Let's put things straight before we
go any further.

300
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:58,204
I'll tell you this, starting now
you're tying in to hard work.

301
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:02,867
You'll polish saddle leather from
dawn to dusk, longer if I'm going to
ramrod this outfit.

302
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:05,319
Maybe that's one thing you ain't
gonna do.

303
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,189
I ain't taking orders from no loud
mouth, neither are Andy or Leach.

304
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,226
Go on, Yordy,
flap your tongue some more.

305
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:16,988
Sure I will, if you had any sense
you'd be over the black boughs.

306
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:20,375
We don't take your kind of talk
in this part of the country.

307
00:33:20,368 --> 00:33:23,747
What you think you're gonna do when
Younger Miles opens up on you?

308
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:26,256
This, Yordy.

309
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,791
Saddle up and get out.

310
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:34,900
Now I said.

311
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,106
What about you, Andy?
- Who, me?

312
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,083
Walk out if you want or stay and fight Rainbow.
I ain't never shot a man, I don't even pack a gun.

313
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,346
Then start now. You, Leach?
- Think I better fix them boundary fences.

314
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:03,117
Guess I better get started cleaning
out the hen house, I reckon.

315
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:13,717
There you are, up beyond Feserley
Canyon is where the Box H has

316
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:16,996
stopped for years.
Open range and 400 miles.

317
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:19,646
That's finished now.
- Dried out?

318
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:23,080
Froze out more like it, by Rainbow.

319
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:26,193
If he's taken it over
we can take it back.

320
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:31,022
Not Feserley Canyon you won't.
Six months ago one of Rainbow's
hands, Tip Henry,

321
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:35,538
filed a homestead claim on it, if he
stays out the year on it it's his.

322
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,670
Then sells it to Miles.

323
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,017
I want to look at Tip Henry's shack
on the quiet. How far is it?

324
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:46,123
About a mile. But I can think of a
lot of scenery I would rather see.

325
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,472
Don't move.

326
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,916
Andy, throw that drifter's gun away.

327
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:06,136
What's the matter, Stew, this ain't
no way to act.
- Shut upl

328
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:10,623
You're both coming with me.
Come on, move!

329
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:50,310
Ernie?

330
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,209
Ernie!

331
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:11,199
Where'd you find them?
- On Rainbow property.

332
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:13,585
Just coming up to meet my neighbours.

333
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:15,958
Well you met them, take a good look.

334
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,007
I don't see anything worth looking at.
- You don't, huh?

335
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:21,244
Take it easy, itchy fingers.

336
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,939
You tough drifters will never learn.
Been everywhere, seen everything.

337
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:29,265
Pretty handy with a six-gun, huh?
- Maybe.

338
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:31,903
Get down.

339
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,198
Let's find out how tough
you really are.

340
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:38,043
Hey, wait a minute, Ernie, Chris
ain't done nothing.
- Shut up, Andy.

341
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:41,240
Go home and take care of your flower garden.
- Flower garden?

342
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:44,385
You heard him, go on back to
your knitting.

343
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,860
No witnesses, eh?

344
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:50,366
That's right.

345
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:54,842
Get going, Andy.

346
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:55,982
Tip, come here.

347
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,462
That's how to treat those tough drifters.

348
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:19,558
Bust up their trigger fingers.

349
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:23,030
Now watch him dog it out of here.

350
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,141
Remember, Tip, when he comes to,
put him on his horse and head him

351
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:56,721
for the black boughs. Tell him to keep riding.
- Sure, Ernie.

352
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:14,226
Hold it!

353
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,862
Drop them gun belts, all of you.

354
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,599
All of you!

355
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:26,242
You too, Ernie.
- You'd better me careful,
Andy, those things go off.

356
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:32,047
Where is he?
What did you do with him?

357
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:35,192
Last we seen of him was heading for
the black boughs.

358
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:40,316
Somebody better start talking or
I'm going to blow somebody apart!

359
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,546
Did you do that, Ernie?
- Why, Andy, you know better.

360
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:02,460
His horse bit him.

361
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:16,252
Ernie, I think I'm going to shoot you.

362
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:20,002
Hold it, Andy,
you just take care of the others.

363
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:22,485
I'll take care of them.
Get over here!

364
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:26,191
Don't any one of you make a move.

365
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:33,716
How did he do it?

366
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:37,503
Somebody better start talking.

367
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:43,290
He stomped on it.

368
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:12,722
Which one of you is Tip Henry?

369
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:14,808
I am.

370
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:20,005
Listen, Henry, you homesteaded
this place for Miles.

371
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,838
You've got six months left
to live on it,

372
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:28,581
to make it what Miles calls legal.

373
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,027
Half those nights I'll come back
and shoot it up

374
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:35,585
until you move or I kill you.

375
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:40,406
And you can tell Miles I won't need
any Indians to help me.

376
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:46,743
I'm sorry, dear, I didn't mean that.

377
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:51,366
I know you didn't, it's the only
thing that seems to help.

378
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:55,291
I understand but drinking doesn't
answer anything.

379
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,803
I thought I told you to keep away
from here, Abbie.

380
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,610
I was just visiting with Kate.
- Visiting, huh?

381
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:03,820
The whole town's talking about your
last visit with her.

382
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:08,221
Get this straight, Younger.
Abbie's never done any drinking here.

383
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:14,362
Kate was only trying to help me
the other night. Which is more than
you've ever done, Younger.

384
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:20,195
Well, howdy, folks. I'll be darned if
I don't believe you and that man of
yours are the best looking couple in

385
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:25,226
Coroner Creek. Katie, there's nothing
like a marriage to keep a woman
looking beautiful.

386
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:30,262
Is there anything wrong, daughter?

387
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:33,271
No, Dad, I was just...

388
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:37,614
That new piano I bought Abbie
was sent out to the ranch today.

389
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:40,930
She ought to be there.
- Yes, of course she should.

390
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:46,775
We'll finish our talk at home.
- A new piano. You're a mighty lucky girl.

391
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:48,918
All of the things Miles
has done for you.

392
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:51,844
Yes, all he's done for me.

393
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,333
He's done a lot for you too,
hasn't he, Dad?

394
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:58,597
He sure has, why, I wouldn't even be
sheriff if it wasn't for him.

395
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,966
What's the matter with her?
Seems like everyone's jumpy today.

396
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,202
Bring me this pot roast,
a lot of gravy.

397
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:14,782
Bring a little catsup too.

398
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,788
Here you are, Mr Miles.

399
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,602
You can't tell me about Danning,
I know all about him, Tip.

400
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,287
Come on, have another drink.

401
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:49,165
What are you doing away from
Feserley Canyon, Tip?

402
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,833
I guess you ain't heard what
happened to Ernie?

403
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:54,203
I heard about it.

404
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:56,957
What's it got to do with you?

405
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:59,736
What's it got to do with me?

406
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:04,503
Danning's kicked me off my own
claim, I'm scared, Miles.

407
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:08,943
He's the kickinist-off dodo I ever
seen, he run me of the Box H.

408
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:13,030
I can understand you being scared,
Yordy, but Tip here -
- I wasn't scared,

409
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:15,427
I told that big...
- I'm scared.

410
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,486
I'm scared good. And I'm quitting.

411
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:20,512
You're what?
- I'm quitting.

412
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:25,826
I paid your fee to farm on that
land. I'm paying you good wages.

413
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:29,188
I'm feeding you. I'm giving you
$1,000 for that quarter section.

414
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:31,593
Isn't that enough?

415
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:36,528
You don't get it, there ain't enough
money in the world to keep me there.
I'm quitting.

416
00:45:36,523 --> 00:45:39,128
I ain't never going back there,
he'll kill me.

417
00:45:39,128 --> 00:45:42,825
I'll send some men out there with
you every night.
- He'd kill them too.

418
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:46,728
He's crazy!
- Say, I'd like a crack at that...
- Shut up!

419
00:45:46,718 --> 00:45:51,371
You haven't got a title to that land
until you've proved up on it. Where
does that leave me?

420
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:56,186
I don't know, but it leaves me alive though.
- If anybody takes a shot at you he'll be hunted

421
00:45:56,181 --> 00:46:00,754
down by the US Marshal. We can't
afford to hunt him down ourselves,
it ain't legal.

422
00:46:00,753 --> 00:46:04,644
Say, that wouldn't stop you, Mr Miles.
- Yordy, someday somebody's

423
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,210
gonna poke your tongue down
your throat.

424
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:11,190
What happens to Danning isn't going
to interest me, with me in my grave.

425
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:15,794
He said he'll come back every night
and shoot up the place until I move
or got killed.

426
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:19,889
And he said to tell you that he
wouldn't need any Indians to help
him do the job.

427
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:23,359
What did you say about Indians?

428
00:46:23,357 --> 00:46:26,292
I don't savvy the Indian part.

429
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,637
Did you know Danning from some
place else?

430
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:35,993
That will teach you not to walk out
on me, you yellow back.

431
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:47,139
Mr Miles!

432
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:14,945
Just the man I'm looking for, Sheriff.

433
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:19,660
If it's about filing charges against
Ernie, you won't get anywhere,
you hit him first.

434
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:23,091
I hit him last, Sheriff.
- My friend, you're headed for trouble.

435
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:25,940
You giving the folks around here
no reason to love you.

436
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:28,455
I'll do my best to protect you
because it's my job.

437
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:32,565
I appreciate that.
- It's also my job to warn you that Frank Yordy

438
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:35,446
is spreading stories that
he's gunning for you.

439
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,233
Did Miles tell you that?
- Yes, I did.

440
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:40,982
But I didn't think O'Hea would
pass it on.

441
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:44,637
I want him to know what's going on
so he can keep an eye on you two.

442
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:49,929
That's real nice of you.
- We don't go in for backstabbing here,
Danning, no matter whose.

443
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:54,305
This is a law-abiding community.
- Yes, and I aim to keep it that way.

444
00:47:54,296 --> 00:47:57,163
You'd better tell that to Miles, not me.

445
00:47:57,153 --> 00:47:59,951
Now look here, Miles...

446
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:03,064
He already knows that!

447
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:06,095
Personally I don't think there's
going to be any trouble.

448
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,944
Personally I think Yordy's just bluffing.

449
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:11,244
Personally I think...

450
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,849
Personally I think we might as
well forget...

451
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:54,331
Don't move, Yordy, until I tell you to.

452
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:56,980
Don't even put down that skillet.

453
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:59,185
Well, it's hot.

454
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:02,091
You going to be hot all over
before I finish with you.

455
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:05,759
What do you want with me?
- A little straight talk.

456
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,950
I can't hold it any longer.

457
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,528
Keep them high, Yordy.

458
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,421
I heard you were out to get me?

459
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,125
Get you? Where'd you hear that?

460
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,470
Miles told the sheriff.
- Miles? That's a lie.

461
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:24,394
I figured it was, that's why I'm
here. What was your deal with Miles?

462
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:26,816
Sheriff O'Hea thinks you're after me.

463
00:49:26,816 --> 00:49:31,048
So if I shot you I could claim self-defence.
- I never made no deal with Miles.

464
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:36,621
If I shot you just right, say under
that left shoulder blade, you know
what would happen to you, Yordy?

465
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:42,098
You'd fall face down
on that nice hot stove.

466
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:45,511
Ever see a man with the skin burned
all off his face, Yordy?

467
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:50,669
You've branded enough cattle,
you know what happens to hide
when it meets hot iron.

468
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:57,959
You wouldn't get an idea
my left hand's slower than
your right, would you?

469
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:00,294
But if you'd like to prove it...

470
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,413
Well?
- Alright, I'll tell you everything.

471
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:19,962
What about a cup of that hot java?

472
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:22,946
Yeah, sure.

473
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:32,115
Better have a cup yourself,
settle your nerves.

474
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:44,778
Now you ought to tell me a story.

475
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:50,093
Well, you know that box canyon back
of the shack here?

476
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:55,692
Yes. Well, we fenced it off
all summer to save the feed.

477
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:59,211
And then about a week ago we turned

478
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:02,519
all of Della's herd into that canyon.

479
00:51:02,513 --> 00:51:04,845
What about it?

480
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:08,665
I told Miles that if the fence
across the

481
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:12,582
mouth of the canyon
accidentally caught...

482
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:17,849
Accidentally caught fire
the grass would go.

483
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:20,835
That grass would burn like pitch.

484
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:26,714
What an idea that was, Yordy. The
cattle would move ahead of the fire
right into that canyon.

485
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:33,571
You murderous snake! What are you
supposed to get out of it?!

486
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:37,412
$500. I was to meet Miles at BJ
Folkenson's and get half of

487
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:41,143
it tonight and then after I set the
fire I was to get

488
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,564
the rest of it and head
over the pass and get outta here.

489
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,973
You think Miles would let you live?
He'd kill you after you went back

490
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:54,214
for the other half of the money and
I'd be blamed for it.
- That's right.

491
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:57,264
Pack your stuff. You're getting out
of here right now.

492
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:01,051
And if you ever head back to Coroner
Creek I'll be waiting for you.

493
00:52:17,354 --> 00:52:23,293
Leach, I got a job for you. Take
blankets and ride up to Falls Canyon,
I want you to camp there tonight

494
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:28,160
right at the fence. Don't make a fire
and sleep light. If anyone drifts up, run him off.

495
00:52:28,156 --> 00:52:33,128
This the first time I ever heard the
Rainbow outfit called cattle thieves
if that's what you mean.

496
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,714
I don't, just do as I say.

497
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:49,158
Della?
- Hello, Chris.

498
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:52,011
Where's Andy?
- Around some place.

499
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:56,042
I just sent Leach up to the canyon to
have a look at the cattle.
- What for?

500
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:58,243
There might be a few strays.

501
00:52:58,337 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh. Aren't you going to notice my
new dress?

502
00:53:00,996 --> 00:53:03,829
Already have.

503
00:53:05,879 --> 00:53:08,234
It's the latest fashion.
- It's pretty.

504
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:13,277
Della, about the cattle up in the
canyon, let's ship them now, take a
profit while we're sure.

505
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:18,058
Let's talk about the cattle another time.
- Haven't time, I'm heading for BJ Folkenson's.

506
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:44,356
What you having?
- Whisky.

507
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:50,498
It's kind of slow tonight, eh?

508
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:54,000
Anybody else been here?
- No, nobody ever comes here.

509
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,801
I don't know why you did.

510
00:54:59,054 --> 00:55:02,615
The drinks are two bits, keep your
own count. I'm going to bed.

511
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:36,133
If you're hiding from someone,
you better cover up that bandage.

512
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,931
What're you doing here?
- I followed you.
- Go on back home.

513
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:41,487
Why?
- You might not like what you see.

514
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,074
Who are you expecting?

515
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:46,794
Younger Miles, he's coming here to
meet Yordy.

516
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:49,415
But he's going to find me instead.

517
00:55:52,985 --> 00:55:55,545
Get inside quick.

518
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,840
Yordy?

519
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,150
Yordy couldn't make it.
- Who's that?

520
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:23,329
Danning, Yordy's run out on you.

521
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:57,484
I see you're keeping your promise.

522
00:56:57,481 --> 00:57:03,249
Yes, a little every day.
- Hey! Do your shooting somewhere
else, I'm trying to get some sleep!

523
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:10,956
So instead of paying him to set
the fire he would have killed him.

524
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:14,911
Chris, why don't you let him go?

525
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,913
Let him go?
- Yes, you got rid of Yordy.

526
00:57:17,906 --> 00:57:21,262
You ran out Tip Henry so Della can
have back her open range.

527
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,889
You wrecked Miles' scheme there.
You forced him to expose himself.

528
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:27,989
Isn't that enough?
- Not for me, Kate.

529
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:32,290
Chris, there's something or someone
bigger than all of us that takes

530
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:35,210
care of our injuries and squares
things for us.

531
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:39,175
I'll do my own squaring, Kate.

532
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:43,989
"Vengeance is mine, I will repay."
Remember?

533
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:46,589
I also remember "an eye for an eye."

534
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:49,622
No, Kate, I'm not going to turn
back now.

535
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:52,779
Miles must have done something
pretty terrible to you.

536
00:57:52,776 --> 00:57:56,598
And after you kill him,
what's ahead for you then?

537
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,967
I hadn't thought that far.

538
00:57:58,968 --> 00:58:01,744
You mean you hadn't cared to think
beyond that point?

539
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:05,793
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
- But you have to live with yourself.

540
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:08,936
Your hatred may destroy Miles but it
can also destroy you.

541
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:12,986
Hate is something that can feed on
itself for only so long.

542
00:58:12,983 --> 00:58:17,306
Don't worry about me. This fight with
Miles is in the open now, and it's my

543
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:21,659
fight alone. If anybody gets hurt
it’s going to be me and nobody else.

544
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,948
If you got hurt that might hurt
someone else.

545
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,512
That I can't help.

546
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,592
You can but you won't.

547
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:35,497
This thing that happened tonight -
I don't want you to say one word

548
00:58:35,494 --> 00:58:38,941
about what happened to anyone,
not even your father.

549
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:44,095
I hoped I can change you,
I see now I can't, nothing can.

550
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,724
You're caught in a web of your own
making and instead of trying to

551
00:58:47,717 --> 00:58:50,754
search for a way out of it,
you'd rather strangle it.

552
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:21,189
Yordy?

553
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:23,898
Yordy?!

554
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,222
I warned you, Abbie.

555
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,489
I'm in my own home.

556
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:47,278
Did that ever happen before, Abbie?

557
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:53,088
When you were a little girl I
couldn't bring myself to lay a hand

558
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,281
on you. Even to spank you, no matter
how wild you got.

559
01:01:56,276 --> 01:02:01,259
I never thought I'd live to see the
day my girl got slapped and I did
nothing about it.

560
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,165
A lot of things are beginning to make
sense to me now.

561
01:02:09,452 --> 01:02:12,967
You've only stayed here on account of
me, haven't you?

562
01:02:15,254 --> 01:02:19,076
Oh, Dad. You figured an old man was
entitled to lie comfortably

563
01:02:19,071 --> 01:02:21,642
in the sun when he was through,
didn't you?

564
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:26,637
Well, so did I maybe.

565
01:02:34,302 --> 01:02:36,429
Chris! Chris?!

566
01:02:36,425 --> 01:02:39,974
Chris! Chris!

567
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:42,605
Chris!
- What's troubling you, Andy?

568
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,057
Get on your horse, I'll tell you on
the way back.

569
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:49,608
I got a funny feeling it ain't good.
- I'll tell you on the way back.

570
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,004
I can't understand why Chris didn't tell.

571
01:03:02,994 --> 01:03:05,076
All he said to me was that -

572
01:03:05,069 --> 01:03:09,358
Where were you, Leach? I told you to
watch the cattle in the canyon.

573
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,081
I didn't figure on no fire. I knew
Miles' outfit wouldn't rustle

574
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,743
our cattle so didn't see the sense in staying.
- Nobody asked you to make sense of it.

575
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:22,187
Leach isn't to blame, you didn't tell him
it was fire you were afraid of.

576
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:25,387
You were afraid of fire, weren't you?
- Maybe.

577
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:29,340
If you told me it was fire you were
afraid of I would have stayed.

578
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,280
When I give an order I don't want to
to explain it, you follow that order.

579
01:03:32,573 --> 01:03:36,817
All that cattle lost,
maybe you'll tell us who did it.

580
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:42,336
Might have been one of Miles’ men or
even Miles himself, can't prove
anything unless Leach saw anything.

581
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:47,425
I didn't see nothing.
- You would have if you'd stayed like Chris told you.
- It wasn't Leach's fault.

582
01:03:47,419 --> 01:03:50,866
It was too, Miss Harms.
- Sorry for your bargain, Della?

583
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:52,959
All you brought us is trouble.

584
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:56,607
He brought you Feserley Canyon.
Tip Henry quit the country

585
01:03:56,604 --> 01:03:59,220
and lost the homestead
and you got back your old range.

586
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,805
If I remember rightly,
I told you I'd go lightly.

587
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,904
Hey, what are you all dressed up for?

588
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:25,850
I'm checking out too.
- No, you're staying, Andy, she needs you.

589
01:04:25,843 --> 01:04:31,907
Not me and Leach both she don't.
- You belong here, you're as much a
part of the Box H as that post there.

590
01:04:31,907 --> 01:04:35,104
Oh, I suppose so. But I'm not
letting you ride out of here alone.

591
01:04:35,098 --> 01:04:37,271
Rode in alone.

592
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:40,021
Drifting?
- That's just about it.

593
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:43,608
Soon as I've finished a little bit of
business in Coroner Creek.

594
01:04:43,604 --> 01:04:48,769
One thing I never will forget, the
way you walloped the dickens out of
that Ernie Combs that morning.

595
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,547
We done alright, didn't we?
- You did, Andy.

596
01:04:51,546 --> 01:04:55,073
Well, so long. Take care of things.
- Sure, Chris.

597
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:02,163
Better get out of these town duds
and into my working clothes.

598
01:05:12,965 --> 01:05:15,968
Chris, I'm sorry for what I said
a while ago.

599
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:19,723
I was so upset.
Will you forgive me and stay on?

600
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:24,186
I'm not letting you down, I'll find
the man that set that fire and you'll be paid

601
01:05:24,183 --> 01:05:27,505
back for the cattle you lost. There's
nothing more I can do here.

602
01:05:27,495 --> 01:05:29,872
Yes, I know.

603
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:34,325
You think more of your personal
battle with Miles than you do with
my loss, don't you?

604
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:38,265
If you put it that way I do.

605
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,809
But remember this, you've got to face
losing as well

606
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,258
as winning and if you can do that
you'll be alright.

607
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:49,196
I'll be alright. I know what it
means to win.

608
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:52,397
I know what it means to lose too.

609
01:05:55,635 --> 01:05:58,069
Good luck, Della.

610
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:26,503
Come in.

611
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:37,596
That's alright, Miss Harms, I
shouldn't have let myself be caught
mid-stream like this.

612
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:40,706
Andy, I have a job for you.

613
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:45,009
I want you to go up and take over
Tip Henry's shack and homestead
Feserley Canyon for us.

614
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:48,920
Is that an order, Miss Della?
- Yes it is.

615
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,033
Oh, Andy, I'll send Leach up later
with provisions.

616
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:56,560
Yes, ma'am.

617
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:00,838
Homestead, Feserley Canyon?

618
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:06,459
Where are you going, to a powwow?

619
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:19,540
That'll learn you.
When you're told to sleep by
the fence sleep by it, I reckon.

620
01:07:48,907 --> 01:07:51,808
Hi, Danning.

621
01:07:51,803 --> 01:07:54,158
I had an idea you'd show up here.
- Why?

622
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:57,969
Younger Miles rode into town, was
asking for you. That's why I'm waiting.

623
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,145
Well?
- Just to warn you to keep awake
and stay out of the open.

624
01:08:01,136 --> 01:08:03,764
Is that one of Miles' orders?
- Wait a minute…

625
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:07,169
I don't want your advice,
save it for your boss. And if you

626
01:08:07,168 --> 01:08:09,796
see him before I do you can say
I'm looking for him.

627
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:13,869
Alright but Younger Miles ain't in
town on Sunday for no church going.

628
01:08:25,517 --> 01:08:29,044
There's something peaceful about
a church bell, isn't there, Dad?

629
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,380
I don't know. Something ominous about

630
01:08:31,376 --> 01:08:35,710
the way it sounds today. There's an
unhealthy air about the whole town.

631
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:45,580
Jack, has Younger Miles been in here?
- No, I ain't seen him all morning.

632
01:08:48,562 --> 01:08:53,317
Come on, boys, drinks are on the house.
- How come?

633
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:55,716
Because Miles ain't here.

634
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:59,202
Morning, Chris.

635
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:01,373
Oh, good morning.

636
01:09:01,574 --> 01:09:03,474
Abbie, this is Chris Danning.

637
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:09,123
How do you do? I've been hoping I
would have a chance to talk to you.

638
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:11,948
If you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.

639
01:09:11,938 --> 01:09:16,637
I owe you an apology for a couple of
raw remarks I made.

640
01:09:16,627 --> 01:09:20,461
I accept your apology. Although it
was your right to say what you did.

641
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,375
I don't think any man has that right.
Although at the time I thought it
would serve my purpose.

642
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,197
You know, in a way I'm grateful to
you, Mr Danning.
- Grateful, how?

643
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:33,147
Miles is a cruel man but he always
checked himself before he went too far.

644
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:36,491
It wasn't until you came to town
that he began to lose control.

645
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:39,565
Well, I hope things will be better
for you now.

646
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:42,359
They will be, now that I've left him.

647
01:09:42,354 --> 01:09:45,699
Kate, I'll meet you at the church.

648
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:49,489
I'm very pleased to have met you, Mr Danning.
- Thank you.

649
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:54,685
Kate, I'd like to have my room back.

650
01:09:56,428 --> 01:09:58,999
What happened at the Box H?
- I quit the Box H.

651
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:01,520
You quit? But why?

652
01:10:01,518 --> 01:10:06,057
Falls Canyon was fired last night and
Della's prime bunch of two year olds was wiped out.

653
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:08,190
How could you leave at such a time?

654
01:10:08,188 --> 01:10:11,965
Well, I can help her more by finding
the man that did it and making him pay.

655
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,257
Miles?
- That's why I'm in town.

656
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:18,261
That's a job for the law, isn't it?

657
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:22,933
The law? In this town, where the
sheriff's working for Miles?
- Not any more.

658
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:27,851
O'Hea's against him and wants to
fight him. Why don't you join the
sheriff and fight with him?

659
01:10:27,847 --> 01:10:31,647
No, Kate, I’m sticking to my own way.

660
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:48,056
Kate!

661
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:51,440
I'm sorry.

662
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:53,628
I wish I'd known you before.
- Why?

663
01:10:55,415 --> 01:11:00,888
Because there's a better side to
you. You're letting your hatred for
one man destroy it.

664
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,599
You seem to know a lot about it.

665
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:05,676
I know all I need to know.

666
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,181
Except the beginning.

667
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:11,039
I even know the ending.

668
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:13,543
There only be one ending.

669
01:11:15,423 --> 01:11:18,074
But it's beyond that that's
troubling me the most,

670
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,466
not just the killing of Miles,
you're wondering whether it will

671
01:11:21,464 --> 01:11:25,343
bring you freedom and the peace of
mind you always thought it would.

672
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:29,061
You don't think it would, do you?
- I can't give an answer to that.

673
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:32,347
You'll have to get it over with and
find out for yourself.

674
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:58,397
Who you got there?
- Andy West, he's been killed.

675
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:00,698
When did it happen? How?

676
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:04,758
I came up on him at Tip Henry's
homestead, he said he was planning
to take over.

677
01:12:04,757 --> 01:12:07,931
He pulled a gun on me, it was me or him.

678
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:09,775
He got it.

679
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:12,599
He's telling the truth.
I saw it all.

680
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:24,336
Tell the sheriff what you told me.
- Well, I...
- Tell him!

681
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:33,945
I saw him kill Andy.
- He's a liar, O'Hea.
- Shut up.

682
01:12:33,935 --> 01:12:39,293
Now, Leach, just what did you see?
- Well I was riding up to Tip Henry's
shack to take Andy some grub.

683
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:42,508
Just as I was coming into the
clearing I saw Stew and Ernie,

684
01:12:42,503 --> 01:12:44,676
I heard him tell Andy to get.

685
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:49,091
Andy started to go and Stew shot him
in the back.
- You dirty little...
- Shut up, Stew!

686
01:12:49,085 --> 01:12:52,873
O'Hea, if you let them ride out of here...
- They're not riding anywhere.

687
01:12:52,863 --> 01:12:56,811
Get off them horses, both of you.
- What for?
- I'm arresting you.

688
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:03,839
We wrote all the way in to give Andy
a chance to be buried decent!

689
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:08,404
You ain't arresting us for protecting ourselves.
And neither is anybody else.

690
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:11,228
You heard what the sheriff said.

691
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:15,923
Get in there!

692
01:13:18,544 --> 01:13:21,274
Alright, Ernie, inside.

693
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:28,613
You must have forgot what side your
bread's buttered on, O'Hea.

694
01:13:32,171 --> 01:13:36,278
You know, Danning, it feels good to
get up off my knees.

695
01:14:00,664 --> 01:14:04,566
I know what Andy meant to you,
Chris. I'm beginning to understand.

696
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:09,627
Then you see, Kate, why I have to do
it my way now.

697
01:14:09,623 --> 01:14:13,184
Yes I do.

698
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:16,526
Good luck, Chris.

699
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:43,136
Well, boys, all I can say is this
has been the most exciting Sunday
that ever happened at Coroner Creek.

700
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:46,920
Sure was surprising to see the
sheriff put Younger Miles' boys in jail.

701
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,668
Surprising to see him jail anybody.

702
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,787
Have you seen Miles today?
- Nope, but if I was him and Chris

703
01:14:52,786 --> 01:14:56,768
Danning was looking for me, I'd want
to be sleeping in jail with my boys.

704
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,351
Howdy.
- Howdy.

705
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,434
Looks like you been riding hard, Danning.

706
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:12,338
Not hard enough. Looking for Younger
Miles.. Seen him?
- No I ain't.

707
01:16:05,823 --> 01:16:09,418
Alright, O'Hea, that was
a pretty good show you put on but

708
01:16:09,415 --> 01:16:12,714
you can open up this chicken coop
now and open up the back door.

709
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:17,603
Ernie, I'm telling you for the last
time, you're staying in there until
you get a fair trial.

710
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,342
Fair trial.
- You heard what I said.

711
01:16:20,335 --> 01:16:25,602
Why, you mangy old crow. Younger
Miles will have something to say about that!

712
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:28,745
Maybe.
- O'Hea?

713
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:38,588
What's the idea of locking up
my boys?

714
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:43,453
You always said you wanted things
done legal. That's just what I'm
doing. Just like I told them

715
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:46,454
they're staying in there until
they get a trial.

716
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:50,126
What's come over you, O'Hea?
I made you sheriff,

717
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,032
and I can break you just as easily.

718
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,097
Maybe, but until you do I'm still sheriff.

719
01:16:56,088 --> 01:16:59,808
I'm going to run things around here
according to law.

720
01:16:59,806 --> 01:17:02,297
My idea of the law, not yours.

721
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:06,347
If you expect me to sit around and
watch you tear down everything

722
01:17:06,341 --> 01:17:10,391
I built up you're crazier that I think.
I worked hard to get where I am,

723
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:14,698
did everything a man could do.
I lied, cheated, stolen, I've even

724
01:17:14,694 --> 01:17:19,677
killed to build up the set up I've
got now. And I'm not going to let
any man destroy it.

725
01:17:19,673 --> 01:17:23,143
Least of all you.

726
01:18:00,062 --> 01:18:02,496
Dad!

727
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,682
Dad!

728
01:18:10,705 --> 01:18:13,754
Chris, watch out!

729
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:19,265
Two of Miles’ men are in here.

730
01:18:19,258 --> 01:18:21,852
Keep down.

731
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:02,108
Chris, be careful.

732
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:04,548
I will, you stay down.

733
01:21:12,044 --> 01:21:14,194
Where's Miles?
- I don't know.

734
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:16,934
Where is he?

735
01:21:16,926 --> 01:21:19,383
I don't know, I tell you!
- Where is he?

736
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:22,649
In the town hall.

737
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:30,957
We're going over there.

738
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:41,027
Look, Danning, I didn't do nothing
to you. Andy was my friend.

739
01:21:41,023 --> 01:21:44,618
Ernie killed him.
Honest, I swear it.

740
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:51,130
Did you ever get hit with a bullet?

741
01:21:51,124 --> 01:21:54,844
It's like a hunk of iron ripping
and tearing into you.

742
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:58,743
Sets you all on fire inside.

743
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:01,407
Sometimes you don't die right away,

744
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,108
you just bleed, and hurt for a
long time.

745
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,809
Go on, open that door.

746
01:22:09,804 --> 01:22:12,181
No, I can't.

747
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:14,560
I'd be walking right into
Miles' bullets.

748
01:22:14,557 --> 01:22:16,923
Andy got his in the back. Go on!

749
01:22:18,554 --> 01:22:21,933
Don't shoot, Miles, it's me, Stew!

750
01:22:24,075 --> 01:22:26,726
Don't come any closer, Danning.

751
01:22:26,723 --> 01:22:33,242
Now you wouldn't shoot itchy fingers,
would you? He's always done your killing.

752
01:22:33,235 --> 01:22:35,874
I told you not to come any closer.

753
01:22:38,229 --> 01:22:42,086
Miles! Miles!

754
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:44,599
Miles! Miles!

755
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:08,791
I've waited 18 months for this.

756
01:23:08,788 --> 01:23:13,191
Why, Danning? Why?

757
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:17,378
Remember that raid you pulled in
Cons Canyon?

758
01:23:20,548 --> 01:23:25,121
The girl on that stagecoach was on
her way to marry me.

759
01:23:25,112 --> 01:23:28,536
Maybe this will help you to remember.

760
01:23:34,382 --> 01:23:37,613
Pick it up, Miles. Pick it up.

761
01:24:33,872 --> 01:24:37,456
'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'

762
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:07,577
Chris!

763
01:25:07,574 --> 01:25:11,044
You were right, Kate, there is
someone bigger than all of us.

764
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:14,086
Then you found your answer?
- Yes, it's all over.

765
01:25:14,084 --> 01:25:16,757
And the memories?
- They're in the past.

766
01:25:16,749 --> 01:25:22,779
I'm free, Kate. I know now what I
thought was going to be the ending
is only the beginning.

767
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:26,445
I'm glad.
