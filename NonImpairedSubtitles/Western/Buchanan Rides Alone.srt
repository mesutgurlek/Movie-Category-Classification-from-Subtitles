1
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,925
Hey, Lew.
Do you want to check this one?

2
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,850
He don't look like much. Hey mister!
- Morning.

3
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:45,166
Ride over here
and get off your horse.

4
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,681
He told you to get down.

5
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:51,119
What for?
- I'll ask the questions.

6
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,894
Go ahead. I can hear you fine,
right from where I'm sitting.

7
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,635
Mister, I don't want to have
to shoot you off that horse.

8
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,710
And I sure wouldn't
want you to, Sheriff.

9
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,424
Check his saddle bags first.

10
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,026
Wasting your time!

11
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,623
Only thing I've got on me is worth
a hoot is this here gun belt.

12
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:14,659
Sure, give me the price of
a good meal and a night's lodging

13
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:16,857
and you can have
this whole caboodle.

14
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:18,053
What do you say?

15
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,437
Somebody chasing you, Roy?

16
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,487
You did that on purpose, Lafe.

17
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,829
Why don't you grow up, Roy?

18
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,260
What's the matter with him?

19
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:50,299
Same old thing, getting himself
in trouble across the line.

20
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:52,673
Where you heading, mister?
- West Texas.

21
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,973
West Texas! Ha!
I should have known it!

22
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,885
You know one West Texan can
always spot another West Texan

23
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,700
by the way he sets his horse,
or walks down the street.

24
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,444
Or totes his gun.
I'm from West Texas. Name's Pecos.

25
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,518
Glad to know you.
- This one isn't carrying nothing, Lew.

26
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,228
We get enough drifters
coming across the border
with nothing in their pockets.

27
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:12,153
I wouldn't linger in Agry Town
if I was you.

28
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:16,352
I don't linger no place
until I get back where I belong.

29
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,301
You're the man to see,
I want to get a room.

30
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,861
Cost you $10. In advance.

31
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,104
Well, I'm not staying a week,
I just want a room for the night.

32
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,891
Well, it will still cost you $10.

33
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:11,490
I've got some tens in here
somewhere. I...

34
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,967
I could change one of them
fifties for you, sir.

35
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:17,199
You sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
- Oh, not at all, sir.

36
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:25,477
There you are, mister er...?
- The name's Buchanan.

37
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,309
Your room is the first one
at the head of the stairs.

38
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,506
I'll use it later.
Where can I get something to eat?

39
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,622
They'll fix you up with a good
steak across at the saloon.

40
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:39,424
Oh, Mr Buchanan, a border town
ain't no place to go walking around
carrying a lot of money on you.

41
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,179
I'd advise you to leave it
with me in the safe.

42
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,854
It's safe right where it is.

43
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,177
Be sure to tell Nacho
that Amos Agry sent you.

44
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,736
You related to him?

45
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,208
He's my brother.

46
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:54,440
The Sheriff is my brother too,
his name's Lew Agry.

47
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,925
Looks like you got
mighty high connections?

48
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,590
Morning, dad.

49
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,302
Don't you ever do that again!

50
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:19,776
I'll do it every time you go
chasing across the border.

51
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,609
I'll settle for a lot but not another woman.
- What are you talking about?

52
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:24,933
Where d'you get those scratches?
- I rode through some brush.

53
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,971
Looks like you tried to ride through
some Mexican wildcat.
- Why, you!

54
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,889
Roy! When you leave, you get me
that bottle of whiskey.

55
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:33,001
I can't do it, your father
gave me strict orders.

56
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,719
Get me that bottle or
I'll come back there and take it!

57
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:37,519
I can't do it, Roy.
- How about me?

58
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:40,079
I was told I could get some whiskey
and a good steak here.

59
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:41,555
You watch out who you're pushing.

60
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,344
Looked like you were arguing
and wasn't getting you anywhere
and I'm a hungry man.

61
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,744
I don't want no steak
that's out and out raw,

62
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,584
I want the middle on the red side.

63
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,778
This ain't a very friendly town.

64
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:59,174
If I was you
I would get out of here quick.

65
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,492
That was Roy Agry
you just hit, mister.

66
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,178
Ain't there anybody in this town
that ain't an Agry?

67
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,406
Please go, senor.

68
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,237
While I'm waiting for that steak
I'll buy a bottle. Of that one.

69
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,285
What I don't drink
I'll take with me.

70
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,992
How much?
- $10.

71
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,791
The steak?
- $10.

72
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:22,192
Good thing I'm only
staying over the night.

73
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:24,184
Sure is a $10 town.

74
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,132
Hey, kid! How about a shot of this?
Maybe you need it.

75
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:46,156
Hold it, son,
I built up a small hanker myself.

76
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:50,997
Nacho, you're fixing up
trouble for yourself.

77
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:54,160
Amos, I didn't give him the bottle,
he gave it to him.

78
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:56,914
He certainly looked like
he could use a drink.

79
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,748
He ain't no son of mine.

80
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:01,911
I'd appreciate it if you'd
bring that bottle back here.

81
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,386
Do you know what I'm gonna do?

82
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:06,178
If you keep pulling
on that bottle I do.

83
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:08,936
When I finish this,
I'm gonna kill you.

84
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,096
Now that's just Jim Dandy, son.

85
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,214
But in the meantime, would you
mind bringing me my steak?

86
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,521
Oh-ooh.

87
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:27,319
What do you want?

88
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:29,715
You've got to get over the saloon right away.
- What for?

89
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,076
Roy's been drinking and he says
he's gonna kill a fella.

90
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,711
Roy ain't got guts enough
to kill nobody.

91
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:37,750
Maybe not sober, but when he's
been drinking there ain't nothing
he ain't liable to do.

92
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,142
What's it to you what Roy does?
- Well, he's our nephew, ain't he?

93
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:44,267
Besides, that fella's carrying
a lot of money, I've seen it.

94
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,499
Lew, if you ain't gonna stop him
I'm gonna tell Simon.

95
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,298
Stop worrying, Roy ain't gonna kill nobody.
- Lew, I tell you...

96
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,738
Shut up and get out of here.

97
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,258
Oh...

98
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,689
"A lot of money."

99
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,449
Who did we miss, Waldo?

100
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,964
Let's finish the hand
and go find out.

101
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,498
Put one of these on the wall right
above the bar, Nacho.
- Muy bien.

102
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,783
You might put another one over here.

103
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,576
It's not my fault, Mr Carbo.
I did not serve Roy the whiskey.

104
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,010
Didn't say you did.

105
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,407
Roy is going to kill him.

106
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,691
He is?

107
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,353
Well...

108
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:52,150
Mighty tasty steak.
- Thank you, senor.

109
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:55,905
Anybody wants me I'll be over at
the hotel getting some shut-eye.

110
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,547
The name's Buchanan.

111
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:12,889
Quite a town!

112
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,120
Roy Agry!

113
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,161
Do not do this, boy.
Take it easy son, he's drunk.

114
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,237
Stay where you are.

115
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,594
No, Palito, no. Please!
Please go back home.

116
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:27,749
I will after I kill him.

117
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:31,106
If you kill him
you will never see your home again.

118
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,799
Stay out of there.

119
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,816
Take him over to the jail house
and wait for him to come to.

120
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,651
When I hang a man I like him
to know what's going on.

121
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:56,816
So they got Roy.

122
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,376
I told you what was gonna happen.

123
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:00,773
You told me!
You couldn't have been more wrong.

124
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,091
You said he was going to kill somebody.
- He was.

125
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,924
Nacho, tell the undertaker
to get his wagon over here.

126
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,044
I guess I better tell Simon.

127
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,559
Don't be gone too long
or you'll miss the hanging.

128
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,398
You ain't never seen
a double hanging!

129
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,996
You're gonna hang Mr Buchanan?
- That's right.
- Why?

130
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:17,633
The way I figure, he and the Mex
were in this together.
- Yeah.

131
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:20,688
How much do you figure's in that purse, Lew?
- Well, it's hard to say.

132
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,708
If it wasn't for me you wouldn't have
known he was csarrying that money.

133
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:26,144
Don't worry, I'll cut you in for your share.
- How much?

134
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,376
This doesn't seem like a likely time
to be haggling over money,

135
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:32,112
especially when it doesn't
belong to you, Lew.

136
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,813
I guess I better go break
the sad news to Simon.

137
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,300
I'll take care of that, Amos.

138
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,453
Sshhh.

139
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,005
Try to understand,

140
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,919
as soon as they hear us, they'll
swing us from the nearest tree.

141
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,757
Comprende?

142
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,837
I understand English, senor.

143
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:34,319
I am grateful for what you did,
but I'm sorry I brought you trouble.

144
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,674
We both got trouble, big trouble.

145
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,384
For me it does not matter.

146
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,905
Roy Agry is dead.

147
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:44,075
Why did you kill him?

148
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,178
Cannot tell you, senor.

149
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:49,728
The name's Buchanan, what's yours?

150
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,698
Sorry, but I would rather not say.

151
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,572
That's all right.

152
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,405
We ain't got much time
to get acquainted anyway.

153
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:06,433
Come on!
- All right, Lew, what are we waiting for?

154
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,673
We're still waiting
for 'em to wake up.

155
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,628
Here, go check on 'em.

156
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:41,402
Get up.

157
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,258
Morning, Nina. Where's the Judge?

158
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,173
Anyone ever tell you you're a mighty handsome woman?
- Many thanks, senor.

159
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,486
When are you gonna leave
the Judge and work for me?

160
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,523
The Judge treats me very well.
- I can treat you better.

161
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:18,834
Why should I leave a man of Judge
Agry's position to work for you?

162
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:20,717
That's for you to answer, beautiful.

163
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,357
And remember if you wait too long
I may not want you.

164
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,788
Morning, Simon.
- Morning.

165
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:34,271
Nina! Bring another glass.

166
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,898
I already have it, senor.

167
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:42,372
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, Simon.
- Oh?

168
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:43,850
Yeah? What's happened now?

169
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:49,210
Roy has been... shot.

170
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,360
Roy, dead.

171
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,151
It was inevitable.

172
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:08,187
Who did it?

173
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:09,744
A young Mexican.

174
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,100
Looks like a man named Buchanan
helped him.

175
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,103
Did they get away?

176
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:20,094
No.

177
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,656
Simon, you'd better get down to the
jail before they string him up.

178
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,366
Lew has everybody primed
for a lynching.

179
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,329
You're smart, you'll stop it.

180
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:29,762
Why should I do that?

181
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,482
Because everybody in these parts

182
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:34,536
knows that Simon Agry
stands for law and order.

183
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:37,556
A lynching could cost you
a lot of votes, Simon.

184
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:44,463
Aside from the fact the young
man's name just happens to be

185
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:45,828
Juan de la Vega.

186
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:49,862
Don Pedro's son?

187
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,347
Why?

188
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,971
Ask me, I'd say the old gentleman
might be willing

189
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,730
to part with a lot of pesos
to get his son back safe.

190
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,926
You're right.

191
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,805
Can't have no lynching
with me coming up for election.

192
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:14,715
Sheriff, you are making
a big mistake!

193
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,277
You cannot hang Senor Buchanan,
he had nothing to do with it.

194
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,592
I killed Roy Agry.

195
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,769
Yeah, and he helped you.
- That's right, Lew.

196
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:24,013
No, you're wrong.
He had nothing to do with it.

197
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,223
Save your breath, kid.
Nobody's listening to you.

198
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,737
I am truly sorry, senor.

199
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,780
So am I.

200
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:33,703
All right, string 'em up.

201
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:34,854
Wait!

202
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,572
Take those men back to jail!

203
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,289
These men are heading
for the cemetery.

204
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:42,849
Do as I say,
take those ropes off their necks.

205
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,331
Please listen to me.

206
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,080
My only son has been killed.

207
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:51,633
A son I held very dear to my heart.

208
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,113
Who among you has a better reason

209
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:57,106
for wanting to see
those murderers hang?

210
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,350
None of you.

211
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,593
I personally would like to put
the noose about their neck,

212
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:04,065
but the law forbids it.

213
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,182
You all know that
I'm a law-abiding man.

214
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:10,857
It's my solemn duty to see
that they get a fair trial.

215
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:18,332
That's just what they're gonna get
tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.

216
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,917
Now the sheriff here is gonna
take these men back to jail.

217
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,998
And I want all of you to go home.

218
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,837
Please, gentlemen!

219
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:30,592
We must see that justice
takes its proper course.

220
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,069
And I shall personally

221
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,947
be for ever grateful to you.

222
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,825
All right, take the ropes off.

223
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:41,401
Senor Buchanan,
why did you help me?

224
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,871
Because you needed it.

225
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,232
I wish my father could meet you,

226
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,508
so he could thank you
for what you did.

227
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,429
Tell me, who is your father?

228
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:54,742
Well, who is he?

229
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,501
Don Pedro de la Vega.

230
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,545
I'm Juan de la Vega.

231
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,936
The whole of Mexico
thinks a lot of your dad.

232
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,374
You've heard of him?

233
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,070
Lots, all good.

234
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,687
He's a fine man.

235
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,360
And he has a fine son.

236
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:19,474
I saw those scratches on Roy's face.
Was she your wife?

237
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:21,808
I am not married.

238
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,073
Your sister then?

239
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,950
Look, Jonny, you've gotta tell 'em.

240
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:29,671
Nobody would hang you for killing a
man who did a thing like that.
- No.

241
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,937
No-one must ever know, Buchanan.

242
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,324
All right, quiet everybody.

243
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,084
This here trial is about to start.

244
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,485
Now Jim here is going to pass
among you with a tray

245
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,158
and the Judge wants me to have you

246
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,354
put all your glasses
in that tray, empty.

247
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,039
Judge don't want no more
liquored up opinion

248
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,600
like he had in that last trial.

249
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,634
Now sit down some place
and take off your hats.

250
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,379
Come on, stand up for the Judge.

251
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,532
Come on, Charlie!

252
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,843
Well, sit down.

253
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:39,473
All right, this here court is now in
session, Judge Simon Agry presiding.

254
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,391
Waldo, bring in the prisoners.

255
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,126
Bring in the prisoners!

256
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,826
Put that gavel down.

257
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,928
Sit down. Sit down.

258
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,413
Sit down!

259
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,918
I see the defendants
have no legal representation.

260
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,560
We don't need no lawyer, Judge.

261
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:11,439
What is your full name?
- Tom Buchanan.

262
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:12,955
What is your full name?

263
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,390
I killed Roy Agry,
that is all you have to know.

264
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:17,187
Your name is Juan de la Vega.

265
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:18,511
Stand up, Buchanan.

266
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:20,343
He had nothing to do with it.

267
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,823
Sit him down.

268
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,538
Where do you hail from, Buchanan?

269
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:26,663
West Texas.

270
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:28,541
Where are you headed?
- Back home.

271
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:29,820
What's your occupation?

272
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,336
Well?

273
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,728
Well, I'm trying to think.

274
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,085
It seems to be quite a chore.

275
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,324
I ain't much of a thinker, Judge.

276
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,126
I grew up chasing cows.

277
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,462
Whose cows?

278
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:51,255
My dad's. Until the drought
and the bank wiped us out.

279
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,557
What then.
- I ramrodded some, a little border spread,

280
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:57,790
and then I got some ideas
about owning for my own,

281
00:21:57,825 --> 00:22:00,988
so I crossed the line and tried
to stake myself some animals.

282
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,348
By rustling?

283
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:03,714
No, sir. Fighting.

284
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:08,302
Oh, so you're a fighter?
- Yes, sir.

285
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:09,816
What kind of fighting?

286
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:12,536
Almost any kind,
provided there's money in it.

287
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:14,489
I joined General Campos in Mexico.

288
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:16,480
Then murder is nothing new
to you, Buchanan.

289
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,881
Ain't murder when you're
killing a revolution.

290
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,167
Why aren't you still there?

291
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:24,957
Revolution petered out.
Besides I... I got myself a stake.

292
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:26,479
I see.

293
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,272
According to this charge, you're an
accessory to the murder of Roy Agry.

294
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,394
How do you plead?

295
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,830
Your son getting shot
is no business of mine.

296
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,546
You got any questions, Lew?

297
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,863
Yeah.

298
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:46,095
Mister, wouldn't you say
you made your living as a gunman?

299
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,497
I've turned a dollar with a gun.

300
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:51,531
And you put in a lot of jail time?
- I've been in jail.

301
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:54,729
So the fact is you were just
another hard case on the dodge?

302
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,084
You could say that.

303
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,122
Tell the Judge here about
the fight you picked with Roy

304
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:00,482
just before he was shot.

305
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:01,839
Nothing to tell.

306
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,119
Nothing to tell!

307
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:05,515
You knocked him down and when
he got up you got him drunk.

308
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,395
He was a man full-grown, I offered
him a drink, but he took the bottle.

309
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,436
He was still working on it
when I left.

310
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,470
Ah...

311
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:14,506
Isn't it a fact of the case

312
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,984
that you were the advance agent
in this killing?

313
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:20,182
Weren't you sent into town to
either goad Roy into a gunfight

314
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:22,974
or get himself drunk
he couldn't defend himself?
- No.

315
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,910
But the plan misfired, didn't it?

316
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,772
You two did the killing all right,

317
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,648
but the Mex here ran
smack into the law

318
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,449
and you came and tried
to break him free.

319
00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:32,850
I saw this boy here getting
a licking from this big ape,

320
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,326
so I dealt myself in.

321
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:36,841
I figured it was one thing
I could do in this town

322
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:38,478
and it wouldn't cost me 10 bucks.

323
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:43,916
Oh, you don't like this town.
- I don't like some of its people.

324
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:46,274
Me included?
- You especially.

325
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:48,551
Oh, you'd like to kill me maybe?

326
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:50,948
I'd like to give you
what you and your boys gave me.

327
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:54,703
Take the law into your own hands, is that it?
- No. Just you.

328
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:59,779
Well, that's the case, Judge.

329
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,153
He's a gunman that came
into town yesterday

330
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:04,450
to set it up
for this boy here to kill Roy.

331
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,544
I never saw this boy in my life
before yesterday.

332
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,603
I didn't have nothing
to do with the killing.

333
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,207
Anybody got any more to say?

334
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:21,795
You've all heard the evidence,
now you've got to decide

335
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,470
whether Buchanan was or was not an
accessory to the murder of Roy Agry.

336
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,663
You can go out to the back room
and talk it over.

337
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:31,821
You folks sit down
until they get out of here.

338
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:09,231
Have you reached your verdict?

339
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:10,745
Not guilty, Your Honour.

340
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:17,248
Since you've been found innocent,
your presence in this courtroom
will no longer be required.

341
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,932
Ivy, escort Mr Buchanan
back to the hotel.

342
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:23,529
I'm glad for you, Buchanan.

343
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,798
Juan de la Vega, stand up.

344
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,836
You are charged with
the murder of Roy Agry,

345
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:37,273
my son.

346
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:41,233
How do you plead?
- I killed your son and I'm glad.

347
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,268
There ain't no point in
prolonging this trial, Simon,

348
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:49,216
he admits he killed him, so there
ain't nothin' we gotta prove.

349
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,897
You heard the defendant confess
that he killed Roy Agry.

350
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:58,164
As Judge, I have no alternative
except to direct you to bring in
a verdict of guilty.

351
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,882
I don't think we have to go anyplace
to cast our vote, Judge.
We find him guilty.

352
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:13,792
Juan de la Vega, you've been found
guilty by a jury of 12 freeholders
of Agry County, California.

353
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:18,794
At an hour before sunset this very
day, you will be hung by the neck
until you are dead.

354
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,710
Court is adjourned.

355
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:32,371
I don't care what you say, this
ain't no fair share and you know it.

356
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:35,011
It was only 300, Amos.
- You're lying.

357
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:40,166
You shouldn't call your brother a
liar, Amos, it's all the money the
man had, we all got a fair share.

358
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:43,822
Well, maybe you can fool them but
you can't fool me, if I don't get

359
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:47,398
at least ten more of these things,
Simon is gonna get an earful.

360
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:52,837
Amos, you start playing Simon and me
against each other, you're gonna get
a lot more than just an earful.

361
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:53,954
Here comes Buchanan.

362
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:06,378
Sheriff, I'll make a deal with you.
You let the boy go and you
can keep the money of mine.

363
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:09,811
Hear that, Waldo?
He's trying to bribe me.

364
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:11,971
He's a real bad one.

365
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,043
No respect at all for the law.

366
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:17,603
Want me to lock him up?

367
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,642
No.

368
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:23,240
I'll forget what you just said,
Buchanan.

369
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,995
Now get back on that horse of yours
and start riding out of town.

370
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,994
I'd like to see the boy first.

371
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:51,614
Hello, Jonny.
- I'm very glad to see you again, Buchanan.

372
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:54,804
I thought this might help.

373
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,445
Thank you.

374
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,641
It was an honour
knowing you, Buchanan.

375
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,160
It was an honour knowing you.

376
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,035
Would you do something for me?
- If I can.

377
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,064
Would you ask them to let my horse
go, just let him loose at the bridge,
he will find his way home.

378
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:12,793
We'll take care
of the horse for you.

379
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:20,420
Well... so long Jonny.

380
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:23,818
Goodbye, Buchanan.

381
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,651
Where's my gun?

382
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:29,768
A law-abiding citizen
like you don't need no gun.

383
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:33,682
Give me my belt.
- You're getting it. Now you saw the kid, git.

384
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:44,754
Lafe and Pecos will ride out with you.
- I don't need an escort.

385
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,873
You're getting one anyway.
I'm making sure you don't
show up in Agry Town again.

386
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:52,584
Sheriff, I had $2,000.
- We were voted out of a double hanging, Buchanan.

387
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,022
Unless you get on that horse
and start riding, we'll make up
for it with a double burial.

388
00:28:57,057 --> 00:29:02,569
I'll be back.
- Lafe, you and Pecos try real hard
to change his mind about that.

389
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,650
Don't you worry about it, Lew.

390
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:17,996
Waldo, you better go back to
the hotel and sit with Amos
until he simmers down a bit.

391
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:20,278
He might have heard something
that upset him.

392
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:37,580
Amos.

393
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:40,970
I've been looking for you, hop in.

394
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:43,803
He can't. He's got some things
to do in the hotel.

395
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,965
Nothing that can't wait
until tomorrow.

396
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,041
I think he ought to stop by and talk
to Simon, a man likes to have his
family around at a time like this.

397
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,559
You might mention that to Lew.

398
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:01,115
Get up.

399
00:30:21,244 --> 00:30:23,246
Funeral is set for noon tomorrow.

400
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,924
Fine. What's he doing here?

401
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:31,079
A couple of loose guns just
rode out of town with Buchanan,
thought maybe he could tell you why.

402
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:32,600
Well, Amos, why?

403
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:43,474
Lew, how come you sent Buchanan
out of town under two guns?

404
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,186
You afraid of Buchanan, Lew?

405
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,507
There ain't a man in this world
I'm afraid of.

406
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:50,743
Is that a fact?
- Yeah, that's a fact.

407
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:55,533
Look, Lew, I don't mind you stealing
a few dollars from the trash
that come across the border

408
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:57,926
but don't get ambitious
and start trying to buck me.

409
00:30:57,927 --> 00:30:59,690
Lew wouldn't try
to buck you, Simon.

410
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,125
Star isn't permanent on your chest.

411
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,436
I put it there and I can take it off.
- You want it back now Simon?

412
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:10,077
No. We haven't had any
real differences yet.

413
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,556
I want both of you to be
at the funeral tomorrow.

414
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:17,028
As Roy's uncles, a few tears
certainly wouldn't be out of place.

415
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:20,189
How are we going to work up
any tears over Roy?

416
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:23,024
Just be sure you rise
to the occasion.

417
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:28,099
I didn't tell him nothing, Carbo
seen Buchanan riding out of town,
he knows you've got the money too.

418
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:32,332
Lew, there was $2,000 in that purse,
Mr Buchanan said so.
- Did he?

419
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:36,895
Sure he did. He was standing
right there on the porch,
you remember when he...

420
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:54,269
Gracias.

421
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,486
Well, not many fathers feel about
their sons the way you did.

422
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:24,199
This trial could do you
a lot of good, Simon,

423
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:28,193
might even make you Governor of
California some day.
- Could be.

424
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,492
Senor Agry?

425
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:53,207
Yes.

426
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,924
Senor Agry?
- Yes, who are you?

427
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,598
Esteban Gomez.
- Won't you come in, please?

428
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:05,595
This is Mr Carbo, Senor Gomez.

429
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,669
What can I do for you?
- I've come to purchase the
freedom of Juan de la Vega.

430
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:15,708
That is impossible,
he has been convicted of murder,
his freedom is not for sale.

431
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,858
I'm sorry to hear that, senor,
I will return to Don Pedro and

432
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:23,813
tell him his generous offer has been rejected.
- Well, just a moment, senor,

433
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:29,809
since you've come such a long way
I see no harm in discussing it.
Won't you sit down?

434
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:31,282
Gracias.

435
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:40,281
Well?
- Don Pedro will deliver to you 30 of his
finest horses upon the release of his son.

436
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:44,192
How could I explain how
I came by these fine horses?

437
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:48,230
I couldn't.
- It's a very generous
offer, senor. Don Pedro's horses

438
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:52,233
are blooded stock, they are some
of the finest horses in the world.

439
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:53,826
I'm sure they are.

440
00:33:55,339 --> 00:34:01,016
But the fact remains that Juan
de la Vega will be hung this very
day unless you meet my terms.

441
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:03,573
$50,000 in American money.

442
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:07,366
Senor...
- I have nothing more to say.

443
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:10,963
Judge, I think Senor Gomez
should be allowed to take the

444
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:15,606
boy's body back with him so he
can be buried in his own country.

445
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:18,318
It's a very kind suggestion.

446
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:20,230
You will be permitted to do this.

447
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,170
I do not think Don Pedro can
raise that much money, senor.

448
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:29,230
I'll give him 48 hours to see if he can.
- 48... 48 hours.

449
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:31,542
You're a very difficult man, senor.

450
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:39,411
Lew, the hanging is temporarily postponed.

451
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:40,887
Why?

452
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,813
Because Simon wants it that way,
that's why.

453
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:48,522
When it's on again
I'll let you know.

454
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:53,079
I wonder what Simon's
got up his sleeve.

455
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:57,995
I don't know
but whatever it is, that kid's going
to get strung up right on schedule.

456
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,513
Might be making a big mistake, Lew.

457
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:04,029
Why?
- Well, Simon never was one
to do anything without a reason.

458
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,944
If I was you,
I'd find out what it is.

459
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,623
Town crier always knows something.

460
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,996
How much further are you boys
going to ride along with me?

461
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,391
A ways.

462
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,792
That where you going to kill me?

463
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,864
What do you get paid
for a job like this?

464
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,952
Fifty? Not over a hundred.

465
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:55,571
Not much more than that.

466
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:59,167
For a West Texan,
you do killin' awful cheap, Pecos.

467
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,598
Buchanan, what was you
planning to do with that $2,000?

468
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:07,803
You know that country
up around Endicott?

469
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,319
I sure do.

470
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:14,428
Well, I had my eye on a spread up
there but I never could get me a big
enough stake together until lately.

471
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,989
I'd love to have my
spread back there,
ain't no place like West Texas.

472
00:36:18,024 --> 00:36:19,746
Then how come you're in California?

473
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:23,621
Settle footed. This country is
so dang big a man just gets used

474
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:29,140
to moving around, so one day I got
tired of watching the sun go west
and I just followed it on out here

475
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,892
but I ain't itchin' no more.

476
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:35,250
Before long I'll follow the sun
right on back to where I come from.

477
00:36:35,285 --> 00:36:37,962
Sounds like you put a lot of
store in being a Texan.

478
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:39,849
A man's got to be
loyal to something.

479
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:41,409
That's the same way I feel.

480
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:44,240
You come on back here.

481
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:47,438
Buchanan, I want you to know
I don't cotton none to this job.

482
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:52,359
A man oughtn't do a job
he don't cotton to, Pecos.

483
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:54,988
Forget it.

484
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,047
Right there, Buchanan.

485
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,204
A step down.

486
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,435
Take its saddle off.

487
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,168
Put it down.

488
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:52,335
Don't turn around.

489
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,475
Who's going to do the shooting?

490
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,000
Both of us.

491
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:14,545
Lafe why don't we just?
- Shut up, Pecos.

492
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,777
I ain't got no more stomach
for this than you have,
we got a job to do.

493
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,285
Thanks, Pecos.

494
00:39:58,107 --> 00:40:00,678
L- A-F-E, Lafe.

495
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:08,862
I sure hope old Lafe ain't put out
with us for stashing him
up this here tree.

496
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:13,212
With animals all around it seems the
only decent thing, don't you think?

497
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:21,166
Anyways, that hole you dug
is done chock full of water,

498
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,449
wouldn't hold nothing but a fish.

499
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:48,458
Lafe,

500
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:54,293
you and me worked for Lew Agry
for nigh on a year and

501
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:59,493
though I don't guess we was ever
real buddies, I'm sorry it was me
that stopped your clock.

502
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:01,444
You had your good side, Lafe,

503
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:07,634
but you had your bad side too, like
cheatin' at stud and emptying my
pockets whenever I got drunk.

504
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:09,558
But I ain't holding
these things agin' you

505
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:14,769
and if you're holding a grudge
agin' me, Lafe, just remember that
when it come down to choosing

506
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:20,812
between you and Buchanan here,
I just had to choose Buchanan
on account of he's a West Texan.

507
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:26,821
Like I always say, let
bygones be bygones and I hope you're
saying the same wherever you are.

508
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:29,773
Well, so long, Lafe,

509
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:31,810
you died real good.
- Amen.

510
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:43,682
I sure got myself in one of
them predicaments, I don't
know what I'm going to do now.

511
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,677
Pecos, how do you like to be
half owner in that spread of mine?

512
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,356
You mean that?
- Sure do.

513
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:52,236
Yeah, but you ain't got that $2,000 no more.
- I'll get it back.

514
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:54,831
Huh! Waldo and Lew
will shoot you on sight.

515
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:59,402
Me too.
- I'll take you in as partner whether you'll
ride back to Agry Town with me or not.

516
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:03,939
Oh, would you? Buchanan, that's
real nice of you, I know just
the place I can wait for you.

517
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,607
Why would I be making
a big mistake, Amos?

518
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:18,318
You mean about going ahead with the hangin'?
- Yeah.

519
00:42:18,353 --> 00:42:20,560
What's Simon up to?

520
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:23,954
Why don't you ask him?
- I'm asking you, Amos.

521
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:27,313
You don't pay too good
for information, Lew.

522
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,792
Oh, how much do you want?

523
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:34,901
I ain't greedy, Lew, all I want is
10,000, you can have all the rest.

524
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,420
All the rest?

525
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:41,698
And how much would that be?
- 40,000.
- Dollars?

526
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,329
Dollars.

527
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,091
Well, you've
just got yourself a deal, brother.

528
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:52,768
Now, how am I going to get
my hands on all this money?

529
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:56,362
Well, sometime in the next 48 hours,

530
00:42:56,397 --> 00:43:01,399
a Mexican is going to bring
$50, 000 to Simon for the release
of Juan de la Vega.

531
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:05,712
Now all you have to do is figure
out some way to keep that
money from getting to Simon.

532
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,831
Yeah.

533
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:15,145
Amos, you go over to the saloon
and tell Hamp and Ivy to
get over here as fast as they can.

534
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,139
What are you going to do, Lew?

535
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:19,574
I'm going to spit
right in Simon's eye.

536
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:35,002
There's the shack and right
behind it you will find a trail

537
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:37,123
that will run you
right into Agry Town.

538
00:43:39,673 --> 00:43:41,875
Change your mind about going back?

539
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,552
I was thinking about young Juan.
- It will be sundown
long afore you can get there.

540
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:50,062
That's bad luck all the way around.

541
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:56,218
Say, I got some coffee and bacon in my pack
if you've a mind to eat before you start back.
- I could eat.

542
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:11,801
All right, Lew.

543
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,877
Hop in, kid.

544
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,073
Drive slow out of town, Ivy.

545
00:44:35,891 --> 00:44:41,648
When you get to the shack, if
everything looks all right, you
get back here as fast as you can.

546
00:44:54,673 --> 00:44:56,880
All right, Mex, get out of there.

547
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:04,619
Ivy, you ride the kid's horse.
- What's the matter, can't you handle him?

548
00:45:04,654 --> 00:45:05,869
Sure you can?

549
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,175
Come on, get up.

550
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:37,031
Senor, you hurt my horse again,
I swear one day I will kill you.

551
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,979
There's supposed to be
nobody living in that old shack.

552
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:46,000
Howdy, fellas, what in tarnation
brings you out here?

553
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:51,513
How come the kid's still alive,
I figured he'd be hung
and buried by now.

554
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:54,147
Lew told you he wanted the job
done, why didn't you do it that way.

555
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:56,563
Well, we done just like Lew said.

556
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,901
What's Buchanan's horse doing here.

557
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:02,475
Only thing you were supposed to
bring back with you was a saddle.

558
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,976
Well, after we killed him... Ain't
no sense in my lying to you Waldo,

559
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:09,850
when it come down
to that poor dumb animal I just
didn't have the heart to do it.

560
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:13,810
What did you stop off here for?
- Well, after all that riding we
decided to stay out the night.

561
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:16,439
Where's Lafe?
- He went out hunting
a rabbit or something to eat,

562
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:19,283
he will be back anytime now.
What did you bring him for?

563
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:24,278
Simon and the kid's pa made a deal
with Simon that he'd pay him
$50,000 to let the kid go free.

564
00:47:24,313 --> 00:47:26,650
Lew figured it don't make no
difference to his pa who he

565
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,988
paid the money to as long
as the kid went on living.

566
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,425
So Lew decided to do a ransom deal.

567
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,981
Looks like Lew's really
bucking the big men this time.

568
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:37,503
Oh, there was bound to have
a showdown sooner or later.

569
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,620
Yeah, like you said,
it was bound to happen.

570
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:43,489
Lafe get a boot out of shooting Buchanan?
- Yeah, he got a kick out of it.

571
00:47:43,524 --> 00:47:45,054
Ain't never minded shootin' nobody.

572
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:50,322
Sit down, kid, if there's any food
left over, we'll give you
something to eat.

573
00:47:50,357 --> 00:47:52,164
You three stay like you was.

574
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,362
I never expected to see you
again today, Buchanan.

575
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:57,362
I didn't never
expect to see you ever.

576
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:58,881
Don't move.

577
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:05,720
You three sit down.

578
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,747
Get the rope.

579
00:48:18,653 --> 00:48:20,780
Throw me the rifle.

580
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:29,410
Jonny, you and Pecos tie them up,
except for Waldo.

581
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:35,962
Drag 'em off.

582
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:44,829
Stand up.

583
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:54,983
Waldo, I've been remembering
that fight we had out in the saloon.

584
00:48:56,816 --> 00:48:59,933
How long were you supposed
to stay here with Jonny?

585
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:01,969
Till Lew comes.

586
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,006
Well, what are we gonna do now?

587
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:14,077
First, tie him up and then fix us
some food, then I... I ain't sure.

588
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,514
When you think Lew
will be showing up?

589
00:49:26,102 --> 00:49:27,981
Ain't your toe sore yet?

590
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:31,861
Lew will be here as soon
as he gets the ransom money
from a Mex named Gomez.

591
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:33,541
Who's this Gomez?

592
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:35,615
He's ranch foreman for my father.

593
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,131
I hope he's smart enough
not to turn the money over
until after Lew turns you over.

594
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,969
Gomez is very smart, Buchanan.
- Good.

595
00:49:41,004 --> 00:49:43,723
I'll ride with you as far
as the border, come on.

596
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:50,840
Be seein' you.

597
00:49:54,749 --> 00:49:58,116
You cut us loose and I'll forget
about you siding with Buchanan.

598
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:00,948
Oh, you would never
forget that, Waldo.

599
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:05,545
Why, if you got the chance,
you'd cut my heart out
with your bare hands.

600
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,825
Well, like the man said,
be seeing you.

601
00:50:12,332 --> 00:50:14,288
Didn't I just say goodbye to you?

602
00:50:14,323 --> 00:50:15,778
Yes, sir, you did.

603
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:22,647
But I've got to think
about what I'd do when Lew got here.
He's handy with a gun.

604
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:24,285
Well, what do you want to do?

605
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,563
I know a place where Juan can
cross the border without no chance
of running into anybody

606
00:50:28,598 --> 00:50:31,239
and I'd be much obliged
if I could ride along with you.

607
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:36,348
All right, Pecos.
- But I still ain't going back into Agry Town, ever.

608
00:51:12,983 --> 00:51:19,024
Lew's going to kill us when
he finds out the kid got away.
- We'll get him back.

609
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:58,708
Well, here we are,
that's your country.

610
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:17,323
Guess this is
where we part company, Jonny.

611
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,045
Please, do not return to Agry Town.
Come to the hacienda with me,
meet my father.

612
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,754
He will be very happy to make up
your losses.

613
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:26,230
I'll make up my own losses.

614
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:29,865
I must do something to repay you
for all you have done.

615
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,425
If you must go back to Agry Town,
let me go with you.

616
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,657
You really want to do something for me?
- Name it and it's done.

617
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:39,865
Start riding and don't stop
till you get home.
- But...

618
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,300
He named it, kid.
- So long, Jonny.

619
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:53,524
Pecos, ride a ways to see that
he keeps going south.

620
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,279
I will be waiting right here
for you, Buchanan, and good luck.

621
00:52:57,314 --> 00:52:59,232
Juan!

622
00:53:05,707 --> 00:53:07,504
Hup!

623
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:20,136
What's the matter with you?
- I couldn't have missed him.
- Have a shot and scare the kid away?

624
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:22,256
Look at Buchanan leaving.

625
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:31,059
You know something, Jonny?

626
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:36,371
Looks like this time I let my big
mouth talk me into real trouble.

627
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:40,730
Tell Buchanan...

628
00:54:48,237 --> 00:54:51,479
All right, boy, mount up.
We're going back to town.

629
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,225
Lew, I want to know
what's holding up the hangin'.

630
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,856
Simon's orders. You all saw
how broken up poor Simon
was at the funeral.

631
00:55:05,891 --> 00:55:07,341
What's that got to do with it?

632
00:55:07,376 --> 00:55:11,460
If your son was killed
you'd want to see his murderer
get what's coming to him.

633
00:55:11,495 --> 00:55:14,408
You'll just have to wait until
Simon's feeling better.

634
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:20,925
Simon. Simon, wake up.

635
00:55:21,561 --> 00:55:26,567
I know the funeral's been a chore
but I think this might make you feel
better. Your money man's here.

636
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:37,866
I have fulfilled your wish, senor.

637
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,304
Fine. Now if you'll just
turn over the money.

638
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,866
I will turn over the money
when you turn over Juan de la Vega.

639
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:47,893
What's the matter, don't you trust me?
- No, senor.

640
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,694
How do you know you can trust him?

641
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:53,768
We haven't seen the money, how do we
know he's got it?
- I have the money.

642
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:55,245
And I believe you.

643
00:55:56,363 --> 00:55:59,082
Carbo, bring the boy back here.

644
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,716
Senor Gomez, as you say
in Spanish, mi casa, su casa.

645
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:07,000
Make yourself at home.

646
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:21,576
Lew! Carbo just pulled up behind
the jail, I think he's lookin' for you!
- I ain't hard to find.

647
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:26,742
But... Amos, ever since this happened
you've been running around like a
chicken with its head cut off.

648
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:28,229
How about I buy you a drink?

649
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:32,889
Lew.

650
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,056
What do you want, Carbo?

651
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:44,117
Keys to the jail cells.

652
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,909
Oh, sure.

653
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:21,359
Lew, you just made
the biggest mistake of your life.

654
00:57:21,394 --> 00:57:27,629
You'd better make it right before it's too late.
- I ain't made no mistake.
- I think so. Come on.

655
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:31,904
I ain't goin' no place.
- We're going to Simon's. You two
have some things to hash over.

656
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:35,779
Now, what would Simon and me
have to hash over?

657
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:37,222
Where's the kid?

658
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:41,580
Ah. Well, you just tell Senor Gomez
that if he's got any trading to do

659
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:45,176
I'm the man to see, because
Simon ain't got nothin' to trade.

660
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:51,464
You know, Carbo, now that I've gone
into business for myself

661
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:54,801
I might not have time
for this sheriff business any more.

662
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:57,793
You keep this up, Lew, you're going
to wind up in a box alongside Roy.

663
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:04,551
Hah!

664
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:52,697
Put your hands
on the top of the desk.

665
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:04,373
And, Sheriff, would you mind
opening up that safe?

666
00:59:10,598 --> 00:59:14,318
You kill me, Buchanan, ain't
nobody going to open that safe.

667
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:16,833
You know something, Sheriff,
it just might be worth it.

668
00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:29,175
Hand me my gun belt.

669
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:34,542
Gentle.

670
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,453
Haul out my money
and count it over here on the table.

671
00:59:48,437 --> 00:59:51,039
Put it in stacks of $500,
it'll be quicker that way.

672
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:54,874
Lew! Everybody's getting riled up,
they're going to come down here...

673
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:56,430
Ahh...

674
00:59:56,465 --> 00:59:59,866
Hello, Amos. Give Lew a hand
countin' up my money.

675
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:07,587
How much is there?

676
01:00:07,622 --> 01:00:09,817
1,700.

677
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,567
You'd better start diggin'.

678
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:18,206
Get out with that 50, Amos.

679
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:30,078
It's all that's left, Buchanan.
- Put it back in my belt.

680
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:36,869
Amos, you were saying
something when you came in.
What's everybody so riled up about?

681
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,868
Because we ain't hung the kid yet.

682
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:40,788
They say if Lew don't they will.

683
01:00:40,823 --> 01:00:46,056
Lew, you'd better get back up to the
saloon. Looks like you're gonna have
to do some mighty fast talking.

684
01:00:51,728 --> 01:00:55,926
Lew, what do you think
they're gonna do when they
find out the kid ain't jailed?

685
01:00:55,961 --> 01:00:59,623
They won't find out till after I get that 50,000.
- What are you gonna do?

686
01:00:59,658 --> 01:01:03,242
Find Gomez. It's time we talked business.
- How are you gonna find Gomez?

687
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:08,909
Very simple, I'm going to look for
him. And if he wants that kid back
he just might be looking for me.

688
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,424
Lew.

689
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:20,141
We've waited long enough.

690
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,058
And we ain't waitin' any longer.

691
01:01:22,093 --> 01:01:26,291
If you don't get on with it, the men
will take care of it themselves.
- Now, take it easy, fellas.

692
01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:27,777
That's what I come in here for.

693
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:31,213
You all know Simon won't like
missing the hanging, so we'll wait,

694
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:33,812
but if he don't show up soon
we'll go ahead without him.

695
01:01:33,847 --> 01:01:36,024
Whiskey for everybody on me, Nacho.

696
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,201
Drink up, fellas, I'll be back.

697
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,683
Set 'em up, Nacho.

698
01:01:39,718 --> 01:01:41,595
OK, drink up, everybody.

699
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:52,343
I thought I told you to go home.

700
01:01:52,378 --> 01:01:54,785
I couldn't help it, Buchanan.

701
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,919
That's right, he couldn't help it.

702
01:01:56,954 --> 01:01:58,979
Now you can do one of two things.

703
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:01,653
You make a break for it and we
shoot you both in the back

704
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:04,541
or you can toss over them guns.

705
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:27,064
Go get the keys.

706
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,351
We're sure makin' progress.

707
01:02:30,386 --> 01:02:31,587
Buchanan,

708
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,783
they killed Pecos.

709
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:59,795
What are you all doin' here?
- We had a little trouble. Where's Lew?
- Where's the kid?!

710
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:04,745
He's in jail with Buchanan.
I asked you where Lew was.
- Well, he... he said he would be right back.

711
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,345
Ain't he busy?

712
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:19,934
I cannot understand why you
do not deliver Juan to me, senor.

713
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:24,167
We can't deliver the boy in
broad daylight, the town's
all for a hanging.

714
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:28,488
I am impatient, senor. I have
fulfilled my part of the contract.

715
01:03:28,523 --> 01:03:30,084
I will leave now.

716
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,795
When you are ready to return
Juan to me, you will discover
I am very easy to find.

717
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:43,629
Might as well face it, Simon,
you're going to have to kiss
the 50,000 goodbye.

718
01:03:43,664 --> 01:03:45,227
Lew's holding the trump card.

719
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:48,159
Lew never saw the day he could
outfox me.

720
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:51,056
And nobody ever saw me
kiss $50,000 goodbye.

721
01:03:51,555 --> 01:03:53,182
Come in.

722
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:59,011
Well, Amos, what is it?
- Well, I was just lookin' for Lew.

723
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:04,245
You were? You should have
known better than to
get mixed up in this with Lew, Amos.

724
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,005
Mixed up in what?

725
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,717
I haven't got any time to waste.
Where's Lew hiding the kid?

726
01:04:09,752 --> 01:04:13,040
What are you talkin' about? I don't
know what... I don't know nothin'.

727
01:04:30,653 --> 01:04:33,016
Now, where's the kid?

728
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:35,373
In jail.
- Don't lie to me!

729
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:39,367
I'm not lyin' to you! He's back
in jail, I'm tellin' you the truth.

730
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,605
I believe you, Amos.

731
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,648
Does Lew know he's back?

732
01:04:45,683 --> 01:04:47,437
I don't think so.

733
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:49,595
He's lookin' for Gomez.

734
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,718
I was just lookin' for Lew.

735
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:54,551
Thank you, Amos.

736
01:05:05,976 --> 01:05:07,898
Ho! Ho! Ho!

737
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,938
You kept us waitin' a long time,
Simon. It's about time we stretched
that killer's neck.

738
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:46,938
Hold on, we can't have an official
hanging until the sheriff is there.

739
01:05:46,973 --> 01:05:49,376
Where is Lew?
- He's in the back room.

740
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:58,211
You won't be able to talk 'em
out of a hanging this time.
- Probably not. I don't intend to try.

741
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,807
After we get the money,
that's Lew's responsibility.

742
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:05,684
Well, I...

743
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:17,679
Senor Gomez, you would be a very
foolish man to believe anything
the sheriff has told you.

744
01:06:17,714 --> 01:06:22,893
Gomez, don't let the judge here
smooth-talk you. He don't know
where the kid is, but I do.

745
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:25,655
He's in jail, where he's
always been.

746
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:30,935
Now, if you'll just hand over
the saddle bag, I promise you that
nothing will happen to Juan.

747
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:35,125
I will hand the money over to no-one
until the boy is handed over to me.

748
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:44,231
Come on, Simon, what's keeping you and Lew?
- How long do we have to wait, Lew?!

749
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,869
Now, I don't blame you for being
impatient. We'll be right there.

750
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:57,340
If you believe me, you lose your
$50,000 and save the boy's life.

751
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,577
If you believe Lew, Juan dies.

752
01:07:00,654 --> 01:07:02,417
Well, which way's it gonna be?

753
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:06,539
I will believe you
only when I see the boy.

754
01:07:08,844 --> 01:07:10,527
All right, Senor Gomez.

755
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:14,004
Why don't you walk
with him over to the jail?

756
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:19,204
Incidentally, I've authorised
Mr Carbo to receive the money
when we deliver the boy.

757
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:29,545
Well, Lew, I wonder which one
of us is going to be right.

758
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:05,229
See Lew?

759
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,296
Lew, can I see you a min...

760
01:08:17,654 --> 01:08:19,736
Waldo, you're a fool!

761
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:24,450
Simon? Turns out that
you were right.

762
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:28,285
But I think we can change that.
- Let go of me, Lew!

763
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,001
Juan, I'm letting you go.

764
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,988
I didn't expect to find you here,
Buchanan. Come on.

765
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:40,035
We could use a gun.

766
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,222
Hey!

767
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,298
Excuse me, senor.

768
01:08:56,052 --> 01:08:57,462
The carriage!

769
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,187
Buchanan!

770
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:23,785
Get up!

771
01:09:42,956 --> 01:09:44,844
Don't shoot!

772
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,241
Don't shoot! Don't shoot,
you'll hit Simon!

773
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:10,582
Buchanan, look.

774
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:14,051
Lew, look, the saddle bag!
- I ain't blind.

775
01:10:18,324 --> 01:10:21,407
Lew... bring out Gomez.

776
01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:33,312
Gomez is all right.

777
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:34,707
Lew Agry?

778
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:39,588
I hear ya!
- Tell everybody to move back up the street,
then let Gomez come out across the bridge.

779
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:42,343
If you don't,
I'm gonna shoot the judge.

780
01:10:42,378 --> 01:10:44,099
That ain't no loss.

781
01:10:44,134 --> 01:10:46,299
You heard him!

782
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,617
He means it, Lew!
- And if we do you're releasing Simon?

783
01:10:52,652 --> 01:10:53,992
You have my word on it.

784
01:10:54,027 --> 01:10:55,333
All right, Gomez, beat it.

785
01:10:57,478 --> 01:11:00,641
If he makes a move for that
saddle bag, shoot him.

786
01:11:03,232 --> 01:11:05,200
Hold it.

787
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:10,307
Buchanan, he isn't going any
further until you let Simon go.

788
01:11:10,342 --> 01:11:12,670
Tell him not to get nervous, Judge.

789
01:11:12,705 --> 01:11:14,524
Let him keep on walking, Lew!

790
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:16,344
All right, Gomez, move on.

791
01:11:24,491 --> 01:11:28,171
Juan!
- Esteban! Estas bien?
- Es nada, nada.

792
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:33,371
Judge, now you go on out there,
pick up that saddle bag
and bring it right back.

793
01:11:53,499 --> 01:11:55,660
Pick it up and come right back!

794
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,213
Run this way, Simon! Come on!

795
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:15,365
Now, Lew, you got any more ideas
on how to get that saddle bag?

796
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,836
Yeah. A real good one.

797
01:12:17,871 --> 01:12:20,514
Oh, no. Don't look my way, Lew.

798
01:12:20,549 --> 01:12:25,430
Why not? You can run faster
than Simon, you ought to be able to
make it. We'll give you good cover.

799
01:12:25,465 --> 01:12:27,031
Just like you did the judge?

800
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,380
Oh, no.

801
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:36,059
No, Lew, not me either.

802
01:12:36,094 --> 01:12:41,009
Suit yourself. But if you don't
I'll kill you right here.
Now, which way is it going to be?

803
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:56,596
Don't shoot, Buchanan!
D... Don't shoot!

804
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:08,824
That's far enough.
Now bend slow and pick up
them bags and come on across.

805
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:11,902
I can't, Buchanan. Lew will kill me.

806
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:13,579
Do as I tell you or I will!

807
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:40,068
Hold it, Buchanan.

808
01:13:40,103 --> 01:13:42,344
Drop that gun and stand up. Get up!

809
01:13:46,658 --> 01:13:49,738
You've just gone and saved us
the trouble of a hanging.

810
01:13:49,773 --> 01:13:52,819
Lew, I can't let you do to Buchanan
what you did to Simon.

811
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:54,496
What are you talkin' about?
- Murder.

812
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:58,297
There were those on this side that
saw it, Lew, they'd swear to it.

813
01:13:58,332 --> 01:14:00,686
Drop your gun, Lew.
- My own brother?

814
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:04,643
Lew...

815
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:24,184
Never should have crossed Simon.

816
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:31,535
I'll take those.
- Not after all the trouble I've gone to.

817
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:36,610
Anyway, it looks like this is your
town now. You wouldn't want to
start out makin' a big mistake.

818
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:41,006
There you are, Jonny.

819
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,200
Gracias.

820
01:14:43,235 --> 01:14:48,480
Buchanan, when you have a Mexican
as a friend, you must allow him to
repay you for all you have done.

821
01:14:48,515 --> 01:14:50,633
My horse is your horse.

822
01:14:50,668 --> 01:14:52,311
No, Jonny.
- Please, Buchanan.

823
01:14:52,346 --> 01:14:54,746
This time I promise
I will go straight home.

824
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,863
Adios.
- Adios.

825
01:15:13,086 --> 01:15:16,487
I don't think anybody'll try to
stop him this time. Do you, Carbo?

826
01:15:16,522 --> 01:15:19,124
Under the circumstances? No.

827
01:15:23,512 --> 01:15:25,753
Where do you think you're going?
- West Texas.

828
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:28,037
Good, I'd advise you
not to stay here.

829
01:15:28,072 --> 01:15:30,716
Like you say, this is my town now.

830
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:35,309
Mr Carbo... you can have it.

831
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:49,738
Don't just stand there, Amos.
Get a shovel.
