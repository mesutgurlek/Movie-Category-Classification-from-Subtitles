00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:21,253
Sorry about smacking you.

4
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:24,805
But you totally buried the lead.

5
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:28,594
If you'd have started with what happened
to Gab, I wouldn't have hit you...

6
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,554
so hard.

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,858
Where is Gab?

9
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,727
[Gab] Right behind you.

10
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,148
Do you want a Diet Coke?

11
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,694
- I'm addicted to the stuff.

[grunts]

13
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:52,325
- What's wrong with your ass?
- I got shot.

14
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,661
I have something for that.

15
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,498
Ibuprofen.

16
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:01,759
Reduces swelling.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,006
So... Gab shot a man and needs to lay low.

18
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,969
That requires some serious medicine.

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,228
Heather Crazy Dog.

20
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,321
Close enough.

21
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,107
There you go.

22
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:37,036
After those men attacked you,
your friends tried the sweat?

23
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,081
To call you back?

24
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,875
Did it work?

25
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,553
I wanted it to.

26
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,466
Sometimes it takes more.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,058
My great-grandmother watched white
soldiers massacre her entire family.

28
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,270
She was raped.

29
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:09,110
She passed this skull down as her
medicine because it's the truth.

30
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,614
Do you have medicine?

31
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,534
I'm not sure what that is.

32
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,708
Your medicine... is a power.

33
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:29,797
I can change your name.

34
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,719
I can even change your
Social Security number.

35
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:39,641
But only your medicine
can change what's inside.

36
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:42,101
Now you're here.

37
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,564
We'll find your medicine.

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,028
Okay, you, say goodbye.

39
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,415
I am not leaving her.

40
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,626
You've got a car parked across the
river where the cops can find it

41
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,754
and a truck with your blood in it at home.

42
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,374
You want to help her out?

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,628
Go... clean up your mess.

44
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,547
[Gab] She's right.

45
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,385
You need to take back Mandy's
car, or she'll turn us in.

[grunting]

47
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,274
Gab, I am so sorry.

48
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,276
Why?

49
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,036
You got me here.

50
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,287
No.

51
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,156
[grunting]

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,371
I think I gave you the
idea to shoot that man.

53
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,125
When I told you to write to Hector.

54
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,047
I think I already had that idea in my head.

55
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:59,304
You just reminded me
that I had the strength.

56
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,946
Thanks for bringing her.

57
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,367
Never come back.

Good morning. [chuckles]

- Coffee?
- Uh, no, thanks.

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,742
I just need to go grab my, um...

67
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,419
- Pants?
- Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,045
They're over there, so...

Hi.

72
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,930
Hi. Just met your roommate.

73
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,939
Um...

74
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,441
You have to get dressed and go.

75
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,360
Whoa, whoa. Not till
I have a cup of coffee.

76
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,819
- No.
- Just one cup of coffee.

77
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,398
Otherwise, this feels dirty.

78
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,659
Okay. Okay.

79
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,861
But, um...

80
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,078
Put your clothes on first.

81
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,699
- All right.
- Okay. Okay.

Met your friend.

Yeah.

00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:57,804
Um, Eamonn. Mm-hmm.

Uh...

Oh, uh, sorry, Ferguson. Morning.

You all right?

00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,462
- You seem distracted.
- No, I'm good.

94
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,416
I just need to talk to the
sheriff before he gets in.

95
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:42,508
Sheriff!

96
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:46,019
Monte? What are you doing here?

97
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,223
I'm sorry to say, but I'm filing
charges against one of your deputies.

98
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,108
Charges? Against who?

99
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,984
Sheriff, I've been
waiting for you to get in.

100
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,362
- You're too late, Zach.
- Whatever this guy has told you...

101
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,864
- Don't you threaten me again.
- Again? I never threatened you.

102
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,618
I don't know what this guy's
problem is, but he's out of control.

103
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,579
I was minding my own business. I
wasn't doing anything to anyone!

104
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,331
He comes busting into my
room without probable cause!

105
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,826
Hey!

106
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,620
My office.

107
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,979
[bird cawing]

[tires squeal]

110
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,726
That's messed up, all
right? He's been watching me.

111
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:12,314
He storms into my room without
permission and with violent intent.

112
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,107
I have witnesses that will tell you

113
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,061
- that he assaulted me.
- All right!

114
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:20,238
Monte, do you want to
file a formal complaint?

115
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,984
- You're damn right I do.
- [Walt] Ferg's in the bullpen.

116
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,071
He'll take your statement.

117
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:36,588
Look, before you say anything, can
I show you what I took from his room?

118
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,883
No! You can't.

119
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,761
Anything you have, you got without
a warrant and without probable cause.

120
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,054
He was following me.

121
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,348
Paranoia is not probable cause.

122
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:49,309
Paranoia is when there's no factual
basis for fear. Now, in this case...

123
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,354
You mean Monte's case?
Because he has a case.

124
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:55,600
Everything you took from his
room was obtained illegally.

125
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,069
Now, this is the last thing I need when
I'm already dealing with two murders.

126
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,105
[knock on door]

127
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,614
- It's Henry.
- Not now.

128
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,525
He says it's important.

129
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:08,412
You wait here.

130
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,489
I don't need you and
Monte in the same room.

131
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,168
Sheriff, what am I supposed to do?

132
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,837
Take his statement.

133
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,213
[Trot] Hey! I'm hungry!

134
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,291
Yeah, we all have problems.

135
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,387
Henry, what's so important, it can't wait?

136
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,264
My truck has been stolen.

137
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,424
[Walt] When?

138
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:32,143
Hard to say. I have not used
it since the night before last.

139
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,563
So sometime in the last 36 hours.

140
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:37,357
I hate to say it, but I think
the person that took your truck

141
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,985
did it because it's yours and
they didn't think you'd call me.

142
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,111
Who do you think...

143
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,773
Gab. She's fleeing a murder charge.

144
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,242
- Murder?
- [Walt] Yeah.

145
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,070
Tyler Malone died last night.

146
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,001
I do not think Gab
would've stolen my truck.

147
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:59,379
Ferg found evidence of a
getaway vehicle in the woods.

148
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,799
Gab doesn't own a car.
Your truck is missing, so...

149
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,133
That is still quite a leap.

150
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,677
[sighs] I hope so.

151
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:09,590
Meantime, we'll call the state police.
I'll let you know if it turns up.

152
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,136
[tires screech]

00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,699
- Looking up the license plates now.
- Thanks.

156
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,909
Where are you going?

157
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,946
I'm going to talk to the
last person that saw Gab.

158
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,129
[grunts]

159
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,262
[Walker] Who the hell are you?

160
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,190
I'm talking to you, asshole.

161
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,026
What are you doing with this car?

162
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,235
Nothing. I was just walking by.

163
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,105
I saw you get out.

164
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,407
Where's Gab, girl who killed my guys?

165
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,409
I really have no idea
what you are talking about.

166
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,370
Gab borrowed the car. You're returning it.

167
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:14,947
You got to know something.

168
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,449
Hang on a second.

169
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,918
Don't I know you from somewhere?

170
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,837
I do not think so.

171
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,498
No, no. Hey. No, no.

172
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,925
You were at the casino
the other night, right?

173
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,468
You were following me and my guys.

174
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,921
I think you are confused.

175
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,926
[grunting]

176
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,346
Confused, huh?

177
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,068
I feel really good about
this, Mr. Blackwolf.

178
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,904
From what you've told me, there's
absolutely grounds for a case here.

179
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,405
[knock on door]

180
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,407
Uh, I'll come meet you
in an hour at the casino.

181
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,776
- Okay. Bye.
- [cellphone beeps]

182
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:54,369
Hey, Punk.

183
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,996
Dad.

184
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:59,117
I was just gonna go outside
and get some... get some air.

185
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,164
Was that...

186
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:09,627
Yeah. Uh, Cady's his daughter. I
didn't... I didn't tell you that?

187
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,302
No, you didn't.

188
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,930
Huh.

189
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,348
- I need to know everything.
- About what?

190
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,643
About when you saw Gab
yesterday. You said she was alone.

191
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,228
Are you sure?

192
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,064
Why wouldn't I be sure?

193
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,440
Was she hurt?

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,233
Not that I could tell, no.

195
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,603
Why couldn't you tell?
Was she in a vehicle?

196
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:31,031
No. No, I told you. I-I
saw her walking, and then...

197
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,275
Was there one nearby?

198
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:35,069
There may have been one parked.

199
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,157
Could it have been Henry's truck?

200
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,625
What? No.

201
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,044
Good morning, Walt. We got to go.

202
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,914
There's been some sort of a
kerfuffle at Mandy Plitt's house.

203
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,591
Ruby's word, not mine.

204
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:52,920
If you remember anything,
you call me, okay?

205
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,952
I don't know what you two have been
doing, but I caught an accomplice.

206
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,120
An accomplice to what?

207
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:20,580
- This Indian...
- [groans]

208
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:23,374
- Hey!
- ...either helped Gab murder my guys

209
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,751
or knows where to find her.

210
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,544
Back up, Walker.

211
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,589
We don't even know that Gab had
anything to do with Tyler's murder.

212
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,008
Well, you may not, but I do.

213
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,878
Owen here said he saw Gab the
morning after Tyler was shot.

214
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,680
You saw Gab?

215
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,724
Right here. She was in a
hurry to borrow Mandy's car.

216
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,476
After Mandy said no, she threatened Owen.

217
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,971
That ought to tell you
a little bit about her.

218
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,643
What'd Gab say?

219
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:54,447
She told Mandy to hand over the
keys or she'd accuse me of rape

220
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,826
and that I'd end up dead...
just like Will and Tyler.

221
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:02,407
Okay, in my book, that's an admission
of murder for both Tyler and Will.

222
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,543
What's he got to do with this?

223
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:09,880
Gab borrowed the car. He returned it.

224
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,209
So he's either in on it or
he knows where to find her.

225
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,468
Is that true?

226
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,470
- No.
- Bullshit!

227
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,890
This Indian was following me and my guys.

228
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:22,350
He was there at the casino
the night Tyler that was shot.

229
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,811
For all I know, the girl was
laying in the back of the truck

230
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,389
while he was talking to me.

231
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,068
So, you gonna arrest him, Sheriff?

232
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,611
Unfortunately, I can't.

233
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,530
See, this is the Res.

234
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,615
I got no jurisdiction here.

235
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,951
[scoffs] I don't get this. I...

236
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:43,163
What do you got against us? What
did me and my men ever do wrong?

237
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:47,993
Aside from rape and murder,
you all seem like great guys.

238
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,589
So, this is... It's just
a goddamn joke to you, huh?

239
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,425
This Indian, he's an accessory to murder.

240
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,670
Even if that's true,
there's nothing I can do.

241
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,557
Then I will.

242
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,726
[Walt] You don't have
that authority, either.

243
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,971
He's got to go to the tribal police.

244
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:13,110
Sir, who would you rather
take you to the tribal police?

245
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,813
Me or him?

246
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,678
Out!

247
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,180
[groans]

248
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,807
Henry, are you okay?

249
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:47,311
It got a bit physical before you
arrived. I landed on something sharp.

250
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,853
What the hell's going on?

251
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,355
I am as confused as you are.

252
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,274
Well, you're sure not as mad as I am.

253
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,025
What are you doing in Mandy's car?

254
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,736
The one that Gab borrowed the
morning after the shooting?

255
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:59,864
She asked me to return it for
her this morning as a favor.

256
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,158
You saw Gab this morning?

257
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,201
No. She called. I do not know from where.

258
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,911
Why couldn't she return the car herself?

259
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,038
She did not say. I did not ask.

260
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,832
She said she had parked it at the Red Pony.

261
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,541
When I went down this morning to get it,

262
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,586
that is when I noticed my truck was
missing, and that is when I called you.

263
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you think it's possible that
when she dropped off Mandy's car,

264
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,125
she took your truck?

265
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,387
It is possible.

266
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,265
You knew Tyler had been
shot. I told you that.

267
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:29,644
It didn't cross your mind that maybe Gab
had done it and she was trying to escape?

268
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,648
I was with Gab yesterday morning.
She was not trying to escape then.

269
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,233
You were with her?

270
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:37,027
Yes.

271
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,903
We took a walk.

272
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:41,440
Ask your daughter. She saw us both.

273
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,860
Cady saw you?

274
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,990
Yes.

275
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,170
Get back in.

276
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:56,796
Why? So you can yell at me some more?

277
00:16:56,797 --> 00:17:00,175
There's clearly no point.
You've said all you're gonna say.

278
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,344
So what, then, are you
going to take me to Mathias?

279
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm not taking you to Mathias.

280
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,555
Then I would rather walk.

281
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,299
[Vic] Henry, you're hurt.

282
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:12,263
Best thing for an injury is to walk it off.

283
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,702
So, did you really hit Monte?

284
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,503
Not on purpose.

285
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,706
Well, I'm sure he was asking for it.

286
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,961
How screwed do you think I am?

287
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:48,014
Ruby, call Cady. Tell her to
come here as soon as possible.

288
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,133
Okay.

289
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,428
Ferg, do you have Monte's statement?

290
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,188
Uh, yeah. I got it right here.

291
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,057
- But I just want to s...
- Let me see it.

292
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,908
I'm not sure which is
more surprising to me...

293
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,995
the fact that Cady Longmire has
voluntarily come to pay me a visit

294
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:15,033
or that she's friends
with Calvin Blackwolf.

295
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,462
- I represent Mr. Blackwolf.
- In what?

296
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,546
[Cady] In the matter of
his wrongful dismissal.

297
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:23,758
Wrongful dismissal? You were fired?

298
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,842
What happened?

299
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:27,053
I'm here to ask you the same question.

300
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,430
You're his employer.

301
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:29,389
That's true.

302
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,476
But I don't handle day-to-day
personnel decisions on the floor.

303
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,478
- And that would be?
- [door opens]

304
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,763
Malachi Strand.

305
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,525
Why did Malachi fire you, Calvin?

306
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:44,404
He, uh... He said I was missing
shifts. But that's not true.

307
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:48,492
Every time big tippers came to the table,
Malachi would tell me to go take a break.

308
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,654
I needed those tips. It's not fair.

309
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,122
And you complained to him?

310
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,499
He did.

311
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
And he was fired.

312
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,628
My client believes that this was
about Malachi playing favorites.

313
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:04,875
But I think Malachi's behavior could
suggest even more egregious improprieties.

314
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,886
"Egregious improprieties."

315
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:12,223
All the self-righteous hostility
one expects from a Longmire,

316
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:15,720
but with notably more elegant vocabulary.

317
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:19,356
You are free to treat this
like a joke, Mr. Nighthorse,

318
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,108
but you have 24 hours to
respond to my client's complaint.

319
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,562
After which time, we will be filing suit.

320
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:26,522
Indeed.

321
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:33,362
Well, I will take all of
this under consideration.

322
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,781
I'm sure you will.

323
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,041
So, do I get to defend myself?

324
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,253
You read this?

325
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,757
Is it all true?

326
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:56,226
Well, yes. But...

327
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,597
Then the "but" doesn't
really matter, Zachary.

328
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm sorry, but you can't storm
into somebody's room without cause,

329
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,530
steal their property, and hit them.

330
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:11,074
- That was an accident.
- [Walt] Well, I'm sure it was.

331
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,527
But it should never have happened.

332
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,197
Well, I promise...

333
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,375
I won't make another mistake like that.

334
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,709
[Walt] But you already have.

335
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,380
You got into a fight at the oil
field your first week on the job.

336
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,707
Now this.

337
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:31,670
That's two physical altercations
in such a short time.

338
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,181
You once told me...

339
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:40,645
that the best way to stop a problem...

340
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:43,223
was to get there before
it becomes a problem.

341
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,479
I'm sorry, but that's
what I got to do here.

342
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,368
You don't have to say any more.

343
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,572
Well, unfortunately, I do.

344
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,242
I need your badge and gun.

345
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,770
Sorry I screwed up, Sheriff.

346
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,481
I know.

347
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,692
So am I.

348
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,402
[door opens]

349
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,390
[door closes]

350
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,395
Hey.

351
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:14,481
What's up?

352
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,828
I understand the rest of
the world disappointing me.

353
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,539
But you?

354
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,290
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,916
You lied to my face.

356
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,244
Twice.

357
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,381
You saw Henry walking
with Gab yesterday morning.

358
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:36,587
And yet you told me again
and again that she was alone.

359
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:46,103
How did you find out?

360
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:47,271
Henry told me.

361
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,557
He did?

362
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:52,477
Well, if he was willing to tell you,
then obviously, he has nothing to hide.

363
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,899
He only told me because he was cornered.

364
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:03,238
And you only confirmed it...
because I caught you in a lie.

365
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,326
Why did you feel you had to lie?

366
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:13,874
I thought that maybe Henry
was involved with... something.

367
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,377
But I was obviously
just being overdramatic.

368
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,756
What did you think he did?

369
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,470
Okay.

370
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:30,022
We've gotten to a place where I'm
uncomfortable answering these questions.

371
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,566
Cady, this is serious.

372
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,611
I have reason to believe he's
involved in a serious crime.

373
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,946
Which is why I can't talk to you about it.

374
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,698
He is, after all, my client.

375
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:39,990
Ex-client.

376
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,452
Well, we never dissolved the relationship.

377
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:47,123
You're going to use legal technicalities
so you can... you can lie to me?

378
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:50,076
I'm not lying to you. And I'm sorry.

379
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:55,332
But if I tell you things without
Henry's permission, I could be disbarred.

380
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,770
- He's not here.
- What do you mean he's not here?

381
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:11,105
Henry Standing Bear is
an accessory to a murder.

382
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,399
That's why he's not here. That's a felony.

383
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,110
I'm not authorized to
deal with cases like that.

384
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,987
Strictly misdemeanors around here.

385
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,030
- So you let a criminal go.
- [sighs]

386
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,199
- Well, that's the flip side.
- Flip side of what?

387
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,994
Well, you and your men can do
whatever you want on the Res

388
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,079
without anybody being able to hurt you.

389
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,998
The flip side is when something goes wrong,

390
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,875
there's nobody that can help you, either.

391
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:33,461
So the sheriff's not gonna lift
a finger to find this murderer.

392
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,879
You aren't, either.

393
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,715
That doesn't leave me a lot
of goddamn options, does it?

394
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,334
Sure doesn't.

395
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:47,258
[laughs]

396
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,771
[Mathias] You were right.
He was here, and he's pissed.

397
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:54,725
Okay, Mathias. Thanks for the update.

398
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:06,236
You fire Zachary?

399
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:08,906
I did.

400
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,950
So what was it that he found over there?

401
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,293
I don't know.

402
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,162
You didn't let him explain himself?

403
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,466
What difference would it make?

404
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,176
I don't know.

405
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:23,628
But neither do you.

406
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,430
Look, I'll admit it.

407
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:29,426
Took me a little while
to warm up to Zachary.

408
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,387
But I think he's a good cop.

409
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:35,140
So do I.

410
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,735
So what happens if he was right?

411
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,854
What happens when he's not?

412
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,450
What's that tell you and Vic
about how you should do your jobs?

413
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,870
Obviously, this is your decision to make.

414
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,372
But I think you're making Zach
pay for someone else's crimes.

415
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,742
Yes. This is about Branch.

416
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,628
That was the last time my
personal feelings about a deputy

417
00:25:57,629 --> 00:25:59,881
led me to make the wrong decision.

418
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:01,291
But Zach's not Branch.

419
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:07,931
Branch was always trying
to prove something.

420
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,508
It was always about Branch.

421
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:12,677
But Zach...

422
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,848
I just think he really
wants to help people.

423
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:20,685
You might be right.

424
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,190
I believe his intentions are good.

425
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,360
But I have to think about the consequences.

426
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,447
I've made my decision.

427
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:42,457
[door closes]

428
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,379
[Henry inhales sharply]

429
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:51,758
[knock on door]

430
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:57,848
Come in!

431
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:12,946
Jacob?

432
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,992
Wow.

433
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,211
You must really love the Red Pony...

434
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:25,750
to willingly live in a place like this.

435
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:31,555
And to stay on, even after
you got bought out by Malachi.

436
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:34,017
"Bought out" is not how I
would put it. He tricked me.

437
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,720
Well, he tricked me, too.

438
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:46,070
I thought that Malachi's past mistakes
were attributable to his circumstances

439
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:51,193
and that if someone like me believed
in him, his best self would come out.

440
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:56,948
But there may be no best
self left in the man.

441
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:01,411
Jacob, why are you here?

442
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:08,092
I have mounting evidence

443
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:13,305
that Malachi has been using the casino
as a base for illegal activities.

444
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:16,301
He's threatening everything
that I have set up.

445
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,561
And I need your help.

446
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:21,188
Illegal activities are more
of a Sheriff Longmire thing.

447
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:22,398
Why not go to him?

448
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,767
Well...

449
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:31,024
Because... he hates me...

450
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,076
and doesn't trust me.

451
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,326
And you think I do?

452
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,570
Maybe not.

453
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,326
But in the end, Henry, I think
that you and I want the same thing.

454
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:47,172
Betterment of our people,
achieved by our people.

455
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:52,302
Walt would see my trouble with Malachi
as an opportunity to destroy my casino.

456
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:58,017
You might see it as an
opportunity to save your bar.

457
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:00,310
Just when I was beginning
to see you as an idealist,

458
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:02,105
the pragmatic negotiator comes out.

459
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,940
[Nighthorse] Ah, yeah, well...

460
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:07,102
we both like being our own boss.

461
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,192
If you help me keep my business,
I'll help you get yours back.

462
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:18,746
What are you proposing I do?

463
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:20,991
Malachi's been stealing money.

464
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:26,204
He's got to hide it somewhere.

465
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,172
I'm guessing it's here.

466
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,758
- Money laundering.
- Yeah.

467
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,003
If you could help me prove that...

468
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:38,591
they wouldn't let him run
this place from prison.

469
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:43,096
Think about it...

470
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,266
Henry.

471
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:56,651
[knock on door]

472
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,446
Monte, can I come in?

473
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:02,873
Sure.

474
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:05,827
I'm gonna leave the door open
in case things get out of hand.

475
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:12,466
[Walt] I want you to know that
we take these charges seriously.

476
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,586
Zachary's been let go for his behavior.

477
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:18,506
I'm here to apologize personally.

478
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,342
Wow.

479
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:23,435
Okay. Apology accepted.

480
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:26,856
Knowing what a harsh
outcome this is for Zachary,

481
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:29,192
I wanted to suggest that
maybe you find your way

482
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,477
to dropping the charges against him.

483
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:37,942
What's in it for me if I do?

484
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,112
Nothing.

485
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:44,040
[chuckles] Ah, it was worth a try.

486
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:48,078
Bribery would have made a really
juicy addition to the complaint.

487
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,670
What complaint?

488
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:50,914
This one.

489
00:30:57,804 --> 00:31:00,973
You're suing me for your
little tiff with Zachary?

490
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,767
Or is this just your way of getting
back at me for not hiring you?

491
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:06,346
I'm not the one suing you.
I'm just the investigator.

492
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,433
Who's suing me?

493
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,559
Barlow Connally.

494
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:21,368
[Ruby] Frankly, I don't care...

495
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:22,786
[Walker] No, I don't!

496
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:25,372
[Ruby] Yelling is not
gonna change my answer, sir!

497
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,457
It's just gonna make you look foolish!

498
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,668
- Just call him on his cell phone!
- He doesn't have one.

499
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:32,588
- Bullshit! Who doesn't have a cell phone?
- Watch your language, sir!

500
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:33,756
There he is.

501
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,258
Time's up, Sheriff.

502
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,759
Make an appointment.

503
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,003
How 'bout instead of
that, I set a court date?

504
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,597
You've been holding Trot for two days.

505
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,766
- It's actually only been 36 hours.
- Close enough.

506
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,269
As far as I know, you haven't
charged him with anything yet.

507
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,895
- We've got 48 hours to do that.
- Right.

508
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:51,274
But if you haven't charged him, I can only
assume it's because of lack of evidence.

509
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:54,484
And we both know that you're suddenly
not gonna find some in the next 12 hours.

510
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:56,361
Not when the actual
killer's still out there.

511
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:58,530
- What do you want, Walker?
- What do you think I want?

512
00:31:58,531 --> 00:32:00,449
You charge him or you release him.

513
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,203
If you do neither, I've got lawyers at
Newett drawing up paperwork right now

514
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:06,163
to drop a wrongful-arrest
suit against you.

515
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,415
Wrongful arrest? Based on what?

516
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:13,170
Abuse of power, corruption, colluding with
tribal police to conceal the real suspects

517
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:17,133
while intimidating and
harassing me and my men.

518
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:19,043
Shall I go on?

519
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:39,696
I hope you all realize next time you try
to hang false charges on me and my guys,

520
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:41,274
not gonna be so patient.

521
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,945
Okay, Walt.

522
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,789
I'm sure you got a good
reason, but why would you...

523
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,375
Because now is not the time for
me to be fielding any questions

524
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:54,579
about corruption, abuse
of power, or intimidation.

525
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:56,706
Why not?

526
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,294
Because I'm already being sued for
the wrongful death of Barlow Connally.

527
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,089
[Ruby] Walt, Walt.

528
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:08,017
Not so fast.

529
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:12,355
So, Ruby said, uh, Steve
Rosato saw the abandoned truck

530
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,564
in a lane behind his store.

531
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,400
Sounded like it could be Henry's.

532
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:18,610
You think Gab is somewhere around here?

533
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,063
[Walt] Don't know.

534
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:25,034
You worried about that lawsuit at all?

535
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,536
I mean, I know that Monte took
a lot of stuff out of context,

536
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:30,164
but there's some pretty
damning stuff in there.

537
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:31,915
Why should I be worried?

538
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:35,336
The feds cleared me. It's
just gonna be a hassle.

539
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,914
These lawsuits eat up a lot of time.

540
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,257
Yeah.

541
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,377
It's a bad time to be shorthanded.

542
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:49,516
[grunts]

543
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:52,436
About that, uh, I was thinking,

544
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:54,855
instead of going through
a whole search again,

545
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:57,934
you think Eamonn might be
interested in taking that job?

546
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,444
Uh...

547
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,607
I don't, uh... I don't really
think that that's the best idea.

548
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:05,241
Why?

549
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:06,692
Um...

550
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:11,573
Because Eamonn and I are in a relationship.

551
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:15,751
Um... a sexual one.

552
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:18,045
We're sleeping together.

553
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,581
Oh.

554
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,590
Oh?

555
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,460
Seriously? That's your response?

556
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,714
What do you want me to say?

557
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,259
I don't know.

558
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:36,556
"Wow, I had no idea," or, "How
long has that been going on?"

559
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,524
It's none of my business.

560
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:42,194
Yeah, Walt, you know... [sighs]

561
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,447
We used to be close, you
know, so close, in fact,

562
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:47,074
that my ex-husband thought we
were too close, and so did Lizzie.

563
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:50,403
And everybody else always thought that
there was something going on between us.

564
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:59,579
You know, it's not like you actually
encouraged me to stay married.

565
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:03,840
And then, you think that Eamonn is
flirting with me, so you push him away,

566
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,260
and then all of a sudden you
start dating the psychiatrist,

567
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:07,795
and you want to hire Eamonn?

568
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:10,089
Why?

569
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,175
Feel guilty?

570
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,895
Please don't walk away from me.

571
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,647
I'm not walking away from you.

572
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,899
I'm walking away from
that truck. It's a Chevy.

573
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,810
It's not Henry's.

574
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:34,489
So, what exactly is the nature of
your relationship with Dr. Monaghan?

575
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:40,286
The exact nature of my relationship
is none of your business.

576
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:43,623
It is my business, Walt.

577
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:49,045
Whether you like it or not,
your life, it impacts mine.

578
00:35:58,604 --> 00:35:59,889
[sighs]

579
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,330
[Ruby] Walt, Dr. Monaghan called.

580
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:19,325
She needs you to get over
to the church right away.

581

[sighs] Oh, thank God you're here.

584

Is that your van?

585
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:38,352
Yeah. I, uh, came out after my
group, and... and it was on fire.

586
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:41,564
And the fire department said
that someone broke the window

587
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,358
and threw a Molotov cocktail inside, so...

588
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,560
Jesus.

589
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:48,320
You think it was your patient?

590
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:53,576
Well, i-i-it's hard for me to imagine
any other explanation right now.

591
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,319
What's your patient's name?

592
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,582
I'm sorry. I'm just not really
comfortable giving you that information.

593
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,791
I don't think you're bound
by doctor-patient privilege

594
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,460
in the face of a violent act like this.

595
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:04,878
No. It's...

596
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,797
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

597
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:11,218
so I'm completely in the dark as
to their state of mind right now.

598
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:16,006
So, someone lit your van on fire, and
you don't want to tell us who it is?

599
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:17,974
Yes. That's right.

600
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,352
[Walt] Well, I don't
think you should go home

601
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:22,687
till we know that this
patient is no longer a threat.

602
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,481
You got somewhere to stay?

603
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,358
Uh, yeah, I can...

604
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:27,984
You should just stay with Walt.

605

About Monte.

He's trying to dig up dirt
on Walt for a civil suit.

I saw the stuff you found in his room.

You know, the transcript
of my conversation with him?

It was totally taken out of
context to make Walt look bad.

Monte's really trying to take Walt down.

What are you gonna do?

take another run at Walt.

00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,028
No, I'm good.

641
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,279
Hey.

642
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,822
Come on, man.

643
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:38,900
Come on.

644
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:43,370
I'm tired of people not listening to me!

645
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:45,949
Give me your goddamn keys!

646
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,338
You know, it's, uh...

647
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:06,636
It's been a long time since there's
been something positive in my life.

648
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,224
I thought this job was going to be that.

649
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,612
I just got sick of cops always
getting there after the crime,

650
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:20,650
after someone had been raped or murdered.

651
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:26,121
And I thought that I could be the guy

652
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:29,659
who could stop those things from
happening in the first place.

653
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,453
Look, man, I'm...

654
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:38,208
I'm really sorry... I gave you such
a hard time when you first showed up.

655
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,712
You didn't deserve it.

656
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:47,267
It's good, man.

657
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:48,761
It's all good.

658
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,272
What are you doing?

659
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:57,611
Well, since you're driving,
I can have another drink.

660
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:59,063
Bartender!

661
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,743
I've been checking with
the state police hourly,

662
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,830
and they have absolutely
nothing on Henry's truck.

663
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:11,207
They put out an alert to all
the counties, other states?

664
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,294
It's not their first
stolen vehicle, Walter.

665
00:41:14,295 --> 00:41:17,422
What about Gab? Anyone respond
to the missing-persons alert?

666
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,916
- No.
- [door opens]

667
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,594
- [Mandy] Please.
- [Ruby] Oh, Lord.

668
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:24,429
You have to help her.

669
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,597
Mandy, what happened?

670
00:41:25,598 --> 00:41:28,885
I didn't tell him anything, I swear.
I don't know anything. But you...

671
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:34,515
You have to find Gab before he does.

672
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,441
Who?

673
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,935
Who did this?

674
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:40,987
[Malachi] Mr. Browning.

675
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:43,148
It's a pleasure to see you again.

676
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,408
[Walker] I need to find a girl.

677
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:48,411
Oh? For you this time or one
of your [chuckles] colleagues?

678
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:50,664
Not that kind of girl.
Her name's Gab Langton.

679
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,165
She killed one of my guys.

680
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,710
Well, I am not a bounty hunter.

681
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:58,497
If I don't find her, they're gonna
pin the murder on one of my boys.

682
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:00,249
I can't have that.

683
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,927
If Trot goes down, he
might take me with him.

684
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:08,390
And our lucrative arrangement where
I overpay you to take care of my guys,

685
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:09,683
that's over.

686
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:11,685
[Malachi] Do we have
anything other than a name?

687
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,312
[Walker] Make, model, and license
number of her getaway vehicle,

688
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:17,566
and her accomplice is an Indian
by the name of Henry Standing Bear.

689
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:20,985
[laughs] Hank Standing Bear's involved?

690
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,572
Well, now I am interested.

691
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,241
- Well, the sheriff sure isn't.
- [chuckles]

692
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,244
Walter Longmire's not going to help you.

693
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,780
He's Hank's best friend.

694
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,585
But tell you what, I'll put
the word out to the brotherhood.

695
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:42,125
And if any of them has seen
Gab or Hank, I'll let you know.

696
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:50,174
I know you know where Gab is.

697
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,843
I know you helped her escape.

698
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:56,346
Now you need to tell me where she is.

699
00:42:57,106 --> 00:42:58,474
Walt...

700
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:02,186
you tried to get justice for her...

701
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:04,814
and could not.

702
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:11,695
And now, just maybe, she found
the only justice available to her.

703
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:17,960
Why are you working so
hard to punish her for that?

704
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:21,671
Because if I don't get to her first,

705
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:26,585
Walker Browning will hunt
her down and kill her.

706
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:33,050
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

707
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:35,594
Where's Gab?

708
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:55,998
[rock music playing]

709
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:57,248
Hey.

710
00:43:57,249 --> 00:43:58,408
Hi.

711
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,205
I promised you a home-cooked
meal and I never delivered, so...

712
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,922
Oh, you delivered.

713
00:44:03,923 --> 00:44:05,256
[both chuckle]

714
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:09,052
Also, this is a restaurant,
so not really home-cooked.

715
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:10,053
Ah.

716
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:15,475
Well, the guy who cooks here... Henry...
also lives here, so it is his home.

717
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:17,686
Well, that's thin, but I'll allow it.

718
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,138
[laughs]

719
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:22,024
[clears throat]

720
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,274
Mm.

721
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:27,696
Also, I wanted to let you know that
Walt brought up the idea of hiring you.

722
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:30,114
And I know that I should have
spoken to you about it first,

723
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:32,609
but I told him that it
just couldn't happen.

724
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:37,614
Yeah, you definitely should've
spoken to me about that first.

725
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,250
Well, yeah, but I mean that it
wouldn't have mattered anyway

726
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,963
'cause we can't work together
if we're in a relationship.

727
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:47,256
All I did was pick you up at the hospital,

728
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:51,712
and now we're in a relationship and
you're making career decisions for me?

729
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,883
Vic, I told you I liked it here.

730
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,977
And my current boss turns out
to be ethically challenged,

731
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:00,436
something I helped expose.

732
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,981
So I don't know how long
I'm going to be in that job.

733
00:45:02,982 --> 00:45:05,101
- I'm sorry, Eamonn. I...
- Are you?

734
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:06,776
Because...

735
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:10,780
'Cause it... It feels like
I'm just some kind of pawn

736
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:14,283
in whatever weird dynamic
you and Walt have going on.

737
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:15,785
That... That is not true.

738
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:16,786
Really?

739
00:45:16,787 --> 00:45:18,788
He fired me because he was jealous,

740
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:23,543
and now you tell him not to hire me
because you want to make him jealous?

741
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:25,162
[scoffs]

742
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:33,219
Okay, so I'll admit that I didn't
handle this situation particularly well.

743
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,842
But none of that means that
I don't really like you.

744
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,440
You know, Vic? Ah.

745
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:46,983
I like you, too.

746
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:50,236
But before there's gonna
be any kind of "us,"

747
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:52,689
you got to figure out
what's going on with you.

748
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:32,271
Gab?

749
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,216
Gab?

750
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,017
Hey.

751
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:15,613
So, here it is, the great demon
your mother fought so hard against.

752
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:16,732
Christina.

753
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:20,284
It's not that bad, is it?

754
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:21,911
Well, my client sure seems to like it,

755
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:24,247
so I'm hoping you have
some good news for him.

756
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:26,875
Well, that's not why I asked you to come.

757
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:27,876
Please, sit.

758
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:30,128
If we're not talking about
Calvin Blackwolf's job,

759
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:31,838
then we're not talking.

760
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,458
I think you're gonna want to hear this.

761
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,878
Please.

762
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:50,065
The profit generated by all this was
never intended to enrich any one person.

763
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:53,193
It is intended to change
the life of the whole tribe.

764
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:56,230
And yet you're the only
one in a Prada suit.

765
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,993
I want to fund the construction of
schools, hospitals, treatment centers.

766
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:05,454
I-I really don't have time for a speech.

767
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:07,999
Um, I have a complaint I
have to write for my client.

768
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,001
And I would also like to fund you.

769
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:11,669
[chuckles]

770
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,962
Excuse me?

771
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:15,757
Most of our people
don't understand the law.

772
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:17,842
They can't afford lawyers.

773
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:21,721
But with a properly funded
and managed legal-aid center,

774
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,514
we could start to change that.

775
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:26,976
Are you trying to buy me off so that
I'll make Calvin's lawsuit just go away?

776
00:48:26,977 --> 00:48:28,978
Calvin shouldn't have been fired.

777
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:30,688
His job's still here if he wants it,

778
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:34,684
along with back pay and
an extra week's vacation.

779
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,987
What I would like, Cady,

780
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:42,901
is for everyone in Cheyenne Nation
to have access to representation.

781
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,362
And I'd like you to provide it.

782
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:52,869
I was raised by a white woman.

783
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:58,091
And I know there are a
few special ones out there.

784
00:48:58,092 --> 00:49:00,336
So call my office if you're interested.

785
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,893
[Walt] Gab?

786
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:23,608
You can't come in here.

787
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,871
You're supposed to fast
for at least 24 hours first.

788
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:31,333
Gab, you need to come with me.

789
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:33,293
We have to leave now.

790
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:35,170
Are you here to arrest me?

791
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,255
I'm here to protect you.

792
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:39,341
There's another man
who's trying to kill you.

793
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,050
Why?

794
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:44,887
He thinks you killed his
friend, the oil worker.

795
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:47,682
And if you're not around
to tell your story,

796
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,968
he can pin a second murder on you, too.

797
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:52,388
I don't care.

798
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:56,024
I wish I did kill them both.

799
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,859
I know.

800
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,569
But if you let them blame
you for both murders,

801
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,780
that means they get away with everything.

802
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,691
And they can do it again.

803
00:50:10,664 --> 00:50:15,077
[Gab] Marilyn says this medicine wheel
is like a microphone to our ancestors.

804
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:18,129
I've been asking for their guidance.

805
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,458
It's hard to believe they would
send a white sheriff to help me.

806
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:32,761
Spirit helpers can take on strange forms.

807
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:36,681
Maybe this time your ancestors
just worked through Henry.

808
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:46,816
He drew me this map.

809
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,239
Do you think he would've sent
me if I wasn't on your side?

810
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,553
Well, isn't this a coincidence?

811
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:18,022
[Walt] Out of my way, Walker.

812
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:19,391
[Walker] All right.

813
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:22,193
As long as you leave Gab with me.

814
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:24,904
- I can't do that.
- [Walker] Of course you can.

815
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:31,035
Look, I know we've had our differences,
but we're both just doing the same thing.

816
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,746
- No, we're not.
- [Walker] Sure, we are.

817
00:51:33,747 --> 00:51:35,740
We're looking out for our friends.

818
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,668
I'm doing right by Tyler,
who this girl shot and killed.

819
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:42,297
And you're trying to protect your pal Henry

820
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:46,001
from getting busted being her accomplice.

821
00:51:46,676 --> 00:51:48,587
I'll keep your secret.

822
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:53,091
Leave the girl with me.

823
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,810
Or what?

824
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,304
Gonna shoot us?

825
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,807
[scoffs] I'm not gonna shoot you.

826
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:03,192
He is.

827
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:06,062
- [gun cocks]
- Put the gun down, Sheriff.

828
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:31,213
And the handgun.

829
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:45,352
You don't think killing a
sheriff will catch up with you?

830
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,778
We're on the Res.

831
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:51,866
All kinds of crazy shit happens on
the Res that nobody has to pay for.

Aah!

00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,485
Gab?

837
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,656
Hey.

838
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:41,790
Where is she?

839
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:43,952
Who? Gab?

840
00:53:45,003 --> 00:53:46,170
She's gone.

841
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,423
I know that. Where did she go?

842
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,383
She hasn't gone anywhere.

843
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:51,835
She's gone.

844
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,257
As, uh... in, Gab is no longer Gab.

845
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:00,935
Who is she?

846
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,805
It's more like, "What is she?"

847
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:09,185
She's been transformed
into a red-tailed hawk.

848
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:11,814
Just now?

849
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,319
She's always been a hawk in spirit.

850
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,410
Now she's a hawk in reality.

851
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,164
Did you fire that shot?

852
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:36,220
What shot?

853
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:38,882
[Walt] Somebody just
killed a man down there.

854
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,267
Saved my life.

855
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:42,803
Gab's, too.

856
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:46,765
Good deal.

857
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:50,226
Yeah. I suppose it is.

858
00:54:57,742 --> 00:54:59,820
Are you gonna go after her?

859
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,700
There's no point.

860
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:12,165
If she's a hawk, that's
outside my jurisdiction.

[hawk screeches]

Hey. Look what I found.

Thanks. I have been
looking all over for it.

I bet.

865
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:10,682
How can I repay you?

866
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:12,768
With blood.

867
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:16,855
Hector.

868
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:37,751
So, do you want to talk about any of it?

869
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:40,886
Maybe.

870
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:42,388
Eventually.

871
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:44,466
Not now.

872
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,718
Okay.

Yep.

It's great.

Not in a long time.
