1
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,522
- Four
- Pair of jacks.

2
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:09,437
Two sevens.

3
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,120
Nothing.

4
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,917
Jacks bet.

5
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,884
Call.

6
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:23,400
Play for fifteen.

7
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,238
I'm out.

8
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,279
Call.

9
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,759
Out.

10
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,638
Bust.

11
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,838
- Five.
- Fold.

12
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,315
Deal me out.
I'll be back for the next turn.

13
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,318
Same game, five card stud.

14
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,966
But...

15
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:33,566
...when I deal, I like to start
with all fifty-two cards.

16
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:39,118
There's only one thing worse
than a crook, that's a clumsy crook.

17
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,877
Keep the money,
just give me my horse.

18
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:55,325
- You'll get your horse and a rope.
- No, hey... !

19
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:11,958
- Who was shooting?
- It turned into a hanging party.

20
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,641
- Hanging who?
- The new man, for cheating.

21
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,799
You kick a cheat out of town,
not lynch him.

22
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,237
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,521
Hey, George.
Wake up and get out here.

24
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,962
Lay still, boy. Come on.

25
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:37,884
Get him up to his room. Let me know
if he needs anything, except brains.

26
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:09,126
How come you didn't hear
when they dumped me there?

27
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,278
I sleep pretty good sometimes.

28
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,120
No questions about last night?

29
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:18,246
I knew what was gonna happen,
and it did.

30
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:42,684
They weren't just five men, they
were a mob. I tried to stop them.

31
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,917
I believe you.

32
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,875
When a gambler lets his game
wind up in a killing,

33
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,244
pretty soon he don't have a game.

34
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:05,077
You know anything about this?

35
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,726
What about you?

36
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:13,277
Was there a game downstairs
after I closed up last night?

37
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,437
Maybe you're right at that.

38
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:24,202
But I don't know, I can't swear to it.

39
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:44,198
You know, I always wanted
to bust into that glass

40
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,996
to find out what your hole card was.

41
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,396
What do you think it was?

42
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,923
Ace of diamond.

43
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:57,726
I think you had your royal flush.

44
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:03,484
So did the other man.
But he folded, so he never found out.

45
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:09,803
- Where you heading?
- Anywhere, to leave this place behind.

46
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,084
But first I got to deliver a message.

47
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,479
- Finish packing for me?
- All right.

48
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,442
- Morning, Mr Evers.
- Hello, Van.

49
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:37,077
Stoney, Mace. How are you feeling?

50
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:40,557
- Never better.
- Same. How are you?

51
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,919
I'd say come and visit me,
but I know better.

52
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:50,000
- My daughter's in, go on up.
- Thank you.

53
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:23,956
What are you doing out in the sun?
You sleep all day.

54
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,039
- I had to get up early to pack.
- Pack?

55
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:31,246
You're always coming or going.
When will you decide to stay?

56
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:35,116
People who stay have no place to go.
Where's your brother?

57
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,484
If you're going to say
goodbye again, say it.

58
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,639
- Goodbye.
- Say it properly.

59
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,480
All right... There.

60
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,878
That was one wore-out,
no-account kiss.

61
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,366
How was that?

62
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:02,361
Fine, but you wasted it.
I don't plan to come back this time.

63
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,122
It wasn't wasted.
You enjoyed it. And you'll be back.

64
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:10,075
Nora, you're the most foolish thing
in the world, a good woman.

65
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:11,566
Why foolish?

66
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:16,755
She'll push herself up against
a man till he forgets she's good.

67
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,237
- Then she expects marriage.
- How else would she end up?

68
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,524
With me she could end up
picking hay from her dress.

69
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,359
Wanna bet?

70
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,883
Don't gamble on my better instincts.
I don't have any.

71
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,039
I just have instincts.

72
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,086
Nick!

73
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:39,203
Nick! Van wants to see you.

74
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,997
Here I am. How do I look?

75
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:57,521
From up here, just about right.

76
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:07,564
You two have been fighting
each other for years.

77
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,116
What's your reason this time?

78
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:12,437
We don't need a reason.

79
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,724
I got one. I don't like him.

80
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,480
Do you think about
that card player much?

81
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,002
Just all the time.

82
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:40,796
Big mistake,
getting wound up with a gambler.

83
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:45,324
- You gamble right along with him.
- But not for a living.

84
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:49,719
What do you do for a living?
Sit around till you own the ranch?

85
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:53,516
Only half of it.
The other half will go to you.

86
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,882
Just giving you
some brotherly advice.

87
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,959
You're not worried about me,
just about yourself.

88
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:03,200
If Van was my husband,
you couldn't run him. He'd run you.

89
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,484
No way.
I've had a gutful of that from Dad.

90
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:11,846
You could get along better with Dad
if you tried. And with Van, and everybody.

91
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:15,841
Why don't they try
to get along with me?

92
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:34,042
- Hello, Van.
- Marshal.

93
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:38,246
- Any news on the hanging?
- Nothing to hang anybody with.

94
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:44,004
- I don't even know his name.
- What do you do in a case like that?

95
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,797
You bury the man,
but keep him in mind.

96
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:53,199
- You're off to Denver. Going for long?
- Depends on Denver.

97
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:58,597
- Everybody in for Denver!
- Why are you going?

98
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:03,443
In my business,
you gotta follow the play. So long.

99
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,606
All right, Charley.

100
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,321
Pair of fives. Nine.

101
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:29,276
- Fives bet.
- I'll bet ten.

102
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:33,076
From what I read,
you left Rincon too soon.

103
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,638
I don't know. That gold strike
improves nothing to damn little.

104
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,604
You'll miss the easy pickings.

105
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:44,158
There's no easy pickings
till they get it out of the ground.

106
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:48,115
There's no easy pickings
in Denver, either.

107
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,639
Ma'am.

108
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,967
- Ma.
- Fred.

109
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:50,245
There's only one kind
of people I don't like: strangers.

110
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,716
That's not a stranger,
that's progress.

111
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:57,358
Sure. They tell me he's bringing in
a long mahogany bar.

112
00:15:57,527 --> 00:16:02,726
Real long. When the front end gets here,
the rear end will still be in St Louis.

113
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,242
You stand to lose customers.

114
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,077
The ones I've been getting
I'd just as soon lose.

115
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:12,842
Whatever happens over there,
my place stays the same:

116
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:16,158
good liquor,
a few card games and no girls.

117
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:21,447
- You might lose all your customers.
- Then to hell with them.

118
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,798
My name is Jonathan Rudd.

119
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:55,324
I come from God's House,
just a little way up the street.

120
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:59,241
The House is ready for use,
to hear God's word.

121
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:02,479
If He's only got one, I'll be there.

122
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,045
First services will begin
on Sunday morning at 9 a.m.

123
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,879
You're all invited:

124
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:14,244
the drunk, the sober,
the big and little sinners,

125
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:16,557
the clean and the unwashed.

126
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:20,606
The many who'll come to scoff
and the few who'll come to pray.

127
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,564
You can count on me, Parson.

128
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:27,676
I'm the dirtiest, drunkest,
most sinful fella the Lord ever saw.

129
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:33,123
There'll be a place for you.
There was a seat for Judas.

130
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,639
Ma'am.

131
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,725
- Deal.
- Who's Judas?

132
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,878
Let's get to gambling.

133
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:56,844
O, come, sinner, come
there's room for thee

134
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:01,637
Hark, 'tis God's home

135
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:07,677
O, come and receive salvation free

136
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,886
Hark, 'tis God's home

137
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:17,121
O, come and rest, come and rest

138
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:21,439
Heavy-laden guilt oppressed

139
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:26,476
O, come and rest, come and rest

140
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,162
Hark, 'tis God's home

141
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:34,800
Amen

142
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:46,122
Well, I see
God's House is full today.

143
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:51,044
But I don't think I've started
any religious revival.

144
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,358
You came here out of curiosity,
most of you.

145
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:59,555
And your curiosity was
mainly brought on by Mr Colt.

146
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:03,720
If I hadn't fired that gun, there'd be
nobody here but me and the dog.

147
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:07,357
Before I came here,
there was nobody but the dog.

148
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:12,237
You didn't seem to think you needed
a church, just a big doghouse.

149
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:16,320
But I'm here to tell you,
you need a praying place.

150
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:22,881
You want to know why? I'll tell you why.
Because you're hell-bent for hell.

151
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,641
The Lord saw fit
to sprinkle gold here.

152
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:30,642
Man and his greed
is turning Paradise into a pigsty.

153
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,004
By day he sweats
for a pinch of yellow dust,

154
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:37,796
and at night he squanders it on lust.

155
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,039
But let's not blame our sins
on the gold.

156
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,119
There was sin here
before it was found.

157
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:47,404
Just a while ago, a man was hanged,

158
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,365
for no reason
that ever came to light.

159
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,405
Nor were his murderers
ever brought to book.

160
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,162
They walk the streets
as free as you and l.

161
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,364
But their Maker knows who they are.

162
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:05,282
They can't escape from Him,
and He will punish them.

163
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,439
Now I say to you, mend your ways.

164
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,158
Your feet are already
on the downward path.

165
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,919
Stop!

166
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,243
Before the fires below devour you.

167
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,397
Amen.

168
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,445
May God bless you all.

169
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,278
You plan to be the conscience
of this town?

170
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:04,360
- It could use one.
- Somebody elected you?

171
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:06,199
God.

172
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:10,804
And Mr Colt, first name Samuel.
Sort of biblical, isn't it?

173
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:15,805
Mr Colt votes a lot of people in.

174
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:20,279
- He also votes a lot of them out.
- You're forgetting about God.

175
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,597
Why not let God do his own work?

176
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:26,806
I'm filling in for him
till he gets around to Rincon.

177
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:34,161
Well, if either of you
needs any help...call on me.

178
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,959
Nick Evers.

179
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:05,246
Meet me here in an hour, Stoney,
and space out those drinks.

180
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,999
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:13,643
- Nora.
- Mr Hurley.

182
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:16,526
The bridle broke
going home from church.

183
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:20,362
- Dad patched it but I need a new one.
- I'll fix it in a jiffy.

184
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:23,883
Thanks. I'll be back
after I finish my trading.

185
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:28,086
Mr Hurley... What did you think
of the new preacher yesterday?

186
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:33,244
A lot more than he does of this town.
Maybe the man's right.

187
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:55,885
Fred Carson must be
keeping banking hours.

188
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:59,164
But bankers don't leave
the front doors open.

189
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:03,161
He must be in the storeroom.
I'll go see.

190
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,123
Stay out of there!
I'm going for help.

191
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:08,802
- What the hell is that?
- Looks like Stoney had an accident.

192
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:28,077
That's no accident.
He's been strangled.

193
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:52,679
George! Sit down.

194
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:00,955
That's right out of Rincon Creek.

195
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:06,440
Funny thing about gold, it doesn't look
like gold until it gets to be money.

196
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:09,679
- Have you read about Rincon?
- Paper's full of it.

197
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:14,716
If it ain't the strike, it's Fred Carson
being drowned in a flour barrel.

198
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:19,802
- Tomorrow it'll be Stoney Burough.
- What about Stoney Burough?

199
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,640
Somebody gave Stoney
a new string tie.

200
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:26,163
Only it was made of barbed wire
and a little tight.

201
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:30,475
That was some unhealthy
card party I had going.

202
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:32,558
Three men dead.

203
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:35,480
- Up to now.
- Up to now?

204
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:41,243
It looks like someone's out to kill
every man at that party.

205
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:46,117
That's a good reason to avoid Rincon,
if you planned to come back.

206
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:50,166
That's what you've come
a hundred miles to tell me?

207
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,876
- I'd have come further.
- Thanks.

208
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:59,644
But the night I got thrown out
in the street, you never did wake up.

209
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:06,396
- I'm woke up now.
- Stay awake. When do we go back?

210
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,923
Back? It's you who ought to wake up.

211
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:14,396
If a man's out to kill you,
don't let him pick the time.

212
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,559
You go to Rincon,
he'll even pick the place.

213
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:20,195
I won't know him
till he looks for me.

214
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,803
You won't know him in Rincon either,
he won't wear a sign.

215
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:29,837
But I will, and then he might just
make one bad move.

216
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:38,126
Well, I guess a man's gotta be
a damn fool once in a while.

217
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:41,279
It proves he's still alive, huh?

218
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:14,199
I've seen strikes before. They eat
a town up alive. Like a snake.

219
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,835
Before I go to Mama's, I'll clean up.

220
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:21,956
From what I hear,
up the street there is the place for it.

221
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,997
Smash your baggage, mister?

222
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:39,962
- Can you find me a room?
- Mama figured you'd be back.

223
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:43,119
You still got your old room.

224
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,998
Van!

225
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:52,166
Take the bag up to the room,
will you, George?

226
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:02,201
I heard about Fred. It wasn't easy,
walking into that storeroom.

227
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:05,122
Walking out was the hard part.

228
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:09,917
And now Stoney Burough.
Everybody's edgy, even my father.

229
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:13,318
He's putting up a reward
for Stoney's murderer.

230
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:19,483
Like he did for Fred Carson. He won't
let me go anywhere by myself.

231
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,765
And look what he makes me carry.

232
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:28,396
Well it's a sure thing
you won't kill anybody.

233
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,080
Unless you're that close.

234
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm glad you're back.
Only you didn't learn much in Denver.

235
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:41,280
You forgot some.

236
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,802
- You need a shave.
- I was about to.

237
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:47,719
Not in her place!
I'd sooner shave you myself.

238
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:51,277
It happens I also need a bath.

239
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:54,439
I can't help you there.

240
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,838
- I'll post the notices.
- Thanks, Al.

241
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,605
- Hello, Van.
- Mr Evers.

242
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,486
What do you think
of what they're doing?

243
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,399
What who's doing?

244
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:16,163
I just put up another $1 ,000
to find out, I don't know.

245
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:20,036
Tell Nick
I'll be at Mama Malone's tonight

246
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:24,166
and to bring some good
card players, he'll know who.

247
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:26,124
I'll do that.

248
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:25,046
- I thought this was a barber shop.
- What changed your mind?

249
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:27,246
You did.

250
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,639
Change it back.
It is a barber shop, and I own it.

251
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,325
I could use a shave.

252
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:47,236
If I got you for one bell,
what do I get for two?

253
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:51,116
A barber.
Hazel, this gentleman wants a shave.

254
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,676
Yes, Miss Langford.

255
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,995
Ever give any shaves yourself?

256
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:02,321
- About once every thousand faces.
- I guess I'm the wrong number.

257
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:15,324
- Good afternoon, Miss Langford.
- Afternoon, girls.

258
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:36,400
"Miscellaneous" is $20.
What's "miscellaneous"?

259
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,037
Something you didn't ask for.

260
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:43,200
- Do many people ask for it?
- It sells well.

261
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:46,079
Thank you, sir.

262
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,998
We had a seven-man poker game
that turned into a lynching party.

263
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,919
Now three are dead.

264
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:35,682
We're here to talk about
those three and us four.

265
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:40,716
I care only about one of the four
live ones, and that's me.

266
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:45,005
I care about the dead ones.
There never should've been a hanging.

267
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:49,797
Fred Carson was my friend, and
I could even stand Stoney Burough.

268
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:53,323
- Not you, though.
- You bleed too easy, Joe.

269
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:56,559
The hanged man was a cheat.
Stoney was a mean drunk.

270
00:32:56,727 --> 00:33:00,686
Carson got paid for his hand
when he weighed anything.

271
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:05,281
Anybody at this table
could be doing these killings.

272
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:10,043
- You're not drunk, so you must be crazy.
- Shut up.

273
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:12,516
How did you figure that?

274
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:17,636
About the lynching, you could call it
a partnership in a killing.

275
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:22,323
They all sit around
and start itching, these partners.

276
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:27,720
- They wonder who'll crack first.
- Who would? It'd be his hide, too.

277
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:32,119
He'd swap his life for all the others.

278
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:36,200
If I thought anybody'd do that,
I'd kill him myself.

279
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:40,883
Sure, so would you, even you,
that's what I'm talking about.

280
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:43,436
Van doesn't believe any of that.

281
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,441
He's just stirring things up,
seeing what floats to the top.

282
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:51,725
I'd say Fred and Stoney
got killed by an outsider

283
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,560
who got even for this hanging.

284
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:58,037
- Got any proof of that?
- A little.

285
00:33:58,207 --> 00:34:02,280
Do you know what I saw
in Strangers' Corner in the cemetery?

286
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:06,565
Flowers on that card cheat's grave.
Who'd do that?

287
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:10,402
- Sure not me.
- Nobody but an outsider.

288
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,956
Take it that way, then.

289
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:16,324
But this outsider,
this flower-picker,

290
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:20,765
how did he find out Fred and Stoney
were in the lynching party?

291
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:26,001
There's only one way he could
find out. From someone who knew.

292
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,284
How'd he guess
what outsider to go to?

293
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:34,237
Maybe he did a little figuring and
tracking, like I did with the flowers.

294
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:36,318
Only better.

295
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:40,366
Maybe he even saw the man
put flowers on the grave.

296
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,123
We're out to save our necks,

297
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:49,044
and right now I wouldn't give
two bits for the four of them.

298
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,959
All I know is,
I know less than when I got here.

299
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,837
Come on, Mace.

300
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:22,359
- I'm sorry you came back.
- I thought we were friends.

301
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:24,245
That's why I'm sorry.

302
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,479
Where are you going?

303
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:33,799
When I was younger,
a shave lasted a lot longer.

304
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,883
Good evening, ma'am.

305
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:18,637
- This place is closed.
- Was closed.

306
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:21,116
You just opened it.

307
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:37,316
It's 2 a.m. and the girls have gone.

308
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,365
Not all of them.
You answer to one bell?

309
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:42,961
I'm not one of the girls, Mr Morgan.

310
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:46,722
You know my name.
We meet some place before?

311
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:48,957
No. I'd have remembered.

312
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:53,166
You're very gallant for 2 a.m.
but I'm not one of the girls.

313
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:57,400
And I don't give shaves,
especially at this hour.

314
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:06,121
How about
that one face in a thousand?

315
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:10,405
The last man I liked
is three years gone.

316
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,357
That's a long time.
Want to tell me about him?

317
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:20,043
What's there to say? He was a man.

318
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,721
Well, go on.

319
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:26,675
That covered it, Mr Morgan.
He was a man.

320
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:30,725
- How'd you know who I was?
- I inquired.

321
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,684
Why?

322
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:37,682
- I wanted to know who you were.
- Same question. Why?

323
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:41,999
- You're asking a lot of questions.
- I don't often hear the truth.

324
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:48,560
I'm still waiting for an answer.
Why did you find out who I was?

325
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:51,639
You're a man,
which is no recommendation.

326
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:53,923
You're a gambler, which is less.

327
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:57,045
You think you're the best gambler
in the world.

328
00:37:57,847 --> 00:38:00,486
And that's no recommendation at all.

329
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:07,285
But like you said, three years
is a long time, a very long time.

330
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,797
That's not good enough.

331
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:14,518
All right. I like you.

332
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,998
That's better.

333
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:21,318
Sometimes the truth
is actions, not words.

334
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,440
Act!

335
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,276
That could've led to trouble
in this town.

336
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:03,766
Prevented it.

337
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,886
If I was who you're worried about,
it'd be too late. I'm Jonathan Rudd.

338
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,958
That's my church down the street.

339
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:13,563
Van Morgan.
Pretty late for a preacher, isn't it?

340
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:18,404
We don't keep hours.
Nor does Mr Poe, that's where I've been.

341
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,523
The liquor's better at Mama Malone's.

342
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:24,202
I believe you're right.
But I don't go for the liquor.

343
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:28,360
I go to get people away from it,
on Sunday mornings at least.

344
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,565
Wind must've blown the door open.

345
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:10,635
Hey, you!
Gimme a hand, quick. Come on.

346
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:16,845
Hold him while I cut him down.

347
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,925
It's Mace.

348
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:49,925
- What do you want, Dad?
- I think I'll just have some coffee.

349
00:40:57,487 --> 00:40:59,205
Thank you.

350
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,599
I think that's all I'll have, too.

351
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,718
I hate funerals.

352
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,960
Who'd want to kill Mace Jones?

353
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:25,518
Just about anybody
who ever knew him.

354
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:29,805
What would it take
to make you lose your appetite?

355
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:32,083
A bellyful.

356
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,966
Sometimes you don't seem
quite human.

357
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:39,120
More like you were made
in a factory or something.

358
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:44,803
If I was made by a machine
then you made it and you ran it.

359
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,959
Stop it, both of you. Just once!

360
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:54,399
Now to the sin ofmurder
we must add sacrilege.

361
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,446
Since coming to this town,
I've sadly had to perform

362
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:02,122
the burial of three men
who have died violently.

363
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:06,405
For the hand that slew
Fred Carson and Stoney Burough,

364
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:08,637
I sought the Lord's forgiveness.

365
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:14,078
But for the limitless evil
of him who slew Mace Jones,

366
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:19,480
I ask for limitless punishment for
he took a man's life in God's House.

367
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:24,641
Let us pray, therefore, that heaven
receives the soul of Mace Jones,

368
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:29,597
and that the soul of his killer
wander the darkness for ever.

369
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,681
All men being sinful and Thou just,

370
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:36,556
I pray You regard any score
against Mace Jones as even.

371
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:40,163
Strike it from Thy books
and let him sleep. Amen.

372
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:42,557
Amen.

373
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,366
I didn't hear you praying,
Little George.

374
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:48,599
You never will, either.
I don't believe in it.

375
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,358
Hey, George.

376
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:21,805
Van called the last meeting,
I am calling this one,

377
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,401
while we're still alive to meet.

378
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:27,639
We've paid for that hanging
three times.

379
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:32,597
We've paid for it all right.
But anybody notice how?

380
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,087
Three times
by some kind of strangling.

381
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:39,125
Stoney with wire, Fred smothered,
Mace got the rope.

382
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:44,042
All three of them strangled.
Which brings to mind what?

383
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:48,559
The way the card cheat died.

384
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:51,446
I still say
it's the work of an outsider

385
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:55,805
getting even for the card cheat
and an insider telling him who did it.

386
00:43:55,967 --> 00:44:00,995
I don't know why it didn't hit me before
but it sure as hell hits me now.

387
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:07,197
We want the man, but we've never
looked up from the card table.

388
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,120
Well, I am looking up now.

389
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:15,282
And right at me, huh?

390
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,962
If George was going to talk,
he'd talk to the Marshal.

391
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:23,803
He'd talk where it'd do the most good,
where we wouldn't find out.

392
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:27,039
Why?
What good would it do George?

393
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:31,917
You think George likes you, Joe?
He don't like nobody.

394
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:37,844
You're the one who found that man
and told him about the card game.

395
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:42,076
Now you just tell us who he is.

396
00:44:43,087 --> 00:44:45,920
I got no use for lynchers.

397
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:49,238
They ought to get
the same thing they give out.

398
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:52,399
And if I needed any killing done,
I'd do it myself.

399
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:55,556
But you're right about one thing.

400
00:44:56,247 --> 00:45:01,116
I don't cotton to most people.
Least of all to you.

401
00:45:03,087 --> 00:45:04,839
Why, you... !

402
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:28,719
There's a right place to stop.

403
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't know if Nick is right,

404
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:39,477
but you'd best keep
your back to the wall.

405
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:43,401
And Van had better sit
right alongside him.

406
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:49,199
'Cause if I'm wrong about George,
I just might be right about him.

407
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:28,605
Everybody ought to have somebody
to say goodbye. Even you, Mace.

408
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:04,199
That sermon over Mace, you take it
hard that he died in your church.

409
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,916
My church?
I don't own it, I just look after it.

410
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:14,005
That night, how long were you out
before the bell rang?

411
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:17,284
I told Marshal Dana.
Why don't you ask him?

412
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:19,802
I'd like to hear it from you.

413
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,802
I went up to Poe's, as I said.
I saw you on the way back.

414
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:28,084
I was gone maybe an hour.

415
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:34,436
Even if you talked some, that's a long
time. Poe's is only 1 00 yards away.

416
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:37,405
Suppose I said I like to walk at night.

417
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:41,446
Suppose I said that's what I was doing.
You believe me?

418
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:43,518
No reason not to.

419
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:48,078
I'm glad you take my word for it,
because that's what I was doing.

420
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:52,320
What kind of man murders
in a church?

421
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:57,686
The kind that doesn't believe in God,
the kind that God doesn't scare.

422
00:48:57,847 --> 00:49:00,805
No killer is scared of God, Mr Rudd.

423
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:05,563
In a church, in an alley
or behind a rock.

424
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,203
Watch this, sweetheart.

425
00:49:32,247 --> 00:49:34,124
Left hand.

426
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:41,800
Men talk about guns
like they're women.

427
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:46,119
"She's a beauty", they say.
What's beautiful about a gun?

428
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:51,486
If you were going to do a man in,
what weapon would you use?

429
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:55,959
- It wouldn't be a gun.
- I'll bet it wouldn't.

430
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:10,044
If he was after us, we'd be dead.

431
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:36,563
"The wicked flee
where no man pursueth."

432
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:40,163
"The righteous don't flee,
they stand like a lion."

433
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:44,957
Yes, ma'am. That's the right quote.
Where'd you learn about the Bible?

434
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:48,085
Where'd a preacher
learn how to shoot?

435
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:53,480
Every preacher was something else
before he became a preacher.

436
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:10,244
You know, I'm tired of shooting
at tin cans and bottles.

437
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:13,001
We still have some cartridges left.

438
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:17,877
We're not going to shoot
each other, are we? How about...?

439
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:27,197
Six out of six.
Can't do better than that.

440
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:35,520
- You can only do worse.
- My shooting was way off.

441
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:41,284
- Way off? Six out of six?
- I was aiming at the spaces.

442
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:51,243
See you in church.

443
00:51:57,607 --> 00:52:02,522
If every preacher was something else
first, I wonder what he was.

444
00:52:03,327 --> 00:52:06,842
Everybody was something
else first, even me.

445
00:52:07,927 --> 00:52:10,680
I don't know what you are now.

446
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:14,078
You don't need that gun to find out.

447
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:18,199
But maybe I need one.

448
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:29,236
Sam! I'll bank the fire. Go on home.

449
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:34,117
- Only one rig left? I'll take care of it.
- OK, Joe.

450
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:49,118
Are you still stewing
about Mace Jones?

451
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:53,758
Stewing about how I sit down
to a drink and play some cards,

452
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,725
and how I get up and hang a man.

453
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,879
Being drunk is a poor excuse.

454
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:03,323
You weren't drinking very much,
what's your excuse?

455
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:06,479
I don't lean on excuses.

456
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:09,480
Whiskey or no whiskey,
you went along.

457
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:14,996
- With you leading.
- That makes you a sheep.

458
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:18,637
A drunk sheep maybe,
but all the same.

459
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:23,961
- You were with us on that rope.
- Three men on that rope are dead.

460
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:28,086
You don't give a damn
about anybody except yourself.

461
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:35,000
When I was ten, eleven...

462
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:37,604
...my mother died.

463
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:45,285
They laid her out in the parlour and
my old man took me in to see her.

464
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:48,564
She wasn't my mother any more.

465
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:52,197
She was something busted.

466
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:55,564
She was something
that wouldn't run any more.

467
00:53:58,247 --> 00:54:01,364
My old man was crying...

468
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:03,995
...but not me.

469
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:09,685
He looked up and he said,
"Where's your heart, boy?"

470
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:12,645
I didn't say anything.

471
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:16,004
So he slapped me
right across the mouth.

472
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:20,205
I still didn't say anything.

473
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,686
So...

474
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:25,998
...he took me out, back of the barn,

475
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:29,762
and he beat the hell out of me.

476
00:54:33,127 --> 00:54:35,721
But he never drew a tear.

477
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:40,515
I think your mother was
as dead as you.

478
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:43,121
If I am dead...

479
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:46,085
...the same man killed me.

480
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:48,442
Name of Sig Evers.

481
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:21,963
Bring a glass for your friend.
I think he'll need it.

482
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:25,563
- He won't drink with you.
- Bring the glass.

483
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:36,599
Now it's reserved
for just you and me.

484
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:41,716
That's right.
These are unlucky chairs.

485
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:46,757
Are you afraid to sit down?

486
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:20,036
You sure know where to find them.

487
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:24,086
Mace Jones in the church,
Joe Hurley in the stable.

488
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:27,717
Meaning that I could've killed
both of them.

489
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:32,677
So could you. Trouble is,
so could any other man in town.

490
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:40,606
Any one of those four guys
could've blabbed to the killer.

491
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:44,476
My guess, though,
is that it's the first, Fred Carson.

492
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:47,806
Why Carson?

493
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:52,518
Figure like the killer. First,
you get the names of everybody.

494
00:59:52,687 --> 00:59:56,123
Then you kill the guy
who gave them to you.

495
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,926
You sure want him out of the way.

496
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:03,080
You're pretty good at that,
figuring like the killer.

497
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:14,158
- Finish your drink.
- You have to start it to finish it.

498
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:34,597
That's what this meeting's about.

499
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:39,045
You're head of the Miners'
Association, so act like it.

500
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:41,641
Tell the Marshal
to stop these killings.

501
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:44,844
- No miner has been hurt.
- Not so far.

502
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:49,046
It takes two hands to pan for gold,
and you can't shoot with your teeth.

503
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:52,483
- We gotta have protection.
- All right.

504
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:56,435
- I'll see what I can do.
- All right.

505
01:00:57,607 --> 01:01:01,077
- I'm doing what I can.
- We've had killings before.

506
01:01:01,247 --> 01:01:05,035
But out in the open,
and we could deal with them.

507
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:08,722
This don't make sense,
and anyone can be next.

508
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:11,845
When we had two dead,
I put up $2,000.

509
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:15,124
Now we got four dead,
I'll put up $4,000.

510
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:17,403
A thousand a head, $4,000.

511
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:21,719
That's more than you make digging
gold. I don't see anyone claiming it.

512
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,924
We're here to ask
what you're doing about it.

513
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:29,082
I'm just a plain town marshal.

514
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:31,920
I'm not a Pinkerton detective.

515
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:35,159
I've got one deputy to help me out.

516
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:38,763
And Otis and me,
we can't cover the ground.

517
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:43,478
You can put up $1 ,000 an hour,
it won't give us more eyes and ears.

518
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:46,207
We need more tin stars, not rewards.

519
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,838
Any one of you can be sworn in.
If you find anyone else, send them in.

520
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:55,436
If you make everyone a deputy,
you'll be swearing in the killer.

521
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:59,839
I don't want any star.
But I am serving notice.

522
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:06,765
I'm wearing my gun tied down, and
if I have to, I am going to use it.

523
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:11,205
A man'd be a fool not to wear a gun
and a bigger fool to use it too fast.

524
01:02:11,367 --> 01:02:16,361
Someone who meant no harm could
die reaching for a chew of tobacco.

525
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:21,647
You listen to Nick Evers and Rincon
will have more dead than Gettysburg.

526
01:02:22,247 --> 01:02:23,760
I'll tell you this:

527
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:27,966
I can't control the miners much longer,
they're rounding up hotheads.

528
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:33,599
Either you do something or they will,
and I can't say I blame them.

529
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,565
Nick says wear your gun
and use it fast.

530
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:39,560
Mr Morgan says wear it
and use it slow.

531
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:43,402
I say don't wear it
and you won't use it at all.

532
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:46,206
- Do you wear a gun?
- Yes.

533
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:49,882
But I'll leave it at home
if everyone else does, too.

534
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,286
And end up
hanging by your bell-rope?

535
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:55,278
Well...

536
01:02:55,447 --> 01:02:59,884
I could tell you to pray, but I don't
believe the killer answers to prayer.

537
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:05,475
I'll remind you of another thing:
all four dead men were wearing guns.

538
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,558
The guns didn't save them.

539
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:12,755
Can I ask you a question?
Why does a preacher put on a gun?

540
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,680
People get funny ideas
about a preacher.

541
01:03:15,847 --> 01:03:20,716
That when he starts pounding a Bible
he stops being a man. That's not so.

542
01:03:20,887 --> 01:03:25,199
But the Book doesn't say
a man can't make himself better.

543
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:28,040
So I say, leave the guns at home.

544
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:29,799
Marshal.

545
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:52,236
I hate to go in there.

546
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:57,236
Just stay away
from the flour barrels.

547
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:00,205
Are you still mad at me, Nick?

548
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,358
Not you, the world.

549
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:04,600
The world?

550
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:07,320
It's flat.

551
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:34,167
- Be with you quick as I can.
- Take your time, Mrs Wells.

552
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:37,080
This will make beautiful underwear.

553
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:40,000
The Chicago people say
it's from Switzerland.

554
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,557
Seems a shame to cover it up.

555
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:47,561
It won't be covered up
all the time, will it?

556
01:04:47,727 --> 01:04:52,005
I mean, you gotta hang it
on a line some time.

557
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:58,561
You're making this young lady blush.
Did the ribbons and elastic come?

558
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:03,323
I'll look in the storeroom,
I ain't unpacked everything yet.

559
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:14,916
- Why did you think I was blushing?
- At your age I did.

560
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:17,726
Someone like you, l...

561
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:22,320
- You belong in the storeroom.
- Why?

562
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:27,515
You were about to say women
like me always wore black lace.

563
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:33,567
Yes. How else can men tell...
who they're with?

564
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:39,643
They can tell long before
they get to the underwear.

565
01:05:39,807 --> 01:05:43,243
The last thing I expected
was to like you.

566
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:46,956
Thanks. Women usually
don't like women who like men.

567
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:48,799
Here it is.

568
01:05:50,567 --> 01:05:54,003
I'll wrap it for you in a jiffy,
Miss Langford.

569
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:59,400
- I hope I'm not keeping you.
- No hurry, I'm getting an education.

570
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:03,405
Hey, mister.

571
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:08,637
- Say, aren't you Nick Evers?
- Yeah.

572
01:06:08,807 --> 01:06:12,686
I hear you said every man
should keep his gun handy.

573
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:17,125
- That's right.
- I agree. Handy means handy.

574
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:21,038
- Yeah.
- Come on.

575
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:27,643
What's been done, huh?
Not a damn thing.

576
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:31,959
- I say we put in a new marshal.
- Right.

577
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:35,597
If we don't do something,
no one will.

578
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:41,926
- Looking for someone?
- Making sure nobody's looking for me.

579
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:44,840
Stop waving that around. Put it away.

580
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:47,475
Make this town safe
and you can have it.

581
01:06:47,647 --> 01:06:50,559
You're making it unsafe.
I'll take the gun.

582
01:06:50,727 --> 01:06:52,126
Oh, no.

583
01:06:58,127 --> 01:07:04,123
- What would you do if I gave it back?
- I'd load it right back up again.

584
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:11,363
- Try with that.
- That ain't gonna stop me.

585
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,360
- I'll get another one.
- You got another.

586
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:19,797
- Drop it or I'll throw you in jail.
- No.

587
01:07:19,967 --> 01:07:23,004
- You heard me. Hand it over.
- No.

588
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:37,165
Stop it, you crazy fools.

589
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:40,277
Get down.

590
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:11,517
I don't care what side you're on,
don't take it here.

591
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,360
All you can shoot off is your mouth.

592
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:29,281
I can't cover the side
of the street from here.

593
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:36,601
Van, don't!

594
01:08:36,767 --> 01:08:40,601
- They'll kill him.
- If you can't stand it, don't watch.

595
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:56,557
I'm glad you didn't listen to yourself
and leave that home.

596
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:08,677
Sounds like the war is over,
and without me, too.

597
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:12,920
Every player has his way of going.
Some raise, some call...

598
01:10:13,087 --> 01:10:15,885
...some just pass.

599
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:22,760
I owe you something.
Say it and you got it.

600
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:27,318
Come to God's House
every Sunday for a month.

601
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,682
That's a steep price for just my life.

602
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:41,404
- Miss Langford, meet...
- We've met.

603
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,684
At the window.
We were looking at the same goods.

604
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:48,726
She means you.
We were afraid you'd get shot.

605
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:52,846
- Looks like I could still get shot.
- Not by me.

606
01:10:53,007 --> 01:10:55,043
I've been put out enough to do it.

607
01:10:55,847 --> 01:11:01,399
You're both lying.
You could. But you couldn't.

608
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:04,604
He thinks he knows about women.

609
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:13,718
You don't, do you?
Oh, about one little thing, maybe.

610
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:27,200
How's Al?

611
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,439
He isn't cold,
but he won't be warm for a while.

612
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:33,201
I'm going to move him to my place.

613
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:38,202
So now we've got a dead deputy
and a shot-up marshal.

614
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,597
That ain't much law.

615
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:43,122
AI knows it all right.

616
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:46,324
He said for you
to get help from Denver.

617
01:11:46,487 --> 01:11:48,955
All right, I'll take the next stage out.

618
01:11:49,127 --> 01:11:51,595
But we need some tin
showing around here.

619
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:53,917
Is AI up to swearing in
some deputies?

620
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:59,400
- He can do that, but not much more.
- Anyone want to volunteer?

621
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:03,685
We can't ask you, Mr Rudd,
but Van, we could use your help.

622
01:12:03,847 --> 01:12:07,157
I don't think so, a gambler with a star?

623
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:12,242
Some folks think no gambler is honest,
they'd call it a stealing badge.

624
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:15,800
You know why they might say that?

625
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:20,085
Because men once gambled
for the clothes of Christ.

626
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:51,280
Putting flowers
on your brother's grave.

627
01:12:52,287 --> 01:12:55,085
That's what finally
gave you away to me.

628
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:57,477
Lucky the right man
happened to see me.

629
01:12:57,647 --> 01:13:00,684
It didn't just happen.
I made it happen.

630
01:13:00,847 --> 01:13:05,796
I was looking for the man
who was looking for me, you.

631
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:09,004
Somebody who'd talk.
You saved me a long hunt.

632
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:13,119
What were you doing
in that street this afternoon?

633
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:16,600
You're not here to stop killing,
but to kill.

634
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,962
I'm particular about who gets killed.

635
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:24,641
It would've been odd,
you getting yours out there today.

636
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:26,604
All right, who's next?

637
01:13:28,207 --> 01:13:30,880
George, bartender at Mama Malone's.

638
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:35,245
- He was in the card game?
- It was after hours, why not?

639
01:13:35,407 --> 01:13:39,639
- He was in the hanging party?
- Right up front.

640
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:42,526
Bartender George, that makes five.

641
01:13:42,687 --> 01:13:45,406
You make six,
my brother makes seven.

642
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:48,001
How many more were in that game?

643
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:52,365
- Just one.
- And when do I get that name?

644
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:55,280
- After you settle with George.
- I see.

645
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,564
One at a time all the way, that's it?

646
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:00,524
That's it.

647
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:03,918
This name you're keeping back.
Why save him for last?

648
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,523
He led the hanging.

649
01:14:06,687 --> 01:14:10,885
When I tried to stop him,
he used a gun butt on me.

650
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:16,246
He's last because I want him to die
once for every man in that game,

651
01:14:16,407 --> 01:14:18,443
and once for himself.

652
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:23,155
Besides,
he'll be the toughest to take out.

653
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:27,798
Wouldn't like you hurt
before your job is done.

654
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:32,917
I killed those men
because they killed my brother.

655
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:37,603
What about you?
Why did you want them dead?

656
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:43,000
Because they were alive
and I didn't want to be dead.

657
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:46,045
Any one of them could've found you.

658
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:49,358
They could be doing to me
what I'm doing to them.

659
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:52,883
I see. "Do unto others."

660
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:55,356
I've got just one rule:

661
01:14:55,527 --> 01:14:58,644
me first, nobody second.

662
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:05,720
Name me somebody
who don't feel that way.

663
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:37,438
You had to do it,
if you're to keep up with Poe.

664
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:42,078
They say competition's the life
of trade. It'll be the death of me.

665
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:45,842
Don't complain,
it's closing time and we're still full.

666
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:49,556
You'd better turn in so you can
clean up this mess in the morning.

667
01:15:49,727 --> 01:15:51,877
That is if you can sleep
for the racket.

668
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:56,882
I was born in a bass drum
and raised in a brass horn.

669
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:20,244
George!

670
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:24,764
Get up! Get out here
and clean up this sinkhole!

671
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:33,126
Oh, my God!

672
01:18:44,727 --> 01:18:48,402
Pete, get someone
from the Marshal's office, quick.

673
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:53,163
- What for?
- Just get him. George's room.

674
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,565
Stand you for a cup of coffee.

675
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:04,598
- What's the matter?
- It's George.

676
01:19:04,767 --> 01:19:09,318
I found him dead when
I opened up this morning.

677
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:29,163
- Pete, will you get Dr Cooper?
- Yes, sir.

678
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,718
Somebody shot a hole
right through George's gut.

679
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:41,077
Must've been from close up.
There's powder burns on his vest.

680
01:19:41,247 --> 01:19:44,319
What bastard would do
a thing like that?

681
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:46,557
He was a mean one.

682
01:19:46,727 --> 01:19:51,118
Who'd shoot a man that
was begging for his life?

683
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:56,600
He was no beggar. He wouldn't have
said "please" to live 1 ,000 years.

684
01:19:56,767 --> 01:20:00,965
It sure looks like he's begging,
with his hands like that.

685
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:05,325
Or maybe praying,
which comes to the same.

686
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:07,079
Praying?

687
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:10,682
Not George.

688
01:20:57,447 --> 01:21:02,043
The man they dug that one for
ought to be buried over there.

689
01:21:02,207 --> 01:21:06,917
- In Strangers' Corner.
- George was no stranger to you.

690
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:12,957
- He sure was a strange colour.
- We all look alike to the worms.

691
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:21,357
I took you for a fool.
I made a mistake.

692
01:21:21,527 --> 01:21:25,566
Big mistake. Forty-five calibre.

693
01:21:25,727 --> 01:21:28,844
There had to be trouble
before I got the last name.

694
01:21:29,007 --> 01:21:33,000
Sure, once you got it,
you'd kill me before you killed him.

695
01:21:33,687 --> 01:21:40,525
- So instead you're going to kill me.
- It's bite or get bit, Reverend.

696
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,076
And I'm biting.

697
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:47,923
There's one thing you forgot.
Who'll take care of the last man?

698
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:52,842
- Van Morgan will be my pleasure.
- Van Morgan.

699
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:59,196
I've had to believe you. But I don't
believe you tried to stop that hanging.

700
01:21:59,367 --> 01:22:03,758
Stop it? Hell, I led it,
just like I've been leading you.

701
01:22:04,407 --> 01:22:08,366
Any last wish?
Would you like a smoke?

702
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:10,916
Would you like to say a prayer?

703
01:22:11,087 --> 01:22:14,557
I would like to pray.
Not for myself, for my brother.

704
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:16,604
Go ahead.

705
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:20,840
If you can find one
to fit that card cheat.

706
01:22:21,007 --> 01:22:26,001
Oh...but first, get rid of the gun.

707
01:22:49,967 --> 01:22:55,041
Unknown,
found hanged March 1 , 1 880.

708
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:58,995
It said that in the papers, too.
Did you know that?

709
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,486
Get praying.

710
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:05,879
This man was lynched in Rincon,
Colorado, that's what it said.

711
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:10,359
- Then it said what he looked like.
- He looked like every second man.

712
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:14,839
Height, weight, colour of eyes, hair.

713
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:17,362
That's not what brought me
here, though.

714
01:23:17,527 --> 01:23:20,200
Marshall Dana wrote something else.

715
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:25,805
Old knife scar, right shoulder.
That made it Frankie Red.

716
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:31,398
Well, Frankie. I guess they didn't
bury you with any gospel.

717
01:23:31,567 --> 01:23:37,085
I'll try to make it up to you now.
This might be good for you, too.

718
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:41,957
Oh, come on,
Frankie's waiting for you in hell.

719
01:23:42,127 --> 01:23:44,482
I just had a thought.

720
01:23:44,647 --> 01:23:48,925
When they find you, my old man
will offer another thousand.

721
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:51,885
Only this time it'll be for me.

722
01:23:54,727 --> 01:23:56,797
- Here it is.
- Come on.

723
01:23:56,967 --> 01:24:00,323
Something for you...from the Book.

724
01:24:45,407 --> 01:24:48,080
"'Vengeance is mine,'
sayeth the Lord."

725
01:24:48,247 --> 01:24:52,399
But this day I am the Lord,
and I repay.

726
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:17,157
I sure wouldn't want your job.

727
01:25:34,687 --> 01:25:38,521
I heard about George, Van. I'm sorry.

728
01:25:38,687 --> 01:25:44,159
But we've got two US marshals coming
in a week. Anything else happen?

729
01:25:44,327 --> 01:25:49,560
I've got some real bad news
for you, Mr Evers. The worst.

730
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:53,322
But I don't like to tell you
on a street corner.

731
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:56,285
I think you just told me, it's...

732
01:25:58,047 --> 01:26:01,244
- It's Nick, isn't it?
- He was shot.

733
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:07,401
- Nick's dead?
- Yes, honey.

734
01:26:14,287 --> 01:26:18,519
- Where is he?
- Over at Doc's house.

735
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:22,038
Come on, honey.

736
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:52,120
I talked to Mr Evers
before he went home.

737
01:26:52,287 --> 01:26:54,517
He'd like you at his son's funeral.

738
01:26:54,687 --> 01:27:00,444
- I'll see him at the graveyard.
- The burial's gonna be at the ranch.

739
01:27:00,607 --> 01:27:05,522
I'm taking the casket out there now,
the family asked me to.

740
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:09,999
If you'd like to ride along with me,
you're welcome.

741
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:16,078
I'll go by myself later on.
Catch up with you, maybe.

742
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:35,799
One for you, Nick.

743
01:27:35,967 --> 01:27:37,844
Stoney.

744
01:27:38,007 --> 01:27:40,601
Tinhorn.

745
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:43,361
Carson, Mace, Hurley.

746
01:27:43,527 --> 01:27:45,165
And me.

747
01:27:59,727 --> 01:28:01,399
I hope you win.

748
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:05,799
Can't miss.
I'm playing with six dead men.

749
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:12,243
Where are you going?

750
01:28:12,407 --> 01:28:15,922
For a horseback ride.
Wanna do me a favour, Mama?

751
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:17,679
Depends.

752
01:28:17,847 --> 01:28:22,716
If I'm not back by dark,
will you flip that last chair up?

753
01:28:22,887 --> 01:28:27,165
- What if you do get back?
- We'll sit down and play some cards.

754
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:31,442
About time. If a man don't work,
he ain't respectable.

755
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:15,519
- Mr Rudd.
- Mr Morgan.

756
01:30:24,607 --> 01:30:30,557
Last time I came to the Evers ranch,
I thought Nick was a lucky man.

757
01:30:30,727 --> 01:30:34,481
"For every beast of the forest
is mine."

758
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:39,281
You've preached a lot of funerals
lately. Got anything new?

759
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:42,156
The funeral's for the living.

760
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:46,161
I'll say that he was a good son
and brother,

761
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:48,318
a loyal friend and a good citizen.

762
01:30:49,127 --> 01:30:52,358
- Won't you gag on all that?
- Why should l?

763
01:30:53,087 --> 01:30:57,763
I'm a gambler, and I don't always
bank on my cards or I'd be broke.

764
01:30:57,927 --> 01:30:59,838
Like your opponents.

765
01:31:00,007 --> 01:31:03,841
Every once in a while,
something comes out of the air,

766
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:06,885
and says something in your ear.

767
01:31:07,047 --> 01:31:10,881
- An hour ago it landed.
- What did it say?

768
01:31:11,047 --> 01:31:13,845
It said, "This is it, play it."

769
01:31:14,967 --> 01:31:17,322
Well, then, play it.

770
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:21,444
You're the killer of Nick Evers
and all the rest.

771
01:31:22,047 --> 01:31:26,962
Make that executioner,
of the criminals who killed my brother.

772
01:31:27,127 --> 01:31:32,645
They hanged him for just
some fast work with some cards.

773
01:31:32,807 --> 01:31:34,763
George wasn't in the game.

774
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:38,763
Nick Evers swore
he held that rope and so did you.

775
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:42,317
George wasn't there,
and neither was l.

776
01:31:42,487 --> 01:31:44,682
So Nick was the one who talked.

777
01:31:44,847 --> 01:31:50,160
Looking back, he was due to go bad.
I thought he was too smart to get killed.

778
01:31:50,727 --> 01:31:53,241
Nobody's too smart for that,
not even you.

779
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:55,398
And not even you, Mr Rudd.

780
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:59,799
You left George for dead, but he lived
to say something with his hands.

781
01:31:59,967 --> 01:32:04,995
It didn't come to me till you turned
that last chair over at the card table.

782
01:32:05,167 --> 01:32:08,318
George wasn't praying,
he wasn't begging.

783
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:12,878
He was trying to show
who killed him, a man who prayed.

784
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:17,199
You won't be reading over Nick
'cause I'm taking you in.

785
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,559
There'll be no trouble,
Mr Morgan. But...

786
01:32:23,087 --> 01:32:28,400
...if you don't mind, first I'd like
to read the rest of that psalm...

787
01:32:30,447 --> 01:32:34,565
...about the thousand hills.

788
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:38,884
Well, read.
Or can't you read upside down?

789
01:32:40,407 --> 01:32:44,605
If that's a Bible, read it.
If not, drop it.

790
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:50,157
Mr Rudd's the man we've been
looking for, Mr Evers, the killer.

791
01:33:50,327 --> 01:33:53,683
Of Nick, too? But why?

792
01:33:55,927 --> 01:34:00,523
I don't know about the others, but
I think Nick got onto him like I did.

793
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:44,886
I won't see your father again,
so would you say "so long" for me?

794
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:49,563
I will, Van. But I don't think
he'll ever get over Nick.

795
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:53,640
- You'd better, though.
- I'll try.

796
01:34:53,807 --> 01:35:00,201
But it's not like a bullet.
A bullet kills you or you heal up.

797
01:35:05,087 --> 01:35:09,239
- It's the first time you didn't say it.
- Say what?

798
01:35:09,407 --> 01:35:12,080
That I'd be back.

799
01:35:12,247 --> 01:35:15,523
That's right. Do you know why?

800
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:19,644
'Cause you don't give a damn
any more.

801
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:24,835
I do. But this is the first time
I haven't been sure you'll be back.

802
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:32,884
Cards, dice and anything else,
you're never sure of it.

803
01:35:34,247 --> 01:35:39,560
One thing is:
I give a damn about you.

804
01:35:39,727 --> 01:35:41,877
A big damn.

805
01:36:17,287 --> 01:36:21,200
Strange about Rudd.
He could've kept this place going.

806
01:36:21,727 --> 01:36:24,639
So what was he
before he was a preacher?

807
01:36:24,807 --> 01:36:27,560
Maybe he always was a preacher.

808
01:36:27,727 --> 01:36:32,323
Lily, I'll see you in Denver
in about a week, you know where.

809
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:35,718
If I'm not coming,
I'll send you a four-flush.

810
01:36:35,887 --> 01:36:38,879
Why must you be
the first to say goodbye?

811
01:36:39,047 --> 01:36:42,244
I don't know if this is goodbye.

812
01:36:42,807 --> 01:36:46,197
I'm used to the truth from you,
a yes or a no.

813
01:36:46,847 --> 01:36:50,157
This time the truth is maybe.

814
01:37:06,647 --> 01:37:10,879
Give me a kiss.
That'll last me a week.

815
01:37:11,047 --> 01:37:15,563
- What if you don't show up?
- That'll mean the kiss wore off.

816
01:37:33,727 --> 01:37:37,003
If you're not made of iron,
I'll see you in Denver.

817
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:40,159
You sure didn't feel like iron.
