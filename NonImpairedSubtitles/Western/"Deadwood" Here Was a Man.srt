<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

2
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,207
I raise 100.

3
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,274
Back 100.

4
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,040
That man's overplaying
His hand.

5
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:21,740
All right.

6
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,673
Whatever the fuck
I got left.

7
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,608
420 back to you.

8
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:45,974
( chuckling )
As advertised,

9
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:48,773
You got more nerve
Than sense, huh, bill?

10
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,707
What have you got?

11
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:55,074
The man stays
On fours.

12
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:57,541
And they call this
A game of skill?

13
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,207
Well, you got me,
Didn't you, bill?

14
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,807
You son of a bitch!

15
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,407
You were told
About that talk.

16
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,673
Go eat, jack.

17
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,074
All right.

18
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:26,574
I thank you
For that kindness.

19
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:30,274
You just bought yourself
Something with that.

20
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:39,007
Some boys can't go near
A cliff without jumping off.

21
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,341
20 to the dealer.

22
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,007
Much appreciated.

23
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,940
Any ideas
For the rest?

24
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:54,141
I believe
I'll stay with cash.

25
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,174
( hammering )

26
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,707
( dogs barking )

27
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,407
Montana.

28
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:20,307
No rest for
The wicked.

29
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:22,574
Well, what are
You doing up?

30
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,040
Well, it's cooler working now. Quieter.

31
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,541
Sorry you had
To listen to them

32
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,707
Drunken fools before,
Mr. Hickok.

33
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:32,007
When you and mr. Utter
Was helping us?

34
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:38,508
I come through unharmed.

35
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:41,508
And bill would be
Easier on my nerves.

36
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,707
Mr. Hickok makes me look
For the warrant in your hand.

37
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:48,974
All right.

38
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:56,107
Montana okay
With you?

39
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:01,640
The only other nickname
I ever had was sloth.

40
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,107
Don't seem to fit.

41
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,374
Choice was among
The seven sins.

42
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,040
I guess I got out before
The others surfaced.

43
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,040
Camp looks
Like a good bet.

44
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,608
My wife and boy are with
Their people in michigan.

45
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:26,341
I hope I can
Bring 'em out soon.

46
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:30,341
They'll get the sioux
Making peace.

47
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,274
Pretty quick you'll
Have laws here

48
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,141
And every other
Damn thing.

49
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,441
I'll just settle
For property rights.

50
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,574
Will ya?

51
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,740
I'm recently
Married myself.

52
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,074
Is that so?

53
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:52,141
The missus
Operates a circus.

54
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,974
She's in cincinnati

55
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,341
Waiting for word
Of my success.

56
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,974
Sol and I put our last
Sifting cradle aside for you.

57
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:07,107
Why don't you go ahead
And use it, bill?

58
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:10,174
What slows me down
Is thinking about

59
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,541
Freezing my balls off
In a creek.

60
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,241
Or the cocksuckers i'd would
Lose the gold to at poker.

61
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,807
I'm flat out tired.

62
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Turn in.

63
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,508
I got her covered.

64
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,574
I believe I will.

65
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,074
Good night, montana.

66
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,740
Good night, bill.

67
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,374
My pop
Called me "kite."

68
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,241
( door opening )

69
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,374
I was supposed to leave for
Cheyenne two damn hours ago!

70
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,407
What kept you,
Charlie?

71
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,541
You don't fuckin' sleep!

72
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,074
I don't know what in the fuck
Is happening to you, bill.

73
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,007
So you stayed in camp
To tuck me in?

74
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,374
If you don't
Want to prospect,

75
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:37,007
I could put you in charge of
That mail route i'm gettin'.

76
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,341
I'm doing
What I wanna do.

77
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,241
Bullshit!

78
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,673
Some goddamned time,

79
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:45,874
A man's due to stop
Arguing with hisself,

80
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:49,740
Feeling he's twice the
Goddamned fool he knows he is

81
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,640
Because he can't
Be something

82
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,407
He tries to be every
Goddamned day without once

83
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,673
Getting to dinnertime
And not fucking it up.

84
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,274
I don't wanna
Fight it no more.

85
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:06,174
Understand me,
Charlie?

86
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:09,740
And I don't want you
Pissing in my ear about it.

87
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:15,874
Can you let me go to hell
The way I want to?

88
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,407
Yeah.

89
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,907
I can do that.

90
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,007
Good luck
In cheyenne.

91
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:44,840
Good luck to you,
Too, bill.

92
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,740
You know me, al.

93
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,341
I don't scrutinize
Or second-guess.

94
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,341
( chuckles )

95
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,441
If you wanted
To explain

96
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,840
Why i'm to buy the dude
Out of a worthless claim,

97
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,407
- i'd surely listen.
- jesus christ.

98
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,541
What is it?

99
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,207
The dude must've had
Some kind of accident.

100
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,141
E.b.:
My word.

101
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,940
- looks dead, don't he?
- yes.

102
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,241
Al: see, my reasoning was,
Get the dude his money back,

103
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,508
Keep him from asking
In the pinkertons.

104
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:35,007
Well, appears now
That's unnecessary.

105
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:38,274
Make the offer
To the wife.

106
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,107
( knocking at door )

107
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:56,874
( knocking continues )

108
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,574
E.b.:
Al, once that dope-fiend

109
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:15,773
Throws her skirts over her head
And hightails back to new york,

110
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:18,807
You think she'll give one wet fart
About what happened at this camp?

111
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:21,207
Let alone send
The pinkertons out.

112
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,207
And 20,000's
A lot of money.

113
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:28,374
Let me tell you,
Several things, e.b.

114
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:31,840
First, $20,000
Is a lot of money.

115
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,341
Second,
It's my fucking money.

116
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:38,341
Third, the widow,
Being a dope-fiend,

117
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:39,874
Might let matters rest.

118
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:42,341
But fourth,

119
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:46,107
Well, this camp has a lot more
To offer me than $20,000

120
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:48,874
As long as I don't get killed
By the fucking pinkertons.

121
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,740
Why take the chance?

122
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,673
Go see to the grieving
Fucking widow.

123
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,307
All right, sir.

124
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,174
( door opening )

125
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,341
E.b.:
Mrs. Garret?

126
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,241
What a tragic turn.

127
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,307
Do you require
Dr. Cochran?

128
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,541
To treat
Your terrible grief?

129
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,940
Yes.

130
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,374
I would like
To see the doctor.

131
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,407
Of course,
Who wouldn't?

132
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,407
I'll get him
Right away.

133
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:02,773
Ask him, before
He sees me please,

134
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,474
To examine
My husband's injuries.

135
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:08,241
I'd like his opinion
On how they were sustained.

136
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,141
I assume your husband
Died in a fall.

137
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:12,174
All I asked you to do was
Get the goddamned doctor.

138
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:13,773
Of course, madam.

139
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,374
Is that what happened,
Mr. Dority?

140
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,974
A tragic turn?

141
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:36,374
Terrible,
Accidental fall?

142
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,807
I'm sorry, ma'am.

143
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:40,874
Oh yes.

144
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,274
Come on, stupid.

145
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,574
She wouldn't have
Nothing to do with me, al.

146
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,541
She told e.b.

147
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,740
To have doc
Go over the body.

148
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,608
You think
He smells the gold?

149
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,241
Nah.

150
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,374
E.b.'s too busy
Sniffin'

151
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:26,740
What he can steal
Being go-between.

152
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,740
Whereas you, dan,

153
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,940
You show me foresight,
And loyalty,

154
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
The way you handled
Making the find.

155
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,707
Just know when
I'm outta my depth.

156
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,141
Amateur. Comes on a lark to dabble,

157
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,840
And falls to his death
From the ridge.

158
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:56,307
Yet the widow
Suspects foul play.

159
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:13,074
I know al wants
Her leaving here

160
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:16,773
With as least of a sour taste
In her mouth as possible.

161
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,940
Wouldn't you expect
Her husband's death

162
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,773
To be sour on her tongue
No matter how it happened?

163
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,207
Question's whether
It's fate she blames,

164
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,474
Or people
In the camp.

165
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,508
What are you
Looking for?

166
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,840
Morning, seth.

167
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,441
When did you get up?

168
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,574
I didn't go to sleep.

169
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,241
The woman that newspaperman
Pointed out to us yesterday

170
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,874
Just lost her husband.

171
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:47,407
Sol: fella bought the
Gold claim at swearengen's?

172
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,707
Innkeep just took
The body down to the doc's.

173
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:59,274
You weren't twiddlin' your
Thumbs overnight, were you?

174
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:03,541
( flies buzzing )

175
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,007
I've brought the doctor.

176
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,907
Please,
Come in, doctor.

177
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,773
I'm very sorry
About your husband.

178
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:40,141
Was he murdered?

179
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:44,707
I was told that he
Fell from a ridge.

180
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:48,274
He had skull fractures
Consistent with that.

181
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,107
Not been wounded by
Bullets nor strangled.

182
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,374
No other sign
Of foul play.

183
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,974
Leaving how
He came to fall?

184
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,207
As to that
I have no opinion.

185
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:04,107
And yet...

186
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,874
In treating me,

187
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:09,040
You were
So full of opinion.

188
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,673
You took the most
Comprehensive view.

189
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,608
I said you needn't
Make up symptoms

190
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,307
To get the laudanum
You want-

191
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,040
Perhaps,
You don't feel

192
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,007
At such perfect liberty

193
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,241
To opine
On my husband's case

194
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,241
As you did on mine.

195
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:28,541
Do other considerations
Constrain you?

196
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,541
Do other men?

197
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,074
I do not know

198
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:44,207
How your husband's skull
Got caved in.

199
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:54,441
You're a bright woman,
Aren't you?

200
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,074
Must've gone
Through hell here.

201
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,707
Go on home,
Mrs. Garret.

202
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,074
What's her mood?

203
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,241
( glass breaking )

204
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:42,241
( sobbing )

205
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,274
( knocking at door )

206
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,974
Who is it?

207
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,374
E.b.: mr. Farnum, mrs. Garret.

208
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,441
May I be of
Further service?

209
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:09,508
Once i've
Determined my plans.

210
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:13,441
I'll certainly
Need a coffin.

211
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,007
I'll see to it.

212
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,740
Thank you.

213
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,707
- ( knocking at door )
- what is it?

214
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,574
Would you open
The door, ma'am?

215
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:26,174
I would like to say
Something to your face.

216
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,007
I'm overcome with remorse,
Mrs. Garret,

217
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,574
That I failed to change
The course of events.

218
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:45,773
It was me your husband
Outbid for the claim.

219
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:50,707
If it will simplify
Your situation in any way,

220
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:53,640
I renew my offer
At $12,000.

221
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:58,241
I know it won't
Bring him back.

222
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,574
No.

223
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,508
We both know that.

224
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:03,874
You'll have
Your answer shortly.

225
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,341
All right, madam.

226
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,141
( footsteps leaving )

227
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:36,040
Is this
Mr. Hickok's room?

228
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,640
Who's asking?

229
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,074
My husband's just died under
Suspicious circumstances.

230
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,740
Suspect someone else.

231
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,874
When bill's killed a man, he
Says so and states his reasons.

232
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:48,541
I don't
Suspect him.

233
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,508
My husband had tried
To engage mr. Hickok,

234
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,307
Just before his death
And I thought,

235
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:54,907
Though they hadn't
Come to terms,

236
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,040
Perhaps mr. Hickok
Would be willing

237
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,141
To advise me on my
Current situation.

238
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:03,407
I'd pay whatever fee
He thought appropriate.

239
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,541
To talk to you?

240
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,174
I have no one else
In the camp.

241
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,673
I'll get him.

242
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,107
He's sleepin' one off.

243
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:19,107
Thank you.

244
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:22,574
I'm sorry about
Your husband.

245
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,807
May I ask your name?

246
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:27,407
- jane.
- thank you, jane.

247
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,907
Wait in your room.

248
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:36,407
It'll take him a while
To get the phlegm situated.

249
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,207
All right.

250
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,508
I'm sure you don't need me
Explaining a place like ours.

251
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:45,673
A doc in frequent
Attendance can

252
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:48,141
Sew the seeds
Of doubt.

253
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,974
All depends on your
Standards of hygiene.

254
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,807
We want 'em shiny.
Make no mistake.

255
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,441
There's a wide
Range of normal.

256
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,040
Friday and saturday mornings
And the mid-week day

257
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,541
Of your choice
Will be right for us.

258
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,974
I can- I can
Work that out.

259
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:06,474
So what does swearengen
Pay for a visit?

260
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:10,807
$20 for routine call,
All girls in.

261
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,840
Ah. And what's
His idea of routine?

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,141
Once every three or
Four months? ( chuckles )

263
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:20,940
Anyway, how's uh...
$50 a visit sound,

264
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,974
Three times a week?

265
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,508
Done.

266
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,307
Lubricants.

267
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:33,074
Well, armed
And ready, madam.

268
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:48,773
Thanks very much.

269
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,773
Cy:
Howdy.

270
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:53,907
Howdy yourself.
You the operator?

271
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,241
Cy tolliver.

272
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,374
Name's crane.
And i'd like a room,

273
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,974
I'd like exclusive
Use of the safe

274
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,874
And i'd like
To shoot some dice.

275
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,740
I'd like to think
This is the first day

276
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,040
Of a long friendship,
Mr. Crane.

277
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,141
We'll get you a room. If
You'll step into my office

278
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,874
We'll meet your
Needs for a safe.

279
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:10,773
Help you with
Your luggage.

280
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:12,341
Suitcases go
To the room.

281
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,907
Expect you'll
Keep the valise.

282
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:15,807
Keep what you
Expect to yourself

283
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,141
And you'll improve our
Chances at that friendship.

284
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:22,407
- young man.
- how are you, cy?

285
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,773
Done some good work
On this place.

286
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,907
Eddie's work.

287
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:28,874
Joanie:
Hey, andy.

288
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,407
Hello, sweetheart.

289
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,207
So let's go,
Let's get something working.

290
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:35,740
We could rob cy.

291
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,141
Cy: how 'bout a bath first and a nap...

292
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:41,541
- and sex with an unfamiliar woman?
- sure.

293
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,341
Eddie: signal when ready, commander.

294
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:46,907
If I didn't make my point, i'd like
To get something fucking working.

295
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:48,707
Sure, andy.

296
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,907
How's andy look?

297
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:59,174
Like he spent
Three weeks on a wagon.

298
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,207
I'm optimistic, al.

299
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,374
And she's promised
A prompt reply.

300
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:06,773
I'd have thought she'd
Say yes on the spot.

301
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:14,341
You did offer her
The whole 20?

302
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:17,441
How can you even
Ask me that?

303
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,574
- e.b.?
- I offered 12.

304
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:25,107
Did I ask you
To play her?

305
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:28,274
Can't you follow one
Simple fucking instruction?

306
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:30,574
She will take the 12, al,
And be happy to get it.

307
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:32,740
And all you'll
Have to decide is

308
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,374
How much of the eight
You saved should go to me.

309
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,940
- you're incorrigible.
- I do my best.

310
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,640
I'll go with the 12.

311
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,341
She says yes, there should
Be something in this for you.

312
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,407
Hint at the amount.

313
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,740
Don't get ahead
Of yourself, e.b.

314
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,007
When she signs
The bill of sale,

315
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:54,341
And you come back here
And sign it over to me-

316
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,541
It is your 12 after all.

317
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,107
Once all that's done,

318
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,541
You should walk
Outta here with 2,000.

319
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,740
Fair recompense.

320
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,474
For saving me money
In spite of myself.

321
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,807
I suggested to my husband
Just last night

322
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:18,141
That we should try
To view our time here

323
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,907
As one experience
Bought at a single price.

324
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:23,574
Even now he's murdered,
I feel that.

325
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,940
That to stake
The boundaries

326
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,107
At- at just that fact
Is impossible.

327
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,341
For one, this camp

328
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:39,107
Hasn't any laws or courts.

329
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:41,541
If it did, i've no evidence.
I'd have tried to take

330
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,174
The thing all whole if they
Hadn't offered on the claim.

331
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:47,740
To receive their money,
Would be a separate matter,

332
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,840
Make me an accomplice
Of another sort.

333
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,341
How have you been
An accomplice till now?

334
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:00,673
A wife
Inevitably feels

335
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:03,474
She's had some part
In what befalls her husband.

336
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,174
I'm answerable hereafter,
On different terms.

337
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,040
I need to know

338
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,907
What i'd be
Selling them.

339
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,640
You don't believe the money's
To keep the pinkertons away.

340
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,040
Why pay me?

341
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,907
If it were a ransom
To keep the pinkertons off,

342
00:26:22,907 --> 00:26:25,407
Why not pay brom
Instead of killing him?

343
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:29,107
It's this saloon operator you
Think is pulling the strings?

344
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:33,574
Al swearengen, it was
Certainly he manipulating brom.

345
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:35,307
The slimy limey
Cocksucker.

346
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:40,773
Bill:
All right, ma'am.

347
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,974
True sounding's
Not guaranteed

348
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:46,007
But i'll try
For a feel of the bottom.

349
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,773
What shall I pay you,
Mr. Hickok?

350
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:53,807
I prefer you
Pick the figure.

351
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,007
Is $100 enough?

352
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,374
Perfect.

353
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,840
Whiskey.

354
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,374
And how'd they take
To the craps game?

355
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:57,241
Like chimps
At their first fire.

356
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,374
( knocking at door )

357
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:02,107
Downstairs.

358
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:08,907
Thank you, dan.

359
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:41,207
I'm al swearengen,
Mr. Hickok.

360
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,474
In the last few days,

361
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:46,574
I've been locked
In my room weeping,

362
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,974
Searching my memories

363
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:52,374
As to where my path might've
Crossed yours previous.

364
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,441
And as to how
I might've given offense

365
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,608
That you stay in this camp
Not 50 feet from my joint

366
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,773
And never once walk in.

367
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,407
No poker.

368
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,174
Is it that simple?

369
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:09,974
Dan, dismantle the titty corner
And set up a poker table.

370
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:11,807
Not necessary,
Mr. Swearengen.

371
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,807
I always felt poker
Slows a joint's action.

372
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:16,207
Bit of liquor, pussy,

373
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,740
And faro made my
Entire fuckin' career,

374
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,407
But certain people
I do respect.

375
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:24,474
This man garret,
Who fell off the rocks-

376
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:26,474
The eastern dude.

377
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,673
His widow's had
An offer on his claim

378
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,773
From that innkeeper
Sitting in the corner.

379
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:32,640
But she's reluctant
To sell

380
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,441
Till she understands
What's behind it.

381
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,907
Why have you
Asked me?

382
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:42,007
She believes
You'd know.

383
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:52,107
Her husband came here
With childish ideas.

384
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,773
Bought himself a gold claim
With me an honest broker.

385
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:56,773
Claim pinches out,
Which will happen.

386
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:59,374
But he can't take
That like a man,

387
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:00,673
Has to blame somebody.

388
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,907
Seller's left camp
So he picks on me.

389
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,907
Says he'll bring in
The pinkertons

390
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:06,874
If I don't offer
Restitution.

391
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,673
I got a healthy operation here,
And I didn't build it

392
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:13,773
Brooding on the right
And wrong of things.

393
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:17,274
I do not need the pinkertons
Descending like locusts.

394
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,707
So I bend over for
The tenderfoot cocksucker.

395
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:23,040
"reconnoiter your claim
Fully," I say,

396
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,474
"and then,
If you're still unhappy,

397
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:27,441
I will give you
Your fucking money back."

398
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,040
And the tenderfoot agrees.

399
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,974
Just as he's finishing
His reconnoiter,

400
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:34,474
Cocksucker falls to his
Death. Pure fucking accident.

401
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:36,874
But up jumps the widow
In righteous indignation.

402
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:40,840
Wants the doctor to examine
Him for murder wounds.

403
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,707
My visions of
Locusts return.

404
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:47,241
I see pinkertons
Coming in swarms.

405
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,441
Commissioned
By the widow.

406
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,541
Who I recognize
Is grieving,

407
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,508
And has better
Intentions probably

408
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:55,441
Than to hold
On the truth.

409
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:58,807
How's the innkeep
Come to make the offer?

410
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:03,207
Underbidder
On the sale I brokered

411
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:05,074
Still believes
In the claim.

412
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:07,640
Even though the gold
Is pinched out?

413
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,574
Well, this camp's
Expanding.

414
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,940
We've already had
One hotel close.

415
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,608
He sees the property
As real estate.

416
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,374
I'll take this
Back to the widow.

417
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:25,508
I only hope you
Show it to her

418
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,207
In a favorable
Fucking light.

419
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:31,773
What's that worth?

420
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:34,940
What?

421
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,807
The light
I show it in?

422
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:40,341
What's it
Worth to you?

423
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:46,907
Why, wild bill.

424
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
They certainly don't
Appear to be at odds.

425
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,508
What happened
To this little one

426
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,907
Was the same
Exact cocksucker.

427
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:14,174
Seems he was
Pulling the strings

428
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:16,608
In your husband's fleecing
And gettin' him killed.

429
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:20,074
This swearengen
Operated the road agents

430
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,608
That done for this
Little one's people.

431
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,773
Oh, poor child.

432
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:30,574
To lose her family,
To see them slaughtered.

433
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,307
- very same cocksucker.
- ( knocking at door )

434
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:35,508
It's bill.

435
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:44,241
You stole off on me.

436
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,407
I had to come in here to
Look after the little one.

437
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:50,740
I thought she might
Want me present.

438
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:55,307
Yes, i- i'm
Very grateful.

439
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,307
Didn't happen
To put one right between

440
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:59,241
The shithead's eyes,
Now did ya, bill?

441
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:04,840
Unless you need the money
Right away,

442
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,974
I'd defer a decision
Until someone honest

443
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:11,141
And competent did
A second reconnoiter.

444
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:14,174
May I commission you?

445
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:17,740
Some question my fitness
On either count,

446
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,040
But i'll guarantee you
I'm not competent.

447
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:25,474
I do know someone
I trust to ask.

448
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:27,307
Please do.

449
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,074
Name's bullock.

450
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,074
I'll go talk
To him now.

451
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,608
How'd you leave it with
The cocksucker, bill?

452
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:41,007
On terms
He'd understand.

453
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:49,574
Al, watchin' you
Even at a distance

454
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,608
Was a pleasure
And privilege.

455
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:56,874
If she don't come back to you
With an answer inside an hour,

456
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,407
You pay a call on her.

457
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,107
But hickok's an ally,
Am I right?

458
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:02,141
I mean if that wasn't
A damn ally leavin'

459
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,974
My eyes completely
Deceived me.

460
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,907
- an hour, e.b.
- yes, sir.

461
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:13,207
Pour me a drink.

462
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:17,207
And ask me the key
To a long life.

463
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:18,640
What is it?

464
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,974
Most important human quality
For a person to reach old age?

465
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,007
I'll buy the drink
If you tell me.

466
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,740
Same as a dog
Who keeps his nose.

467
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:35,541
Don't poke it
Where it don't belong.

468
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,374
Wise words.

469
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:40,874
A lesson hard
To come by.

470
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:42,807
But thoroughly learned.

471
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,574
Something else I know.

472
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:50,508
My knowing what I know

473
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,673
And somebody else
Knowing it,

474
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:56,040
Is two entirely
Different things.

475
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,974
I'm near losing
Your trail, ellsworth.

476
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:06,441
Say somebody thought I saw
Something I shouldn't have.

477
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,307
Whereabouts?

478
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,640
On a ridge.

479
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,040
A man, pushed off
Or whatever the hell else.

480
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,474
If it meant
My leaving camp

481
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,508
To prove I could
Mind my own business,

482
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:21,773
It'd be a friend
Who told me that...

483
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,574
Instead of throwing me
To the pigs.

484
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,974
It's my whole philosophy
And outlook.

485
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,773
Make use of it
As you will.

486
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:49,107
Well, well, if he-
If he was here

487
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,107
Sealing a appearance
Arrangement,

488
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,141
Then i'm glad it was you
That tied him up, al,

489
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:55,174
Not that new
Fucking operation,

490
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:57,974
What with them fancy signs
And cleaned up women

491
00:35:57,974 --> 00:36:00,474
Where I heard
He was gambling all night.

492
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:03,040
We made
No appearance agreement.

493
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,241
Well, uh...

494
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:08,040
- you and- you
And hickok- - no.

495
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,341
Oh, I see.

496
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:13,241
Well, I mean, because
His game at my place yesterday

497
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,341
Was this far
From coming to lead.

498
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,807
Him and this
Droop-eyed hoople head.

499
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,207
And I had
To shut it down.

500
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,773
I mean, if that gives him
Offense or umbrage,

501
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,940
Well, I can't worry
About his plans

502
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,341
As far as where he decides
To gamble elsewhere,

503
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:30,174
Or this new joint
Overwhelms the camp.

504
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:32,341
We made no agreement.

505
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:35,074
What do you think
Of the new joint?

506
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:36,673
Nice sign.

507
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,907
This far from
Fucking gunplay.

508
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:45,007
Jack fuckin' high!

509
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,773
That's what I have.

510
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:50,107
I bet
Every fuckin' cent.

511
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,740
Miracle to me is you sit
Here bragging about it.

512
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,707
I ain't braggin',

513
00:36:55,707 --> 00:36:58,274
Or a braggart,
Or a blowhard.

514
00:36:58,274 --> 00:37:00,773
I state a fact,
I live by a fact-

515
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,174
Anyways, it's over.

516
00:37:03,174 --> 00:37:06,541
Yeah, you believe that because
You're a walkin' fuckin' cunt!

517
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:10,773
With your cunt-
Your eye movin'.

518
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,907
No matter how
Your day's going, jack,

519
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:14,707
You're always fun
To talk to.

520
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:16,441
Give me a buck
Then, lou.

521
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:19,974
He sent me off
For a meal.

522
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,141
Give me a buck, see what
Part of you gets shot

523
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:23,707
Because i-

524
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:27,107
I possess a fuckin' gun
That I didn't bet.

525
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,207
I'll pay you $5 for
That gun, sight unseen.

526
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:36,107
'Cause what you need is a
Stake to make your comeback.

527
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:39,640
That'll get you out of this
Brown study you're in.

528
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,241
What'd you
Take off of me?

529
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:44,974
The tag from
Your new suit.

530
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:46,974
All right then.

531
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,974
Dealer:
Name a price.

532
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:51,141
If it's close to fair,
I'll pay it.

533
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,074
For the suit?

534
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:55,773
For your gun.

535
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,007
No, I believe not.

536
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,608
I believe no.

537
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:06,174
Lou: he too is god's handiwork.

538
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,307
Oh, double fucking
Solitaire.

539
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,874
Where's your
Fucking ballgowns?

540
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,040
Bring a bunch a chips
Over here

541
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,274
And let's get
A poker game going!

542
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:26,141
( laughing )

543
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:28,274
I don't know
This camp.

544
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:30,241
I'd have to bring
Someone from montana.

545
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,874
Would the widow
Give it that much time?

546
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:34,274
Yeah, she would.

547
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:36,374
She don't wanna be
Stupid or fooled.

548
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,407
Wants to stand up
For her husband

549
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:40,141
Better than he stood
Up for himself.

550
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,241
Not that she ought
To stick around.

551
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:45,974
Far as that goes,
She could sign a proxy.

552
00:38:45,974 --> 00:38:47,974
There's her $100
In it.

553
00:38:47,974 --> 00:38:50,040
And what that
Saloon-keeper gave me

554
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,441
If you'd wanna
Take it on.

555
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,974
All right.

556
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,207
I guess she's all right

557
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:02,174
Till that saloon-keep
Decides I can't be trusted

558
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,541
To betray her interests.

559
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,608
Trust ain't
His long suit.

560
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:08,807
She oughtta be
Lookin' for a wagon.

561
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:18,174
Thanks for
The favor, montana.

562
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,307
Sure.

563
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:26,541
I like ellsworth, too.

564
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,974
There's a difference
Between talking a lot,

565
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:30,508
Which ellsworth
Does enjoy,

566
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:32,407
And oversteppin'.

567
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,107
He don't get into
Other people's business.

568
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,974
Then what are we
Talkin' about, dan?

569
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,608
Well my own standards
As to who's reliable

570
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,608
Ain't the same
As al's.

571
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:47,474
So ellsworth has to leave
Camp over the difference?

572
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:49,407
Yeah, he does if
It's that or kill him.

573
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,074
He said tell him
If those was the choices.

574
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:55,040
Don't you do it.

575
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,441
Which?

576
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,608
Either.

577
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:11,007
Asks a bribe for something
He never intends to do.

578
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:14,141
Takes my 150 then
Tells her not to sell.

579
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:16,707
Why are you so sure
He told her not to?

580
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,574
You went back there,
You knocked on her door.

581
00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:23,608
She said hickok reported
His conversation with you.

582
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:26,441
But she wasn't prepared yet
To give me an answer.

583
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,441
Does this make sense
To you, huh?

584
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:31,807
She pays hickok
To come talk to me.

585
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:34,107
He goes back,
Tells her to sell.

586
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:37,740
And then she says she needs
More time to make up her mind.

587
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:41,574
( groans )

588
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:44,141
That idiot couldn't
Put one in his ear.

589
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,907
If you're talking
About tom mason,

590
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:47,840
I'd say that's water
Under the bridge.

591
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,441
I'd say hickok has to die
If I have to kill him myself.

592
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:54,107
Jesus, al.
With all that's going on?

593
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,807
How would it sit with
The widow, for one thing?

594
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:59,673
How would that
Dispose her toward us?

595
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:02,474
Let me pose you a question,
E.b., you fuckin' cunt!

596
00:41:02,474 --> 00:41:05,241
Someone comes at you, what are
You supposed to do about it?

597
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:09,541
And I pose you a question
Back, al swearengen!

598
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:13,207
If a friend, or at least
A professional colleague,

599
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:16,274
Has a mistaken impression
Of who's coming at him

600
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,374
And who isn't, what are you
Supposed to do then, huh?!

601
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:27,508
You don't think
He's coming at me?

602
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:29,541
I don't think hickok's
Coming at ya, al.

603
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,407
No, I don't.

604
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,474
I think you're a man with so
Many different responsibilities

605
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,474
You sometimes
Get feeling beset.

606
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:39,007
And in that frame of mind,
Take things personal.

607
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:42,574
I'd sooner the cocksucker was dead.

608
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,773
Simplify working
The widow.

609
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:47,341
We don't get to choose
The world we live in.

610
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:51,341
Bella union cocksuckers
To worry about

611
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,174
And every other
Damn thing.

612
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:55,174
Well, you got
A full plate.

613
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:57,341
I need to fuck
Something.

614
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,241
Trixie!

615
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,307
Hey, hey, hey!

616
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:07,673
Get the bottle.

617
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,307
That's using
Your old noggin, al.

618
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:14,707
Get yourself
Some relief.

619
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:17,007
Let the world
Do its own spinnin'.

620
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:24,907
Don't be pointing
Your fucking thumb for me.

621
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:26,907
Me and you done
Talked that subject out.

622
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:36,541
What's new, dan?

623
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,874
Nothing.

624
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,608
No news at all?

625
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:45,207
If I had somethin' to tell you,
One way or another,

626
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,441
I'd tell it to you.

627
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:51,207
Well then I reckon
I'll have another drink.

628
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,474
( shivering )

629
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:01,907
( knocking at door )

630
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:06,474
Who is it?

631
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:07,940
It's joanie.

632
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,773
Wait a second, honey.

633
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:11,508
Give me just
A second.

634
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,907
I fell asleep.

635
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:31,341
I broke up
Three catfights, andy.

636
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,241
Girls wanting
To give you a bath.

637
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:37,341
I fell right
The hell to sleep.

638
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,441
You ready to meet
Some strange?

639
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,673
Tell you the truth,
Joanie, i'm...

640
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:45,074
Feelin' outta sorts.

641
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,807
Well, you had
A long trip.

642
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:52,307
And i've heard
Worse confessions.

643
00:43:52,307 --> 00:43:54,241
That's the gospel truth.

644
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:56,840
Which I hope you'll
Keep to yourself.

645
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,907
Yeah, sure I will, andy.

646
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:03,974
I feel fucking
Unwell to myself.

647
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,541
Won't you lie back and
Let me get your boots off?

648
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,608
I don't think you
Should touch me, honey.

649
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:12,274
That's the gospel
On that score.

650
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,007
No girl in the world
Ever got sick pulling off

651
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:16,608
A pair of boots, andy.

652
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:19,007
But if you want,

653
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,207
I won't take more liberties.

654
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:25,974
$50 an issue.

655
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:28,773
Well, uh, frankly, sir,

656
00:44:28,773 --> 00:44:31,107
That-that would purchase
Your advertisement

657
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:34,640
An amount of space wildly incommensurate
With the accompanying articles.

658
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,141
See?

659
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,141
I never heard
That word in my life.

660
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,874
That's his trade, cy,
He's a wordsmith.

661
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:43,007
( laughing )

662
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,040
Do you shoot craps,
Mr. Merrick?

663
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
Excuse me?

664
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,707
Oh, oh, oh no!

665
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:53,007
Ah, no, I haven't shot
The craps in sometime.

666
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:54,740
Perhaps never?

667
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,608
If you'll keep
My secret, sir.

668
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,673
No, i've never
Shot them.

669
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:04,207
Maybe that would
Make an article:

670
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:07,407
A man learns
To shoot the craps.

671
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:10,207
Cy: well, we're agreed on $50 an issue.

672
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,407
Have we
Actually agreed?

673
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:15,407
I feel almost duty-bound
To remonstrate you, sir.

674
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,574
Three months
In advance, eddie.

675
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:19,141
$50 an issue.

676
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:20,773
Let's see the man
With the cash.

677
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,508
Seriously?

678
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:25,773
Don't let him take
Your money, mr. Merrick,

679
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:28,508
While he's teaching
You this game.

680
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,007
( laughing )

681
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,441
Who did you
Give to andy?

682
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,441
Nobody.
He's poorly.

683
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:41,307
Does he need
A doctor?

684
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:43,274
Maybe he does.

685
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:46,608
God damn it!

686
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:49,707
I told you I didn't
Like the way he looked!

687
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,840
Stand outside room eight,
No one in or out.

688
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,407
Get the doc.

689
00:45:57,407 --> 00:45:59,407
Tell him...
Someone fell.

690
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:04,341
I told you.

691
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,107
Thank you,
For your help.

692
00:46:08,107 --> 00:46:11,007
I'll look forward
To mr. Bullock contacting me.

693
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,974
May I ask, ma'am,

694
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:17,307
When you'd expect
To leave the camp?

695
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:20,773
I'm not certain.

696
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:23,307
Bullock is honorable.

697
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:25,574
You can trust him
To see to your interests.

698
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,174
He couldn't come more
Highly recommended.

699
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,241
You know the sound
Of thunder, don't you?

700
00:46:35,874 --> 00:46:38,074
Of course.

701
00:46:38,074 --> 00:46:41,740
Can you imagine that
Sound if I ask you to?

702
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,207
I can, mr. Hickok.

703
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:48,207
Your husband and me
Had this talk.

704
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:53,040
And I told him to head home
To avoid a dark result.

705
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:57,241
But I didn't
Say it in thunder.

706
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,274
Ma'am...

707
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:04,773
Listen to the thunder.

708
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,374
Very good luck to you.

709
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,274
Thank you for all
Your help, mr. Hickok.

710
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:38,241
( door opening, closing )

711
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:52,341
Thanks for coming, doc.

712
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:54,074
The boy said
Someone fell?

713
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:55,673
Room eight.

714
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,840
( knocking at door )

715
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Jane:
It's jane, bill.

716
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,707
Come ahead.

717
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,640
This little one's
Cool as a cucumber.

718
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,574
Is that so?

719
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,907
Feel this little
One's forehead.

720
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,374
Fever and you parted ways, young lady.

721
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:35,974
( speaking norwegian )

722
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:39,407
Did she just asked
To borrow money?

723
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:41,341
( laughing )

724
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:47,107
Anyways, how'd it go
With bullock?

725
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:48,874
He'll help the widow.

726
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:50,874
Good for him.

727
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:52,541
Good for you.

728
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,707
Did you tell her so?

729
00:48:55,707 --> 00:48:57,040
Hmm.

730
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,307
You think
She'd want company?

731
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:02,341
I'll bet
She'd enjoy yours.

732
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,474
Maybe she'd enjoy...

733
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,207
Feelin' the little one's
Forehead.

734
00:49:10,274 --> 00:49:13,174
You're probably enjoying
Your damn privacy

735
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:16,007
With charlie headed
For cheyenne.

736
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:18,174
I'm writing my wife.

737
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,773
Why didn't you say
Something, damn you!

738
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:24,508
I owe you a penny.

739
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:28,608
So long, jane.

740
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:30,541
So long, bill.

741
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,608
( moaning )

742
00:50:28,174 --> 00:50:30,707
All right,
Breathe big breaths.

743
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:32,374
( gasping )

744
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:34,074
Andy:
Oh, my back!

745
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,474
Oh, my aching back.

746
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:39,274
I'm gonna get you
Something to ease that.

747
00:50:39,274 --> 00:50:41,673
What's he got, doc?

748
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:45,608
I guess it's his back

749
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:48,341
Is what he landed on
When he fell.

750
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:50,174
My back is sweating
And broken.

751
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:51,974
I don't know
What he landed on.

752
00:50:51,974 --> 00:50:54,107
Wait, who said
He fell?

753
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:57,673
Course, if little
Pussy sores

754
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:01,141
Rise up on his trunk
And his face,

755
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,141
More likely he's
Got other trouble.

756
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,740
- oh, give me a game. How I ache.
- joanie: okay, andy.

757
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,508
Doc: i'm gonna give you
Somethin' to ease that.

758
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:10,874
You lost your friend
In the fire.

759
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:30,574
Hey!
Hey, winkie!

760
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:31,874
Hey, wait a minute.

761
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:34,840
Does that look
American to you?

762
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,541
No, this ain't.

763
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,074
People don't
Eat this shit!

764
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,207
It touched it!

765
00:51:58,474 --> 00:52:00,773
Meow, meow.

766
00:52:04,107 --> 00:52:05,773
( man chuckling )

767
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:10,840
Man:
Aw hell.

768
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:30,773
Boys.

769
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,840
Howdy, bill.

770
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:58,107
My father was
The best company.

771
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:00,907
From the time
I was ever so little.

772
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,974
Problems or...

773
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:06,474
Difficulties or even
Sadness, no such thing.

774
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,574
Not permitted.

775
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:12,840
The evening I was
Presented to society

776
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,907
I found out
Later he'd

777
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:18,374
Been able to attend
Only by fleeing

778
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:20,840
Some dismal
Legal difficulty.

779
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,740
In that sense,
My marriage

780
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,940
To mr. Garret was
A tremendous solution.

781
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,874
Tremendous.

782
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,640
At the ceremony I remember
Father whispered to me,

783
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,141
"darling...

784
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:41,207
I can never repay you for
What you are about to do

785
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:44,407
But I can repay
Everyone else."

786
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:49,673
And he said, "to think of you, with him,

787
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:52,707
In that
Godforsaken place

788
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:55,940
Is almost
Unbearable."

789
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,307
Meaning,
Your husband?

790
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:04,474
And I said,
"maybe he'll die."

791
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,341
- ( trixie moaning )
- ( al grunting )

792
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,874
( gasps )

793
00:54:15,974 --> 00:54:18,174
( panting )

794
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,407
( gunshot )

795
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:56,907
Take that,
God damn you!

796
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:09,807
( men chattering )

797
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,407
