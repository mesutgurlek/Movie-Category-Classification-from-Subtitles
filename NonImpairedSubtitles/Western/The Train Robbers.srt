1
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,958
Train's late, Jesse.

2
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,059
It'll be along. Get your clothes on.

3
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,092
What about Grady and them?
They should have been here by now.

4
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,364
Ask me, I say they ain't coming.

5
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,737
Then who's that?

6
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,190
- Hey there, old Jesse.
- Hi, Grady.

7
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,622
Howdy, Grady.

8
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,790
Who's that up there?
Ben, how the hell are you?

9
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,854
Never better.

10
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,231
Me neither,
soon as I get some of this dust off me.

11
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,793
Come on, give me a hand here, Sam.

12
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,809
Come on, get wet all over!

13
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,277
Keep in there, girl.
Okay, Sam, grab hold of her.

14
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,280
Hot damn, that feels good.

15
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,526
Calhoun and Sam Turner.

16
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,021
I've heard of them.

17
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,258
They're good boys, and young.
A lot younger than you, but good.

18
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,027
All right. What's it all about, Jess?

19
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,260
Beats me. All Lane said was
meet him here at the train stop.

20
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,669
- It would be worth it.
- To him or us?

21
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,573
What difference does it make?
It's something to do, isn't it?

22
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,544
Jesse, I get so bored
sitting around doing nothing lately.

23
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,137
- Get to you, too?
- All the time.

24
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,081
Sam? Take them over to the corral.
Turn them loose.

25
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,214
That train Lane's coming in on,
when is it due, Jesse?

26
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,385
Yesterday.

27
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,688
Any women in this town?

28
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,253
- One.
- Good, we can fight over her.

29
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,171
It's a long time
since I've seen that big old Lane.

30
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,204
He as bullheaded as ever?

31
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,938
He ain't changed.

32
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,369
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. Lowe.

33
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,680
- We're working for her.
- We are?

34
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,438
That's right.

35
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,783
Doing what?

36
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,482
Ben, would you help Mrs. Lowe
get set up at the hotel?

37
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,854
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,270
Now, what was that again?

39
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,304
I said, "Doing what?"

40
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,908
I thought that's what you said.

41
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,009
What in the hell did you do that for?

42
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,346
I told you to get me two guns
that would take orders.

43
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,976
Draw your horses and skedaddle.

44
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,520
- Ain't we got a right to know?
- No.

45
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,523
Jesse, how about the pack mules
and supplies?

46
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,321
- Ready to go.
- Good. Dynamite?

47
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,586
- Ben brought two cases.
- That ought to do it.

48
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,199
- What are you fixing to do, start a war?
- Look, Lane.

49
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,733
You still here?

50
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,001
- Damn it, we rode two days.
- That's your problem.

51
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,734
You gonna tell us or not?

52
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,440
Grady, where did you find
these two peckerwoods?

53
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,074
They're standing up to you.
That should prove something.

54
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,018
I don't need them standing up to me.
I need them standing alongside of me.

55
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,317
All we want to know
is what we rode here for.

56
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,291
What a gun rides anywhere for: money.

57
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,188
The more there is of it,
the more chances you take.

58
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,593
What about the woman?

59
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,790
What about her?

60
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,833
- She part of it?
- She's all of it.

61
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,731
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,270
- None of your damn business.
- Lane!

63
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,568
We've got a right to know
what we're getting into.

64
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,473
A grave, more than likely,
if you come along with us.

65
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,771
Then why should we?

66
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,676
Beats the hell out of me.

67
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,442
Unless you think
gold is worth taking a chance for.

68
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,178
- Gold?
- $500,000 worth.

69
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,286
Already dug?

70
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,054
Already dug.

71
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,286
The hell you say.

72
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,616
- Don't you think it's about time?
- All right.

73
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,894
A train robbery, five years ago.

74
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,598
Ten men rode away with $500,000 in gold.

75
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,467
The fellow that was running the show
figured they ought to hide it...

76
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,764
until things cooled off.

77
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,968
So he took the Fargo box
and two of the men...

78
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,204
and rode south into Mexico.

79
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:10,212
Came back alone.
Said the other two got killed accidentally.

80
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,178
His name was Lowe.

81
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,176
The woman, she his wife?

82
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,415
His widow.
He had the misfortune of getting shot.

83
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,790
But he told her where the gold was
before he died.

84
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,954
- And she told you?
- No, she doesn't trust me.

85
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,165
All she'll say
is that it's four days south of here.

86
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,295
If there was 10 of them jumped that train,
three of them dead...

87
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,102
- that leaves seven of them still alive.
- And still kicking.

88
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,972
You figure they know Lowe died?

89
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,239
Six of them were pallbearers.

90
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,575
Then why didn't she tell them?

91
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,672
Get her husband's share
and let it go at that?

92
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,546
That isn't what she's after.

93
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,519
When she gets the gold,
she plans to turn it in.

94
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,078
Clear her husband's name.

95
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,919
Why the hell would she do that?

96
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,222
They got a kid, a boy.
She doesn't want him growing up...

97
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,354
thinking his old man
ran around robbing trains.

98
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,023
Kind of high-minded, ain't it?

99
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,999
Not the way she looks at it.

100
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,094
Then why didn't she go to the railroad
and tell them where it is?

101
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,198
That's what she was about to do
when I met her. I talked her out of it.

102
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,438
There's a reward: $50,000.

103
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,379
- Hell, that ain't no $500,000.
- No, and it ain't stolen, either.

104
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,146
- We'll leave first thing in the morning.
- Lane.

105
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,620
Talking that woman
out of going to the railroad...

106
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,592
you might have talked her
into getting herself killed.

107
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,129
You let me worry about the woman.

108
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,931
Bullheaded.

109
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,329
He ain't changed.

110
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,794
Come in.

111
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,698
Mrs. Lowe?

112
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,203
Join me?

113
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,738
Don't mind if I do.

114
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,472
I've had a few.

115
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,515
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,882
I started thinking about
what I was letting myself in for.

117
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,220
It's not too late to change your mind.

118
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,190
Let you and the others go alone?

119
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,696
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,730
- I told you before, Mr. Lane, that l...
- You don't trust me.

121
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,195
Can't say as I blame you.

122
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,999
You realize if anything should happen
to me on the way...

123
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,270
- It won't.
- But if it should.

124
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,208
We'd be out of a job.

125
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,480
This the stuff
you're planning to wear tomorrow?

126
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,210
- Yes.
- Put it on.

127
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,916
- Now?
- Now.

128
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,311
- But...
- Put it on.

129
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,082
You can turn around.

130
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,523
The pants aren't bad.

131
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,961
That shirt ought to be tighter.

132
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,328
- Take it off and I'll boil it.
- Boil it?

133
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,225
Shrink it up.

134
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,634
I want you to stick out
in the right places...

135
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,799
so that if anybody a long ways off
sees you...

136
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,769
there'll be no doubt you're a woman.

137
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:03,645
- Mr. Lane, if you're trying to shock me...
- I'm trying to keep you alive, Mrs. Lowe.

138
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,618
If they see you along, they'll know you
haven't told us where the gold is hidden.

139
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,984
And they'll be overcareful
to keep you alive.

140
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,751
At least until we get our hands on it.

141
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,917
- I see.
- No, you don't.

142
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,757
If you did, you wouldn't come along.

143
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,296
But there are only seven of them.

144
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,822
That we know of.
With this much money up for grabs...

145
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,837
likely they've got every two-bit gunman
in the territory along.

146
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,683
Maybe I should go to the railroad.

147
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,446
Maybe you should, at that.

148
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,683
Thanks for the drink. I'll tell the boys.

149
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,159
Can't that wait until morning?

150
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,854
Why should it?

151
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,066
I might change my mind.

152
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,328
Again?

153
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,336
I'm a woman.

154
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,932
And I'm out two train tickets
and five friends.

155
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,132
Let's let it go at that.

156
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,674
There's a train due
through here tomorrow.

157
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,543
I'll put you on it.

158
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,515
Good night, Mrs. Lowe.

159
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,024
Mr. Lane.

160
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,464
Boil it.

161
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,134
Yeah. I'll boil it.

162
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,380
- Stay with him, Jesse.
- Come on, Jesse.

163
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,742
Grab him by the tail!

164
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,515
I think them boys will need a hand.

165
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,720
They'll need more than that
if that stuff blows.

166
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,168
Show him who's boss, Jesse.

167
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,732
- Come on, now.
- Hang on to him, Sam!

168
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,809
Whoa, son of a buck.

169
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,349
Don't you think
we ought to put this on a gentle one?

170
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,352
This is the gentle one.

171
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,013
Hold on to him!

172
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,322
Goshdarned mule!

173
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,366
- He's had it. He's all right.
- Okay, I got him.

174
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,674
Do you mean to tell me
you're gonna trust that jackass?

175
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,738
They get kind of rank
when they ain't had a pack on in a while.

176
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,785
- He'll be all right.
- Ain't worried about him. It's us.

177
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,547
He'll settle down.

178
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,028
Here, hold this.

179
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,569
How'd you like
to draw into a pair like that?

180
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,838
Guess you don't
get to town very often, Calhoun.

181
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,605
Go on, take a good look.
But from here on in...

182
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,982
you'd better be looking over your shoulder
if you want to stay alive.

183
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,045
All right, Jesse,
get her on a horse and point her south.

184
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,420
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,156
- Give him a hand with the mules.
- We ain't no mule packers.

186
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,027
- You will be by the time you get back.
- lf we get back.

187
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,226
Do you see that knot-head
packing that dynamite?

188
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,529
Do what you're told, Cal.

189
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,126
- Yeah, but...
- Calhoun!

190
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,503
There will be one boss.
Now go help with the mules.

191
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,936
Just like old times, huh?

192
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,740
Like hell it is.

193
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,212
- Ready?
- Yes.

194
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,388
Let's go to Mexico.

195
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,653
You afraid of the dark, Jesse?

196
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,251
- Fire's going out.
- Let it.

197
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,865
- Something wrong, Lane?
- Thought I heard something.

198
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,042
I guess not.

199
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,341
Just my old heart pounding.

200
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,009
Gets to doing that
when I'm around a good-looking woman.

201
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,044
- Want some more coffee, Mrs. Lowe?
- Thank you.

202
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,520
Coming up.

203
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,319
Lane tells us you got a little boy.

204
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,161
How old is he?

205
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,663
- Six.
- That's a good age.

206
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,289
What do you call him?

207
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,994
Matt. It was his father's name.

208
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,405
- Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up.
- It's all right.

209
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,671
No, it's not all right. I talk too much.

210
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,043
That's the trouble
with always running around wild.

211
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,548
You get kind of starved
for female attention.

212
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,586
You get near a woman, start talking,
and next thing you know...

213
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,315
you say something wrong
and hurt somebody's feelings.

214
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,257
Shut up, Grady, before you put
your other foot in your mouth.

215
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,895
See what I mean?
Hurt old Jesse's feelings.

216
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,765
Got him all mad at me for no cause.

217
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,859
I've been mad at you
ever since I've known you.

218
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,961
Jesse, that's 10 years.

219
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,606
That's an awful long time
to go around hating a man.

220
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,198
I never said I hated you.

221
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,244
Well, there ain't exactly
any love between us.

222
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,076
I damn sure ain't sweet,
if that's what you mean.

223
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,240
You know, sometimes...

224
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,946
I hate to break up this friendly chatter,
but it's your first guard, Grady.

225
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,425
Jesse, you spell him at midnight.

226
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,358
Don't pay any attention to Grady, ma'am.
He's his own worst enemy.

227
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,023
The hell he is.

228
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,367
It might mean nothing...

229
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,598
but I think I'll take a pass
at our back track.

230
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,509
Ma'am, when you finish that coffee,
you better bed down next to the coals.

231
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,444
Gets kind of chilly long towards morning.

232
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,392
- Jesse?
- Yes, ma'am?

233
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,761
How long have you known Lane?

234
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,091
A lot of years.

235
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,703
Me and Grady rode with him
during the war.

236
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,897
Behind him, I should say.
He was our officer.

237
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:15,239
We fought together for a couple of years
before he ever knew we had a name.

238
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,218
Then one day at Vicksburg,
we were ordered up a hill.

239
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,318
Over a hundred of us.

240
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,252
Only three of us got to the top alive.

241
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,024
Lane, Grady and me.

242
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,857
We've been going up hills together
ever since.

243
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,533
And the others?

244
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,596
Young Ben, he's been along with us
ever since Lane shot him.

245
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,766
Shot him?

246
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,642
Backing out of a bank in Tucson.
Tried his hand at stealing.

247
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,440
Lane broke him from that.

248
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,549
Doctored him back to life,
got the bank to drop the charge.

249
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,979
Calhoun and Sam, them I only just met.

250
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,715
But from what I've heard...

251
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,354
they haven't made up their minds
what side of the law they're on.

252
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,955
That's the trouble with young guns.

253
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,867
It's mighty tempting
to cross over to the wild side.

254
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,675
I don't think they will, though.
Not now. Lane will see to that.

255
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,942
How is it he never took a wife?

256
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,280
He did.

257
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,688
Right after the war.
Me and Grady stood up for him.

258
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,559
I never got so drunk in my life.

259
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,598
A year later, she died.

260
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,194
We went up that hill with him, too.

261
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,743
What the hell was that for?

262
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,873
You were the last man on guard.

263
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,315
- That's right.
- Count the mules.

264
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,351
It must have pulled loose.

265
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,547
And packed itself and walked away.

266
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,615
- They led him off, then rode off with him.
- How many were there?

267
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,250
Four of them I could make out.

268
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,160
Let Sam and me go after them.
We can get that dynamite back.

269
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,857
One stick at a time.

270
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,593
Grady, when this is over...

271
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,830
- What?
- You brought him. Saddle up.

272
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,839
- I'm sorry, Grady.
- You're sorry?

273
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,161
- Go pick him up, Cal.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,705
How in the hell do you figure
that mule got here?

275
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,278
Well, my Spanish is kind of rusty...

276
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,974
but it seems those fellows
that borrowed our mule...

277
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,541
wanted the dynamite
to blow their friends out of jail.

278
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,013
Do you suppose
they'll let Cal have that knot-head back?

279
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,884
I think gladly.

280
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,586
Jesse, you better tell the boys
to hobble the horses.

281
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,986
If we lose them in this storm...

282
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,082
we'll have a hell of a time
getting them back.

283
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,387
Right.

284
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,295
- Let me give you a hand, Jesse.
- Thanks.

285
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,978
I'm afraid I'm not sticking out
in the right places.

286
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,183
I mean if somebody far off sees me.

287
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,881
Yeah, well, I don't think
anybody will bother us tonight.

288
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,330
I probably shouldn't say this...

289
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,468
but sometimes I get to thinking
I'm making a mistake.

290
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,130
I already told you that.

291
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,902
I mean about the gold.

292
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,176
What if I didn't turn it in?

293
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,518
What if I didn't go to the railroad?

294
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,521
You'd be a rich woman.

295
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,524
And that boy of yours...

296
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,652
would have a mother
that goes around robbing trains.

297
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,593
You're an honest man.

298
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,657
If you thought that...

299
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,066
you'd be waiting for us
back at that train station.

300
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,565
And what if you all didn't come back?

301
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,138
Well, then you'd know...

302
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,804
that we got to figuring
that maybe we'd made a mistake.

303
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,976
Gold has a way of bringing out
the larceny in all of us, Mrs. Lowe.

304
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,450
That's why I'm along, Mr. Lane.

305
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,618
And that's why I'll stay along.

306
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,527
Grady!

307
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,446
- He's alive.
- He won't be if we don't get this off him.

308
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,642
- I'll get his head.
- Stay away from him, Cal.

309
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,652
If we pick this tree half off him,
he'll kick himself to death.

310
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,655
- I know that, and you along with him.
- Yeah, but he's my horse.

311
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,985
I know.

312
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
- Grady.
- Calhoun!

313
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,857
You've been warned. Make up your mind!

314
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,716
All right, grab a hold. Heave!

315
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,619
Heave!

316
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,919
He's all right!

317
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,618
That's good.
Now maybe we can get some shuteye.

318
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:06,152
Soon as you hobble those horses.
Sam, walk him around.

319
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,695
Yes, sir.

320
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,747
I was wrong about you.

321
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,449
How's that?

322
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:32,015
For hitting you back there
when the jackass got stolen. I'm sorry.

323
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,255
A man gets older, it's harder to say that.

324
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,557
He tries to bully his way through.

325
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,155
I had it coming.

326
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,359
- No, you didn't.
- I was on guard.

327
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,232
So was I, trying to catch you sleeping...

328
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,637
so I could put you in your place
once and for good.

329
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,437
While I was worrying about
kicking your butt...

330
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,705
they stole that ornery mule.

331
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,545
It was as much my fault as it was yours.

332
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,452
I just wanted you to know that.

333
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,458
What's wrong with him?

334
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,226
Not one damn thing.

335
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,259
- We can cross upriver.
- Good.

336
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,432
I didn't say that she didn't say...

337
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,975
that the gold was half a mile
from the river crossing.

338
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,635
What I said...

339
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,844
Slide off and let him swim!

340
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,783
I'm trying to!

341
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,486
What I said is, I don't know
whether this is the right river crossing.

342
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,890
- This is the only one we could find.
- Then maybe...

343
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,823
You think she's drowning?

344
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,203
Sure does look like it.

345
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,986
- Is she all right?
- Come on, give us a hand.

346
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,319
Try to keep her feet higher than her head.

347
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,621
She'll be all right
after she catches her breath.

348
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,422
- Get the whiskey.
- Whiskey?

349
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,192
What are you trying to do?
Save her life or get her drunk?

350
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,377
- I don't swim, you know.
- I do now.

351
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,885
Mrs. Lowe...

352
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,516
if that shirt shrinks up any more,
you're going to be in a little trouble.

353
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,120
But not from you, Mr. Lane.

354
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,190
- What's he up to?
- My last bottle.

355
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,066
I should fall in the river more often.

356
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,538
I haven't felt this good
since I can't remember when.

357
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,404
Can you remember when, Mr. Lane?

358
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,547
I can remember when.

359
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,780
I'll have another.

360
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,620
I drink, you know.

361
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,826
But I can handle it.

362
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,427
"Handle your whiskey
and never feel sorry for yourself."

363
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,765
My father said that.

364
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,271
Good words to live by.

365
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,467
He said it to my brother,
but I never forgot it.

366
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,682
- A lot of things I never forgot.
- Yes, ma'am.

367
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,617
Do you always have to be so damn polite?

368
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,992
Makes it harder on me.

369
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,195
How's that?

370
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,694
You're trying to trick me, Mr. Lane.

371
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,940
Trying to get me to tell you something...

372
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,572
without letting me know...

373
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,014
that I told you what I know.

374
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,749
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,780
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?

376
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,824
I'm the kind of woman...

377
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,822
that, once I made up my mind...

378
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,558
there ain't no turning back.

379
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,026
And I made up my mind.

380
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,470
You know...

381
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,576
once I tell you...

382
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:04,182
I'll probably never ever see you
or any of the others again.

383
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm gonna miss you, Mr. Lane.

384
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,698
You'll probably be glad to get rid of me,
but I'm going to miss you...

385
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,266
very much.

386
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,222
We'll swing west to the Bravo...

387
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,925
follow it on up.
That way we can stay out of trouble...

388
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,468
Mr. Lane!

389
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,114
That was a rotten thing for you to do
last night, getting me drunk!

390
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,275
Yes, ma'am, it was.

391
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,478
I suppose you found out
what you wanted to know.

392
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:13,819
Yes. Cut those mules loose. There's plenty
of feed. Somebody will pick them up.

393
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,256
Why don't we take them?

394
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,489
No mules, no gold.
No use getting shot for nothing.

395
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,655
- You're turning back!
- That's right.

396
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,858
- But you can't!
- The hell I can't!

397
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,026
When I start plying a woman
with whiskey...

398
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,594
it's time to throw the key
in the water bucket and ride on.

399
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,136
- Even if I tell you where the gold is?
- Even then.

400
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,507
I'll go back to the train stop
and wait for you.

401
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,512
Looks like it's a little late for that now.

402
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,885
Them pallbearers sure as hell grew.

403
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,583
Maybe we ought to jump them.
Thin them out a little.

404
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,387
We'd better get moving out of here!

405
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,952
Cal! You and Sam hang back.

406
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,922
Anybody starts crossing that river
before we're out of sight...

407
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,998
- baptize them.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,537
They're still up on that hill!

409
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,096
Got off their horses
and went to cook coffee.

410
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,075
If we're gonna head west,
now's the time to do it.

411
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,872
- Unpack the mules.
- Hold it!

412
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,178
- I hate to cross you, Lane.
- Then don't.

413
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,047
I've got to. We just ran from a fight.

414
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,715
That's a bad habit for a man to get into
that makes his way with a gun.

415
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:59,352
- There are 20 of them back there.
- I'd say they were a little shorthanded.

416
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,428
And so would you, if it wasn't
for the woman being along.

417
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,522
Go on.

418
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,603
I tried to warn you and you wouldn't
listen. You said to let you worry about her.

419
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,935
Now you think
I'm worrying too much about her.

420
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,704
- lf we swing west, you are.
- He's right.

421
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,635
Don't make no sense,
riding off without that gold.

422
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,444
- It does to me.
- It won't to them back there.

423
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,882
They're gonna come killing,
no matter what we do.

424
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,546
You're wrong and you won't admit it!

425
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,953
You're just bullying your way through.

426
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,020
Seems like I heard
somebody say that before.

427
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,959
- Mrs. Lowe?
- Yes?

428
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,331
Where the hell is that gold?

429
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,520
- It's a hell of a way to run a railroad.
- What?

430
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:46,188
I said it's a hell of a way to run a railroad,
without any tracks!

431
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,458
When this wind lays down,
we'll find them.

432
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,866
If you ask me, I say we won't.
I say Lowe lied to the woman.

433
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,563
Why the hell would he do that?

434
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,004
Any man who's gonna steal gold
from one train...

435
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,770
and put it on another train
is liable to do anything.

436
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,834
It struck me as a pretty good idea.

437
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,244
At least he knew
it would be there when be got back.

438
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,839
- Maybe.
- You heard what the woman said.

439
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,648
I'm not talking about the train.
I'm talking about the $500,000.

440
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,282
You wouldn't catch me hiding that much
gold in the boiler of a six-wheeler!

441
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,794
- What?
- The gold is in the firebox of the engine!

442
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,592
What if somebody decided to build up
a head of steam and struck a match to it?

443
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,600
It's been laying upside down
at the bottom of a grade...

444
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,395
along with two flatcars, ever since
timber trains ran in this country...

445
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,405
- and that's a hell of a long time ago.
- I'll believe that when I see it.

446
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,910
Wonder whatever happened
to that old boy.

447
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:36,672
What old boy?

448
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,341
The one that came riding in back
at the train stop...

449
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,477
laughing and scratching, saying how good
it was to have something to do.

450
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,554
Grady, you're a pain in the neck.

451
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,393
Hell, everybody knows that.

452
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,840
- Get the woman.
- What?

453
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:45,531
Walk out there, where they can
get a good look at you. Go on.

454
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,942
It rubs me the wrong way,
hiding behind a woman, if you ask me.

455
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,140
Nobody did.

456
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,089
- What if they throw down on us?
- They won't.

457
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,793
But you've thought it all out. Maybe
they haven't. Maybe they haven't even...

458
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,004
- I thought you...
- So did I.

459
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,202
Let's get out of here.

460
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:27,863
I hope we're not depending on any luck
to get us back to that train stop.

461
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,907
- I think we just ran out.
- Not quite.

462
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,149
I thought somebody said
the gold was already dug.

463
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,711
Keep digging.

464
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,166
That'll get it.

465
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,495
- That's what it's all about.
- I'd say it's time to load the mules.

466
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,805
I wouldn't. We're staying here for a while.

467
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,874
- Staying?
- That's right.

468
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,676
Them 20 get up on that rim with rifles...

469
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,580
it could get a little hard to stay alive.

470
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,676
Yeah, but not as hard
as getting caught out in the open.

471
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,881
We've got to make a run for it
sooner or later.

472
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,618
Later, there may not be
so many of them around.

473
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:40,988
String a picket line over those flatcars.
The rest of you give him a hand.

474
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,262
You unload that mule. Bury the dynamite.

475
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,495
Bury it?

476
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,061
You wouldn't want to get blown
to hell for a stray bullet, would you?

477
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,667
No, sir.

478
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,016
If they see that Fargo box,
they'll hit us, won't they?

479
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,152
Just as hard as they can, Mrs. Lowe.

480
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,596
If you ask me, I say they're not
gonna jump us, not here.

481
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,491
Probably wait at the river
and catch us crossing.

482
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,227
What I'm trying to figure out is why
we're going back the way we came.

483
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,604
Apart from that village,
there's not a whole lot...

484
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,303
to hide behind
between us and that rail stop.

485
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:40,015
Lane says this is the closest way out.
Besides, we know the ground.

486
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,484
Yeah, we could get buried in it, too.

487
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,520
- Hell, a man can't live forever.
- Not around Lane, he can't.

488
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:55,963
Come to think of it,
it's the best way, anyway.

489
00:58:56,132 --> 00:59:00,091
- What's that?
- You and me, we can't get old.

490
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,833
What the hell use are we going to be
to anybody in a rocking chair?

491
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:09,805
- That's a long ways down the road.
- The hell it is.

492
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,911
You're not one damn day older than
you were the first time I ever met you.

493
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,281
Not outside, I ain't,
but it's inside that counts.

494
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,084
Time was I could get drunk
for a week, maybe two.

495
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,128
Now I go on a bender
for six or seven days...

496
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,722
and I get the blind staggers so bad,
I gotta get me to my bed.

497
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:35,535
When a man can't hold his liquor,
that's the first sign.

498
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,098
- What about your women?
- What about them?

499
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:42,667
Don't tell me you don't run them
as much as you used to.

500
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,852
Now, I wouldn't want this to get around...

501
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:56,047
but the last time I was over
to Kate's in Tucson...

502
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,719
I spent the whole night...

503
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,064
listening to a fellow play the piano.

504
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,866
- Could he play good?
- Worst I ever heard!

505
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,299
You just weren't in the mood.

506
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,566
I'm not getting any younger,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

507
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,801
Neither are you.

508
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,606
What the hell do you want me to do,
just roll over and die?

509
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,011
All I'm saying is, don't get old.

510
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,547
You'll live to regret it.

511
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:44,838
- Not yet.
- They'll be along.

512
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,212
I hope I don't let you down.

513
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,048
You planning to rob another bank?

514
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,419
No, sir, I mean when those 20 jump us.

515
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,521
- You'll be all right.
- I don't know.

516
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,424
I was thinking a few minutes ago that
I ought to get on my horse and get out.

517
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,763
Get out and never look back.

518
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:18,067
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

519
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,838
Why?

520
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:23,846
I don't know. Maybe I was afraid
you'd come after me.

521
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,776
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?

522
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,447
I hate to have to tell you this,
but whether you like it or not...

523
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,114
you're a man and you're stuck with it.

524
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:38,118
You'll find yourself standing your ground,
and fighting when you ought to run...

525
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,327
speaking out when you ought to keep
your mouth shut...

526
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:47,035
doing things that will seem wrong
to a lot of people...

527
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,762
but you'll do them all the same.

528
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,000
You mean like talking up
for me in Tucson?

529
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:56,442
- They were wrong.
- Not if I ain't all the things you think I am.

530
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,015
- Not if I turn and run.
- You won't.

531
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,575
You're going to spend the rest
of your life getting up one more time...

532
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,214
than you're knocked down,
so you better start getting used to it.

533
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,877
If any trouble starts, under there.

534
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,579
Cooking coffee again.

535
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,352
Like hell! Get under there.

536
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,995
- Ten men.
- So far.

537
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,466
- Maybe they'll give it up.
- They should.

538
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,404
- They can't shoot worth a damn.
- But they won't.

539
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,310
No, they won't.

540
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,780
Then maybe we should.

541
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,645
Your mind is as changeable
as the weather.

542
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,717
It's not a joke, Mr. Lane.

543
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,420
I tried to tell you that
before we left the train station.

544
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,560
- You wouldn't listen to me.
- Now you won't.

545
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,525
Not to turning it over to the likes of them.

546
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:04,930
But they're not going to...

547
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:09,062
I set out to get you and that gold
back to the railroad.

548
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,531
That's what I fully intend to do.

549
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,197
No matter what?

550
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,437
No matter what.

551
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,856
Lane, they'll more than likely
try and run the horses off tonight.

552
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,421
- You and Sam make sure they don't.
- We may need some help.

553
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,468
You won't get it.
The rest of us will be gone.

554
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,431
- Gone?
- To run off their horses.

555
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:47,197
Ben, dig up the dynamite.

556
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,452
They're running.

557
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,222
Not as fast as their horses.

558
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:00,530
Ben, you better take care of that leg.
I'll see if the woman's all right.

559
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,772
- What the hell are you doing up there?
- They needed help.

560
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,565
Get down.

561
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,085
Give me that.

562
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:22,149
You going to knock me
on my butt, Mr. Lane?

563
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,552
Maybe I should, at that.

564
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,896
Don't you think we better
get the hell out of here?

565
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,763
The sooner the better.

566
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,690
- Ben, how's your leg?
- It's getting better.

567
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,063
It'll be all right as long as I don't have
to wrangle that damn mule.

568
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,692
You don't have to worry about that.

569
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,636
As long as she's packing
that gold, we're in love!

570
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:54,433
- How about you?
- Are there any more rivers to cross?

571
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,138
- Just a little creek.
- I'll make it.

572
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,340
If them pallbearers jump us here,
they'll wish they hadn't.

573
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,418
You put old Jesse and me
up in that church tower...

574
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,047
with a couple of Winchesters,
they'll never know what hit them.

575
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,352
- We're not staying.
- How the hell come?

576
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,887
Did you ever bury a baby?

577
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,723
No.

578
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:24,634
Neither have I, and I don't intend to.
Not over gold. Let's move.

579
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,170
Better put some more wood on there.

580
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,502
Not too much. We don't want
them to think we're asking for it.

581
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,479
Can't say that I like this, Jesse.

582
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,187
We've done this once before,
during the war.

583
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,555
Me and Lane got up on the high ground...

584
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,720
left Grady sitting by a fire,
just like this one.

585
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:31,521
Blankets spread all around,
just like we were all sleeping.

586
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:36,360
We were trying to scald
them Rebs into the open.

587
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,670
They were driving off a lot of our horses.

588
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,642
- Did it work?
- It's according to how you look at it.

589
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,945
Long about morning,
me and Lane kind of fell asleep.

590
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:51,110
- When we woke up, Grady was gone.
- Gone?

591
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,222
Yeah, the Rebs sneaked in
and took him prisoner.

592
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,420
Never even fired a shot. If they had,
they wouldn't have got him.

593
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,692
I tried to talk Lane
into letting them keep him.

594
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,561
I think he would have, but he figured
it was our fault that he was took.

595
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:12,705
They kept him a week and it was
the best seven days of the war.

596
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,770
It's hard as hell to get to like Grady.

597
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,572
- Hell, he likes you.
- He's got to.

598
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:23,076
Me and Lane are the only ones
who will put up with him.

599
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,644
I've got to admit, though,
he's saved our hide a lot of times.

600
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,919
Jesse, after this is all over with...

601
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,723
do you suppose, maybe me and Sam
could stay along a while?

602
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,800
I figured you two would just roar off
and spend your share of the reward.

603
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:49,401
We can go together.
Find some women. Get drunk.

604
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,203
That beats the hell out of cold coffee.

605
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:57,412
- I figure we better get some shuteye.
- Shuteye?

606
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,386
Yeah, Lane will see
that we're not disturbed.

607
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:04,084
- What if he falls asleep like he did before?
- He won't.

608
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,718
Losing Grady is one thing.
Gold is something else.

609
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,162
Good night.

610
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:17,536
I hope so.

611
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:50,928
We better give them a rest.

612
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,501
Ben, you stay aboard.

613
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,808
It don't seem right,
those boys haven't showed up.

614
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:09,017
- Probably still on foot.
- I doubt that.

615
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,921
If those horses stop running,
they'll start thinking of water...

616
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,894
head for that river.

617
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,565
So many of them,
they won't be hard to track.

618
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,462
Yeah, they double back to the river...

619
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:26,106
pick up their saddles,
that'll throw them about a day behind.

620
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:30,008
It shouldn't. No mules to slow them down.

621
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,173
Then where the hell are they?

622
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,376
If I knew that, I could
get some sleep tonight.

623
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,929
Thank you. Hot.

624
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:28,827
We'll be at the train stop tomorrow.
And then what?

625
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,334
There's a north-bound
due through at midnight.

626
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,300
Any luck, then we can get you
and the gold on it...

627
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,642
before anybody else jumps us.

628
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:42,976
- You're not coming?
- I'll stay along with the boys.

629
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,886
After this, I'll probably have to buy them
a drink or two.

630
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,584
What about the reward?

631
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:54,725
You can tell the railroad
we'll drift by and pick it up.

632
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,960
That's all you do, isn't it? Drift.

633
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:02,470
You could say that.

634
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:06,132
- Doesn't seem like much of a life.
- It's not.

635
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,937
- Then why do you do it?
- It's what I'm good at.

636
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,943
- My husband was good at robbing trains.
- Your husband was a fool.

637
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,618
Because he got shot in the back
in a whorehouse?

638
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,985
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

639
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,827
For him or me?

640
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,564
The boy.

641
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,171
No matter how things turn out...

642
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:44,242
I want to thank you
for all that you've done and...

643
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,147
if you should change your mind
about coming back with me...

644
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,684
- I won't.
- But if you should...

645
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:56,055
I've got a saddle
that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe.

646
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,445
Get under the porch.

647
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,227
The Gold!

648
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:57,755
Lane, come over here!

649
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,469
- Look.
- Get him out of there.

650
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,037
Mule!

651
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:21,979
Something new!

652
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,655
Nail him!

653
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,916
- Quit worrying about that damn mule!
- It's not! It's the woman!

654
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,284
Look at that. They can't last
under there much longer.

655
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,687
- We're going to have to rush them.
- What good would that do?

656
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,367
Get the horse.

657
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,399
Come a-running!

658
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:55,307
- Are you hit?
- No. I'm all right.

659
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:31,779
Go on! Throw it!

660
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,175
Much obliged.

661
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,177
Go ahead, tell her.

662
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:50,554
Go on.

663
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:55,185
Ma'am, it's about the reward.
You see, we've been thinking...

664
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,188
if you go turn that gold in to the railroad...

665
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:02,066
there ain't going to be nothing left
for you and the boy to live on.

666
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:07,004
We've decided we want you
to have that $50,000.

667
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:11,140
I couldn't do that.

668
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,476
It's the only thing you can do.
We've already made up our minds.

669
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:19,979
- Ain't that right, Lane?
- That's right.

670
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,058
Thank you.

671
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:59,725
That was very touching, boys,
giving up that reward money.

672
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:04,422
- Who are you?
- I work for Wells Fargo.

673
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,335
- Pinkerton man?
- That's right.

674
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,507
I've been tracking Matt Lowe
for five years.

675
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,371
- He's dead.
- I know.

676
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:27,211
I was there the night he got shot
in that, shall we say, house of ill repute?

677
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,380
So was the woman. She worked there.

678
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:34,320
Mrs. Lowe?

679
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:37,523
Her name is Lilly, with two L's.

680
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,092
Matt Lowe was never married.

681
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,433
Better luck next time!

682
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,109
Lilly?

683
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,512
With two L's.

684
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,251
One of them must stand for "liar."

685
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:02,484
Where are you going?

686
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:05,492
Where the hell do you suppose?
To rob a train!

687
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:10,029
- To rob a train?
- It's something to do.

688
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:49,091
English
