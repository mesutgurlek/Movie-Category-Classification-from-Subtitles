1
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,796
Pull up!

2
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,077
Where you heading, mister?

3
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:28,082
That town called Río Arriba?

4
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:31,255
- That's right.
- That's where I'm heading.

5
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:34,884
Are you Mr Simms?

6
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:37,046
No.

7
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:44,391
The sheriff don't want any strangers in town.
Not till day after tomorrow.

8
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,053
- Then I'm in time.
- For what?

9
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,901
The hanging. Tomorrow, ain't it?

10
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,857
Yes. So just turn around and go back.

11
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,281
You're welcome to Río Arriba the day after.

12
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,776
I've ridden 100 miles to see this hanging.

13
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,489
That's for the sheriff to decide.
Unbuckle your gun belt.

14
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,631
Give me your rifle.

15
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:18,883
Don't take the hand off the butt.

16
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:24,728
Ride in slow. I go right behind you.

17
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,082
- Who is it?
- Shh. I don't know.

18
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,840
That's his office.

19
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:57,527
Picked him up on San Marcos Pass.
Said he came to see the hanging.

20
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:01,830
I told you not to let anybody through
except Simms. Get back and see you do it.

21
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:03,991
Yes, sir.

22
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:19,425
- Well, you got a name?
- Douglass.

23
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,551
Who are you looking for?

24
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:27,229
Did I say I was looking for somebody?

25
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:31,694
Río Arriba's a quiet little town.
We don't get many strangers here.

26
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,271
What do you want?

27
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,904
It's like your deputy said.

28
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,567
I come here to see the hanging.

29
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:44,872
- Where did you ride in from?
- Winthrop.

30
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:49,997
You rode 100 miles over the mountains
just to watch a hanging?

31
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,167
Uh-huh.

32
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,930
Know the men who are gonna die?

33
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,967
No.

34
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:05,811
You just like to watch hangings, is that it?

35
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:19,535
I'll keep your guns. You stay away
from this jail while you're in town.

36
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:25,034
- What time is the hanging?
- Six o'clock in the morning.

37
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:31,793
They start serving breakfast at the hotel
at 5:30. You can watch it on a full stomach.

38
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:02,906
- My name is Loomis. I own the bank.
- How do you do?

39
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,286
They shot my bank full of holes,
killed my teller.

40
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,249
But we caught 'em red-handed,
all four of 'em.

41
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,343
- No, sir. They didn't get a dime.
- When you hang 'em tomorrow, do it slow.

42
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,380
- Afraid you got me confused, young fella.
- Aren't you Mr Simms?

43
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:22,049
The hangman from Silver City?

44
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,520
No.

45
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:29,985
If you're not the hangman,
what are you doing here?

46
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:37,440
- Just passing through.
- Maybe he came here to help 'em break out.

47
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,656
Just looking to feed my horse
and find a hotel room.

48
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:44,698
Sir, I'm the hotel clerk.
I can find you a room. May I take your horse?

49
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,870
All right.

50
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:53,552
- You didn't answer my question, mister.
- I didn't hear you ask one.

51
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:58,714
- Wha's your business here in Río Arriba?
- Quinn! Put it down.

52
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:04,347
Ain't we got enough trouble
without you starting more?

53
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,942
Folks are a bit edgy today.

54
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:12,071
Might be a good idea
for you to stay in the hotel.

55
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,449
All right, break it up.

56
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:22,448
That's just what we're trying to avoid, a crowd.
You ought to know that. Come on, break it up.

57
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,115
- You going to church tonight, Tom?
- Emma?

58
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:29,920
- Yes, Father. Coming. Are you, Tom?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

59
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:33,840
Willie, take care of this horse.
Saturday, we gave 'em a fair trial.

60
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:39,350
We never had a hanging in this town. We had
to send to Silver City for a man to do the job.

61
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:41,972
We all thought you was him!

62
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,269
Well, it's not my line.

63
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:48,393
But if he don't show up,
I might accommodate you.

64
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:52,021
Tony.

65
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:58,947
- Take my horse and I'll meet you at the store.
- Yes, Miss Josefa.

66
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,202
Jim!

67
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:17,964
Josefa.

68
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:22,637
- It must be four years.
- it's closer to five.

69
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,151
Well, when I saw you crossing from the
courthouse, I just couldn't believe it was you.

70
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,809
I still can't believe it, Jim.

71
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,487
It's me all right.

72
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:39,036
This is an occasion. It deserves a celebration.

73
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:44,117
- Yes, it does.
- Come on. I'll buy you a beer.

74
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,715
- Diego, dos cervezas, por favor.
- Sí, señorita.

75
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,876
Le's sit here.

76
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,727
What brings you to Río Arriba, Jim?

77
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,346
Nice country.

78
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,979
What are you doing here?

79
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:12,019
I have some business with the sheriff's office.

80
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,237
Gracias, señor.

81
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,244
Have you been back to New Orleans?

82
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,244
No.

83
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,910
- We had fun.
- Uh-huh.

84
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:33,841
Since my father died,
I don't get to travel much.

85
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:39,137
- Where have you been?
- I got a little ranch outside Winthrop.

86
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:41,552
I never heard about it.

87
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:44,351
Small place.

88
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,647
Sometimes I wish mine were.

89
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,522
It's too much for a woman to handle.

90
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:53,281
- You never got married?
- No.

91
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:57,993
I just can't seem to find the right man.

92
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,203
Maybe you're too particular.

93
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,662
That's what my father said.

94
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:09,630
When we met in New Orleans...
I was husband-hunting.

95
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,632
You were?

96
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:18,134
I guess I...
I guess I did behave a little foolishly.

97
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,143
I don't know, maybe you were smart.

98
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,721
Did you ever marry?

99
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,816
Yes, I did.

100
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:33,111
Fine girl.

101
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,861
I'm sure.

102
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,338
I have to go.

103
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:50,716
- How long are you gonna be in town?
- Just until tomorrow.

104
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,719
Well...

105
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:57,510
It's good to see you again, Jim.

106
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:07,693
Amigo. Whiskey.

107
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,687
Sí, señor.

108
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:18,736
Willie! Take Mr Simms' horse to the stable.

109
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,832
I'll tell the sheriff you're here.

110
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:49,607
Mind if I join you?

111
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,772
Sit down.

112
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,243
Can I buy you a drink?

113
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,785
- I have mine.
- I hate to drink alone.

114
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,370
Oh, bartender? Whiskey.

115
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,711
Simms is the name, from Silver City.

116
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:18,891
I've come to perform
a little service for you folks.

117
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:33,152
Say, what does a man do
for a little recreation in this town?

118
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:35,484
At night, I mean.

119
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,530
I'm a stranger here, myself.

120
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,753
(sheriff) Mr Simms?

121
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,041
Oh, Sheriff. Come in and have a drink.

122
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:56,054
No, thanks. Would you care to inspect
the gallows and look at the prisoners?

123
00:14:56,141 --> 00:15:00,637
There's plenty of time for that.
Had a long trip. Think I'd like to freshen up.

124
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:04,394
- Your room's ready, Mr Simms.
- Oh, thank you.

125
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:08,230
I hope I see you again, sir.

126
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,443
Of course, not professionally.

127
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,066
I'll drop over to the jail this afternoon.

128
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:32,628
Sheriff?

129
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:39,303
I wonder if I could see the prisoners.

130
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:45,314
- You said you didn't know 'em.
- I never met 'em, but I think I know 'em.

131
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:51,980
Did they do you a bad turn?

132
00:15:56,037 --> 00:16:00,201
I've been following them for six months.
Tracking 'em up and down the state.

133
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:06,045
It's a relief to catch up with them and
find out the law's gonna do the job for me.

134
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:11,007
- You're sure they're the same bunch?
- Two white men, a half-breed and an Indian?

135
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:16,718
That's them. We never had anything like it in
Río Arriba before. I'll be glad when it's over.

136
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,679
You're wasting good lumber.
A tree would have done.

137
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,435
They were sentenced to be hanged,
not lynched.

138
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,670
- Primo?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,764
- They giving you any trouble?
- No.

140
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,232
- Feed 'em?
- They ate.

141
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,610
All right, come here.

142
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,442
On your feet! All of you!

143
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,862
(chuckling)

144
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,704
I said move! Now!

145
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,592
- Can you spare a smoke, stranger?
- Shut up!

146
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:38,971
What are you gonna do? Punish us if we talk?

147
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,894
I was hoping you'd bring us a woman, Sheriff.

148
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,734
Like to know their names?

149
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,826
No.

150
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,127
Much obliged.

151
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,839
Who's that, Sheriff?

152
00:18:55,725 --> 00:19:00,553
- Don't you know him?
- I never saw him before in my life.

153
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,055
He came to see you hang.

154
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,684
- This is the last night. Watch 'em.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,645
And don't talk to 'em.
If they want anything, call me.

156
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,898
- Sheriff?
- Hm?

157
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:15,326
You think I might get off
long enough to go to church tonight?

158
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,986
I'll see. I'll do what I can.

159
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,849
- Parral, Father Bailey's here to see you.
- I told you to keep him outta here!

160
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:41,147
- Your mother's with him.
- I don't wanna see her either!

161
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:50,441
Primo.

162
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:53,154
- What time is it?
- I don't talk to you.

163
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:56,328
You're the only one
we got nothing against, Primo.

164
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,450
Primo takes good care of us. We all love him.

165
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:02,918
- Well, I don't love you.
- Sure you do!

166
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:07,333
First time I have a little niño,
I'm gonna name him Primo, after you.

167
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:13,054
You joke when you should be praying.

168
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,383
(sawing)

169
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:29,022
Get down!

170
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:43,203
What you thinking, Zach?

171
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:47,084
Wondering who that stranger is.

172
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:51,422
- The way he looked, he didn't come to help.
- I can't place him.

173
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:55,725
He seemed to know you.
He looked at you the hardest.

174
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,968
- Luján.
- Mm?

175
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,268
You ever see that man before?

176
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:04,021
No, but he's got the face of a hunter.

177
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,946
Zach, we don't have much time.

178
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,067
- Don't you think we know that?
- We can't just wait here.

179
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,411
Go ahead, bang your head on the bars
and yell. They'll hang you right now.

180
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,201
(bells ringing)

181
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:46,392
Why, you say the darndest things sometimes.
Good evening, Mr Steinmetz.

182
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:48,859
Hello, Tom.

183
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:51,486
Emma, you know where
I put my stomach powders?

184
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,493
- Oh, yes, Father.
- Would you get me one?

185
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,655
Just in case.

186
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,917
Tom, Emma is a fine girl.

187
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,162
Yes, sir. I think so too.

188
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:10,923
The worlïs big and there are many wonderful
places in it, and I'd like Emma to see them.

189
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:14,429
- Well, sir, I want...
- Let me finish, Tom.

190
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:20,721
I was a pedlar when I came here. It's taken a
quarter of a century to make what I got today.

191
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:23,388
And now I am too old to enjoy it.

192
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:29,277
I want Emma to enjoy it.

193
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:33,280
But not in this out-of-the-way small town.

194
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,364
I want her to marry some man
who lives in Philadelphia or Boston.

195
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:43,037
Has his business there.
Mixes with educated people.

196
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,840
- Am I wrong to want that for her, Tom?
- No, sir.

197
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:55,385
Right now, Emma thinks she loves you.
I guess she does.

198
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:58,762
But she's never had a chance
to meet anyone else.

199
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,428
I want to give her that chance.

200
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:11,444
- Now, what has he been telling you?
- About Philadelphia and Boston.

201
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,571
Gosh. Wouldn't you love to go there?

202
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:22,584
- Good evening, Sheriff.
- Good evening, Mr Steinmetz.

203
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,878
Emma. Tom.

204
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:34,516
Must be big doings in church tonight.
Looks like everyone in town is going.

205
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,061
That's right.
It's our annual novena to St Anthony.

206
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:47,648
- Would you like to look at the prisoners?
- I'd like to finish my cigar first.

207
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:51,689
All right, there's no hurry.
Finish your cigar.

208
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:55,027
I think I'll stretch my legs.

209
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,735
(knock at door)

210
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:29,229
It's open.

211
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,150
Jim?

212
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:34,486
Come in.

213
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,538
I'm on my way to church.
I thought that you might like to go.

214
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,248
I don't go to church any more.

215
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:50,421
Jim, I... I don't understand.

216
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:54,182
Very simple - I just don't go.

217
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,267
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

218
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,613
Josefa.

219
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,752
If you'll allow me, I'll walk you there.

220
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,913
Of course.

221
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,267
Stay down.

222
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:06,957
- Think the sheriff would let us go to church?
- No.

223
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:15,600
It's all right if I look at it
from the window, isn't it?

224
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:17,762
All right.

225
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,251
Everyone's going to church.

226
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:54,598
You think they'd pray for us, Primo?

227
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:03,189
Primo.

228
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:05,685
Will you pray for us?

229
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,940
You want me to?

230
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,533
You're a good man, Primo.
Goïll listen to you.

231
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:18,241
- What should I pray for?
- That we go to heaven.

232
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,995
I can't do that.

233
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,006
But I will pray that God will forgive you.

234
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,499
I'll settle for that.

235
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,636
Was it Tucker?

236
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:41,732
How soon, do you think,
before he'll make his try?

237
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,190
When everyone's in church.

238
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:46,770
No talking!

239
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:50,280
I'm praying, Primo.

240
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:53,283
Do you have any children, Jim?

241
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,622
- Little girl.
- How old is she?

242
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,748
Three.

243
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:00,911
Pretty?

244
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,372
She's pretty.

245
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:06,625
Like her mother was.

246
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,795
"Was"?

247
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,674
She's dead.

248
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:19,222
I'm sorry.

249
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,273
- Good evening, Sheriff.
- Evening, Josefa.

250
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,405
You must have been very much in love.

251
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,617
Still am.

252
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,246
(Simms) Beautiful evening, isn't it?

253
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,213
Yes, it is.

254
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,809
Thanks, Josefa.

255
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:59,683
Guess I needed to talk to a woman.

256
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:05,979
There's a woman inside
I think you might do well to talk to.

257
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,989
(choir sings)

258
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:40,189
Well, should we take a look
at our bad boys now?

259
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:42,351
Fine.

260
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,990
- Primo?
- Yes, sir.

261
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,704
- Everything all right?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,916
You go on to church now.
Mr Simms is with me.

263
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:07,128
- Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you, Mr Simms.
- And Primo...

264
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,514
Come back as soon as the service is over.
Mr Simms may wanna get to bed early.

265
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,758
Oh, That's all right, Sheriff.

266
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:18,430
- Take your time. Don't worry about me.
- Thank you, sir.

267
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:32,240
All right. On your feet, all of you.

268
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,406
Over here.

269
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,930
Can't we have
a little more light in here, Sheriff?

270
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:55,393
- Sure.
- I'd like to get a good idea of size and weight.

271
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,404
Hold him up while I get the key.

272
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:16,791
- There's a key dropped on the floor.
- All right, get it.

273
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,500
- I can't reach it.
- Reach with the dipper.

274
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,672
Reach!

275
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,967
Reach!

276
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,804
Blanket.

277
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,521
Come on!

278
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:05,668
(choir singing)

279
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:58,431
(whispers)

280
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:07,839
- We take her along.
- She'll slow us down.

281
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,600
They won't rush us as long as we've got her.

282
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,759
Get the horses.

283
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:33,533
I think we're all aware of the shadow
that has fallen over Río Arriba.

284
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:37,207
The gallows cast a shadow even at night.

285
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:40,081
Tomorrow four men are to die.

286
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:44,751
That they die is the just
fulfilment of Caesar's law.

287
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:51,262
But I remind you that these four men are
also creatures of God, eligible for His mercy.

288
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:53,509
Pray for them as He would.

289
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:58,767
If you recall,
there was also scaffolding at Golgotha.

290
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:05,573
And Christ, bleeding and dying, took time in
his agony to turn and pardon a common thief.

291
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:09,734
Remember that tomorrow.

292
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:14,121
For all of you, i'll be daybreak.

293
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:19,368
But for these four men...
i'll be the midnight of their lives.

294
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,624
Your prayers will help them.

295
00:35:28,514 --> 00:35:30,591
(choir singing)

296
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:53,990
(sheriff) Help!

297
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,621
Help!

298
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,916
Help!

299
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,830
Wha's the matter? Que pasa?

300
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,790
(gunshots)

301
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:04,856
Emma!

302
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:07,400
Emma!

303
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,362
Emma!

304
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:16,167
- Here's her purse.
- Emma!

305
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,165
- Emma!
- Emma!

306
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,962
- How's the sheriff?
- He's badly hurt.

307
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,130
(man) Everybody, come on, le's go!
Get your horses and guns!

308
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:28,510
- Get your gun and horse. Le's go.
- Where?

309
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,181
- After 'em!
- They stole five horses!

310
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:34,975
We can't find Emma. They've taken her.

311
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:38,100
Josefa! They've taken Emma.

312
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:41,810
Wha'll I do? Please help me. Please!

313
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:46,946
Mr Steinmetz, we'll all help. I'll get
my horse and go with you. Come on, Jim.

314
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:51,697
You can't overtake 'em tonight
before they get to San Marcos Pass.

315
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:56,915
- One of 'em can hold that against a hundred.
- Aren't you coming with us?

316
00:37:57,003 --> 00:38:01,582
It's gonna be a long hard chase.
I could use some sleep. I'll wait till morning.

317
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:07,963
Do you mean to tell me, after wha's
happened, you can just go and sleep?

318
00:38:08,057 --> 00:38:09,337
Yes.

319
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,556
And then what?

320
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:15,143
I'm gonna find them, if it's the last thing I do.

321
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:18,021
Good night.

322
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:39,747
- What do you think?
- With the woman, they can overtake us.

323
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,467
Taylor, stay here and hold them off
till sundown. We'll head for Elder Gorge.

324
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,427
We'll wait for you there.

325
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:48,423
- Please let me go!
- Later.

326
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:55,183
- Please. My father will give you anything.
- I've already got all he can give me.

327
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,651
(Primo) Everybody, le's go! Come on!

328
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:04,148
Quinn, how about those boys back there?

329
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,529
Come on!

330
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:09,987
Quinn! Steinmetz! Le's go.

331
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:23,938
Get your horse, go into town and get a wagon
here. Take this man down with the others.

332
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:30,285
Primo, Murphy looks bad. There's nothing
I can do. You've gotta get him out of here.

333
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:39,248
Do what you can. I've sent for a wagon.

334
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:43,834
(Primo) All we can do is wait.
Then we'll follow them over the pass.

335
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:46,300
Once they get to the desert,
we can circle 'em.

336
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:49,141
- (Tom) We can lose 'em.
- They got Emma!

337
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:52,926
- I'm not going to take that chance.
- (Douglass) Hold it! Wait.

338
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:57,601
Primo's right. You can't rush 'em.

339
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:02,316
But don't worry about losing her.

340
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:07,282
What do you know? Who are you? You're
a stranger. You say, "You can't rush them."

341
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:13,490
That's all right for you, but my daughter's
in danger. Maybe you want us to lose them.

342
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:19,420
I've been following them for six months.
I'm not gonna lose 'em now.

343
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,754
If I was you...

344
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:31,052
I'd pick out 12 of these men
and send the rest of 'em home.

345
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:33,896
Especially the old fella
and the lady over there.

346
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,930
- I can't send Mr Steinmetz home.
- He'll not do any good and get in the way.

347
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,102
He won't leave.

348
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,007
I'm sorry.

349
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:23,521
Primo just told me you don't want me along.

350
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:26,071
Well, That's right.

351
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,205
Emma's gonna need me
when we catch up with them.

352
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:37,125
With you along,
we might not catch up with them.

353
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:41,258
You might get hurt.
I wouldn't want to see that.

354
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,466
Are you worried about me?

355
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:49,012
These are mean men we're after.

356
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:51,390
They're real mean.

357
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:07,741
- For the gorge you must turn off here.
- You still like that idea?

358
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:11,529
- Yes. We told Taylor we'd wait there.
- We'd move faster on the desert.

359
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:14,162
That's where they'll be looking for us.

360
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:17,372
If we keep moving,
we can reach the border in two days.

361
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:21,675
In the desert we can only ride at night.
Two days and we'll burn up.

362
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,298
- She won't last a day.
- Why do we need her?

363
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:30,640
I need her. We'll head for the gorge and hole
up there till they stop searching. Lead, Luján.

364
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,364
- What do you think, Mr Douglass?
- Sun's going down.

365
00:44:22,448 --> 00:44:25,615
That's what he waited for.
We can't track 'em by night.

366
00:44:25,702 --> 00:44:31,123
- Le's move ahead as long as we can see.
- Everybody, get mounted!

367
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,272
Somebody build a fire. Start up some coffee.

368
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,748
Can't we go on? Just you and me?

369
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:26,671
- Be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
- Yeah, but I'm worried about Emma.

370
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,767
Suppose we were lucky enough
to stumble across 'em.

371
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,807
You don't think they'd give up
without a fight?

372
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:37,358
- She'd be the first they'd kill.
- Here is one of them! Here he is!

373
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,733
Come on, all of you!

374
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:42,690
Come here, all of you! Help!

375
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,988
I found one of them!

376
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,579
There he is. See? Must be one of them.

377
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,551
This is not one of them.

378
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,964
That must be the real Mr Simms.

379
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:23,772
- Got a timepiece?
- No, sir.

380
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,196
Here.

381
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:28,363
Take mine.

382
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,786
You go back to the rim of the gorge.

383
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:35,624
- Then fire a shot every five minutes.
- But what good will that do?

384
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:39,378
Sound carries a long way
in these canyons. They'll hear it.

385
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:43,168
Make 'em wonder. Keep 'em up all night.

386
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:46,264
Take their minds off Emma.

387
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:51,554
One of us will relieve him every hour.

388
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:53,722
Keep it up all night.

389
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:09,820
You take turns standing watch.

390
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:12,620
I'll look after the horses.

391
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,790
I'll take the last tour. You'll take the first.

392
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:21,301
I'll take the first watch. Can't sleep anyway.

393
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:33,886
- Taylor.
- Yeah?

394
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,814
When we get out of this,
you wanna stick with me or split up?

395
00:47:38,904 --> 00:47:43,032
- Well, I haven't given it much thought.
- I have.

396
00:47:43,117 --> 00:47:47,578
You're a good man, Taylor.
I should hate to lose you.

397
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:53,042
Well, I sort of like having
a man behind me I can count on.

398
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:55,832
That Parral's a louse.

399
00:47:55,922 --> 00:48:00,134
The Injun makes me nervous.
Never know wha's going on inside his head.

400
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:05,046
- I never crossed a man that rode with me.
- Well, neither did I.

401
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,298
I need you with me.

402
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:10,219
That goes double.

403
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:14,476
I got one weakness
I feel you should know about.

404
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,602
Wha's that?

405
00:48:20,406 --> 00:48:22,529
Women.

406
00:48:22,992 --> 00:48:27,037
Every man's entitled
to one weakness. Mine's cards.

407
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:33,412
You think Luján
needs some help with the horses?

408
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:37,579
Well now, he just might.

409
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:58,227
Is that silk?

410
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,397
(gunshot)

411
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:08,957
Where'd that come from?

412
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,786
- Where'd that shot come from?
- It's an old trick. They wanna keep us awake.

413
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:19,463
Get back on watch.

414
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:27,349
Go to sleep. You never hear
the shot that kills you.

415
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:49,429
Well, they were here all right.
Not too long ago.

416
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:53,558
Looks like those shots of ours
changed their path.

417
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,853
Tracks show they went down the gorge.

418
00:50:56,945 --> 00:50:58,439
Yeah.

419
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,484
Could be the Indian's thinking,
to throw us off.

420
00:51:51,669 --> 00:51:53,994
Stop that, you idiot!

421
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:59,165
- I want Emma to know we're following.
- Now they all know!

422
00:52:00,136 --> 00:52:02,461
You said we'd lose them in the gorge.

423
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:05,129
They're smarter than you thought, red man.

424
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:08,558
There's only one man
that could have followed us down here.

425
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:12,725
The one with the eyes of the hunter.
The strange one.

426
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:17,395
- That the sheriff brought to jail to look at us.
- He's right.

427
00:52:17,487 --> 00:52:19,979
I saw him with the posse
up in San Marcos Pass.

428
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:23,490
Well, who is he? Wha's he dogging us for?

429
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:28,201
- Maybe she knows.
- I never saw him before he came.

430
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,208
- Why did he come?
- To watch you hang.

431
00:52:32,336 --> 00:52:34,874
- It's the truth!
- Let her go!

432
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:41,712
- He must know one of you.
- Maybe it's you he's after.

433
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:45,849
How could he be? I never saw him before.

434
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:52,186
No. He don't look like no banker.
Or the owner of any place we ever robbed.

435
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:56,057
Le's kill him. Then the others can't follow us.

436
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:59,771
- It's a good idea. You do it.
- Can't Luján do it?

437
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:04,444
No. We need Luján to take us to the border.
You catch up with us tonight.

438
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:07,242
- Why me?
- It was your idea!

439
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:15,099
What is it, Mr Douglass?

440
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,441
You see movement up there in that tall grass?

441
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:19,906
(Tom) No, sir.

442
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:23,241
I think there's a man there,
waiting for us to come in range.

443
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:26,032
Why don't we make him fire first?

444
00:54:26,122 --> 00:54:29,787
- Then one of us would be dead.
- We gonna wait for sundown again?

445
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:31,952
Primo.

446
00:54:33,797 --> 00:54:35,955
You take the lead.

447
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:41,636
You and the others circle the hill.
Stay just outside rifle range of that tall grass.

448
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:43,880
I'll go up the other side.

449
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:52,982
- Why are you doing this for us, Mr Douglass?
- I'm not doing it for you.

450
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:31,515
Come on.

451
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:38,483
Come on. Keep moving.

452
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:43,408
- I'm waiting for you.
- I'm here.

453
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,448
Drop it.

454
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:37,832
You remember that woman?

455
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,003
No.

456
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:47,342
Now look at it.

457
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,148
- No.
- You're lying!

458
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:57,106
I never saw her before. I swear I didn't.

459
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:59,569
You stopped at my ranch six months ago.

460
00:56:59,658 --> 00:57:02,861
I never saw your ranch.
I don't even know where it is.

461
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,824
- There were four of you.
- We never did.

462
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:08,488
Please. You gotta believe me.

463
00:57:10,753 --> 00:57:13,873
She begged. And cried.

464
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:16,041
And pleaded too, didn't she?

465
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:19,300
"Please, leave me alone. I have a baby."

466
00:57:19,387 --> 00:57:22,056
"I have a husband. Please, leave me alone."

467
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,426
"Take anything you want,
but please leave me alone."

468
00:57:25,518 --> 00:57:28,092
Didn't she? But it didn't help much.

469
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:33,609
I never saw that face before. I was never
on your ranch. I never did anything to you.

470
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:36,611
Which one of you? Which one of you did it?

471
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:38,773
I didn't do it.

472
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:43,282
I've done some bad things. Robbed. Stole.

473
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:49,124
- I've run cattle. But I never killed no woman.
- Talk! There were four of you. Which one?

474
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,953
Which one?

475
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:55,339
Don't do it. Please let me live.
Please let me live. Please.

476
00:57:55,425 --> 00:58:00,003
I've got a wife and baby, too. Don't do it.
Please don't do it. I'll do anything.

477
00:58:00,096 --> 00:58:03,715
Then it was all four of you!

478
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,635
(gunshot)

479
00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:11,894
Holy Mother, help...

480
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:01,525
- Morning, Father.
- Morning, Josefa.

481
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,695
- How's the sheriff?
- Much better.

482
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:05,412
Good.

483
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:09,994
Poor Mrs Parral. I feel so sorry for her.

484
00:59:10,086 --> 00:59:12,162
Yeah.

485
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:20,385
It's hard to believe. One child can bring
so much happiness, so much grief.

486
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:25,351
Any news of Primo and the men?

487
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,716
No.

488
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:29,599
- Douglass has gone with them, hasn't he?
- Yes.

489
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,608
- He came to church with you.
- Yes.

490
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,192
Do you know him?

491
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:39,357
Years ago.

492
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,491
I hadn't seen him in five years.

493
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,449
But he's changed.

494
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,910
What happened to him, Father?

495
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,298
Quite a lot.
He was out tending his cattle.

496
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:59,084
Came home one evening to find
that his house had been ransacked

497
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:02,465
and his wife had been raped and murdered.

498
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:06,805
- How awful.
- I think That's what brought him to Río Arriba.

499
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:10,431
Jim Douglass is not the kind of man
to just watch a hanging.

500
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:14,605
Must be some connection between
those men and what happened at the ranch.

501
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:18,314
I think that Jim must believe
that those men committed the crime.

502
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:22,737
- Did they?
- Nobody knows. I doubt if Jim knows.

503
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:25,402
But his child. What happened to the child?

504
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:29,662
A ranch hand and his wife
are taking care of her.

505
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:37,337
That child could have been mine.

506
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:43,847
I was in love with Jim Douglass
and he asked me to marry him.

507
01:00:43,934 --> 01:00:46,852
I didn't have the sense to say yes.

508
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:51,638
You'd have married a good man.

509
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:55,602
How do I get to his ranch?

510
01:00:56,531 --> 01:01:01,608
After San Marcos Pass,
you take the Winthrop road to Canyon Diablo.

511
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:04,194
There'll be a small stone cabin.

512
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:14,379
- You think Parral got our man?
- I hope they got each other.

513
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,337
Look.

514
01:01:17,428 --> 01:01:20,001
Yeah. There's Parral now.

515
01:01:23,142 --> 01:01:26,262
He got our man. I feel better.

516
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:31,014
That's not Parral.

517
01:01:31,526 --> 01:01:33,602
It's the hunter.

518
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,654
- How could they have caught us so soon?
- They haven't.

519
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:40,446
It's only one man.

520
01:01:42,204 --> 01:01:46,118
(Taylor) Well, we can handle
one man easy enough.

521
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:49,209
He's marking a trail for the posse.

522
01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:54,712
- Le's wait for him.
- And let the posse gain on us?

523
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:57,418
- Go on. I'll catch up with you.
- Why you?

524
01:01:57,511 --> 01:02:02,387
I'm a better shot.
And I don't like a man dogging my trail.

525
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:13,414
What do you think, Luján?

526
01:05:14,342 --> 01:05:17,213
There's sure to be someone there.

527
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:21,254
- Then we'll get something to eat.
- We need fresh horses more than food.

528
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,470
Then we'll get both. Come back here!

529
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,432
(horse whinnies)

530
01:05:48,503 --> 01:05:51,457
Now, where did you think you were going?

531
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:55,380
Aw, don't cry. I'm not gonna make you walk.

532
01:05:56,261 --> 01:06:00,805
I'm gonna let you ride.
Right up here, next to me.

533
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:05,225
We haven't seen Douglass
since he killed Parral.

534
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:07,601
He must have gone back.

535
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:17,278
Douglass didn't go back.

536
01:06:18,368 --> 01:06:20,444
Look.

537
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:07,326
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

538
01:07:09,254 --> 01:07:12,540
Can you spare a little food?
We haven't eaten all day.

539
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:16,417
- Fooïs pretty scarce around these parts.
- (sniffs)

540
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:21,381
We're willing to pay for hospitality.

541
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:24,181
- Where you heading?
- Río Arriba.

542
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,722
Well, you're lost.
You're headed in the wrong direction.

543
01:07:27,816 --> 01:07:30,900
Río Arriba's across the Diablo in the north.

544
01:07:30,986 --> 01:07:33,987
You can spare a little grub
for the lady, can't you?

545
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:38,319
- I guess so.
- We'd be satisfied with a cup of coffee.

546
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:51,710
You know what happened to your horse?

547
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:55,002
- Just one word and you'll get the same.
- I won't talk.

548
01:07:55,094 --> 01:07:57,170
Eggs!

549
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:15,281
- Where can we get a couple of horses?
- Well, the...

550
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:18,201
Douglass ranch
is about four miles west of here.

551
01:08:18,285 --> 01:08:22,449
But I don't know
if they've got any horses or not.

552
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,241
Don't get any foolish ideas.

553
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:46,472
Wha's that?

554
01:08:46,565 --> 01:08:49,103
- It's gold.
- Them's my teeth.

555
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,269
- Where's your gold?
- I haven't any.

556
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:56,439
- What are you mining for?
- Silver. So far I haven't found any.

557
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:08,459
Well...

558
01:09:08,546 --> 01:09:13,541
- I gotta get back to work.
- Go ahead. Don't let us stop you.

559
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,647
What did he take?

560
01:09:42,623 --> 01:09:45,115
Go and see what it was.

561
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:17,776
(screaming)

562
01:10:26,044 --> 01:10:28,202
(Emma) No!

563
01:10:28,296 --> 01:10:30,372
(screams)

564
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:38,593
(screaming)

565
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:03,872
- Le's go. The posse's coming!
- Go ahead. I'll be along.

566
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:06,829
I said now!

567
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,519
Come.

568
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,140
There's the miner's cabin.

569
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:37,942
Douglass' ranch should be
about four more miles west.

570
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:44,407
Who's that?

571
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:54,050
You know, that looks like Jim Douglass.

572
01:12:06,858 --> 01:12:09,016
Jim!

573
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:11,482
- I'm glad I caught up with you.
- Why?

574
01:12:11,571 --> 01:12:17,491
Jim, why don't you stop this mad chase
after these men and let them go?

575
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:24,200
You can't undo wha's been done.
And you have a child to think of.

576
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:27,626
How can you be so sure these are the men?

577
01:13:01,582 --> 01:13:03,325
Come here.

578
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:12,211
Look at this.
That's John Butler, my neighbour.

579
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:19,013
Poor devil never harmed anybody in his life.
Now they've killed him.

580
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:23,016
Le's get him in the house.

581
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,199
(Josefa) Jim!

582
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:39,068
Jim, come here! Come quickly! Emma!

583
01:13:52,468 --> 01:13:55,173
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

584
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:03,104
Mr Steinmetz, hurry!

585
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:07,933
We've found Emma.
She's here, in the house.

586
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,067
- How is she?
- I don't know.

587
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:18,703
- (sobbing)
- (Josefa) Please don't worry, Emma.

588
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,326
Everything's fine now. Really it is.

589
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,950
Look, Tom's here and your father's here.

590
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,546
Jim!

591
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:41,758
I know how you feel.
Go after them, Jim, and catch them.

592
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:46,314
Get them before...
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

593
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:55,608
Primo.

594
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,789
You take your men and head for the border.

595
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:02,542
I'm going by my place
to pick up a fresh horse.

596
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:05,662
- I'll meet you at the river.
- Yes, sir.

597
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:08,042
Everybody! Get moving!

598
01:15:14,596 --> 01:15:17,087
All right, le's get going.

599
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,150
Juanita!

600
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:41,073
Juanita. Juanita.

601
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:45,494
Juanita.

602
01:15:47,922 --> 01:15:49,999
Alguien viene a caballo.

603
01:15:50,091 --> 01:15:52,168
No los veo.

604
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:58,008
Parece tu padre. No los conozco.

605
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:12,479
Señor Douglass.

606
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:19,617
Hace rato vinieron dos hombres, se llevaron
dos caballos y se fueron hacia el río.

607
01:16:21,374 --> 01:16:25,668
Se llevaron los mejores caballos.
¿ Qué hacemos? Lo siento mucho.

608
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:29,004
Elena y yo estábamos solas.
Pablo se fue a trabajar.

609
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:32,376
Está bien, Juanita. No te apures.

610
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:36,170
We're not far behind,
but they took the only horses that were here.

611
01:16:36,265 --> 01:16:38,886
Helen, this is Josefa.

612
01:16:39,935 --> 01:16:43,636
She's a good friend of mine.
A very good friend.

613
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:47,349
- I want you to stay with her until I get back.
- Yes.

614
01:16:52,115 --> 01:16:54,688
I don't know when tha'll be.

615
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:58,829
I'll take care of her.
Just as if she were my own.

616
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:03,749
I guess I haven't been much of a father.

617
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,165
Bye.

618
01:17:14,054 --> 01:17:16,130
God bless you, Jim.

619
01:17:49,842 --> 01:17:52,547
It looks like it all right.

620
01:17:58,643 --> 01:18:01,560
Mr Douglass, here are the tracks.

621
01:18:02,438 --> 01:18:06,057
This is where they crossed the river.

622
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:07,775
Mr Douglass!

623
01:18:08,611 --> 01:18:11,731
This is the international border.
We can't go further.

624
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:13,899
I can.

625
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:57,531
Señora, did you see two men
on horseback cross the river here today?

626
01:18:57,621 --> 01:18:59,530
No entiendo.

627
01:18:59,623 --> 01:19:03,455
¿ Vio a dos hombres a caballo
cruzar el río por aquí hoy?

628
01:19:03,544 --> 01:19:05,584
Ah, sí. Mire.

629
01:19:05,671 --> 01:19:08,625
Bajaron allí, luego cruzaron el río,

630
01:19:08,716 --> 01:19:14,055
dieron la vuelta y se fueron a San Cristóbal.

631
01:19:14,138 --> 01:19:17,056
San Cristóbal. ¿Para dónde hay que ir a eso?

632
01:19:17,142 --> 01:19:19,977
Mire. San Cristóbal está...

633
01:19:20,061 --> 01:19:25,400
Se va usted por aquí, da la vuelta, sube
y un poco más adelante está San Cristóbal.

634
01:19:25,484 --> 01:19:28,319
¿A qué distancia queda?

635
01:19:28,403 --> 01:19:31,321
- Como a 20 km.
- Muchas gracias.

636
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:44,018
- Otro copa para la señorita.
- Si, Señor.

637
01:20:44,108 --> 01:20:45,732
Y...

638
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:14,669
Who are you?

639
01:21:14,765 --> 01:21:17,054
What do you want with me?

640
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:20,514
- Look at it.
- I see it.

641
01:21:20,604 --> 01:21:23,095
What of it? It's a watch.

642
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,479
Look at the picture.

643
01:21:34,827 --> 01:21:37,318
What about her? Who is she?

644
01:21:38,873 --> 01:21:43,666
- You remember her.
- I never saw that woman before in my life.

645
01:21:43,753 --> 01:21:47,253
Now get outta here.
I'm tired of you dogging my trail.

646
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,417
She was my wife.

647
01:21:51,887 --> 01:21:54,176
Raped and killed by you.

648
01:21:54,264 --> 01:21:59,888
I tell you I never saw that woman before
in my life. Now get away from me!

649
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:02,055
(screaming)

650
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:19,865
(horses galloping)

651
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:38,493
(chickens squawking)

652
01:23:49,135 --> 01:23:52,967
Pablo, qué bueno que llegaste.
Bendito sea Dios que llegaste.

653
01:23:53,055 --> 01:23:58,181
Mira, Ángela. Tenemos todo el dinero
necesario para el resto de la vida. Cógelo.

654
01:23:58,269 --> 01:24:03,809
- Sí, pero el niño está enfermo.
- ¿Que está enfermo? ¿Desde cuándo?

655
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,186
- Desde hace mucho.
- Vente.

656
01:24:14,286 --> 01:24:17,620
- Tiene mucha fiebre.
- Sí, pobrecito.

657
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:22,538
Necesitamos refrescarle la frente.

658
01:24:22,628 --> 01:24:25,380
Bueno, le voy a poner un poquito de agua.

659
01:24:25,464 --> 01:24:27,955
A ver si se le quita la fiebre.

660
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:34,640
Pero es que no hay agua.
Voy a buscar un poquito. Vengo enseguida.

661
01:24:34,724 --> 01:24:38,224
(boy) No hay agua. No hay agua.

662
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:08,709
Mientras cuidas al niño,
te voy a hacer algo de comer.

663
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,594
Where's the Indian
who rode up here on that horse?

664
01:25:16,685 --> 01:25:20,848
Perdone, señor, no le entiendo nada.
Mi hijo está muy enfermo.

665
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:24,059
Mi esposo fue a traer agua al arroyo.

666
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:32,742
¿Quién es usted? ¿Qué va a hacer?

667
01:25:45,256 --> 01:25:47,830
Ese hombre te quería matar.

668
01:26:11,075 --> 01:26:13,151
Ángela.

669
01:26:14,954 --> 01:26:17,030
Traele algo de comer.

670
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:47,937
Eat.

671
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:51,943
Why don't you kill me?
I came here to kill you.

672
01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:54,193
I have no reason to kill you.

673
01:26:54,287 --> 01:26:56,445
Why do you hunt me?

674
01:27:08,927 --> 01:27:11,216
Just look at that picture.

675
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:21,102
- Your wife and baby?
- Yeah.

676
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:26,396
She's very pretty.

677
01:27:26,487 --> 01:27:29,061
My wife and baby, they are pretty.

678
01:27:36,915 --> 01:27:39,620
Why do you hunt me?

679
01:27:39,709 --> 01:27:43,079
- You ever see that woman before?
- No.

680
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:48,593
There were four men. Two white men,
a half-breed and an Indian.

681
01:27:49,428 --> 01:27:52,049
They robbed my ranch house
and killed my wife.

682
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,926
I have never seen your ranch.

683
01:27:55,017 --> 01:27:57,804
The horse you rode up here
you stole from my ranch!

684
01:27:57,895 --> 01:28:03,103
I did not know that was your ranch
and I didn't see any woman.

685
01:28:03,568 --> 01:28:07,316
If you've never been to my ranch,
where'd you get this money?

686
01:28:07,405 --> 01:28:10,525
That I took from a miner
I met in Canyon Diablo.

687
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:13,820
We were at his house.
We ate his eggs and meat.

688
01:28:13,912 --> 01:28:17,696
Then he ran down the hill
to hide that money and Zachary killed him.

689
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:21,836
I took that money
from his hand when he was dead.

690
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,962
No.

691
01:28:32,431 --> 01:28:36,975
Butler was the one who told me - six months
ago, the day my wife was murdered -

692
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:42,732
that the four of you, you came
straight from my ranch past his place.

693
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:46,151
It is true. We did come past his place.

694
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:52,490
But we did not come from the direction of
your ranch. We came straight from the border.

695
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,491
Well, uh...

696
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:01,619
How...

697
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:04,499
Where did Butler get that money?

698
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:12,256
It was stolen from my house the day...

699
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,388
If my wife...

700
01:29:35,038 --> 01:29:37,115
Butler.

701
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:44,078
What I have told you is the truth.

702
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:10,320
Oh, God.

703
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:12,200
Dear God.

704
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,601
That's him.

705
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:53,486
Tom.

706
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:57,198
He's back.

707
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:16,552
Sheriff, he's back.

708
01:32:35,185 --> 01:32:39,314
Glad you're back, Jim.
You've been away a long time.

709
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:44,362
Father, I need help.

710
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,484
- We all do.
- I killed three men.

711
01:32:50,827 --> 01:32:57,577
The people of Río Arriba are thankful
that you brought justice where they failed.

712
01:32:57,667 --> 01:33:00,040
You don't understand. I...

713
01:33:01,755 --> 01:33:05,705
I didn't... kill them for the sake of justice.

714
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:13,347
You were a member of an armed posse
legally sent out to get them, dead or alive.

715
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:20,148
No, Father. I didn't kill them for
anything that they did here in Río Arriba.

716
01:33:20,233 --> 01:33:22,521
I killed them for revenge.

717
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:28,690
Revenge for something
that they didn't even do.

718
01:33:28,783 --> 01:33:37,289
I set myself up as the judge,
the... jury and the... executioner.

719
01:33:38,627 --> 01:33:41,711
They swore that they were innocent.

720
01:33:41,797 --> 01:33:44,418
One of them even...

721
01:33:44,508 --> 01:33:49,217
He begged on his knees...
for his life.

722
01:33:51,682 --> 01:33:53,971
I wouldn't listen.

723
01:33:55,102 --> 01:33:59,147
I killed them for something
that they didn't do.

724
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:09,525
Well...

725
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:13,110
Jim, let me point this out to you.

726
01:34:14,164 --> 01:34:16,869
By telling me what you have
and feeling as you do,

727
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:22,665
you're already a step ahead of a lot
of other men that have been in your shoes.

728
01:34:22,756 --> 01:34:27,086
That doesn't mean I'm condoning
what you've done, but at least you haven't

729
01:34:27,178 --> 01:34:31,306
excused your own actions by saying,
as many men would,

730
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:35,803
that these men were evil and should die,
and that you carried out a legal execution.

731
01:34:35,895 --> 01:34:40,142
I know that, Father, but... it doesn't help.

732
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,853
I was wrong.

733
01:34:49,242 --> 01:34:52,861
Wrong. Wrong.

734
01:34:59,503 --> 01:35:01,579
Come on.

735
01:35:10,556 --> 01:35:13,344
Some people think prayers help.

736
01:36:09,994 --> 01:36:12,070
(crowd cheering)

737
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:39,847
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no need for me to tell you,

738
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:43,986
the emergency arose...
and the man appeared.

739
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:50,616
Douglass, it's not often a man gets
to do so much for his neighbours,

740
01:36:50,703 --> 01:36:52,992
and do it like you did.

741
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:59,333
We want you to know, we'll be forever grateful
and you'll be in our hearts always.

742
01:37:05,468 --> 01:37:07,544
Thank you.

743
01:37:09,556 --> 01:37:12,047
And in your prayers.

744
01:37:12,142 --> 01:37:14,218
Please.
