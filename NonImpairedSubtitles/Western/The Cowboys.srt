1
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,440
Easy.

2
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:35,144
Easy, girl.

3
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,105
Easy.

4
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,690
Hold it, girl.

5
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,068
Hold it.

6
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,451
Well, I want each of you fellas. . .

7
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,371
. . .to buy yourself a dollar Ingersoll watch.

8
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,582
You can't break them with a hammer and. . .

9
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,418
. . .won't lose more than a minute a month.

10
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,005
-I know we're late, Mr. Andersen.
-You're two hours late!

11
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,800
Work starts around here at 6 a.m.

12
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,468
-Goes for everybody.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,136
We spent the night in Bozeman.

14
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,846
Town's empty as a bone orchard.

15
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,848
Everybody's lit out for the Ruby River.

16
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,683
-What for?
-Gold.

17
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,352
At the Ruby?

18
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,978
Played out years ago.

19
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
No. This is a new strike.
About 20 miles above there.

20
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,275
Almost to the Beaverhead.
Tell him, Smiley.

21
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,862
The fact is, Mr. Andersen,
me and the boys thought. . .

22
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,199
. . .we'd like to take a ride up
and have ourselves a little look-see.

23
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,371
Got 1 , 500 head of steer to get
to Belle Fourche before it snows on me.

24
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,790
You hired on to move them.

25
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,669
-We'd like to help you out--
-Like to help me out?

26
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,130
The others done pulled out.

27
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,508
There's only five of us left.

28
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,843
That busts it.

29
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,762
You work us like dogs night and day,
and Christmas, too!

30
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,473
-Pay you every Saturday!
-There's easier money around.

31
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,891
We'll do it this way.

32
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,145
We'll take a ride up there, we'll have
a look around, 2 or 3 weeks.

33
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,398
If it don't work out, we'll get the others
and we'll be right back.

34
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,233
Now you have my word.
Don't he, boys?

35
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,401
That's right.

36
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,944
-Your word?
-Yes, sir.

37
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,863
Well, here's my word.

38
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,532
Get the hell off my spread !

39
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,409
Now!

40
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,043
Miserable.

41
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,223
Well, they run. . .

42
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,810
. . .clean out from under me.
Whole damn bunch of them.

43
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,730
I heard most of it. Let me see that.

44
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,944
A fool comes to town
with a fist full of gold dust and. . .

45
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,740
. . .every jackass in 50 miles around
lights out after him.

46
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,994
My day a man'd stay with you
on a handshake.

47
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,205
It's a different day, Wil.

48
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,497
Yeah.

49
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:05,085
Well, I guess I'll go over to
the Bigelow place, see what I can turn up.

50
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,629
Maybe Henry. . . .

51
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,006
Henry Bigelow's 60 years old, Wil.

52
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,259
So am I .

53
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,329
Kind of noisy around here.

54
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,581
It's been like this all week.

55
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,667
Any luck?

56
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,253
No.

57
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,173
I traveled 30 miles today. . .

58
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,885
. . .didn't find a single hand that could. . .

59
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,429
. . .throw in with me.

60
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,475
-Did you talk to Parker?
-Yeah.

61
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,395
His wife's gonna have a baby.

62
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,522
How about Miller?

63
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,066
His wife wants to have a baby.

64
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,152
Sucker's only been married three weeks.

65
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,380
Well, if you can't get your cattle
to market this year, put it off till next.

66
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,675
What'll I do with this year's bills?

67
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,887
Pay them next year.
Hell, a lot of folks around here do.

68
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,056
No, I won't go on tick.

69
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,063
If your neck was any stiffer. . .

70
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,233
. . .you couldn't even bend over
to pull your boots on !

71
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,488
Shut up and pour!

72
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,426
Did you ever think of hiring boys?

73
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,262
-What boys?
-The schoolboys.

74
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,389
Oh, sure, and women.

75
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,268
How about my mama in Cedar City?
She's only 92.

76
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,979
You ain't got a lot of choices.

77
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,774
There ain't a kid in that school over 15.

78
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,777
They're between hay and grass.
I need men.

79
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,613
How old was you when you went
on your first cattle drive?

80
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,532
-What difference does that make?
-How old was you, Wil?

81
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,659
-Well, in my day--
-How old?

82
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,286
Thirteen.

83
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,914
But an old man's pants fit me.

84
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,583
"The above convenient arrangement
is designed. . .

85
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,503
. . .to adjust ladies' long dresses
to a walking length.

86
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,006
It is worn around the waist,
has two ends--"

87
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,969
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

88
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,721
Afternoon, Miss Ellen.

89
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,600
Have you gentlemen decided
you need some additional schooling?

90
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,813
Well, I guess we could probably use some,
but we just come visiting.

91
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,648
Well, come in.

92
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,234
Please, sit down.

93
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,335
It isn't often we get visitors.

94
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,464
We were reading
from the Montgomery Ward catalog.

95
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,427
The grammar's quite correct
and it's always most interesting.

96
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,513
Elizabeth, would you continue, please?

97
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,809
"--the longer of which has a nickel clasp. . .

98
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,813
. . . rubber-lined, which holds the bottom
of the skirt to any desirable height. . .

99
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,524
. . .the shorter one a hook
for holding a fan.

100
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,570
This elevator has been worn in Chicago
during the past season a great deal. . .

101
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,448
. . .and ladies consider it
almost indispensable."

102
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,074
Thank you, Elizabeth.

103
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,786
Now, let us hear how well the boys do.

104
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,206
Put away your catalogs
and take out your readers.

105
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,920
Charles Honeycutt.

106
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,673
Would you read
today's assignment for us?

107
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,018
Hail to thee, blith--

108
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,395
Blith?

109
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,190
Blithe.

110
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,444
--blithe spirit.
Bird thou never wert--

111
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,905
Weren't?

112
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,866
Bird thou never wert

113
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,956
That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy--

114
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,500
Get away!

115
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,251
-What have you got there?
-Nothing.

116
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,379
Homer, take your hand
from behind your back!

117
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,218
And open it!

118
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,601
Stop it! Now stop it!

119
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,061
Sit down !

120
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,044
Give it up, Wil.

121
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,463
Can't move heaven and earth.

122
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,633
Well. . . .

123
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,970
What you thinking about?

124
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,973
You.

125
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,060
Stringy women like you live a long time.

126
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,897
Sisters have seen all their husbands
put under.

127
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,608
More than likely you will, too.

128
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,486
And I don't wanna. . .

129
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,030
. . .see you end up somebody's fry cook.

130
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,159
I've been your fry cook for 40 years.

131
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,537
A pretty good one, too.

132
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,248
It's getting chilly.

133
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,584
Come on in, have a cup of coffee.

134
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,837
I'll be in.

135
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,439
Damn Anse!

136
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,942
He put them up to this.

137
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,156
I'd better jump straight down their throat
and get it over with.

138
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,870
Don't be hard on them.

139
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,291
They must've traveled half the night
to get here this early.

140
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,717
Good morning, boys.

141
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,969
Good morning, Mr. Andersen.

142
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,935
Looks like it's gonna be another fine day.

143
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,273
What can I do for you?

144
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,776
Anse Petersen says you're looking
for hands for your drive.

145
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,446
We come to put in for the job.

146
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,452
Well, any of you
ever been on a cattle drive?

147
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,499
Any of you ever herded cattle?

148
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,171
Well, what can you do?

149
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,548
We can all ride.

150
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,511
Most of us can rope.
Couple of us are pretty good shots.

151
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
Well, that's something.

152
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,853
You know, trail driving is
no Sunday school picnic.

153
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,774
You gotta figure you're dealing
with the dumbest. . .

154
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,985
. . .orneriest critter on God's green earth.

155
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,239
A cow's nothing but a lot of trouble
tied up in a leather bag.

156
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,992
A horse ain't much better.

157
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,040
Speaking of a horse. . . .

158
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,713
Got me a little green, broke filly over there.

159
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,299
Name's Crazy Alice.

160
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,887
Now if one of you was to stay aboard her,
for, say, a count of ten. . .

161
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,808
. . . I might just keep that in mind
come hiring time.

162
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,199
Thank you.

163
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,262
Steady, girl, steady.

164
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,207
Easy.

165
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,217
All right.

166
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,803
Easy. Here we are.

167
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,859
Who's first?

168
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,699
Well, I'll try and saddle her
while you're making up your mind.

169
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,172
Good girl.

170
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,341
Made up your mind?

171
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,345
I'll go first.

172
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,362
I'll start counting when you hit the saddle.

173
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,676
Five. Six.

174
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,094
Seven. Eight.

175
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,888
Time!

176
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,224
Get off of her!

177
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,944
My name's Honeycutt.

178
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,696
I'm 15.

179
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,573
And everybody calls me Slim.

180
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,455
Easy, girl.

181
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,748
I'm next.

182
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,588
Easy, girl. Easy.

183
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,968
She's rank. Keep your mind in the middle.

184
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,279
Bail off, youngster! Bail off!

185
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,786
My name's Homer Weems, Mr. Andersen.

186
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,581
And I hope I ain't rode
all the rough off of her.

187
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,644
-You all right, boy?
-Yes, sir.

188
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,773
My name's Clyde Potter. They call me Fats.

189
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,067
Tending toward the gut myself.

190
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,995
My name's B--

191
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,457
His name's Bob Wilson. He gets excited.

192
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,804
I'm Charlie Schwartz. I'm Jewish.

193
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,140
I've settled it every place in town but here.

194
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,768
Must keep you pretty busy.

195
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,145
All right, who's next?

196
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,438
I am.

197
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,029
Good morning.

198
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,950
Close the gate.

199
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,756
Did you see that?

200
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,242
Here, boy. I think you can handle her now.

201
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,744
Keep it.

202
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,794
All right, break it up.

203
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,296
Break it up!

204
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,134
Come on, Slim, get back up on the fence.

205
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,595
Hurry it up.

206
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,307
Settle down !

207
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,519
-You all right?
-Yes, sir.

208
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,190
I didn't see you at the school.

209
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,275
I don't go to school.

210
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,904
-Got a name?
-Cimarron.

211
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,657
That's half a name. What's the rest of it?

212
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,120
There's no more name.
I'm a mistake of nature.

213
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,009
That was a pretty good ride you made.

214
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,973
But I'll have to think you over.

215
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,855
You having difficulty seeing the board?

216
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,817
Homer, Bob, why don't you take
these slates and pads. . .

217
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,738
. . . put them underneath the board
and raise it up. . .

218
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,575
-. . .so that everyone can see the lower lines.
-Yes, ma'am.

219
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,000
There, that's much better.
Thank you, boys.

220
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,587
When you've copied your assignments
for the week you may all go home.

221
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:03,181
I'd like to talk to these boys
before class breaks up, if you don't mind.

222
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,435
Do you wish to address
the young ladies, as well?

223
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,188
No, I don't think so.

224
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,274
I've nothing to say to young ladies.

225
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,947
Then we bow to the fact
that it's a man's world and leave you to it.

226
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,199
Girls.

227
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,271
I don't expect to get to. . .

228
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,316
. . . Belle Fourche with one
single head of beef. . .

229
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,194
. . . but I'm cornered. . .

230
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,155
. . .so I'm taking you on.

231
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,325
Now this is the way it's gonna be.

232
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,702
I'm a man and you're boys.

233
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,789
Not cowmen, not by a damn sight.

234
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,751
Nothing but cowboys,
just like the word says.

235
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:18,297
And I'm gonna remind you of it every
single minute of every day and night.

236
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,183
This is the Double-O.

237
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,895
This is Belle Fourche.

238
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:37,733
In between is 400 miles
of the meanest country in the West.

239
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,863
And the only way
we're gonna get through is if. . .

240
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,364
. . .you take orders.

241
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,200
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.

242
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,202
Bring a bedroll. . .

243
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,413
. . .a couple of good ropes. . .

244
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,373
. . . horse, if you got one.

245
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,710
You'll get the best food in the territory. . .

246
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:58,588
. . . no rest, and damn little sleep.

247
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,383
And 50 big silver dollars. . .

248
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,386
. . . if we make it to Belle Fourche.

249
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,264
Now you'll show up at my place. . .

250
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,476
. . .first Monday after school's out,
at 5 a. m.

251
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,062
And come with grit teeth.

252
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,233
Because, gentlemen,
that's when school really begins.

253
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,944
Mr. Andersen?

254
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,488
Yeah?

255
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,740
All of us?

256
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,285
Come here.

257
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,126
Anybody that tall.

258
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,816
They must've rode all over the territory
to get that many brand new hats.

259
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,361
You know. . .

260
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:49,699
. . .you're gonna have to feed these kids
till my cook comes.

261
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,492
I don't mind.

262
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,328
I like the sound of boys.

263
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,451
Next one of you pulls a knife
in this outfit. . .

264
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,204
. . .you're gonna learn better
at the buckle end of my belt.

265
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,707
Now, what happened?

266
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,710
You.

267
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,047
What went on here?

268
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,216
He said something about his mother.

269
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:50,885
What'd he say?

270
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,224
-You understand Spanish, Mr. Andersen?
-I understand.

271
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,893
So does Slim.

272
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,146
Clear out.

273
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,565
Get on your horse and clear out.

274
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,694
All right. There's plenty of road.

275
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,586
Give me back my gun.

276
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,590
I'm not in the habit of throwing
kerosene on a fire.

277
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,801
It cost me $30.

278
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,011
Send me a bill.

279
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,847
You're gonna get it, mister.

280
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,694
All right, everybody packing iron unload it.

281
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,279
Throw it over here in this buggy.

282
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,282
And I mean anything that shoots.

283
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,786
Anybody holds out so much
as a pea shooter. . .

284
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,957
. . . may find himself hanging
by a tie-rope 70 foot up in a tree.

285
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,841
You ever fire that thing?

286
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,551
No, sir.

287
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,264
This hardware'll be locked up
in the chuck wagon.

288
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,767
You got anything to settle between you,
butt heads.

289
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,811
Now get rid of those bedrolls and. . .

290
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,397
. . .get mounted and we'll see
how much you don't know.

291
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,573
All right, turn him loose.

292
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,252
Bring in the iron, Charlie.

293
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,387
Been smelling that for 40 years.
Never could get used to it.

294
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,806
-You.
-Yes, sir.

295
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,308
What's your name?

296
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,851
Hardy Fimps.

297
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,895
Go rope one.

298
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,372
You'll do.

299
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,718
I've seen them fight all day,
from dawn to dark.

300
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,888
Sometimes the young one wins,
sometimes the old.

301
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,894
Young one's got more muscle.

302
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,063
Old one's got more experience.

303
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,076
That's the old one still standing there.

304
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,580
-Keep his nose out of the water.
-Watch out!

305
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,999
Hang on to that line!

306
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,502
Steady, steady. Pull !

307
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,212
Slow, Weedy!

308
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,716
Watch out for those horns.

309
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,593
You got him.

310
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,096
Now hold him right there.

311
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,432
Pull his nose back now.

312
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,185
Keep his head back.

313
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,570
All right, take him out!

314
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,154
Pull !

315
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,158
Get him out of there!

316
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,119
You need some help?

317
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,039
Nah, they're doing all right.

318
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,966
Mr. Wil Andersen?

319
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,801
What can I do for you?

320
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,929
Well, I think there's something
that we can do for each other.

321
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,849
My name's Asa Watts. How are you?

322
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,935
This here's Henry Williams and Red Tucker.

323
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,687
They both ride with me.

324
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,065
We heard in town that you was going
on a drive, needing some hands.

325
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,692
You sure heard right.

326
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,819
Well, sir, we're the very best.

327
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,739
You fellas aren't from around here.

328
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,949
No, sir, we're not.
We're from Denton County.

329
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,161
We've been on the Ruby River
the last few weeks panning for gold. . .

330
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,163
. . . like every other damn fool.

331
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,918
These last 22 days you know all we got
was $2 worth of dust and nothing more.

332
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,419
Ain't that pitiful?

333
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,797
Now we're ready to get back
to what we know, and that's cows.

334
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,716
What outfits have you worked with?

335
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,720
Well, sir, we've worked for every big outfit
in north Montana. You name them.

336
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,305
No. You name them.

337
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,768
Alrighty.
There's Oscar West at the Triple-D. . .

338
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,021
. . .and George C. Thompson over there
at McNeil. . .

339
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,357
. . . Dillard Fant at the Santa Rosa.

340
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,609
How long were you with Fant?

341
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,861
Well, sir, the last eight years.

342
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,822
What a lovely old gentleman he is.

343
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,993
If we weren't three of the damnedest fools
you ever saw we'd be there with him now.

344
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,537
And if you were, you'd be in a pine box.

345
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:11,830
Sir?

346
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,709
I was pallbearer at his funeral
five years ago.

347
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,424
Well, I've been caught at it, haven't I?

348
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,303
Mr. Andersen, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

349
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,016
I got all them names right out of
the Stockmen's Association brand book.

350
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,354
You see, we're fresh out of jail,
the three of us, and. . .

351
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,274
. . . I don't know, you tell that to people
and they just turn a deaf ear on you.

352
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,237
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.

353
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,739
How do you mean you can't use us?

354
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,449
I won't use you.

355
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,870
You-- You mean you're gonna be
like everybody else. . .

356
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,956
. . .and not give us a chance?

357
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:57,543
I don't hold jail against you,
but I hate a liar.

358
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,840
You're a hard man, Mr. Andersen.

359
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,176
It's a hard life. I got work to do.

360
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:11,098
Sir, before you get back to your work,
I'd like to ask you one more little question.

361
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,476
What are you gonna use for hands
on this drive of yours, huh?

362
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,939
Them little-bitty boys down there?

363
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,650
Come on, you know better than that.

364
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,945
You know what you'll need
to trundle them boys across the prairie?

365
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,155
A baby carriage.

366
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,615
Well, whatever I need I'll get.

367
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,159
I bet you will.

368
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,749
Good luck to you, Mr. Andersen.

369
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,810
Get mounted !

370
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,864
There's your saddle band.

371
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,619
They've been living wild all winter.
We'll finish breaking them on the drive.

372
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,706
We'll pick our strings by age.
Who's the oldest?

373
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,501
-I am.
-Get yourself a rope.

374
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,740
All right.

375
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,911
And here.

376
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,500
-May I have some more, please?
-Sure.

377
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,922
You eat that much at home?

378
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,926
We've been branding cattle all day.

379
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,473
Can't be that hungry. They're showing off.

380
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,714
Good afternoon, mister.
Were you looking for me?

381
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,799
Who are you?

382
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,844
Name's Nightlinger. Jebediah Nightlinger.

383
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,056
I was expecting a white man.

384
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,475
Jim Wheeler. What happened to him?

385
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,811
Well, he got drunk on Sunday
and married on Monday.

386
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,688
I came in his stead.

387
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,150
I told him the fix I was in.
He promised he wouldn't let me down.

388
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,654
He doesn't even wash his hands
before he puts them in the pot.

389
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:54,905
I do.

390
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,157
Can you cook?

391
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,160
Apple pie.

392
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,162
Green apples sliced thin.

393
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,832
Lard, flour, salt, water to bind.

394
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,961
Sugar, cinnamon, a dab of butter.

395
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,297
Three slashes on the crust, one for steam. . .

396
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,925
. . .and two because your mama
did it that way.

397
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,844
Good afternoon to you, lady. Am I correct?

398
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,346
Why, yes, indeed.

399
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,682
-Mrs. Andersen.
-Ma'am.

400
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,309
You ever been on a trail drive?

401
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,853
The Oregon, Chisholm. . .

402
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,690
. . . Santa Fe, some without names.

403
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,149
I don't know.

404
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,027
I like to travel with a man I'm used to.

405
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,363
You'll get used to me.

406
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,534
What do you want for wages?

407
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,035
All I can get.

408
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,746
This job pays $100.

409
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:45,998
A hundred?

410
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,041
That's the money.

411
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,962
Well, if you should get flooded out,
stampeded out, frozen out. . .

412
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,214
. . .or scalped by wild Red Indians. . .

413
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,635
. . .there'll always be substantial food
on the plate and coffee on the boil. But. . .

414
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,887
. . .that'll cost you $125.

415
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,391
You're a pretty independent character,
aren't you?

416
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,643
It's been said of me.

417
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,316
Put your wagon in the barn.

418
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,819
Are all these small boys. . . ?

419
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:20,198
No! They're my trail hands, God help us.

420
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,661
Doesn't anything larger
wanna work for you?

421
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,040
We had a case of gold fever around here.

422
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,958
They're all that's left.

423
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,421
I'll fix up some sugar tits to take along.

424
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,175
Hey, Dan. What's "sugar tits"?

425
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,589
This one suits me.

426
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,313
It smells of boy in here.

427
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,153
You're staring at me, children !

428
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,238
I feel your eyes on my back.

429
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,365
Now why is that?

430
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,534
Well, sir. . .

431
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,412
. . .you're the first nigger we ever saw.

432
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,248
Then it must be a treat for you.

433
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,917
Something different for a change.

434
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,379
Are you black all over?

435
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,716
Except for the white of my eyes.

436
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,094
Is your, you know, your--?

437
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,222
It is. Black too.

438
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,059
See? He's the same as us,
except for that color.

439
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:02,194
The same as you?

440
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,908
Oh, children.

441
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,495
My father was a brawny Moor.

442
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,080
Six feet six inches tall.

443
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,252
He bound his head in a red velvet cloth.

444
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,298
He wore a curved sword. . .

445
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,343
. . .forged from the finest Toledo steel.

446
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,763
He captured a lady. . .

447
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,432
. . . bright and dark.

448
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,435
He took her in his arms. . .

449
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,438
. . .and wrapped her in a warm quilt. . .

450
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,690
. . .and carried her off.

451
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,736
They came to a castle. . .

452
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,741
. . .and he battered down the doors
with the trunk of an oak tree. . .

453
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,369
. . .and killed everybody in it!

454
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,081
Just so they could rest the night.

455
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,463
Later. . .

456
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,633
. . .while she slept. . .

457
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,220
. . . he walked the parapets. . .

458
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,641
. . .and became a king.

459
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:19,271
Is that true?

460
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,899
If it isn't, it ought to be.

461
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,486
Blow out those lamps!

462
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,613
You, that lamp!

463
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,020
Do your work.

464
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,689
Don't be profane
and don't listen to profanity.

465
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,984
Wash your feet daily.
Say your prayers nightly.

466
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,193
Yes, sir.

467
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,280
You have to go out in the world
and prove yourself.

468
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,199
I guess that's right.

469
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,708
God bless you, son.

470
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,464
-Don't be fresh.
-I won't.

471
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,049
And don't come to any harm.

472
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,800
Don't worry, I won't.

473
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,017
So long, Gramps.

474
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,991
Sixty days ought to see me back.

475
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,411
I want two things.

476
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,121
What?

477
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,502
You home again
and a string of blue glass beads.

478
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,546
You don't ask for much, Ann.

479
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,090
I don't need much.

480
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,843
Well, if you run into any trouble, call Anse.

481
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,848
I'll think about you
before I go to bed at night.

482
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,602
You do and you won't sleep.

483
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,985
-Are you ready, Mr. Nightlinger?
-Long ready, Mr. Andersen.

484
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:13,570
Let's go to Belle Fourche.

485
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,241
Move them out!

486
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,244
Yes, sir! Move them out, Weedy!

487
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,329
Start them, Charlie!

488
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,998
Move them out, Bob!

489
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,125
Move them, Jim !

490
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,462
All right, cover them over here.

491
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,297
Keep them over this way!

492
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,451
That's good, Slim.

493
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,121
Right pace, Homer.

494
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,458
Any faster you'd be running
tallow off of them.

495
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,585
That's money out of my pocket.

496
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,096
We'll try and make Still Meadows tonight.

497
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,472
Still Meadows.

498
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,371
All right, take them through.
Take them through. Come on !

499
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,208
Get with it! Head them down there!

500
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,085
Head them downhill !

501
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,796
Get up there, kid. Get up where you were!

502
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,260
Get down, Hardy!

503
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:45,513
Hey, there's a stray.
You want me to get him?

504
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,767
Easy, easy! Don't stop, go with them !

505
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,436
Go with them !

506
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,356
Go on with the wagon !

507
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,152
Easy, easy. Don't stop them.

508
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,279
Go with them ! Go with them !

509
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,967
You were sleeping.

510
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,596
I'm sorry, Mr. Andersen.

511
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:31,100
I pay a full day's wages,
expect a full day's work.

512
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,219
Drove you hard today, didn't he, children?

513
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:21,567
-You think it's gonna be like this every day?
-Yep.

514
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,611
Sundays, too?

515
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,072
There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.

516
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,325
Slim, give that to Hardy.

517
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,912
Watch it, it's hot.

518
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,917
I never noticed before. . .

519
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,797
. . . but most of the people I know
are quiet compared to Mr. Andersen.

520
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,467
He's quiet, it just comes out loud.

521
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,798
That youngster's been following all day.

522
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:26,966
I know it.

523
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:28,968
Who is he?

524
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,597
A bur under my hide.

525
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,016
You just gonna leave him out there?

526
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,896
Mr. Nightlinger, you take care
of the kitchen, I'll take care of the drive.

527
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,864
You know, in the late war
between the states. . .

528
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,784
. . . I served under an officer. . .

529
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,119
. . .just like you.

530
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,289
Is that right?

531
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,627
As a matter of fact, I shot
that military gentleman in the buttocks. . .

532
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,754
. . .just outside Vicksburg.

533
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,923
I'd have hung you.

534
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,801
They gave me a medal.

535
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,430
In my regiment, Mr. Nightlinger. . .

536
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,558
. . . I was known as Old Iron Pants.

537
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,061
You might keep that in mind.

538
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,116
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!

539
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,535
Hey, Hardy, you wake up!

540
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,205
Homer! Get up and go wake up
good Slim over there!

541
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,040
Up, up, up!

542
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,709
Out of these sacks, into your britches!

543
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,003
Come on, Jim, get up! Get up!

544
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,631
My God, get up!

545
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,591
Don't let the sun catch you sleeping.

546
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,802
Mr. Nightlinger, what's for breakfast?

547
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,929
Stewed apples, bacon and biscuits.

548
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,556
Well, forget the apples.

549
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,267
Slap some bacon on a biscuit and let's go!

550
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,060
We're burning daylight!

551
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,229
Burning daylight?

552
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,231
All I see are stars.

553
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,067
You'll see a lot more of them
if you don't get a move on.

554
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,824
Bring them on !

555
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,078
Bring them on, Mr. Nightlinger!

556
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,846
Come on. Stay with them.
Keep them upriver.

557
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,684
Stay upriver, Mr. Nightlinger,
there's some soft sand down there.

558
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,355
Keep them upriver.
Let them go higher, up their head.

559
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,286
Well, come on.

560
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:19,513
Keep them upstream
so they won't have to swim.

561
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,646
Easy, now.

562
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,152
Push them upstream, that's it.

563
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
Good work.

564
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,202
Head them upstream more.

565
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,672
Hold it on up there in the canyon
till they all get across.

566
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,178
Settle down.

567
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:15,528
Help! Help!

568
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:37,967
Come on.

569
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,261
Here's one of your strays.

570
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,055
You all right?

571
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:48,519
Better sit on his back and pump him out.

572
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,147
Get his feet up.

573
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,691
Move your gear into camp.

574
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,029
I won't charge you for the days
I've been following you.

575
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,781
You're hired on, just like the rest.

576
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,366
You work out, you stay.

577
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,910
If you don't, it's a long walk back.

578
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,164
You !

579
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,340
You almost got him killed, you know that?

580
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,176
-But I tried to tell you.
-The hell you did !

581
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:21,552
I tried hard.

582
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,847
If you'd have been in that water
we'd have heard you loud and clear.

583
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,682
I couldn't get the words out.

584
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,269
You could've if you'd wanted to.
You just didn't want to bad enough.

585
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,021
Before God, I tried.

586
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,814
Trying don't get it done!

587
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:37,818
The fact is, you almost let your friend
choke to death out in that river.

588
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,863
-I'd rather die than done that.
-Then you're a liar!

589
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,741
It ain't my fault I stutter.

590
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,035
Listen to me, you whining little whelp. . .

591
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,954
. . .you're gonna stop stuttering
or get the hell out of here.

592
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,457
You're gonna stop it or go home,
do you hear me?

593
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,085
You son of a bitch.

594
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,170
What did you say?

595
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,465
-You goddamn son of a bitch !
-Say that again.

596
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,218
-You goddamn, mean son of a bitch !
-Say it faster!

597
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,137
You goddamn, mean, dirty son of a bitch !

598
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,642
I wouldn't make it a habit
calling me that, son.

599
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,564
I did it.

600
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,109
Did you hear me?

601
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,987
I did it.

602
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,256
Hey, Cimarron.

603
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:48,264
I ain't had a chance to thank you
for hauling me out.

604
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:49,765
I sure am obliged.

605
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:53,686
-Well, I figure I owe you for it.
-Yeah?

606
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,021
How much in dollars?

607
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,651
Well, I can't pay you in dollars.
I ain't got any dollars.

608
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,028
Well, money's what cuts it with me.

609
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,699
Hey, wait a minute.

610
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,878
I picked this up on the trail.

611
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:23,090
I know it ain't gold, it's just fool's gold,
but it's kind of pretty.

612
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,552
You calling me a fool?

613
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,054
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

614
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,902
I got no use for it.

615
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,583
You write that yourself?

616
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:01,253
No, no. It's printed on paper.
I've been trying to learn it.

617
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,008
Well, there's nothing to it.
It's just like arithmetic.

618
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,593
All you gotta do is just. . .

619
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:11,931
. . .count the lines and the spaces. That
tells you where the notes go. It ain't hard.

620
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,352
Looks like fly specks to me.

621
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,271
Some guy named Vivaldi wrote it.

622
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,025
It's kind of pretty.

623
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:38,123
If that's that old Tennessee sour mash,
put a little in there.

624
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,961
Good for my rheumatism.

625
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,046
That comes with old age.

626
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,465
Yeah, miserable old age.

627
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:47,967
I hate it.

628
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:51,345
I'm not far behind you
and I don't like it, either.

629
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:56,350
My oldest boy. . .

630
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,272
. . .would be close to 40 now. Middle-aged.

631
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,482
If he had lived.

632
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,359
You lost a son?

633
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,486
Two of them.

634
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,281
Went bad on me.

635
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,326
Or I went bad on them.

636
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,036
I don't know.

637
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,163
I can't figure it out.

638
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,541
You got another chance.

639
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,336
They're not mine.

640
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,880
They could be.

641
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,031
So as I went down to Denver
with my cousin, L. D. Grimes. . .

642
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,575
. . .then there was this
hootchy-kootch show going on.

643
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,578
And when the fella wasn't looking
we snuck in under the tent.

644
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,790
There was this gal up on the stage
doing a harem dance.

645
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:46,585
First thing I know, she dropped her dress
and she was naked.

646
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,962
-All over?
-From head to toe.

647
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,006
What'd she look like?

648
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:55,094
She had a belly button so big,
you could've stuck your middle finger in it.

649
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,806
I saw my first one in Benbow, too.
Fifty years ago.

650
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,392
Probably the same girl.

651
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,772
Damned if he ain't almost human today.

652
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,275
He's been sleeping better.
He's been at the bottle.

653
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,111
There's bug juice in this camp?

654
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,614
Hell, yes. I seen him and Mr. Nightlinger
swilling it down last night.

655
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,908
Keeps it in a drawer in the chuck wagon.

656
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,451
Which drawer?

657
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,221
Come on. Hurry up. Give me that.

658
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,475
Come on, let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up.

659
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,691
-Come on, Weedy.
-Weedy, come on.

660
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,776
Hurry up. Everybody else is.

661
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,195
-You're wasting time.
-Gambling's a sin.

662
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,781
-So what?
-This ain't gambling, it's stealing.

663
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,284
-That's a bigger sin.
-Not if you don't get caught.

664
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,203
-Come on, just take one.
-Come on, Weedy, come on.

665
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,667
Holy shit!

666
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,503
Go on, Weedy, go on. Hurry up.

667
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,464
Watch out! Here he comes.

668
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,687
Innocence is wasted on me.
I don't believe in it.

669
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,564
What are you up to?

670
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,859
Nothing, Mr. Nightlinger.

671
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,069
Nothing at all.

672
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,740
Boys are always guilty of something nasty.

673
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,327
What could it be this time, I wonder?

674
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,872
Nothing, I swear. Just standing here talking.

675
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,875
If you're lying, remember one thing:

676
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,921
I could swallow each of you whole
without choking.

677
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,425
All I need to do is butter your heads
and pin your ears back.

678
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,648
Hey, come on.

679
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,278
Hurry up.

680
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,072
Get going. Go, go.

681
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,574
Keep going.

682
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,455
Look in with the liniment.
That's where my folks keep it.

683
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,918
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

684
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,505
Come on, Weedy,
don't take your sweet time.

685
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,590
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry up.

686
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,509
Hurry up, Weedy.

687
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,719
-Come on.
-It's not here.

688
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,763
-Look around here.
-Look over here.

689
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,432
Hurry up.

690
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,394
-Would you get going? We'll watch.
-Go on.

691
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,775
I got it.

692
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,737
Don't drop it.

693
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,871
-Hot coffee.
-Heard you coming.

694
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,205
I'm used.

695
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,714
That Fats!

696
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,509
He can sure sing those cows to sleep.

697
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,557
Fatboy isn't on guard. He was just here.

698
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,601
That's right. It's. . .

699
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,395
. . . Steve and Cimarron.

700
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,442
There's more than one voice.

701
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,338
What is this?

702
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,960
Weedy! You keep taking
long swigs like that. . .

703
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,212
. . .you're gonna miss your turn next time.

704
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,463
Pass it on.

705
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,300
Hey! There's two of everybody.

706
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,015
There's two moons.

707
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:56,061
I'm going to bed as soon as I can stand up.

708
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,022
Just don't wake up Ol' Iron Nuts.

709
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:05,237
Mr. Brass Ass Andersen.
A bastard if there ever was one.

710
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,865
He made you stop stuttering fast.
He really tromped your tail !

711
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,033
Listen, Fatso. . .

712
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,911
. . . I could've given up stuttering
a long time ago.

713
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,956
-Why didn't you?
-I didn't know anybody wanted me to.

714
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,129
This is the first time I've ever been drunk.

715
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,924
Oh, you getting sick, you farmer?

716
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,387
-I've decided.
-What?

717
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:35,600
I've decided if Ol' Iron Nuts tells me
I'm burning daylight just one more time. . .

718
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,602
. . . I'm gonna let him have it.

719
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,147
Have what?

720
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,024
It.

721
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,900
What's "it"?

722
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,530
I ain't decided yet.

723
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,283
What happened to that bottle?

724
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:52,868
It's coming.

725
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,457
You know who you sounded like just then?
Mr. Nightlinger.

726
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:03,045
That black son of a bitch
cooks better than my ma.

727
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:07,299
Come on, you guys, we ought to be going
before the old man finds out we're gone.

728
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,553
Yeah, come on.

729
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,140
Did you ever notice how pink
Mr. Nightlinger's palms are?

730
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,350
-Yeah.
-They're kind of pretty.

731
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,770
Shit.

732
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,438
"Shit" yourself.

733
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,451
Shall we join them, Mr. Nightlinger?

734
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,587
When did you take your first drink?

735
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,009
It was on the occasion
of my first broken heart.

736
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:52,844
And my last.

737
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,015
She was an older woman and wise.

738
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,059
Vastly experienced.

739
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:04,022
She told me she couldn't stand
the sight of me for another minute. . .

740
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,150
. . . handed me a half-gallon jug
of sour mash and fled.

741
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,194
And you polished it off?

742
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,570
Every drop.

743
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,366
I've been drinking sour mash ever since.

744
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,410
I was 17.

745
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,956
She was almost 22.

746
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,375
Her name. . .

747
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,419
. . .was Oceola.

748
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,049
I think these kids are rushing it a little.

749
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,343
They're in a hurry to grow up.

750
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,638
Well, they won't get it out of a bottle.

751
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,598
They'll know that in the morning.

752
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,277
All down sick at once.

753
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,905
Must've passed a bad waterhole.

754
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,616
Well, this'll settle you.

755
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,618
Come on, son.

756
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,453
Back, wide.

757
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:02,914
Voilà.

758
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,792
Good morning, gentlemen.

759
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,921
Mr. Nightlinger, I'd like some beans
and cabbage for supper. . .

760
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,466
. . .with a big chunk of fatback
in some red pepper sauce.

761
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,428
And make some gravy out of the grease.

762
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,221
I'll be back.

763
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,434
Hurry it up. We're burning daylight.

764
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,686
All right, son, tongue out.

765
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,229
Head back.

766
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,064
Wider.

767
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,448
Where do you think you're going?

768
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:37,991
Go get him, Dan.

769
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,744
Come back, you.

770
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,488
You ain't nothing but a small child.

771
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,491
If you was a fish, boy,
I'd throw you back.

772
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,660
Hey, boys! Lookie here!

773
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:24,621
Look what I found.

774
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,707
Look around and meet the boys.

775
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,293
It looks like he surprised us.

776
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,837
We surprised you, too, though,
didn't we, boy?

777
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,548
You know better than to scream out now,
don't you?

778
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,636
What's the matter with you, son?

779
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,806
You're looking at me like I had two heads.

780
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,187
You're wondering where I came from,
ain't you?

781
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,776
You know we've been tracking you
for days?

782
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,904
What have you got to say to that?

783
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,572
I can't hear you, son.

784
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,283
I can't hear you, son !

785
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,993
I won't say nothing.

786
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,830
You're a quiet boy.

787
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,375
If I had a prize I'd give it to you, boy.

788
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,044
I like quiet boys.

789
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,672
Now, quiet boy. . .

790
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,882
. . . I'm gonna let you loose.

791
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,303
But you point your ears now, son.

792
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:26,891
Because you ain't running back to Andersen
with them eyes rolling back in your head. . .

793
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,562
. . .telling him that these real bad men
have been following us day and night.

794
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:31,938
You're not gonna say that.

795
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:35,066
You think you'll raise a commotion
and get congratulated for it.

796
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:38,570
They're gonna pat you on the head
and tell you what a good boy you been.

797
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,739
That's not gonna do you any good, son.

798
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,907
You know why?

799
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:45,910
Now you listen to me careful, boy.
You know why?

800
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:49,748
Because I'm gonna come to you
some night it's real dark.

801
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,709
I'm gonna come to you on tiptoe. . .

802
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,546
. . .so you ain't never gonna be able
to hear me.

803
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,799
And I'm gonna come to you
with a knife. . .

804
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,260
. . .freshly sharpened on a stone. . .

805
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,515
. . .and I'm gonna cut you a grin
down here on your neck.

806
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,602
It's gonna run clear across to there.

807
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:19,027
Do I make myself clear, boy?

808
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,205
Is it clear to you now, huh?

809
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,459
Is it clear to you?

810
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,089
-Is it clear?
-Yes, it's clear.

811
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,138
Go home!

812
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,976
No. No, I ain't gonna.

813
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,353
-You gotta stand watch.
-I ain't gonna.

814
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,480
-It's your turn.
-I ain't gonna.

815
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:43,690
Why not?

816
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,650
I ain't gonna.

817
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,660
-What's the matter, Dan?
-Nothing. Just-- Just leave me alone.

818
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,538
Mr. Andersen, can I speak to you?

819
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,040
Go ahead.

820
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,626
Well, it's about Dan.

821
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:05,336
What about him?

822
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,215
He doesn't want to stand his watch.

823
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,843
-Is he sick?
-No, sir.

824
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,845
Well, did he break something?

825
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,471
No, sir.

826
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,515
To tell you the truth. . .

827
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,018
. . . I think he's afraid of the dark.

828
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:33,656
Come here.

829
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,373
What ails you, boy?

830
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,209
Nothing.

831
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,379
-You night-hawked last night.
-Yes, sir.

832
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,715
-Everything went smooth.
-Yes, sir.

833
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,802
If you don't stand your watch,
somebody goes short of sleep.

834
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,888
Carry your weight, boy.

835
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,893
Yes, sir.

836
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:36,803
I don't steal off you and you don't
steal off me, not even a pinch of pie.

837
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,471
What's the matter with you?

838
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,474
Your house is your house
and my house is my house.

839
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:44,936
Mr. Nightlinger, you'd better start
being real careful.

840
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:47,313
How does it feel to be scared?

841
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:54,320
You think I was too rough on the boy,
is that it?

842
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,197
Yeah, that's it.

843
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:07,625
Well, I can't say I always decide right.

844
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,627
In that case. . .

845
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,423
. . .cut yourself a piece of pie.

846
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,272
Move easy. They're kind of jumpy.

847
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,997
They look funny from up here, don't they?

848
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,670
My glasses!

849
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,592
I'll get them for you.

850
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,762
-Be careful, Charlie.
-Don't worry, I'll be all right.

851
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,518
Come on, come on.

852
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,271
Easy, boy.

853
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,566
Easy, easy.

854
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,570
Come on, boy, come on.

855
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,113
Come on, easy.

856
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,282
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.

857
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,201
Come on, easy.

858
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,955
Be real careful, Charlie.

859
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,414
Don't worry.

860
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:13,626
Get off him easy.

861
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,211
Just stop worrying.

862
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,555
I found them!

863
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,015
Come on up. Hurry out of there.

864
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,613
Easy, Charlie, don't spook them.

865
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,619
They're crowding me!

866
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,545
Charlie!

867
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,818
Sometimes, it's. . .

868
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:24,280
. . . hard to understand. . .

869
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,450
. . .the drift of things.

870
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:30,661
This was a good boy.

871
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,873
He'd have been a good man.

872
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,334
Didn't get his chance.

873
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,089
Death can come for you anyplace. . .

874
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:44,634
. . .anytime.

875
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,762
It's never welcome, but. . .

876
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,390
. . . if you've done all you can do. . .

877
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,518
. . .and it's your best. . .

878
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,857
. . . in a way, I guess, you're ready for him.

879
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,490
Go on back to camp.

880
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:09,784
All of you.

881
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:40,606
Go on, son.

882
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,381
What's that?

883
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,801
Little Big Horn.

884
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:55,056
They didn't even dig him a decent grave.

885
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:57,850
Well, it's not how you're buried. . .

886
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,644
. . . it's how they remember you.

887
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:03,898
I guess I better go into Fort Smith and. . .

888
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,234
. . .see if there's been any Sioux activity
up ahead.

889
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:12,531
Keep the cattle headed due east.
Tell Mr. Nightlinger he's in charge.

890
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,658
Why not put me in charge?

891
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,912
A big mouth don't make a big man.

892
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,395
Cimarron, come here!

893
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,579
Them ladies ain't got their dresses on.

894
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,039
No, they ain't.

895
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,625
They sure are pretty.
Wonder who they are.

896
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,128
I don't know. Let's go find out, huh?

897
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,967
Girls, come on. Come on.

898
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,177
Hurry up. Hurry up, get behind the wagon.

899
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:16,679
Move, move.

900
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,396
-Good morning, boys.
-Ma'am.

901
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,439
Morning, ma'am.

902
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,984
Fine morning, isn't it?

903
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:31,986
You on a drive?

904
01:31:32,154 --> 01:31:34,613
Yes, ma'am, we're going to Belle Fourche.

905
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,949
Where's your head man?

906
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,910
That's Mr. Andersen.
He's over at Fort Smith.

907
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,830
All right, then.

908
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,707
What's your name?

909
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,834
They call me Cimarron.

910
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:50,045
I'm Kate to my friends.

911
01:31:52,883 --> 01:31:55,843
And who's the one
with the pretty pink blush?

912
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,262
This here's Homer.

913
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:00,890
Hello, Homer.

914
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,266
Ma'am.

915
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,604
How many men you got in your outfit,
Cimarron?

916
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:12,484
If you're going by age,
we've got two that's 1 5.

917
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,111
My God !

918
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,658
If you're going by what we can do,
there's 1 1 of us.

919
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:21,076
No offense.

920
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,080
In this kind of country
a poor helpless woman likes to know. . .

921
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,749
. . . if there are any men around.

922
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:31,587
I mean, men who can take care of us
as we go along our way.

923
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,632
Well, we're getting paid a man's wages.

924
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:38,344
And you look man enough
to earn them too, Cimarron.

925
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:41,722
Did you want me for anything,
Mrs. Collingwood?

926
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:45,976
That's Phoebe.

927
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:50,648
You're putting too much merchandise
on display, Phoebe.

928
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:54,985
You better cover some of that up
before you come down with pneumonia.

929
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,988
Isn't this a sweet-looking boy?

930
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,619
Wouldn't you like to come inside, honey?

931
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:06,914
You'd be surprised how nice
we got everything fixed up.

932
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:17,633
I think that Homer
just saved himself a dollar.

933
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,392
That leaves you.

934
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,271
Well, excuse me for saying so, ma'am.

935
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,359
You're old enough to be my mama.

936
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:39,905
Well, if I were, I'd teach you something.

937
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:42,866
Like what?

938
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,744
Like manners, for a start.

939
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:57,798
Morning, ma'am.

940
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:05,389
Will you see that the boys return to work
while I chat with this lady?

941
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:07,016
Ma'am.

942
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,483
My name's Nightlinger. . .

943
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:18,569
. . .and I'm in charge of these boys.

944
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:21,280
I'm Mrs. Collingwood and. . .

945
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,699
. . . I'm in charge of these girls.

946
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,910
Well, I just heard
from a highly excited youngster. . .

947
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:30,372
. . .that there were some soiled doves
swinging through here.

948
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,545
What do you want from me?

949
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:38,714
Madam, you know young boys.

950
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:41,675
They dream of golden skin
and unbound hair.

951
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,971
Even if I could lock them up
they'd find a way of getting here.

952
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,433
There's very little I can do about that.

953
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:52,436
I'm sure you'll handle everything
most tastefully.

954
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,775
It's a question of waiting for a more
appropriate time in their lives.

955
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:02,029
Perhaps it would be wiser
to wait until next year.

956
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,822
Or even the year after.

957
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:07,701
With any luck I'll be retired by then.

958
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,960
The first time should be
in the back of a buggy with. . .

959
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,338
. . .a girl they think they're in love with.

960
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,009
All right.

961
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,136
We'll move on.

962
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,265
You're a charming and sensible lady.

963
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:36,146
What about you?

964
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,109
Well, I have the inclination. . .

965
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,654
. . .the maturity and the wherewithal. . .

966
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:48,534
. . . but unfortunately, I don't have the time.

967
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,905
-You got them?
-Aye.

968
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,204
Can you fix it?

969
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:35,706
I think so.

970
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,125
Catch us by suppertime?

971
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,169
Do what I can.

972
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,671
Homer, drop out and help him.

973
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:10,574
-Mr. Andersen.
-I know.

974
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,912
They've been paralleling us
for the better part of an hour.

975
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,789
-What do you suppose they want?
-The herd.

976
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,668
Now you just go on about your business
like you hadn't seen them.

977
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,921
I'll pass the word to the rest.

978
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,912
Think you can do
something kind of ticklish?

979
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,121
Sure.

980
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:00,374
I want you to fade back and. . .

981
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,876
. . .find Mr. Nightlinger.

982
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:04,336
What'll I tell him?

983
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:07,005
Tell him to load his gun
and hightail it up here.

984
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:08,465
Yes, sir.

985
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,564
-Mr. Andersen?
-Yeah.

986
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,399
I can't find Weedy.

987
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:29,528
Well, I sent him back after Mr. Nightlinger
a couple of hours ago.

988
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,989
Don't know where the hell they are.

989
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,449
Looks like we're gonna have a cold supper.

990
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,076
You want me to go?

991
01:38:36,286 --> 01:38:38,829
Son, I wish we could all go, but. . .

992
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,832
. . .we gotta stay put right here.

993
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:46,336
Here's some jerky.
Take a piece and pass it on.

994
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,486
As soon as it's dark. . .

995
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,114
. . .they'll be coming in.

996
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,867
They're after the herd.

997
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:21,371
I don't know who they are
or how rough they'll get.

998
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:27,252
But right now they think
we're one man and a bunch of kids.

999
01:39:28,338 --> 01:39:30,881
And that's what
we're gonna let them think.

1000
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:34,426
I know you're more than that, a lot more. . .

1001
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:38,013
. . . but this is no time to try and prove it.

1002
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:42,643
You act like you just came out
of Ellen Price's grammar school and. . .

1003
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:44,770
. . .you'll be all right.

1004
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:48,106
Now scatter and get us some firewood.

1005
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:03,038
-What's the matter with you?
-I should have told you.

1006
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:04,998
Told me what?

1007
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,876
They've been following us for a long time.

1008
01:40:08,086 --> 01:40:10,587
I should have told you, but I was scared.

1009
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,382
-They said they'd kill me.
-Who said that?

1010
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:16,551
The man with the long hair
who came looking for work.

1011
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:24,935
Don't worry, Dan. It's not your fault.

1012
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:28,021
You got plenty of guts.

1013
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,317
Now get out there and give them a hand
getting that firewood.

1014
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:47,958
Hello, there.

1015
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:56,007
Remember what I told you.

1016
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,981
Well, bless my soul.

1017
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:15,610
If it ain't Mr. Wil Andersen
of the Double-O!

1018
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:25,162
We knew it was gonna take you
a long time herding little boys and cows. . .

1019
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:30,417
. . . but ain't no way we thought
it was gonna take you this long.

1020
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,172
Winter's coming on, old friend. . .

1021
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:39,676
. . .and we gotta get these cattle
to Belle Fourche.

1022
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,096
How far would you say it is?

1023
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:44,556
I didn't say.

1024
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,018
If you was to say.

1025
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,105
Four or five days.

1026
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:58,320
Two or three is more like it.

1027
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:03,074
You know, I'm hungry.

1028
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:07,287
And I remember you had
a chuck wagon and a nigger.

1029
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:08,872
Where are they?

1030
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:13,460
They're behind us. I sent a boy back
to find out what was holding him up.

1031
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:15,212
Well, I know the boy.

1032
01:42:17,048 --> 01:42:18,548
Bring him on in here.

1033
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,597
I don't suppose you mean
this stalwart young man here, do you?

1034
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,605
-Are you all right, boy?
-Yes, sir.

1035
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,023
Mr. Andersen. . .

1036
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:39,611
. . .do I look like the kind of man to you
that would beat on an innocent boy?

1037
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:46,076
You look like the vermin-ridden
son of a bitch you are.

1038
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,288
Well, my sainted mama didn't think so.

1039
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:55,168
Now, boy, you get over there
and sit down.

1040
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,296
Go on. Now!

1041
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,090
And sit down!

1042
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:02,634
And the rest of you boys,
sit down right now!

1043
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:10,600
Now old friend. . .

1044
01:43:11,561 --> 01:43:13,186
. . . I'll have the gun.

1045
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:14,980
That's right.

1046
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:29,035
I'll also have the belt,
because you ain't gonna need it.

1047
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:37,460
That's good.

1048
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:45,343
Pick it up and bring it over to me.

1049
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:55,312
I don't think you heard what I said!

1050
01:43:55,479 --> 01:44:00,150
I said to bend over, pick up the belt
and bring it right here to me, now!

1051
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,261
Pride.

1052
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:30,639
Stubborn pride.

1053
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:34,017
I admire that.

1054
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:37,604
That truly is. . .

1055
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,565
. . .an admirable quality.

1056
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:45,403
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have picked it up either.

1057
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,410
Mr. Andersen. . .

1058
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:55,872
. . . how much would you say
that them cattle are worth apiece?

1059
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,210
Fifteen?

1060
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,379
Sixteen?

1061
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:04,422
Maybe $17 a head?

1062
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:08,385
Now, old friend. . .

1063
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:13,640
. . . I am ready to be rich.

1064
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,902
You, come here!

1065
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,239
Right now! Get up!

1066
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,791
You kept our little secret, didn't you?

1067
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:43,128
-Answer him.
-Yes, sir.

1068
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:44,587
Me.

1069
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,589
You don't listen to him anymore.

1070
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:49,259
You gotta look to me now,
you understand that?

1071
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:51,761
-How old are you?
-I just turned 13.

1072
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:53,388
Really?

1073
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:56,099
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.

1074
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:58,435
-You done anything like that?
-No, sir.

1075
01:45:58,602 --> 01:45:59,936
I'll bet not.

1076
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:03,189
-You're the runt of your family, ain't you?
-Yes, sir.

1077
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:05,984
Where are your glasses?

1078
01:46:06,152 --> 01:46:08,486
You had some glasses. Where are they?

1079
01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:17,454
Son, there's no glass in there.

1080
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:22,292
You must have broken them, huh?

1081
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:25,503
Say, look at that. . .

1082
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,965
. . . I can see myself back home now.

1083
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,470
And all them carpetbaggers
calling me "mister."

1084
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:41,728
I'd like them back when you're through.
They've been in my family for a long time.

1085
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:44,981
Well, you can have them back. Here.

1086
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:47,984
All right.

1087
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,321
We've seen what you can do with a boy.

1088
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,948
How are you when they come
a little bigger?

1089
01:46:55,993 --> 01:46:57,160
You mean you?

1090
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:00,955
Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys
to just sit this one out?

1091
01:47:05,002 --> 01:47:07,504
You love to make it happen, don't you?

1092
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,589
You having any of it?

1093
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,300
Well, sir, you're. . .

1094
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,220
. . .a pretty old man.

1095
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:18,515
Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.

1096
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,185
Had my back broke once and my hip twice.

1097
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,231
And on my worst day
I could beat the hell out of you.

1098
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,316
I don't think so.

1099
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,235
You will.

1100
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:37,951
Get away from him! Get away from him!

1101
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:43,081
You're mine. All mine.

1102
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,751
Now, come on, you get up,
you son of a bitch.

1103
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:30,980
You miserable wretch!

1104
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:34,484
Mount up!

1105
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:36,486
Stop, you son of a bitch!

1106
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:37,820
Go to hell!

1107
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,281
Turn around!
I want you to see this coming!

1108
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:41,908
I said, stop!

1109
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:49,374
You're mine, you old bastard.

1110
01:49:58,175 --> 01:49:59,509
Leave him alone!

1111
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:00,677
Get back.

1112
01:50:00,886 --> 01:50:02,971
Clear back, all of you.

1113
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:48,975
We're leaving.

1114
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:53,354
-What about them kids?
-They're not going nowhere.

1115
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:55,606
Take everything but the fire.

1116
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,281
-What happened here?
-Rustlers, Mr. Nightlinger.

1117
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:48,201
They've been following us
since we started out.

1118
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,633
Why would they do this to him?

1119
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:06,302
Mr. Andersen put up a fight.

1120
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:10,348
Ain't there anything we can do for him?

1121
01:52:10,516 --> 01:52:11,766
Yes, there is.

1122
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:14,560
You can be men.

1123
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,270
Mr. Nightlinger. . .

1124
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:19,190
. . .you're scaring the boys.

1125
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:22,652
You wanna sit up?

1126
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:24,404
No.

1127
01:52:25,447 --> 01:52:27,240
Could you drink some whiskey?

1128
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:28,991
No.

1129
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,078
Is there anything. . . ?

1130
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,665
I want you to see that. . .

1131
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:38,709
. . .these boys all get home.

1132
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,087
I will.

1133
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:45,299
Summer's over.

1134
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:48,970
Just about.

1135
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:58,896
I'm proud of you.

1136
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:02,066
All of you.

1137
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:05,653
Every man wants his. . .

1138
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,030
. . .children to be. . .

1139
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,199
. . . better than he was.

1140
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:14,537
You are.

1141
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:38,478
This may seem. . .

1142
01:53:39,771 --> 01:53:42,064
. . .a lonesome place to leave him.

1143
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:46,444
But he's not alone.

1144
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:49,739
Because. . .

1145
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:53,534
. . . many of his kind rest here with him.

1146
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:57,872
The prairie. . .

1147
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:01,417
. . .was like a mother to Mr. Andersen.

1148
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:05,129
He belonged to her.

1149
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:09,675
She cared for him while he lived and. . .

1150
01:54:17,518 --> 01:54:19,435
. . .she's nursing him. . .

1151
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,939
. . .while he sleeps.

1152
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:47,129
Now!

1153
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:52,260
What--?

1154
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:08,818
What are you doing?

1155
01:55:28,463 --> 01:55:32,466
We didn't want to do it this way,
but we knew you wouldn't give them to us.

1156
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:37,013
We're gonna get the herd back for Mr.
Andersen and take it on to Belle Fourche.

1157
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:39,890
You're gonna get yourselves killed.

1158
01:55:41,727 --> 01:55:43,352
We're gonna finish a job.

1159
01:56:07,127 --> 01:56:08,544
Better have a plan.

1160
01:56:10,714 --> 01:56:13,049
Turn me loose and we'll make one.

1161
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,802
Cut him loose.

1162
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:26,455
Dung heap!

1163
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:30,793
Come back here!

1164
01:59:56,565 --> 01:59:57,982
Hey, you.

1165
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:39,732
Come on in!

1166
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:47,656
What the hell's the matter with them?

1167
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:51,869
Mount up!

1168
02:02:06,069 --> 02:02:08,904
Look at that. Come on.

1169
02:02:58,038 --> 02:03:00,998
You've been behind this all the time,
ain't you, nigger?

1170
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:03,459
Not at first, but I came round to it.

1171
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:06,086
You take your hat off
when you talk to me, mister!

1172
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:11,967
Now you're acting mighty calm
considering what it is I got in store for you.

1173
02:03:12,469 --> 02:03:15,596
What have you got to show me,
white man, that I haven't seen before?

1174
02:03:15,764 --> 02:03:17,639
Don't you sass me, you black!

1175
02:03:19,642 --> 02:03:20,893
Give me that rope.

1176
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,605
This is what?

1177
02:03:24,773 --> 02:03:27,900
You ever seen one of these?
You ever seen a nigger run? Run, nigger!

1178
02:03:28,068 --> 02:03:29,234
Come on! Come on!

1179
02:03:31,488 --> 02:03:33,322
Get up! Get up!

1180
02:03:45,794 --> 02:03:47,586
Since you mean to hang me. . .

1181
02:03:47,796 --> 02:03:49,880
. . . I'd like to atone to my maker.

1182
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:56,386
You got one minute.

1183
02:03:57,597 --> 02:03:58,889
Speak your piece.

1184
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,349
Where to begin?

1185
02:04:03,061 --> 02:04:05,771
I regret having trifled with married women.

1186
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:10,943
I'm thoroughly ashamed
of having cheated at cards.

1187
02:04:12,987 --> 02:04:16,156
I deplore my occasional departures
from the truth.

1188
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:21,620
Forgive me for taking your name in vain. . .

1189
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:25,040
. . . my Saturday drunkenness,
my Sunday sloth.

1190
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:29,086
Above all. . .

1191
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:33,382
. . .forgive me for
the men I've killed in anger. . .

1192
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:36,093
. . .and for those I am about to.

1193
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:41,366
Look out!

1194
02:05:59,636 --> 02:06:00,969
Get off!

1195
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:54,231
I think my leg is broken.

1196
02:06:57,485 --> 02:06:58,860
Don't let him get up.

1197
02:06:59,028 --> 02:07:00,946
Oh, my God, don't let him get up.

1198
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:09,329
I think my leg is broke.

1199
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:15,168
The other one is hung up.

1200
02:07:22,844 --> 02:07:23,885
You!

1201
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:27,514
Son, please cut me loose.

1202
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:29,474
Please!

1203
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,852
I'll make it worth your while.

1204
02:07:32,353 --> 02:07:33,562
I promise.

1205
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:45,741
Oh, thank you.

1206
02:07:56,252 --> 02:07:57,461
Don't! Don't!

1207
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:09,097
Stop him!

1208
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,929
Who are these kids?

1209
02:10:21,939 --> 02:10:23,732
Now what do you want on it?

1210
02:10:27,778 --> 02:10:29,488
His name. Wil Andersen.

1211
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:34,117
Wil Andersen.

1212
02:10:34,494 --> 02:10:35,744
Anything else?

1213
02:10:38,623 --> 02:10:39,664
Like what?

1214
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:42,959
Well, it's usual to say something like,
"Rest in peace."

1215
02:10:43,961 --> 02:10:45,253
"Eternal sleep."

1216
02:10:45,421 --> 02:10:47,005
"In fond memory of. . . ."

1217
02:10:52,094 --> 02:10:53,803
Was he a family man?

1218
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:56,056
Did he have any children?

1219
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:57,849
Yes.

1220
02:10:58,601 --> 02:11:01,436
Well, then I carve,
"Beloved husband and father."

1221
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:08,360
That'd be fine.

1222
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:13,573
I don't see it.

1223
02:11:14,033 --> 02:11:15,909
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1224
02:11:16,077 --> 02:11:17,661
I remember that tree.

1225
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:21,206
There must've been a heavy rain.

1226
02:11:21,374 --> 02:11:22,666
Washed it away.

1227
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:30,423
We ain't never gonna find it now.

1228
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:31,675
Come on in.

1229
02:11:37,848 --> 02:11:39,266
Boys.

1230
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:43,395
I think it's close enough.

1231
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:47,315
Well, come on, we're burning daylight.
