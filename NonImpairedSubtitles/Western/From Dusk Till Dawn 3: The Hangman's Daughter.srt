1
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:20,596


2
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:25,682


3
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:30,362


4
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:51,556
Take it off. My bulletts speed if
by head I wanna spite name on it.


5
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:01,822
The blood of many brave men have 
been shared on that wall.

6
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:05,963
It will give you some comfort 
to share in their glory.

7
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:11,200
- I accept that honour.
- The honour is mine.

8
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:22,200
- The last words?
- Death is the end of pain.

9
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,323
The last pain.

10
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:45,439
Death is the end of pain.

11
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:12,198
It's a man enough gun you got there, sir
Is that...?

12
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:22,486
- I won't gonna steal it or nothing, 
  I just want to see it up close.
- Is this close enough?

13
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,115
Yes,sir.

14
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:33,339
Yeah, you got out of here, cabron!
He's been hanging around here in the
last couple of days and not drinkin' a din.

15
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:37,995
- Brandy.
- It's no brandy, sir.

16
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,817
- Whisky.
- Right.

17
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:54,721
Pass the Lord for forgiveness, he'll save 
your soul. Would you like a prayer sheet? 

18
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:16,646
- So, you are here for the hanging?
- No. I have other business.

19
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:21,839
Stick around? 
Here, in Bagatoria was big entertainment.

20
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:25,522
Open your heart to the kingdom of heaven 
there is a seat for you by his throne.

21
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:29,560
Pass God for forgive you and he will.
Would you like a prayer sheet?

22
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:53,443
- I don't want to be here when it happens.
How soon to they're ready?


23
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,146
I'll go and see.

24
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,562
Has Villa a ridden through here?

25
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:10,766
East side of you. Why?

26
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,982
I've something very valuable.

27
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:16,003
Well, the best place to track in is Tierra Negra.

28
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,800
It's a bit of days ride from here, 
but it's rough country, bad lands.

29
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:23,205
Travellers like you might not want to go alone.
- Really?

30
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:34,442
It's better you travel with company. That 
stedickles there is going that direction.

31
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:42,919
Senor! A lot of white folks go miss in these parts.
Can I ask your name in case someone came looking?

32
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:49,798
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce. 
And no one will come looking.

33
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,437
Brother! Can I offer you a 
life and a resurrection?

34
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:01,599
My name is John Newlie.
Bierce. Ambrose Bierce.

35
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,685
Guess we are travelling together.
-Really?

36
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,318
Who gets the fare?

37
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:14,400
He has no tongue. I'm his 
voice, he is my eyes.

38
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,680
You are safe with us.
I'm filled with confidence.

39
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:45,979
Die! Die!

40
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,540
I know you.

41
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:52,644
Madrid. Look at me Madrid.
Look at me!

42
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,477
Look in the eyes that will watch 
you swinging from that rope,

43
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,798
my ears will hear the crack 
of your neck breaking,

44
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,202
my nose will smell the 
shit in your pants,

45
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,043
and my mouth will laugh when you die.

46
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,477
Hold him!

47
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:56,517
Esmeralda! What are you 
doing here? Go home!

48
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,664
I won't tell you again!

49
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,362
I want to see it.

50
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,924
You dare to disobey me now? 
Even to my face?

51
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,964
Bring her!

52
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:11,702
No! No!

53
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,858
She is your daughter. 
Your own flesh and blood.

54
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,645
Any last words?

55
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,526
See you in hell.

56
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,679
That one has a devil on the side.

57
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,477
Esmeralda.

58
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:46,241
She is your daughter! What are
you doing?  You could kill her!

59
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:51,121
I'd rather see her dead! 
Go get the horses!

60
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,705
Is something the matter John?

61
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:12,303
No, what'd I thought I left the Bibles.
But here they are!

62
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:17,140
Thank Godness! We can't start a 
Bible school in tierra Negra without Bibles!

63
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,182
Perhaps Mr. Bierce would like one.

64
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,502
Oh no, no thank you. I've already read it.

65
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,843
You have.

66
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,578
Nice thing of the good book is 
that it covers too far apart.

67
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:35,643
Excuse me?

68
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:40,405
I'm on the opinion that the Bible is perhaps 
the greatest assemblage of lies and 


69
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:44,291
untruth ever gathered together. A possible
exception is the Congressional Record.

70
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:50,227
- Are you an atheist, sir? - Yes ma'am.
Thanks to your god. I'm an atheist.


71
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:54,485
There's no hope for your soul on the final day,
when Gabriel blows his horn 

72
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:58,522
your ears will be deaf to the resounding 
tone of its glory, Mr. Bierce. 

73
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:05,439
Oh, no. On the contrary, when Gabriel
blows his horn, I'd be playing the tuba.

74
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:11,244
It won't feel us bad, Mary. Mr. Bierce 
is entitled to his beliefs so deeply.

75
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,537
How generous!

76
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,606
- So why are you here, Mr. Bierce?
- I have an ambassador good will.

77
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,478
All right. And an ambassador to whom?

78
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,399
General Fransico Vien.

79
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:29,758
- The...the revolutionary?
- One and the same.

80
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,456
And I meet him tomorrow in Tierra 
Negra. I'm in charged with the

81
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,885
duty to transport somthing 
of incredible value to him.

82
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:38,277
- What is it? 

83
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:42,095
I'm afraid of if I shared this 
information with you madam,


84
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:47,276
It would be forced to take your life and 
I wouldn't want that on my conscience.

85
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,743
He is joking honey,
he is joking.

86
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,918
Johnny!

87
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,205
Where where you, Mickey?

88
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,805
I thought... we... Chato said...

89
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,201
What did Chato say?!

90
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:59,158
He said... he said... he said 
that he was the new heffe.

91
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,479
Where is Chato?

92
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,266
Get him!

93
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:17,485
All the things they say about you...
I don't believe them.

94
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:20,357
Believe them.

95
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,906
But you took me away. You have me.

96
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:27,302
I thought you would keep them 
shooting at me. But I was wrong.

97
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,716
- Where would we go?
- Say that again!

98
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:33,147
- Where would we go?
- What do you mean, 'we'?

99
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:37,085
- You got that way, and I go this way.
- But you... - No more words!

100
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,996
You can hit me if you want!

101
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,816
Yeah, turn around!

102
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,596
Keep smearing harm.

103
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,258
- Don't you have any relatives
you can go to? - No.

104
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:35,876
- What about your mother?
- She died when I was born.

105
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:41,854
My father told it I stole my 
first breath from her last one.

106
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,165
You can ride with me to Tierra Negra.
I know someone there.

107
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:49,978
- He can set you up with some food and work.
- What kind of work?

108
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,719
Kind of work girls do.

109
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:57,606
- I don't think I'm that kind of girl.
- All girls are that kind of girl.

110
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,721
Well, about two hours or so.

111
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,783
They headed east.

112
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:59,990
Go back to town find all the men you can. 
Tell them I pay 100 pesos who ever 
brings Esmeralda back to me alive.

113
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:27,036
Are you talking to me?
Are you really talking to me?

114
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:48,138
- What's this?
- I don't mean any harm, all right?

115
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,276
I want to be your prenis.

116
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:04,118
Look! My doors swing only one way: OUT!

117
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:07,639
No no no...
It's a student! I want you to teach me!

118
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:12,444
I want to be a real outlaw. 
A legend like you.

119
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,993
You want us to kill him for you?

120
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,682
Kill her!

121
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:31,077
I shot that thing clean off and 
I will do the the same with your tereso!

122
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:36,183
- You shot that rope?
- Take me on and let me learn! 
I'm not gonna mess up.

123
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:38,899
So you are proving.


124
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,237
Mains Reece. When do we start?

125
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:49,439
Lesson number one: I ask questions and 
you answer them, ok? Give me your gun!

126
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:55,856
Lesson number two: never give your gun to nobody.

127
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:59,961
- Lesson number three: we don't like gringos!
- I know a gringo we can hit!

128
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,256
Talk!

129
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,205
- An old man is carrying 
something to Pancho Villa - What?

130
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:10,980
- I...I don't know. It must be very valuable.
- She is lying!

131
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,418
I sware to God! It could be guns 
and it could be gold!

132
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,684
Very good job.

133
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:30,166
Very good job! But if you are fucking with
me you will be in a wooden box, 
understand? Good for you!

134
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,999
Mr. Bierce, you are sick! 


135
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:06,255
Now this is a sign to stop your drinking.

136
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:17,382
They say when a man drinks, it develops certain powers.

137
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:20,881
- What kind of powers?
- Cleurboids.

138
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:23,198
Second sight.

139
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,593
My wife is right, Mr. Bierce. 
You'd better take care of yourself.

140
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:32,915
This is a preservative, and I'm pickling
 myself for your great beyond.

141
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,401
What did he say exactly?

142
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:43,581
He said he was carrying something for 
via. Something that worths a lot.

143
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:48,381
If you lie, you die, understand?

144
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:58,482
This little difficult experition:
Who foots the bill?

145
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,385
We don't have to listen to this.

146
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:05,283
My father died recently, Mr. Bierce. 
He left me a large sum of money, 

147
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:07,463
and I decided to use it for the low.

148
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:12,797
Ah, so he not only gained a bride, 
but a checkbook to in the bargon.

149
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,486
You insinuate that I married 
my wife for her money.

150
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:23,323
We have scrooped with Mr. Bierce. Something 
you must have lost if you ever had'em.

151
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,803
With that shotgun, he is blind!

152
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:08,842
- What the...  who is that?
- Bandits, no doubt.

153
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:15,946
- Damn! They gonna rob us!
- Kill us too, most likely.

154
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,777
Bastard!

155
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:54,720
Joaquin, the driver!

156
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:27,784
I got him!

157
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:48,358
Mr. Bierce! Stop it!

158
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:00,841
Stop it now!

159
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,300
Move!

160
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:19,365
- Which one of you shot me?!
- He.

161
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:23,379
That's him!

162
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,845
Thank you.

163
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:35,604
Find the gold!

164
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:43,392
Reece! Over there!

165
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:06,239
- Look what you did to my friend, gringo.
- My liquor, give it back.

166
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:20,438
- Mr. Bierce!
- That hurt, don't it, ha?

167
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:34,806
- May I assist you or something...?
- What's the matter with you, ha? 

168
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:47,990
- We gonna get 50 pesos for that. Real silk.
- My wedding dress!

169
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:52,581
The gold! I said find the gold!

170
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:07,322
- Hey, Chefe! 
- There's nothing secret...

171
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:11,996
- What's in the box, senora?
- There are Bibles...
- I wasn't talking to you.


172
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:17,479
There are Bibles for the 
children of Tierra Negra.

173
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:23,236
- A Biblia Santa.
- Where is the gold?
- I found something!

174
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:41,997
- You said he had two cases of gold.
- No Madrid, I said that it could've been gold.

175
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,857
You got something very valuable 
for Villa. What is it?

176
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,400
- Shoot me!
- No! Please!

177
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,539
Go on! Squeeze the trigger. 
You can do it.

178
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:03,702
Just tell them what it is , Mr. Bierce! Let 
them take it, it's not worth your life!

179
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,577
- It's not worth your life.
- It is my life.

180
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:16,257
- What? - It is me. I'm going to be
 a soldier in Villa...in the revolution.

181
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:28,363
Crazy old gringo! What are we 
to take you, ha? Look at you!

182
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:36,285
- Let me kill him at once!
- Leave him alone! He is an honorable man.

183
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:53,357
I'd like to thank you, Mr. Bierce. With all your 
provato you nearly got us killed back there.

184
00:30:56,727 --> 00:31:01,485
- Don't you lay another finger on my husband!
- I'm sick of the sight of him.

185
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:06,080
- You have no right to speak like this! We are alive...
- We are alive! What are you living for?

186
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,299
This sick, offending...

187
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:13,300
John! Leave him alone! Get off of him!

188
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,616
- You still have simpathy for 
him even after that?

189
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:24,883
- I fault the sin and not the sinner John, he needs help.
- Bring on!

190
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:31,904
- When do the lessons start? - The lessons are 
all around you all the time. Remember that.

191
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:35,179
The earth, it's opened up for
you like a woman.

192
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:39,883
- Was it hard to kill all those men?
- No it wasn't, was it Madrid? 

193
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:45,718
For an outlaw, it's easy. An outlaw 
is ready to kill no matter what.

194
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:49,102
Listen, tell me your technique. 
You know, how you done it.

195
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:54,090
Was it sneaking upon people or 
did you do a run to their face?

196
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:58,181
Madrid, how did you became 
famous, like a legend?

197
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:04,002
- Is that what you want? To be a legend?
- I want to be an outlaw. And that means famous.
 
198
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:06,879
People know your name and 
they're scared of it.

199
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:09,358
They tell their children to watch out at night, 
because you could coming 

200
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:15,961
at night and kill the in their cribs. 
Men fear you and women scream at the sight of you.

201
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:20,937
- That's what I want.
- Yeah? Is that what you think I am?
- Of course that's what you are.

202
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:26,765
You are a monster. You are lying to yourself 
if you're  think you're any different.

203
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:45,605
- John! Is something wrong?
- Wagon stuck.

204
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:54,236
We're not gonna make it throgh the sand. 
We walk a while. It'll be fine.

205
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,793
I know you!

206
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:53,564
- Why are we stopping? I don't like cementeries.
- This is for the kid.

207
00:33:54,327 --> 00:34:02,976
Reece! Do you want to be like me? This is what you learn.
The secret for becoming an outlaw, a legend, is fear.

208
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:05,257
To make the people scared of you?

209
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:09,586
The only way to know how to put fear into 
someone else is for you to feel that fear.

210
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,997
- Feel it and face it. Can you do that?
- Yeah, I can try.

211
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,965
- Try?
- I mean yeah, I can do it.

212
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:34,898
- What are you doing?
- What's the lesson number one?

213
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:40,263
- You ask the questions.
- Get up on the cross! Move!

214
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:49,366
- Put the noose around your neck.
- Johnny, I don't think...

215
00:34:49,427 --> 00:34:56,238
Do you want to learn, ha? You want to be an outlaw, a legend.
You got to be able to step fear in the face! 

216
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:01,287
Smell it's breath and laugh. 
If you can't do that...than forget it.


217
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,878
- Johnny, please!
- Shut up!

218
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,416
- Is that better?
- It isn't now.

219
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:23,623
- Are you scared? 
- No.
- Johnny!

220
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,341
- How about now?
- Yes.

221
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:35,883
- Do you feel that rope is getting tighter around your neck?
- Yes.- Johnny! Stop it!- Hey!

222
00:35:40,147 --> 00:35:42,999
- Do you think you must slip and fall?
- Yes.

223
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:49,595
You feel like a horse's ass, ha? 
Because that's what you look like; a horse's ass!

224
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:59,319
Don't laugh at me! Don't laugh at me!

225
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,317
You see, we're looking at you
and you don't look like a legend.

226
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:09,379
- You look like...like... Joaquin, 
what she looks like? - A horse's ass!

227
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:14,183
- Don't fucking laugh at me!
- Johnny that's enough!

228
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:20,307
- You can't kill her! She is a girl.
- She is an outlaw. And she'll die like an outlaw.

229
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:36,496
You're on your way now, kid. 
A little while, you'll be a legend.

230
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:40,786
Esmeralda! Wait!

231
00:36:41,347 --> 00:36:48,724
- Come on! - See we don't mean nothing you ask chefe, you 
chase after her. We're going on to Tierra Negra.

232
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:49,356
"La Tetilla del Diablo".
Now what does that mean?

233
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:54,979
I believe I can translate that for you.
Welcome home, wearied pilgrims.

234
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:20,979
Inkeeper!

235
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:10,316
- We'are closed.
- You speak English!
 
236
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:15,843
- English, French Latin and Nahuatl.
- We'd like a room for the night, sir.

237
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,919
- And I'd like some brandy.
- All night?
- Yes.

238
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,896
Uno peso.

239
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,624
- Drink?
- Yeah, sure.

240
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,839
Two glasses of milk, please.

241
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:39,519
- Water, then.
- Tequila!

242
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:43,282
That's my cure . Have two bottles of your finest, thank you.

243
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:54,465
- I think we have some water in the back. The kind with the bubbles?
- Yeah, I know.

244
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:58,816
- Anything, please.
- Make yourselves comfortable.
 
245
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:01,317
- We'll busy here for a couple of hours.
- Thank you.

246
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,836
Esmeralda! Wait!

247
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:32,739
What's the matter? You didn't 
even know that kid.

248
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:35,780
- She made you angry?
- She had the wrong idea about me.

249
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,199
- What's gonna happen to me when I make you angry, ha?
- You don't make me angry.
 
250
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:45,964
What if I say the wrong thing? Sometimes 
I just looked at my father and he hit me.

251
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,942
I'm sorry.

252
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:54,644
- More?
- No. We'd like to see our rooms, please.

253
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:41,284
I'm Quixsla. I'll show you to your room.

254
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:46,025
- John Newlie.
- John.

255
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:55,475
- And she is...
- My wife. Mrs. Mary Newlie.

256
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,041
Hello.

257
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:18,993
Madrid did this.

258
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:26,490
He'll have to stop. They cannot ride in the dark, there are coyotes out. 
The closest pueblo is another half days journey.

259
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:31,636
- There's no place to stop out here.
- There's one place.

260
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:35,421
She is still alive!

261
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:40,904
Kill him! Kill him!

262
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:49,516
You have no idea what you've unleashed!
Bring her!

263
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,005


264
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,383
I have a shot of your best.

265
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:31,996
Damn lucky thing I found this place.
I saw a dead meandering in the dusk and dawn.

266
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:36,699
I was wondering... which do you call
when someone looks real but it ain't?

267
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:42,305
- A mirage.
- Yes sir, that's it, a mirage... the real thing.

268
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:52,503
Uh, that's good, yeah, it'a real good. 
I think I have another one.

269
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,816
Pay for the first one.

270
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:06,602
You know...I ain't got damn money... but I do
have some much better than that.

271
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:16,263
- It's a brush!
- Well, yeah, technically speaking it's a brush,

272
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:23,405
but this brush was made by the finest Andalusian
group, bristles handpicked by Andalusian gypsies 

273
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:29,477
straight of the mane of Andalusian
horses, going into far of Andalusia.

274
00:45:32,707 --> 00:45:35,221
- We don't need no stinking brushes!

275
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:38,940
I'll stand the pedlar to a drink.

276
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:57,482
Still ain't interested in the brush?

277
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,381
That's occupied.

278
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:48,986
This will be your room.

279
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:06,756
Call me... if you need anything. 

280
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:10,498
Excuse me madam, what time 
can we expect supper?

281
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:19,663
We eat late around here. But don't 
worry, I let you know when it's time.

282
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:31,717
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes, I'm fine.

283
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:38,203
- Need anything?
- Nop, nothing.

284
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,496
Ah, John!

285
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:08,443
We've been married a week, Mary. And I still 
don't know what you look like in a bed dress.

286
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:12,585
John, I just hope that you have better 
reasons for marriage than that.

287
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:18,804
You know I do! I love you, Mary. 
It's not a sin if you married in love.

288
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:24,685
I'm not refusing you because I think it's a sin.
It's just that...that...

289
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:46,604
It's a bat. Just a bat. Tried to 
find some shade from the heat.

290
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:52,320
- Are you sure you all right?
- I feel sick.

291
00:48:53,107 --> 00:48:57,239
I just want to go to bed. 
Could you possibly get me some water?

292
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:00,762
All right Mary, I  get you some water.

293
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:04,898
I'll be back.

294
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,704
Son of a bitch!

295
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:37,643
- Are you looking for something?

296
00:49:39,107 --> 00:49:42,319
No I... I dropped something.

297
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,756
Maybe it's in here.

298
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:45,244
You like the dress? You want it? 
You can have it. For 50 pesos!

299
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,400
Here are a lot of ladies.

300
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,856
There's a lot of dirt down here, in Mexico,
I make a kill instead of brushes and boom,

301
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:18,865
but Tierra Negra was my last hope, if I 
don't sell last it's back home for me.

302
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:26,582
We begged a ticket up in threed, barter system
or something if you get my drift listed.

303
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:31,405
- Sorry mister, I ain't asked your name.
- Bierce, Ambrose.

304
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:34,119
- Ambrose Bierce you, right?
- Yes.

305
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:38,281
- That don't be true.
- You know my work?

306
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:42,303
Yes sir, I do. 
I did read...let me see... 

307
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:48,323
The story with that soldier up on that bridge set to be hanged,
and he escapes far into the river below 

308
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:53,146
He swam, he swam he swam, ran to his 
house and kiss his wife,

309
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:59,995
snap, his neck broke and all went to dream. 
It's a got damn dream. That'd just kill me.

310
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:11,578
Excuse me! Drink!

311
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:16,365
- Water?

312
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:18,719
- No. Tequila.

313
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:34,990
Keep it coming!

314
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:38,995
My name is Newlie. John Newlie. 
I like your friend.

315
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:11,917
Never seen this place before. I must've 
ridden through here a thousand times.

316
00:53:12,87 --> 00:53:18,994
- Maybe we'd go to Tierra Negra.
- It's dark. The coyotes are out. We'll be safer in here.

317
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,845
You are very pretty, senorita.

318
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:29,501
- Go inside. I take your horses.
- Yeah, you'd better do that.

319
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:40,262
Go on! I'm gonna make sure that 
the horses are taken care of.

320
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:44,996
We don't want to get stuck here. I'll be right back.

321
00:54:11,507 --> 00:54:13,490
You're alone?

322
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:20,079
- Who hurt you? 

323
00:54:22,147 --> 00:54:33,305
- The scars on your back. Your husband?
- No. My father.

324
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:08,643
You sweet child.

325
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:21,681
It's tears, have never fallen on the mother's breast.

326
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:30,906
- You are very special... Esmeralda.

327
00:55:33,807 --> 00:55:36,204
- How do you know my name?

328
00:55:51,207 --> 00:55:54,320
Hey idiot! Where are you?

329
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,500
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing, senior.

330
00:56:22,787 --> 00:56:25,399
- Get away from my horse!
- Si, senior.

331
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:33,479
John!

332
00:57:07,027 --> 00:57:10,802
Well, well. Remember me?

333
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:22,337
- Where's the girl?
- Which one?

334
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:26,342
I mean a specified girl. The one that 
just came in here. Where's she?

335
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:40,897
Hey! Where's the girl? I'm talking to you!

336
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:15,405
So what's your policy on fighting 
in this establishment?

337
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,622
I don't care. What do you have in mind?

338
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:22,947
I'm talking about real ass-kicking; broken arms,
smashed nose shattered jaw, that's what I think.

339
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,320
I've seen worse, senior.

340
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:29,926
- Tequila!
- Si, senior.

341
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:42,220
- What do I owe you?
- Jetted jaw right here!

342
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:04,796
Please, senior...

343
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,818
- Esmeralda, we're leaving!
- I want to stay!

344
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:20,957
This is not the time to fuck around!

345
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:25,479
- She said she's staying.
- I'm not talking to you!

346
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:33,883
- Get out of the way or I blow you an extra hole!
- Go ahead!

347
00:59:49,187 --> 00:59:54,321
- John!
- Let him go, or I fix your little bitch, cabron!

348
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:07,163
You're next, asshole!

349
01:00:15,747 --> 01:00:17,236
John!

350
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:39,799
John, stop it!

351
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:01,463
- Something wrong?
- What's the matter with this place?

352
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:05,497
- Your stupid friend ate my horse! I had to shoot him.
- You mean Nano?

353
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:23,460
I know what you look like Madrid: 
you look like the horse's ass!

354
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:24,923
Esmeralda!

355
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:35,540
- Mary!
- John!

356
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:55,158
I'm walking out of here,
 and I'm taking Esmeralda with me!

357
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:57,900
You've taken far enough, Madrid. 
You don't know what you're getting into!

358
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,986
Give her back to me now, and I let you live! 

359
01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:02,860
You're not going anywhere! You stay with me!

360
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:08,441
Well Mauricio, it's been a long  time.
But I knew you come back.

361
01:02:10,107 --> 01:02:11,904
Stay away from me!

362
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:18,237
The girl is beautiful. 
She does really look like you.

363
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:22,775
- Stay away from me!
- But she looks a lot like me!

364
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:41,992
Hey Mauricio! After all these years, where've
you been, amigo? You're just in time for dinner!

365
01:03:02,507 --> 01:03:04,404
Fuck!

366
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:36,877
Oh Jesus!

367
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:25,991
Mauricio! That wasn't very nice!

368
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:54,361
Let's get out of here!

369
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:17,540
Let's go honey! Let's go!

370
01:05:26,647 --> 01:05:27,990
Back!

371
01:05:42,327 --> 01:05:44,740
Mary! Mary!

372
01:05:45,127 --> 01:05:46,997
Cabron!

373
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:55,990
John help me! John!

374
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:17,997
Get a dance!

375
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:21,998
Mary!

376
01:07:09,827 --> 01:07:11,962
Mary!

377
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:14,437
Mary!

378
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:22,319
Mary! No!

379
01:07:24,997 --> 01:07:27,197
Down here!

380
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,498
Go! Go! Move back! Move back!

381
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:52,999
Shut the door! Shut the door!

382
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:57,925
- Because of you they took my wife!
- They should have taken you, pendejo!
 
383
01:07:57,987 --> 01:07:59,822
That's enough!

384
01:08,00,487 --> 01:08:02,586
No it isn't!

385
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:07,958
- I said that's enough!
- It's none of your business, gringo! 
He put my daughter into this area.

386
01:08:07,987 --> 01:08:11,683
Everyone here has a score dissent. 
And if we were in anywhere else,

387
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:19,167
I wouldn't give too annal explosions if you blew
your stinking brains into a flatulented wink.

388
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:26,637
But from now on the bets are off. 
Am I clear? Am I clear!?

389
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,999
It's her they want. 
Till we have her we have a chance.

390
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:38,816
- My daughter is not for sale!
- Did I say that?

391
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:43,485
Let's find another way out.

392
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:51,259
- You'd better watch your back, hangman.
- Watch yours.

393
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:09,437
Get up! Get up!

394
01:09:16,407 --> 01:09:19,998
Wait! They're gone!

395
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:23,992
- Esmeralda!
- There's something in my hair!

396
01:10:17,867 --> 01:10:19,995
Where's my girl?

397
01:10:20,707 --> 01:10:26,844
You must find her. 
You have to taste what I've tasted.

398
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:44,317
She has arrived!

399
01:10:44,997 --> 01:10:47,997
Wake the old one!

400
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:30,919
John!

401
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:41,377
John!

402
01:11:52,247 --> 01:11:54,597
My Lord in heaven!

403
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:58,781
John! How could you leave me up there?

404
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:01,525
I'm your wife, John!

405
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:05,722
They hurt me!

406
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:11,176
- Mary!
- This is not your wife, Newlie.
- Shut your mouth, Bierce!

407
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:19,802
He is no servant of God! 
He talkes a good game.

408
01:12:20,267 --> 01:12:23,465
But deep down he is a sinner! 
Child of Sodom!

409
01:12:24,027 --> 01:12:29,762
- Stop it!
- Send her to the hell, she is
so formerly feared when in sermon.

410
01:12:30,627 --> 01:12:37,347
Now what kind of preacher would 
defy his god so blasphemously!?

411
01:12:39,207 --> 01:12:42,336
The game is up you cocksucker!

412
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:48,162
All this time, you've been selling 
your sale as a devoted believer!

413
01:12:48,487 --> 01:12:52,836
Now you are as a sinful thief! 
You counted me what for?

414
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:56,682
oh you really wanted to do 
was to take my father's money.

415
01:12:57,287 --> 01:12:59,990
Blasphemour!

416
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:03,960
Fucking pendejo!

417
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:09,856
You always wanted to see what was
underneath this dress, didn't you?

418
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:19,406
Help me! Help me!

419
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:37,945
John, how could you?

420
01:13:38,307 --> 01:13:40,585
Forgive me!

421
01:13:43,547 --> 01:13:45,996
<:She is the princess:>

422
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:58,622
Was anyone else beaten back there?

423
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:01,463
- No I wasn't.
- No, not me.

424
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:20,458
No.

425
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:26,458
Everybody's fine? All right then, 
we're safe. Let's move on.

426
01:14:26,927 --> 01:14:29,779
Make god forgive and help all of us.

427
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:47,993
Here feels colder.

428
01:14:50,827 --> 01:14:53,598
Nightair.

429
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:55,899
This must be the way out.

430
01:14:56,067 --> 01:14:58,721
Could be that way, could be this way, idiot!

431
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:04,162
We will separate.
Take our chances.

432
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:08,741
You! You take the girl, 
your friend, and the believer.

433
01:15:08,907 --> 01:15:14,755
I take the hangman and the kid. 
And try not to kill each other!

434
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:29,592
God forgotten about you, Reece.

435
01:15:29,887 --> 01:15:36,300
- Reece. Katherine Reece. - No. 
- You're wanted for murder in two states I believe.

436
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,522
See you read papers.

437
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:43,202
I'm a journalist. She sent her 
entire family to the great beyond.

438
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:46,925
Killed them in cold blood in Oklahoma.
Then went on to Texas,

439
01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:52,241
where she proferred the same gift to 
her aunt, her unkle and five cousins.

440
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,993
- Six.
- Oh, six. Pardon me.

441
01:15:56,307 --> 01:15:59,301
You killed your mother and father? Why?

442
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:03,937
They were starving, there's no food. 
So I sent them to a better place.

443
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:07,884
What about your aunt and 
unkle and all your cousins?

444
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:11,696
I never liked them.

445
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:48,016
What the fuck are you looking at, pendejo?

446
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:07,763
Trouble! Hey! Where's your friend?

447
01:17:08,997 --> 01:17:10,903
Joaquin!

448
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:15,796
Quit fucking around, Joaquin! Joaquin!

449
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:20,916
Joaquin!

450
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:56,485
You made me one of them! 
You turned me into one of those things!

451
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:03,106
What? What are you gonna do?

452
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:17,946
- Do it for turning!
- God have mercy in your soul, compadre.

453
01:18:33,307 --> 01:18:35,758
What's going on? Where are the others?

454
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:39,387
- Dead.
- Dead? Why not you?

455
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:42,359
Maybe you are one of them. A bloodsucker.

456
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:45,879
You know about bloodsucking, wouldn't you?

457
01:18:47,247 --> 01:18:49,791
What's that supposed to mean?

458
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:53,565
... the girl... the princess...

459
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:56,996
Pappy! Why do they want me? Who am I?

460
01:18:57,047 --> 01:18:58,701
Why don't you tell her?

461
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:00,322
What are you talking about?

462
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:03,879
Tell her who her mother is. Tell her!

463
01:19:08,967 --> 01:19:15,140
If you cannot succeed in killing one another 
I release you so could do it upon that god damn door!

464
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:29,823
Come! There's somebody that I want you to meet.

465
01:20:13,887 --> 01:20:18,996
This is your grandmother. 
Welcome home Santánico.

466
01:20:20,227 --> 01:20:25,925
- Prepare these sacrifices for the annuity.
- Nooo!

467
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:33,905
It's really quite an extraordinarily, 
compromising position.

468
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:35,443
What are they fixing to do with us?

469
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,200
Lead us dry.

470
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:47,980
Hangman, your past has come back to haunt us.

471
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:54,360
I tried to do the best I could. 
I raised her in my own home for 19 years.

472
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,560
And I beat her so she 
would never disobey me.

473
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,860
I never thought she would come 
back to her mother.

474
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:07,960
The old woman... she predicted this; 
Esmeralda would return to Tetilla des Diablo.

475
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,300
As only she was kept from this place she 
said she would remain a human, just a girl.

476
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:17,960
Coming here she becomes something else.

477
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:35,980
- You should've kill her.
- I tried... she was a child. But she kept coming back.
 
478
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:46,940
We taste of your blood that 
we join us Santànico Pandemonium.

479
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,240
Psst! Hangman!

480
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,960
Welcome to the darkness Santanico Pandemonium!

481
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,520
Send her to her rest!

482
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,900
I'm here, pappy!

483
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,990
I'm home, pappy.

484
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:24,840
No. I raised you, not your mother! I raised you!

485
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:28,720
- I know, pappy.
- I never wanted to punish you.

486
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:35,740
I know. Pappy! I love you!

487
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,990
Out of here!

488
01:24:59,999 --> 01:25:02,900
Johnny wait!

489
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,860
Get away from me.

490
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:10,520
But you brought me here. 
To the place I belong. It's safe here.

491
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:13,220
What are you talking about, Esmeralda!?

492
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,980
She is not Esmeralda!

493
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,120
She is Santanico!

494
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,200
Bitch!

495
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:11,940
Johnny! Don't leave me! Johnny!

496
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,920
Hey! What are you gonna do now?

497
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,000
What I came here to do.

498
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:40,560
Hey!

499
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,540
Do you need company?

500
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,120
Not particulary, no.

501
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,480
But Villa might.

502
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:35,040
