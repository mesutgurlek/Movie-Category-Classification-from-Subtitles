1
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,919
- Hey, mister?
- What?

2
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:15,667
- You're strong, ain't you?
- Yeah, I am strong.

3
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:22,081
- How long will it take you?
- To what?

4
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:26,413
To build the boat.
This man said that you build the boat.

5
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,557
- How long it gonna take?
- Quite a while.

6
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,956
That sure is a great gun there.

7
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,819
- How many Indians did you
kill with it? - None!

8
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,414
But I shot and scalped
a lot of curious kids.

9
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:48,849
Come on, you better get back
on the wagon.

10
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,741
You've changed a bit, haven't you
Travis? But this place sure has.

11
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,471
I see they're building a church...
A new school, huh?

12
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,572
Hell, I remember when
there was nothing here.

13
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:07,386
You had to go 100 miles north,
to cross the river. Yeah.

14
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:14,568
It sure is gonna be
a real town someday.

15
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,511
Do you ever think about
that, Travis?

16
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,539
Lots of times! Get ready 
to lower that tail.

17
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,000
Sure.

18
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:44,849
Okay, follow up behind
Trevor's wagon.

19
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:59,066
Henry! Keep an eye on that boy,
I don't want anybody wandering off.

20
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:04,413
We're near the Mexican border and there's
lots of bandits and wild Indians here.

21
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,394
Wild Indians?

22
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:12,366
I'm just spooking them a little bit,
Travis. That keeps them on line.

23
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,081
Besides you never know...

24
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:18,555
We got one more wagon.

25
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:28,925
- It sure feels good to be home.
- What did you say?

26
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:31,548
It's good to be home.

27
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:35,111
If you stay out there long
enough then you get lonely.

28
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,194
- Didn't you ever get lonely out there?
- No!

29
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,279
Well, it's different with me.

30
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,545
- Who's that?
- Roland Hal. Another squatter.

31
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,343
- Gentlemen. Step inside, I will be right back.
- Thank you, senor.

32
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:38,167
Get another sack of flower and check
up inside, please. - Yes, sir.

33
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:43,270
Now Mrs. Harrington, this will protect you
from what evil lies across that water.

34
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,770
Thank you, Reverend.
Bless you.

35
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,686
I'm only doing what any man of God would
do, help those who cross the Mighty Paraju.

36
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,937
Hello Nola.

37
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:06,641
- She needs a new horseshoe.
- It'll be ready about... about 20 minutes.

38
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,509
Take your time.

39
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,988
Hey! Close that thing!

40
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,962
Of that, I will take care of it.

41
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:52,220
Well, Mrs. Harrington. Looks like you
purged all supplies you need for the trip.

42
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,578
- Oh, thank you, Reverend. I don't know...
- Please, please...

43
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,600
This is the last
church in California.

44
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,171
This space between us is far
with grizzlies and heathens.

45
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:08,428
Now that the war is over at the border,
mercenaries will come back for the territory.

46
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,611
Sam.

47
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,590
Thank you.

48
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,623
Sam.

49
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,857
Thank you, brother.

50
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:33,535
Your donation to our church
is gratefully received.

51
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:59,402
- Hey, Travis! I got us some meat.
- Good. - Move it!

52
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,381
Go!

53
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:36,525
Is that our man?
On the barquero?

54
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,806
We had a wonderful time together.

55
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,770
Am I not beautiful, senor?

56
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,987
I need a drink.

57
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,582
Say it, senor.

58
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,750
You look beautiful.

59
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,082
Oh, how are you beautiful.

60
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:40,330
Why are you wearing a sombrero?

61
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,493
Why are you wearing stockings?

62
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,029
They are treaty.

63
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:54,558
So is my hat.

64
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:03,267
- Oh, senor. I want more. I want...
- Shut up there! Shut up!

65
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:18,628
- Why do you keep looking out the window?
- Ah, why don't you take a rest.

66
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,578
That is good.

67
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:46,091
- Good morning, Doug... - Good morning?
- Just coffee?

68
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:48,559
Yeah, yeah. Just a coffee.

69
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,416
# Lalalala... #

70
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,436
# My love... lalala #

71
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,864
# Lalalala, crazy song... #

72
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:31,431
Lalalala... you are my dream?

73
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,855
- # Lalalala... Do I smell? #
- Yeah, you sure do.

74
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,344
# Lalalala... my love... #

75
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,030
Good day, gentlemen.

76
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,638
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

77
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,263
Layeta! Layeta!

78
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,924
- What's going on? - I don't know.
- They are shooting people.

79
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:39,376
You'll be the last that heard.
I got to move.

80
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:04,571
Senor.

81
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,229
Don't you think it would be nice...

82
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,454
to take Layeta with you.

83
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:17,832
What do you think, senor?

84
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,236
- Senor! Will I see you again?
- I don't think so.

85
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,423
Wait! Did you get it all?
All right, get the mine.

86
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:30,816
-  You're so busy filling your pockets, you
could get your head out of it. - Oh, yeah.

87
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:36,476
Hey, Jake. You're right. But there is nothing
like them staking playboy in Mexico. No, man.

88
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,272
We've done had it real rich.

89
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,930
- Why don't you go out on the street show!
- Yeah...

90
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,654
- What that cricket says?
- Oh, nothing to concern us.

91
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:11,186
But what did it say?

92
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,773
- Do you know... Elaine Bingl?
- No.

93
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,991
She just gave birth
to a little Bingl.

94
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,662
- Get some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:35,247
Tell me, monsieur. Last night...
Did you enjoy the "long summer nights."

96
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,009
- That new kid, he's learning.
- "Lizard"? Yes.

97
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:19,178
You know Jacob, it's been a long time
since I've been able to read about

98
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:24,422
the period time... "French
unfamiliar words"... Tu comprend?

99
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:27,652
Tres bien.

100
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:48,794
Them blue bellies are giving us too much
trouble. Stick with that critics. - Yes.

101
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:13,180
Hey, leave that!
You had a job to do!

102
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:20,107
So do I.

103
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:27,521
Michael... This is 
gonna be one hot day.

104
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:36,536
Hey Bo, Bo...
Not so rapido. Enjoy.

105
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:44,935
What the hell is the matter?
Take them blue bellies. Damn it.

106
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,970
It must be 20, 30 cases.

107
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,680
Now we can go back to
Mexico and start the revolution.

108
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,372
- That's a lot of guns, Mr Remy.
- 30 cases!

109
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:32,355
360 of the finest repeating rifles
made in the world today!

110
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,428
Just like I promised.

111
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,910
Have you seen the power of these rifles. 
Few men will pinch you down. They are ours!

112
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:50,159
- Driver, load them up!
- All right, Jake. You heard the man!

113
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,560
Chewi, fetch the wagons and go to the mining company. 
Encow, get some more men and equip them.

114
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,212
Pack up anything for the attack.

115
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:19,077
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

116
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:25,886
- The barge is ready for crossing?
- It will be.

117
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,267
Put them on the barq.

118
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,062
What you get for your money is a river crossing.

119
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:27,322
Look at this, senor. Look at the water.

120
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:32,709
- How... how deep is it?
- Deep.

121
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:37,551
I hate the water!

122
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,811
They never do this to me more again. Never!

123
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:31,345
Hey, Jake. Miguel and me are gonna
open us an inn down at Sonara.

124
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:35,130
- And for you the drinks are on the house.
- Thanks!

125
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,253
- Hey, Charlie! Have you ever 
been in a bathtub before? - No.

126
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:42,311
You ought to try, with water.

127
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:50,150
Jake was right. We only lost a few men.

128
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:54,126
Now there'll be a bigger share for the rest of us.

129
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,596
Hey, Jake! Hey, Jake!

130
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:06,061
- What do you think of my girls?
- They are all right. - Yeah.

131
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:10,979
- When we get to Mexico, I will get you the real thing.
- Oh good! Good!

132
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:17,977
Marquette, we did it.
We really did it.

133
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:22,363
- We?
- Very good. - Yeah. Very good...

134
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,402
Just sit down real natural.

135
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:50,163
If you try anything it will take them days to 
find your head on the bottom of that river.

136
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:51,653
Sit.

137
00:24:55,532 --> 00:25:00,099
- Lopez, tie him up. Just to be safe.
- Sure. I do that right now.

138
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:05,357
You put your hands back there, please.

139
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,988
Hawk, get the horses up. Take a look around.
Make sure nobody is coming.

140
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:21,306
- He no can't get loose now.
- Good. Remy ought to be here soon.

141
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:25,635
- Now all we have to do is wait.
- Yes.

142
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:06,847
- We should stop to water the horses?
- We ain't stop until we get to Mexico.

143
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,135
No drinking on the job, Sheriff!

144
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:53,681
They give me a couple for Remy
right from here.

145
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:00,164
Good. I will make it a whole hand full.

146
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,269
It ain't gonna be easy at this distance.

147
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:08,146
I could take the shop keeper first.

148
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:13,900
- My girl is very beautiful...
- After him, my lover is beautiful.

149
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:19,734
Stop that singing. It makes me nervous. 
I don't aim too good when I'm nervous.

150
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,959
But I like to sing!

151
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:27,322
- My girl is well Incorpada
- Shut up!

152
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:32,196
Let me see... Oh, yeah...

153
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,863
The ugly blacksmith.

154
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:44,216
Now you can sing! I got them all!

155
00:27:44,773 --> 00:27:48,404
That's right, son. You've had your limit.

156
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,200
Heavy, ain't it?

157
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:57,901
Now... You are not gonna need that, are you?

158
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:07,264
Is that your friend?

159
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:14,976
You go sit beside him. Keep him company, huh.

160
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,110
Go on... Go on now. That's right.

161
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,315
Sit down!

162
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:33,684
Go on, snuggle up there... That's right.

163
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:38,111
He won't bite you... No.

164
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:56,922
- There's an Indian strolling around there. - What?
- There's an Indian out there. - Oh, no, no, no...

165
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:59,209
There was an Indian out there.

166
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:04,679
What is going on here anyway? What have 
you done? Overcharging these fellows?

167
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,538
They are waiting for Jake Remy.

168
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,608
The last thing I heard 
they were fighting in Mexico.

169
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:12,280
How many?

170
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:18,425
- How many are there?
- Calm down. Take it easy.

171
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:24,907
In just a minute and he's talking
his arm off. You just watch.

172
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:28,648
Alright, sonny. Come on. Let's go.

173
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:32,582
Walk. Slowly. Go, go on.

174
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:44,362
Yeah just keep walking. 
Put one foot in front of the other.

175
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:05,559
Ants are useful creatures, you know?

176
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,987
Yes, sir.

177
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:09,394
Like you just take right now, for example...

178
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:14,927
if you want to get that shirt off lice, 
them things will be overjoyed to do the job.

179
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:21,558
Look at them buggers eat...
Ain't they enjoying now?

180
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,931
Ants love lice, you know?

181
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,946
I'll tell it's a fact of life that
all God's creatures got to eat.

182
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:36,415
Now you take me. I've eaten everything 
that walked, that swam, crawled, or rigged...

183
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,501
Even ate the soles of my moccasins one time...

184
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:47,436
Oh, yeah. The there was a time I ate black criquets. 
Those were very lean times.

185
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,878
Hell, I even ate ants!

186
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,203
Hey. Come here.

187
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:09,763
This is what I call filling the meat bag...

188
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:11,866
Want you some? No?

189
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:17,338
That's too bad because if you don't eat them...

190
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,296
...they are gonna eat you . That's life.

191
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:25,859
Here. Come on.

192
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,372
- No! Wait, wait!
- Oh, you got something to say?

193
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,690
We were send ahead.

194
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,732
Remy and the rest were heading Buckskin. 
They are on their way here.

195
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:42,596
What for?

196
00:31:43,873 --> 00:31:46,218
He said: what for?

197
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:50,147
- Here. Come on, now.
- Oh God, no!

198
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:52,494
Wait... There is more?

199
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:59,973
They get back to Mexico. Remy is gonna
burn the barge after he crosses the river.

200
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:04,633
He talked.

201
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,380
Now what the hell is the matter?

202
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,488
It looks like we're done bogged down, Jake.

203
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,587
- You want me to ride ahead?
- Yeah.

204
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:42,399
Driver, you take five men and go with him.

205
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,628
You get your ass down of the wagons 
and put your shoulders on that wheel!

206
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:48,222
I was just thinking that same thing.

207
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:19,203
Give them a hand.

208
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,961
Hurry up, Kathy.

209
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:28,775
- Get everybody on that barge. Everybody!
- Yes.

210
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:34,114
You don't understand, everything I own is here. 
I just can't leave my store!

211
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:37,623
Why don't we let just let them pass? 
Maybe they won't make troubles.

212
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:41,134
- You are talking like a damn fool.
- Travis is right.

213
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:44,143
Jake Remy will use Lonely Dell to light a cigar. 
He'll eats every one.

214
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:45,973
Boatman, Boatman!

215
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:52,302
You just best worry about crossing the river. 
And hope that Remy don't show up with Moses's staff.

216
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,486
- Now get the hell out of here!
- Now you just listen to me, Travis...

217
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:59,428
Reverend, he's right. He is always right.

218
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,486
Now go on and get the hell out of here!

219
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:13,765
- You're not coming with us?
- In a minute.

220
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:38,062
We have to get that boat before it crosses the river.

221
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:42,735
- What the hell could have happened to Fair?!
- How the hell should I know?

222
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,521
Gentlemen, we go to work. You go there.

223
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,460
- Have you seen Roland?
- No, ma'am.

224
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,316
- Get on the barge!
- No, I have to find Roland - Get on the barge!

225
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:26,543
I just don't understand you, Fire Eyes. 
To nanny a bunch of squads...

226
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,133
I don't neither. Come on.

227
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,256
These are fines shooting sticks, but 
they ain't not good for this work.

228
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:01,209
- Hey, Fire Eyes. - Yeah?
Them boys are not quite to get.

229
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,059
I think so.

230
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:09,101
- Phil, get on the barge.
- Okay.

231
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,426
Move it. Move it.

232
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:45,543
Well, what now, General?

233
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:49,012
- You go over there.
- No, not me!

234
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:58,814
Maybe you're right. Nothing more we can do here. 
Save your fight and your life for later.

235
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:01,099
- Thanks.
- You are welcome.

236
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:31,917
- Jacob! - What the hell happened?
- We could do nothing.

237
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,046
Where is Fair, Where is that bastard?

238
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:38,597
Well I don't know. But believe me, 
all this shooting is to no good.

239
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,599
Cease fire!

240
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,315
Cease fire, damn it!

241
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:25,273
What are you thinking on doing now, Jake?

242
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:36,125
Shine it!

243
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:40,580
Jacob.

244
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:44,769
Jacob.

245
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:02,291
Will you cut me in on this trip?
For a buck a head there must be a lot.

246
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,944
- I'll think of it.
- Yeah.

247
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,015
You're all right, Susy?

248
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,887
Is everything okay? Samuel Smith, 
Wright, McAdams, Williams.

249
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:08,948
A 50 yards apart. Come on.

250
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:11,881
Come on, boy. Get up.

251
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:16,024
Nolan, come on.

252
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,553
Hurry up!

253
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:24,822
Gibson. Gibson. Get up there! 
Get on the pier!

254
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:29,135
Keep 50 yards apart. Hurry up!

255
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:32,338
Keep 50 yards apart. Hurry up. Come on!

256
00:42:38,297 --> 00:42:41,762
- Hey Jake, I got an idea.
- Forget it. - Yeah, but Jake?

257
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,720
- Shut up, Happy.
- Yeah, I am shut.

258
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,069
Hey barquero!

259
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:14,925
I wanna talk to you.

260
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:21,112
- Hey boy... Go fetch him.
- Yes sir.

261
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:31,291
- Mr. Travis.
- Yeah. - Mr. Remy wants to talk to you.

262
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,693
I heard him. Tell him that I will 
be with him in a minute.

263
00:43:34,693 --> 00:43:38,630
- You'll be with him in a minute?
- I know what he wants. There's hurry.

264
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:41,850
Yes, sir.

265
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:50,602
Mr. Travis says, he won't talk 
to him for a minute.

266
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,057
- Tell him. - Huh?
- Go on. Tell him.

267
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:57,864
Yes, sir.

268
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:10,271
- Are you the bargeman?
- No! I ain't him!

269
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:16,141
- What did he say?
- He is not the barquero.

270
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:18,182
- Mr. Remy!
- Yeah?

271
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:25,010
Mr. Travis, the fellow that owns the barge, 
he said he will be with you in a minute...

272
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:26,833
What?

273
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:32,583
- Did you hear what he said? In a minute!
- Jacob remember, you need this man.

274
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,340
All right.

275
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:38,448
All right.

276
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:54,854
Do you have a match?

277
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:59,796
- You best take two.
- Thanks.

278
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,282
Are you the bargeman?

279
00:45:11,072 --> 00:45:16,778
- Yeah!
- Listen, I want to buy your boat, fair and square.

280
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:22,170
I got this wagon load of silver here. 
Bring it up!

281
00:45:23,735 --> 00:45:25,470
Bring it up!

282
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:37,172
Look! All this's silver!

283
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:43,231
For your boat!

284
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:48,306
If you strike a bargain with me, we'll 
cross peacefully, we'll hurt nobody...

285
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:53,145
- I got your word on that, huh?
- That's right.

286
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:57,234
- How about it?
- Well, I'll tell you Remy...

287
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:03,714
I sure got a fondness for this boat, 
just as I would have for a good horse.

288
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:11,168
And I wouldn't sell this boat to any man unless I 
really knew he'd love it, the same as I would a horse.

289
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:14,738
You wanna sell that boat, or not?

290
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:18,369
Did you ever own a boat before, Remy?

291
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:24,735
What did you say?

292
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:31,087
I said you would not sell your favorite horse
to a man who did not know its head from its tail.

293
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,587
What the hell is the head and tail of a boat?

294
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:36,100
Jake, he has no intention of selling you that boat.

295
00:46:39,868 --> 00:46:44,824
I'll wipe you out! 
I'll kill every last one of you!

296
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:49,151
No trickle of water is gonna stop me, 
you hear me?

297
00:46:49,151 --> 00:46:54,931
I will damn this stick and river with 
your bodies! Every last one of you!

298
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:07,846
I swear I will.

299
00:47:11,993 --> 00:47:16,423
- Well, here's my idea...
- You know what to do with it.

300
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:20,046
Travis.

301
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:23,395
I think we should seriously consider 
let them have the barge.

302
00:47:23,395 --> 00:47:27,628
- Remy has got no reason killing us.
- These kind don't need a reason to kill.

303
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:32,057
- But do we really hold them?
- Well, we got control of the river and if they cross...

304
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:35,194
Take them off.

305
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:40,678
- Maybe you like us to burn the barge, huh?
- And that is a good idea!

306
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:47,450
- Then maybe they leave. They'd have no reason to stay.
- That's my barge.

307
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:52,168
And nobody is gonna burn it. 
Not you, not Remy.

308
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,850
Wolf is wolf and sheep is sheep.

309
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,151
You should not look for your grave, Fire Eyes.

310
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:20,873
Hey.

311
00:48:21,574 --> 00:48:26,432
Why not have delivered you from settlers 
and throw on with me? How would you like that?

312
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,755
- It sounds good.
- Will, come on! - Not now.

313
00:48:36,729 --> 00:48:41,994
You mean... you're going to 
make a stand with a bunch of squatters?

314
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:49,374
My ass... 
with a bunch of settlers?

315
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:53,596
Don't you know that in a few years, 
they gonna push us out of this wilderness?

316
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:57,225
- There won't be no wilderness.
- She's right.

317
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,234
There will only be settlers everywhere. 

318
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:04,767
All of them plows the ground, and dropping fence posts...
It makes me sick to think about it even.

319
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,051
And you want to help them?

320
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:12,417
I don't give a damn about them.

321
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,612
Well... if he is bound to stay... 
I'm gonna stay with you.

322
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,158
But I don't like it!

323
00:49:26,902 --> 00:49:29,940
Wolf is wolf and sheep is sheep.

324
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:34,966
You may stay with them, but 
they ain't gonna stay with you.

325
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,100
Afternoon.

326
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:04,745
If I see you even breathe, 
then I'm gonna cut your throat.

327
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:08,791
Don't blame me then. You understand?

328
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:16,282
Yes, swallow is alright.

329
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,633
Damn barge!

330
00:50:46,614 --> 00:50:48,962
Jacob... don't you think we could...

331
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:53,693
divide the money now and 
let everybody go his own way?

332
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,454
- No.
- Why not?

333
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:03,272
Because we're gonna take that barge 
and cross the river...

334
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:05,619
As we set out to do!

335
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:09,705
Jacob, this morning we massacred an American town.

336
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:15,453
- By now half of Fort Bowie is coming after us.
- It don't matter.

337
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:21,331
Before they get here, we will have crossed 
with the wagons and burned the barge.

338
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:25,575
You are assuming a lot. You know...

339
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:32,728
the only thing that kept our men together, 
was the need for violence and money.

340
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:35,504
This morning they got their share of the violence.

341
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:40,718
Now, all they want is 
their share of money and to split up.

342
00:51:46,008 --> 00:51:47,558
Hell...

343
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:52,956
- And you?
- Yes Jacob, I do too.

344
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:55,605
Will you listen to me, damn it.

345
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,319
I kept that bastards together after 
they got whipped down in Cajuilla.

346
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,851
I did it! Because I know how!

347
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,007
And I know how to make us rich.

348
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:10,318
Jacob. we are rich. Let us stay that way.

349
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,828
We separate here and now. 
Why take a chance we may not get the barge?

350
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:18,747
You and me are going to take our stuff
across that river. And that's it!

351
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:32,220
We will have power, you and me...

352
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:37,755
You will be important, Marquette.

353
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:40,174
Your brains and me leading...

354
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:42,460
We'll have men, guns.

355
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:45,579
Money! Power!

356
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,820
An empire!

357
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:55,992
- You think about that, Marquette?
- I am...

358
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:03,295
- Maybe you're right.
- Damn right, I am right.

359
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:13,082
You know, Jacob... You and me. We're like...

360
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:16,685
- supplementary angles.
- Hm?

361
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:23,782
It's basic trigonometry. It is short
for an angle of complete 180 degrees.

362
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:28,593
You and me... We each got an angle...

363
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:36,884
Alone, we are short... 
Together, 180 degrees.

364
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:39,749
A whole hemisphere.

365
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:55,045
Don't shoot! It's me, Jacob Remy.

366
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,940
All right, Happy?

367
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:07,018
You are awesome pretty. Awesome pretty.

368
00:54:08,754 --> 00:54:11,652
- Here, my friend.
- Very elegant.

369
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:19,046
The river. You are worried? 
Well, don't. It's no problem. You trust me.

370
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:21,912
I trust you, Jacob.

371
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:26,950
But your crown is a little 
crooked, your majesty.

372
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,838
- Driver! - Yeah? - Get some men up on the hill. 
I don't want them blue bellies over my ass.

373
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:42,389
Chewi, Rodriguez, take your guns 
and get up on the hill!

374
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:49,011
- OK, Lopa start shoveling.
- What is he gonna do now?

375
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:55,915
I've fought with Ramos and Manuel Toril in Mexico. 
None of us has the savior or courage as Remy.

376
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:01,619
He got three bullets with him, and walk 
with them would walk like a wounded buffalo.

377
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:04,578
No, kid. I'm not worried.

378
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:10,165
He'll get the barge.

379
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:18,515
Well, if he don't by nightfall...
I'm taking all I can carry and clear out.

380
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:22,597
You... move 100 yards down there.

381
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:31,518
- I wanna talk to you.
- You already have had your saying over here.

382
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:34,327
I'm standing on the wrong side 
of this damn river.

383
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:36,238
Everything I own is over there.

384
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:39,986
And I'm not gonna sit around and watch 
some lunatic destroy it.

385
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:42,467
Listen, Reverend...

386
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:49,779
I saw you steal the poor people 
who have been through Lonely Dell.

387
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:54,489
And you ordained yourself when 
you saw they bought religion.

388
00:55:54,747 --> 00:55:59,420
Well, I don't give a damn which side of this river 
you are on. You better stay at the right side by me.

389
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:03,245
Well, it seems my ordain was not high enough.

390
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:06,832
You beat me, you made yourself God.

391
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,130
Blessed be Travis, blessed be his holy name.

392
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:16,571
Thank you. I have got work to do.

393
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:41,882
Did they feed you yet? 
I asked: Did they feed you yet?

394
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,675
Yeah... I ain't surprised.

395
00:56:47,855 --> 00:56:52,161
With all this doing, 
they only got time to feed themselves.

396
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:55,006
Here...

397
00:56:57,674 --> 00:56:59,590
Go on. Go on... beef jerky

398
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:05,989
Yeah?

399
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:09,295
That's pretty good, ain't it?

400
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:14,787
You know, you're not such bad, 
now that I close look at you.

401
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:19,689
One thing is for sure: you ain't gonna 
be driving no fence posts, will you?

402
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:22,465
Yeah. That beef jerky is pretty good.

403
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,574
Of course it's not as good as buffalo hump.

404
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:30,462
And it's better than ants. Now ain't it?

405
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,708
You chew. I got a surprise for you.

406
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,411
Dessert.

407
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,326
Look at it.

408
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:44,789
Here.

409
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,577
That ain't even, is it?

410
00:57:51,564 --> 00:57:53,176
Now it is.

411
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,932
Ain't that good?

412
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:21,920
I got this gold chain of her, in Buckskin. 
But I ain't got no keys to put on it.

413
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:27,452
- That's really a problem.
- You know, I had a key once...

414
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:32,004
that opened the door to this house 
me and my wife had in Sonara.

415
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:39,368
Then one day I went to fight in your rebellion, then to
Mexico to fight my Revolution, now I'm fighting with Remy.

416
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:44,833
You see, I wonder what 
that woman is doing right now?

417
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,867
- What woman?
- My wife, amigo.

418
00:58:48,603 --> 00:58:49,849
Oh...

419
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:43,130
- Stop firing! Stop firing!
- Cease firing! - Stop firing!

420
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:49,692
Jacob, who ever that barquero is,
he is no ordinary bargeman.

421
00:59:49,692 --> 00:59:52,491
I wondered what was in his mind.
And now I know.

422
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:56,677
He's using that barge as bait to 
keep us here until the army comes.

423
00:59:57,523 --> 00:59:59,442
We got time.

424
01:00:14,707 --> 01:00:18,337
Hey... I don't think 
Jake is gonna like that.

425
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:24,932
Well, I don't think Jake is gonna know 
...unless you open your big mouth.

426
01:00:24,932 --> 01:00:29,750
And if you do, this is gonna close it. 
You understand?

427
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:33,990
- Oh, yeah.
- Get back to your girls.

428
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,755
Thank you.

429
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:59,208
You dropped your bracelet.
Keep it.

430
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:04,658
I think you dropped this too.

431
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:11,436
Now put it back. All of it.

432
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,142
You see? I told you 
Jake wouldn't gonna like that.

433
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,087
I told you...

434
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:39,706
Go ahead. Tie me up. Tie up
everyone who disagrees with you.

435
01:01:39,706 --> 01:01:42,665
Just make sure you got enough rope.

436
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:47,847
- Burning the barge isn't the answer.
- Sure as hell it isn't.

437
01:01:56,983 --> 01:01:59,637
It fits. Remember that.

438
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:19,844
This is not the time for that. 
We have to keep our heads clear.

439
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:30,575
This clears my head... 
I always think better later.

440
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:42,883
Jacob...

441
01:02:45,051 --> 01:02:47,148
you know that I've always stuck with you...

442
01:02:47,148 --> 01:02:51,579
after Maximilian was killed and 
all my countrymen left Mexico.

443
01:02:53,785 --> 01:02:58,157
After Don Ramos... I stayed with you...

444
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:04,573
because I thought with you... one day 
I might return to France, a rich man.

445
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:11,359
You still will be, my friend. 
You still will...

446
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:17,361
My friend... I begin to have doubts.

447
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,041
I think you are making a mistake.

448
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:27,198
It was a good plan. It is all gone bad and...

449
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:33,243
I think we must show some wisdom
and salvage what we can.

450
01:03:35,576 --> 01:03:39,940
No, I may never have as many men again.

451
01:03:40,664 --> 01:03:44,663
We will do whatever we 
have to do with less men.

452
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:46,811
Hm?

453
01:03:48,081 --> 01:03:52,385
We will do whatever we
have to do with less men.

454
01:04:03,919 --> 01:04:06,388
That damned bargeman.

455
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:35,776
That damned bargeman...

456
01:06:45,225 --> 01:06:46,531
Jacob.

457
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,437
Jacob.

458
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:04,591
Did good things come to you, my friend?

459
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:10,370
Don Ramos?

460
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:15,937
I got him. And I got his men.

461
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:24,431
- And that makes me better than him.
- He was a magnificent leader.

462
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:28,066
He was a son of a bitch.

463
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:34,857
You know, Jacob... it seems that 
not all of the people of Lonely Dell...

464
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:40,635
made it across to the other side. 
One was going hunting.

465
01:07:41,341 --> 01:07:43,566
He just came back.

466
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:01,398
Good, them settlers didn't stop complaining.

467
01:08:01,398 --> 01:08:05,370
If they'd ride up right now, 
there would be a short of rations.

468
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,367
They are afraid to take over 
that food and ammunition.

469
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:14,899
- They're better off here than roaming out there alone.
- Yeah, it will be a long night for them.

470
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,895
Hey, bargeman!

471
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,879
I've a friend of yours here.

472
01:08:28,446 --> 01:08:32,576
- Don't tell me he got one of the settlers.
- Now I will bring him!

473
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:37,696
What's your name, dude? 
I said what's your name, dude!

474
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:42,957
- Roland, Roland Hal.
- I got you Roland Hall!

475
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:58,915
And I'm gonna baptize this sinner!

476
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:16,896
So you better get that boat over here, quick!

477
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:22,917
We got our own hostage.

478
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:32,347
- Get him.
- Yeah, Fire Eyes.

479
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,921
- Remy!
- Yeah?

480
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:40,998
Two can play that game  as well as one!

481
01:09:49,844 --> 01:09:54,703
Yeah, I know I keep you well fed for some good reason.

482
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,389
Here we go. Come on. Stand up, sonny. 
You will take a little a walk.

483
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:20,992
Hey, Remy! 
we got you a genuine bargain here!

484
01:10:23,035 --> 01:10:25,836
I trade you this rascal for that settler.

485
01:10:25,836 --> 01:10:30,742
- Is that you, Fair?
- Yeah, Remy. It's me, it's Fair.

486
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:34,640
Hey boy, you talk louder than that.
Go on, speak up.

487
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:38,991
Remy! It's me, Fair!

488
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:43,207
I'll be damned.

489
01:10:45,347 --> 01:10:48,445
- Jake.
- Yeah?

490
01:10:50,553 --> 01:10:56,900
Ready. Aim... Fire!

491
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,684
Cease fire.

492
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:12,553
Now, you damn settlers, 
all you got to swap is that boat!

493
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:20,873
I was beginning to like that fellow.

494
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:24,312
Poe, tie it up.

495
01:11:30,305 --> 01:11:33,592
Him... for the boat!

496
01:11:35,282 --> 01:11:38,425
But take your time, think it over. 
There ain't no hurry.

497
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:42,230
And in a little while...

498
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:46,537
I'm lower down the settler about 30 cm...

499
01:11:48,423 --> 01:11:51,137
to explore the bottom of this river.

500
01:11:52,588 --> 01:11:57,015
But like I said, 
take your time, think it over.

501
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:04,404
All right, boys. We're gonna have one drink.

502
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:09,219
- The bar is open. Then we're pulling out.
- Yeah.

503
01:12:10,215 --> 01:12:12,807
You two stay on guard.

504
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:22,883
- Come on, give me a hand.
- You're getting old?

505
01:12:23,362 --> 01:12:26,984
I'm trying to give this fellow 
some kind of decent burial.

506
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:31,791
After all the trouble get rid of them ants, 
it would be shameful to be eaten by them.

507
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:33,403
Yeah, come on.

508
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:59,250
This wouldn't have happened if 
we had burned the barge.

509
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:03,433
If you touch the barge, I'll shoot 
you where it hurts the most.

510
01:13:04,485 --> 01:13:06,403
She will.

511
01:13:12,713 --> 01:13:16,040
Now, come on. Let's get back. 
Come on. Come on.

512
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:50,117
I want you to get Roland.

513
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:53,211
If I could... But it is impossible.

514
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:59,712
If I give this barge to Remy, he'll 
kill all of us. As well as Roland.

515
01:14:01,624 --> 01:14:04,827
- You never knew Roland very well.
- No.

516
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,218
Not the rest either.

517
01:14:09,734 --> 01:14:14,009
I respected you for that. 
They hated it.

518
01:14:14,009 --> 01:14:20,057
The way you put yourself above them, with that 
woman of you and live the way you pleased.

519
01:14:20,057 --> 01:14:24,056
Roland and I talked a lot about it. 
He could not understand you.

520
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:27,369
- And you could?
- Yes.

521
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:29,542
Does that surprise you?

522
01:14:30,822 --> 01:14:32,006
Yes.

523
01:14:33,332 --> 01:14:36,332
It's because you never looked very close at me.

524
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:40,993
- Well now, that's where you're wrong.
- I know you looked at me like that.

525
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,342
But you didn't put a study on it.

526
01:14:44,342 --> 01:14:48,677
I study those things that are 
important to me, to keep me alive.

527
01:14:50,547 --> 01:14:54,998
Give them the barge. I'll do 
whatever you ask, if you do.

528
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,781
It seems to be my day for bargains.

529
01:15:02,781 --> 01:15:04,699
Travis, listen to me.

530
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:08,791
As long as you've lived 
you have never known a real woman...

531
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:14,324
You have known half woman, half man 
like that excuse for a woman you're keeping.

532
01:15:14,324 --> 01:15:17,283
But never a woman who was all woman.

533
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:20,269
You spent your life among the other kind...

534
01:15:20,269 --> 01:15:26,045
to travel from one cabin to another, who
pretend for four, five minutes to be woman.

535
01:15:26,156 --> 01:15:29,361
And then go back to the work of a man.

536
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:32,970
I'm something you've never had before.

537
01:15:35,175 --> 01:15:36,848
Mrs. Hall...

538
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,634
Is your husband the only reason for this bargain?

539
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:47,102
- Because he isn't, you know?
- We are the same in our own way...

540
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:56,931
I'd give anything to spend a night with you.

541
01:15:57,865 --> 01:15:59,722
Anything.

542
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:09,281
Except my barge!

543
01:17:00,268 --> 01:17:03,106
Do you think he deserves that?

544
01:17:05,764 --> 01:17:09,519
Well... it'll keep the ants of him. Maybe.

545
01:17:13,192 --> 01:17:18,866
- There is a place up stream where we can swim.
- Are you crazy?

546
01:17:20,413 --> 01:17:25,087
If we go there, that Remy will give us a baptize 
just like he's done to that poor bastard.


547
01:17:25,838 --> 01:17:29,104
- Are you scared?
- No, no. I don't think so.

548
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,827
But I don't think my Red brothers 
understand me being a Christian...

549
01:17:34,827 --> 01:17:38,984
- without a good reason.
- I got a good reason.

550
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,624
You?

551
01:17:42,482 --> 01:17:48,961
- I just thought you'd like to keep me company.
- I will tell you something...

552
01:17:48,963 --> 01:17:52,421
my visits with you are gonna get 
scarcer and scarcer.

553
01:17:54,073 --> 01:17:56,115
You plumb wear me out.

554
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:07,390
Hey...

555
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:13,406
Hey! You stinking settler! 
Wake up!

556
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:17,500
Don't you die on me. Wake up!

557
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:56,546
If they don't make up their mind quick...

558
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:59,583
I'm gonna letting on this rope.

559
01:19:08,427 --> 01:19:10,897
I sure hate to do that.

560
01:19:12,273 --> 01:19:14,561
You understand me, don't you?

561
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:26,228
Yeah.

562
01:19:28,588 --> 01:19:31,303
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

563
01:19:57,702 --> 01:20:00,416
Look at me. I'm a mess!

564
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,104
Marquette. Tomorrow we will be in Mexico.

565
01:20:14,426 --> 01:20:18,734
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Thanks, but I'm busy.

566
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:24,688
If we had split up the stuff, you know 
where they would be now, don't you?

567
01:20:33,497 --> 01:20:37,690
- Last drink, folks!
- Drink up, son!

568
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:41,343
Get them guns, not ammo.
Let's get ready to go out.

569
01:20:41,343 --> 01:20:44,240
Hey, Jake. He don't believe it.

570
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:51,182
Thurlo, you feel like walking? 
Get him out of the tub. We're leaving.

571
01:20:53,127 --> 01:20:57,475
- Now you believe?
- Come on. We just leave that whiskey.

572
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:59,335
That's a shame.

573
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:34,202
Hey. We got to get rid of those manure...

574
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:38,183
and those guards up at the dock.

575
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:43,386
I was hoping you might start a little stampede.

576
01:21:47,216 --> 01:21:49,746
Fire Eyes, you are a devil.

577
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:51,196
She was awful pretty, you know? She got
into bed, I got into bed right behind her...

578
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:59,123
And you know what happened? She pulled 
the light out and she told me to get out.

579
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:04,533
It's hard to believe, ain't it? 
You better get on there now.

580
01:23:06,143 --> 01:23:10,264
Encow, you better drop what you're doing 
and come on out of there!

581
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,457
Phil, damn it. Come on!

582
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:59,111
- Hey Encow.
- Who's that? - It's me, Happy.

583
01:24:04,964 --> 01:24:07,066
You ain't Encow.

584
01:24:10,591 --> 01:24:13,183
I bet you ain't happy.

585
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:55,451
Stay here. Watch the hostage.

586
01:26:05,104 --> 01:26:06,471
Sawyer!

587
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:11,449
Inform our leader we've lost our hostage.

588
01:26:13,255 --> 01:26:14,561
Yeah.

589
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:18,233
Phil.

590
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:27,298
Wait for me.

591
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:36,805
- I've just got dry.
- You want to stay here with Remy?

592
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:39,703
No. It's good wet again.

593
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:03,891
Hey.

594
01:27:04,918 --> 01:27:06,163
Jake.

595
01:27:27,362 --> 01:27:29,344
Jake! Jake! Jake!

596
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:36,707
Jake.

597
01:27:37,398 --> 01:27:42,135
- Jake. They got him! They cut him down. 
The hostage... - Sh!

598
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:45,953
Listen.

599
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:49,799
They cut him down. 
The hostage....

600
01:27:57,915 --> 01:27:59,588
Yeah, I know.

601
01:28:02,014 --> 01:28:06,258
How we get the boat now, Jake? 
What do we do?

602
01:28:11,907 --> 01:28:13,519
I don't know.

603
01:28:31,282 --> 01:28:32,895
I don't know.

604
01:28:40,622 --> 01:28:43,766
Get away. You're breathing my air.

605
01:28:48,002 --> 01:28:49,493
Turn around.

606
01:28:58,819 --> 01:29:00,309
Turn around.

607
01:29:02,216 --> 01:29:04,930
Turn around!

608
01:29:08,981 --> 01:29:16,345
I'm tired of all of you...
staring at my back when I'm speaking.

609
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:21,474
Jake.

610
01:29:27,506 --> 01:29:29,422
Go on.
Leave me alone.

611
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:38,534
Jake.

612
01:30:41,286 --> 01:30:42,533
Jake.

613
01:30:45,393 --> 01:30:47,373
I shot the river.

614
01:31:19,984 --> 01:31:26,861
I sure thought you'd let Dell throw in
with me. I see now that you ain't.

615
01:31:26,964 --> 01:31:30,923
- You may never...
- You are leaving?

616
01:31:30,923 --> 01:31:35,473
Well, you don't need me no more. 
You and them settlers has got Remy...

617
01:31:35,506 --> 01:31:38,097
He sure ain't gonna stick around.

618
01:31:40,618 --> 01:31:41,740
Hey.

619
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:46,738
Why don't you and Nola 
just make some tracks with me?

620
01:31:46,738 --> 01:31:50,126
Three of us can awful get lost
in the wilderness, huh?

621
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,525
You go. We'll get you.

622
01:31:59,005 --> 01:32:00,802
Sure.

623
01:32:07,123 --> 01:32:09,656
Why we don't go with him?

624
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,075
No.

625
01:32:13,081 --> 01:32:14,633
Not yet.

626
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:18,732
Mrs. Hall...

627
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:24,958
All your husband needs now is 
just a little sleep.

628
01:32:46,632 --> 01:32:49,038
To keep me warm.

629
01:32:50,745 --> 01:32:52,603
Welcome styling?

630
01:32:56,461 --> 01:32:58,135
Not a styling.

631
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:46,341
Separate the pieces of lumber. 
We need eight rounded beams.

632
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:49,116
- Where do you want to put these?
- Right there.

633
01:34:49,444 --> 01:34:53,444
- Remy is gonna be in for a big surprise.
- I hope they round up the rest of the horses...

634
01:34:53,444 --> 01:34:57,260
- Just in case this plan of yours don't work.
- Don't work?

635
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:02,484
I have the solution to Remy problems. 
Now get some more barrels and some rope.

636
01:35:05,593 --> 01:35:08,980
Take off those heavy beams and 
rip off their plankings.

637
01:35:33,155 --> 01:35:34,976
What are you doing with those barrels?

638
01:35:34,976 --> 01:35:39,773
Marquette want it. Mr Remy, you 
and Rodrigez went out.

639
01:35:55,699 --> 01:35:58,719
What are you building, Marquette?

640
01:35:58,991 --> 01:36:00,787
Building two rafts.

641
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:18,318
- Two rafts, huh?
- Yes.

642
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,290
To cross the river.

643
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:24,521
We put half of the men on one barge,
half on the other and go across.

644
01:36:24,521 --> 01:36:27,543
One raft on each side of the barquero's barge.

645
01:36:28,023 --> 01:36:31,778
We will have concentrated firepower
which will blast us on the shore.

646
01:36:49,443 --> 01:36:51,791
You see Jacob, 
it is just as you said.

647
01:36:52,978 --> 01:36:56,009
My brains, and your leadership.

648
01:36:56,009 --> 01:36:58,356
We will be big men.

649
01:37:05,999 --> 01:37:07,184
Yeah.

650
01:37:10,932 --> 01:37:14,196
You know all the time something 
like this would happen.

651
01:37:16,535 --> 01:37:19,310
You just don't give a damn, do you?

652
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:21,682
You have hated the Dell from the beginning.

653
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:28,403
When I built that barge I did 
figure on anyone settling around me.

654
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:35,535
I saw the river for years. I watched men go around it,
as some fence with a sign 'No tress passing' on it.

655
01:37:37,576 --> 01:37:41,453
I don't like fences, any kind.

656
01:37:41,635 --> 01:37:44,474
So I tore that fence down.

657
01:37:45,162 --> 01:37:49,162
Back in the East I read books about
men who were taming the wilderness.

658
01:37:50,441 --> 01:37:52,603
I dreamed about those men.

659
01:37:53,837 --> 01:37:56,123
They weren't like you.

660
01:37:56,873 --> 01:38:01,789
They weren't like you. They were 
statues people could look up to.

661
01:38:02,899 --> 01:38:07,513
The only resemblance you bear 
to a statue is pigeon droppings.

662
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:16,431
- They may be help for you yet.
- No, Travis.

663
01:38:16,695 --> 01:38:19,103
You're the one there is no hope for.

664
01:38:19,295 --> 01:38:23,703
After you are dead, me and my kind will 
still be here, and everything will be ours.

665
01:38:23,703 --> 01:38:26,966
You're like those prehistoric beasts 
that have become extinct.

666
01:38:26,966 --> 01:38:31,334
They will write nice stories about your kind.
You will be a hero and all that...

667
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:34,584
But most of all, you will be dead.

668
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,568
It was since I've been here, 
I ain't been getting nothing.

669
01:40:15,692 --> 01:40:18,347
But I got the deck now...

670
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:24,642
And I am doing the dealing.
And I'm gonna win this game.

671
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:29,985
Because I got me a Marquette on my sleeve.

672
01:42:24,828 --> 01:42:26,135
Now!

673
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:49,002
- Cut the rope!
- But then the barge shall be no good to us.

674
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:51,749
I said cut, damn it!

675
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:07,019
Driver, get that son of a bitch!

676
01:44:11,442 --> 01:44:15,545
Mr. Remy. Mr. Remy...

677
01:44:17,913 --> 01:44:19,404
Mister...

678
01:44:38,728 --> 01:44:41,318
You and your brains!

679
01:44:55,017 --> 01:44:56,281
Hi.

680
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:59,610
- Hi.
- What's your name?

681
01:45:01,141 --> 01:45:04,222
- Driver.
- Nice name.

682
01:45:05,324 --> 01:45:07,058
Mine is Phil.

683
01:45:08,087 --> 01:45:12,147
I'm glad I came back,
or I wouldn't have met you, friend.

684
01:45:13,465 --> 01:45:16,193
Friend... well, then...

685
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:20,754
You're fighting for Remy,
and me am fighting for the settlers.

686
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:25,553
That don't hardly make us friends, do it?

687
01:45:29,225 --> 01:45:32,306
Even your eyes ain't friends...

688
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:39,228
Yeah well... I reckon we've
done talking long enough, huh?

689
01:45:52,626 --> 01:45:55,095
One will do it without saying.

690
01:47:14,754 --> 01:47:16,612
Barquero!

691
01:47:18,445 --> 01:47:21,895
We should have met another time.

692
01:47:23,166 --> 01:47:26,615
Yeah.
When you didn't want my barge.

693
01:47:29,674 --> 01:47:32,395
Oh yeah, that barge...

694
01:47:32,809 --> 01:47:35,033
Well I can see it's yours.

695
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:40,743
You might have had a free cut, 
if not for that barge.

696
01:47:42,384 --> 01:47:48,098
How about running to you down in Mexico,
we'd have killed a bottle of tequila together?

697
01:47:50,288 --> 01:47:54,901
- We'd have killed something, for sure.
- Yeah!
