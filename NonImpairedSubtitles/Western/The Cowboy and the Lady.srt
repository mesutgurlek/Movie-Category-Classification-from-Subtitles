1
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,420
Look at this, Chief.

2
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,160
List of the people who were in that club,
the one that was raided last night.

3
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,293
-Anybody we're after?
-There's a Mary Smith on it.

4
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,235
I got a hunch it's Judge Smith's daughter.

5
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,364
Judge Smith's daughter
in a joint like that? You're crazy.

6
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,535
-Somebody said they recognized her.
-Recognized her? How?

7
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,236
The old gent won't even let
her picture be public.

8
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,007
Let alone go out by herself.

9
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,515
Especially now that he is out for
the presidential nomination.

10
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,381
That's just it. Now's our chance
to pounce on the old bird.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,249
How do you know
the girl hasn't cut loose?

12
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,915
And now, gentlemen,
I should like to propose a toast.

13
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,922
At all these organization dinners,
we have been entertained by a hostess

14
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,760
whose charm is only exceeded
by her beauty.

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,299
And I'm sure that no one here
will think me premature

16
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,298
if I offer a toast to Mary Smith.

17
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,540
The next first lady of the land.

18
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,476
-Success to you, Mary.
-And your father. Good luck.

19
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,381
Good evening. Would you tell Mr. Smith
his secretary must see him at once?

20
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,513
It's very important. I'll wait in the study.

21
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,976
-Yes, Chester, what is it?
-May I see you alone, sir?

22
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,917
Oh, that's my brother,
Professor Hannibal Smith.

23
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,853
How do you do?
Don't mind me, I'm the poor relation.

24
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,389
Mr. Smith, there was a gambling place
that was raided last night.

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,727
Yes.

26
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,055
The newspapers have a list
of the people who were there.

27
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,126
How does that concern me?
I never frequent such places.

28
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,727
Your daughter's name is on that list, sir.

29
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,070
My daughter?

30
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,097
You're insane. My daughter wouldn't think
of setting foot in...

31
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,300
Well, I thought so, too.

32
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,800
But here's the list.

33
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,138
And the newspapers
are checking up all those names.

34
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,112
Probably some other Mary Smith.
I'll send for my daughter.

35
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,249
Needn't bother, Horace. I'm afraid
it was our little Mary, all right.

36
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,978
You saw her, I suppose.

37
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,812
-I took her.
-You took her?

38
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,451
-Will you please explain that?
-Sure.

39
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,951
Now, you see, I felt sorry for her.

40
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,953
I'll bet that girl hasn't talked to a man
under 60 since she left school.

41
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,924
I thought it was time that she should see
how the younger half lived.

42
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,495
I've asked you many times, Hannibal,
to please stay out of my affairs.

43
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,871
This is an unnatural existence for a girl,
Horace.

44
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,001
-Mary's perfectly happy.
-Oh, don't be an idiot.

45
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,540
She's just trying to be loyal
to your bigoted notions.

46
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,315
-It's dreadful.
-Do you realize what you've done?

47
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,514
A scandal like this
can cost me the nomination.

48
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,486
-Mary in a gambling raid.
-We didn't gamble.

49
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,555
We just danced.

50
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,350
And did she have a time!

51
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,622
Say, they had a jam session last night
that would have done your heart good.

52
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,429
Oh, when I think of the years I've wasted
teaching political economy.

53
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,259
Hannibal, sometimes I think
you are in your second childhood.

54
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,761
Well, come on in, the water is fine.

55
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,873
Here, let me see that.

56
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,208
I hope they didn't leave my name
off the list of jitterbugs.

57
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,336
Jitterbugs?
What in heaven's name is that?

58
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,177
Deputies of the finer arts.
Doggone it, they left me out.

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,318
Friends of the flat foot floogie
with a floy, floy.

60
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,520
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,854
Oh, my poor benighted brother
doesn't know what a jitterbug is.

62
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,642
-Jitterbug.
-That's it, sir.

63
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,542
I'll send for a psychiatrist.

64
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,704
Goodbye, Horace.

65
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,112
-What's the matter with him?
-Is he crazy?

66
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,351
Never mind about him.
A dreadful thing has happened.

67
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,419
Close the doors.

68
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,090
You're a fool, Mary.

69
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,359
Letting yourself be hustled
out of town this way.

70
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,528
What am I to do, Uncle Hannibal?
Break his heart?

71
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,199
Newspapers get too inquisitive,

72
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,366
he's going to tell them
I've been in Palm Beach for weeks.

73
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,412
Your poor father is in over his head.
Oh, stop him, before it's too late.

74
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,571
He wants that nomination so desperately.

75
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,915
-Sometimes it frightens me.
-Yeah. I know.

76
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,056
You had a good time last night,
didn't you?

77
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,352
Marvelous. The raid was thrilling.

78
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,958
Palm Beach out of season
is going to be awfully dull.

79
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,891
That's right, rub it in.

80
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,801
If you can find a young plumber or
somebody lying around loose down there,

81
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,600
you take my advice and grab him.

82
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,069
You think you'd know how to talk
to a young plumber?

83
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,100
Shut up!

84
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,380
Hannibal.

85
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,950
Mary, we have
Mr. Dillon's airplane all ready.

86
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,476
Excuse me.

87
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,948
Two maids are in Palm Beach opening
the house. They'll take care of you.

88
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,327
I can't understand
what got into you, Mary.

89
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,723
Good heavens, Father,
what did I do that was so dreadful?

90
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,865
I tried to make it clear

91
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,900
that without Henderson's support,
my nomination is impossible.

92
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,098
And you know how he'd react
to a scandal of any kind.

93
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,740
And what am I supposed to do?
Live like a prisoner

94
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,604
because Henderson
is a narrow-minded fool?

95
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,977
-Mary.
-I'm sorry, Father, but it isn't fair to me.

96
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,907
I don't see anyone,
and I don't go anywhere.

97
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,778
This is the first time
I've been out in two years.

98
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,516
And then I had to go with Uncle Hannibal.

99
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,546
I can't allow you to destroy something
that I've worked on for years.

100
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,381
Or perhaps you'd rather I give up
the whole idea.

101
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,653
-Sometimes I wish you would.
-Why, Mary!

102
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,091
Maybe we can go back to living like
normal human beings again

103
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,563
where we don't have to be
under a microscope all the time.

104
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,264
Oh, Father, we used to have so much fun
before you went into politics.

105
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,368
Remember those wonderful summers
on the farm?

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,703
Don't be absurd, Mary.
This is a great tribute.

107
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,770
There'd be nothing left for me
if this fell through.

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,878
Mr. Smith, the reporters are downstairs.

109
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,713
Get the bags. Come, Mary.

110
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,844
You better go down the back way.
I've got a car waiting.

111
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,218
-Bye, Uncle Hannibal.
-Goodbye.

112
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,782
Don't forget about the plumber.

113
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,876
-Elly.
-Yes, miss?

114
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,508
Do you play any card games at all?

115
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,586
Let's see. Casino, miss.

116
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,019
Casino? I'd love to play casino.

117
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,589
-Do you mind playing with me?
-I'd love to but...

118
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,690
-You have a date?
-Oh, it's nothing, miss. I can break it.

119
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,896
It's only with one of the fellows
at the rodeo.

120
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,189
-A cowboy?
-Yes, miss.

121
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,762
I wouldn't think of letting you break it.
Have a good time.

122
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,560
Oh, thank you, miss.

123
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,276
-Elly.
-Yes, miss?

124
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:15,948
Has he got a friend?

125
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,747
Why, yes, miss. Katie's got him.

126
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,410
I mean, I promised Katie.
You see, it's a blind date, miss.

127
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,615
Blind date? Sounds marvelous.

128
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,093
Katie, I was just trying to induce Elly
to take me on your blind date.

129
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,162
-You, miss?
-Yes.

130
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,163
Oh...

131
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,225
I don't think that you'd want to do that,
Miss Mary.

132
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,836
Oh, no. You don't want to do that.

133
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,428
-Why not?
-These are cowboys.

134
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,007
-Yeah, and they're awful particular.
-Snobs, eh?

135
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,441
No, no. That ain't it.

136
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,680
They'd be kind of scared
of somebody like you.

137
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,582
-When a man's scared...
-Scared?

138
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,018
Well, you see...

139
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,743
You gotta give a fellow
a little co-operation once in a while.

140
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,324
What she's trying to say is that

141
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,291
they're liable to think you're a cold fish.

142
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,695
That's all right, Katie.
Perhaps they'd be right.

143
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,672
But what do you think?

144
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,240
Huh?

145
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,670
Do you think I'm a cold fish?

146
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,076
Why, I...

147
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,536
-Well...
-Go on, Katie, I don't mind.

148
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,711
Well, you don't exactly sizzle, miss.

149
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,279
What do you think I better do about it?

150
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,418
Gosh, I don't know, Miss Mary.

151
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,923
But it's not your fault.
You've got it in you all right.

152
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,054
But you've been held down so much that...

153
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,128
Yeah.

154
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,154
Me and Katie talk about it a lot.

155
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,399
That's right.

156
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,896
We've always felt kind of sorry for you,
Miss Mary.

157
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,393
Thank you.

158
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,642
Gosh.

159
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,743
If you really want to go, miss,
we'll fix it up for you.

160
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,644
Sure, we'll give you a couple of pointers
and you might get by.

161
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,878
-Yeah, we'll show you our system.
-You got a system?

162
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,784
-Sure.
-Well, it's a sort of a system.

163
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,413
Depends on what you run up against.

164
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,554
For instance, he's the cold type,
keeps giving you the icy stare.

165
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,323
Well, if you've made up your mind

166
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,158
that you're going to make him
kiss you or bust,

167
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,356
start out by flattering him.

168
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,929
That's maneuver number one.

169
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,158
I see, maneuver number one, flattery.

170
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,700
-I'll remember that.
-That's it.

171
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,805
Now, if that doesn't work,
you make him talk about himself.

172
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,907
That's number two.

173
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,737
But a man can't talk about himself
and kiss you at the same time.

174
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,842
No, but eventually
he's going to talk himself out, isn't he?

175
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,441
-I suppose so.
-Tell her about number three.

176
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,049
Number three is sure-fire.

177
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,982
Of course, you want to use that
in case of emergency.

178
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,850
-Tell him a hard luck story.
-Work on his sympathy, eh?

179
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,649
That's just like money in the bank, miss.

180
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,852
Just tell him what a hard time you've had
of it and how you've had to suffer.

181
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,155
Then if you sneak in a little tear or two,
he's yours.

182
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,125
-You think you can do it?
-I'll try.

183
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,825
We've got to hurry.
It's in West Palm Beach.

184
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,834
-What are you gonna wear?
-A little plaid...

185
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,522
-Elly, which one is mine?
-I don't know.

186
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,894
Hiya, Stretch.

187
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,229
-Glad to roll on you, boy.
-Glad myself, son.

188
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,196
Got to take it in you.
How are you sitting, Sugar?

189
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,824
-I'm raring to go.
-All right, Buzz, unchain him.

190
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,664
Okay, Stretch, he's all yours.

191
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,583
Hey.

192
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,364
Get yourself a load of this.
Now this really gets them.

193
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,461
Uh-uh.

194
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,441
-Now, you can't get nowhere without it.
-I don't wanna go nowheres.

195
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,044
Oh, come on, Stretch,
it'll smell you up pretty.

196
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,910
I always thought
I smelled pretty naturally.

197
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,007
You go ahead, I'm going to stay here.

198
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,483
You're staying here?
Why, we thought you was going with us.

199
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,452
Sure, we've got a gal all set for you.

200
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,618
I've got to write this letter about Bess.

201
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,192
Why? What's the matter with Bess?

202
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,254
Well, she's due to drop a foal in a month.

203
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,790
Oh, that's a month away.

204
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,362
-We're talking about tonight.
-Yeah.

205
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,364
Three gals and two guys ain't right.

206
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,229
Come on and take up the slack,
would you, Stretch?

207
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,026
What do you got against gals, anyhow?

208
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,501
Oh, they chew your ears off.

209
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,006
Well, maybe you'll get a break
and get a dumb one.

210
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,641
-Yeah.
-That kind ain't been born yet.

211
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,307
What are we going to do
with that extra filly?

212
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,076
Well, I guess
that messes up the whole works.

213
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,917
Hope you two buzzards
ain't gonna break into tears.

214
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,862
He's going to be kind of lonesome
sitting here with nothing to do.

215
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,003
I guess I ain't going to get
this letter written anyway.

216
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,017
Come on.

217
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,845
-This place is terrific.
-No need for suspense, miss.

218
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,816
One cowhand is just like another.

219
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,247
Hey, there's Buzz. Come on.

220
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,390
-Hello, Buzz. How are you?
-Hello, Elly.

221
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,003
Say, Elly, I want you to meet my friends.

222
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,575
-Stretch and Sugar.
-How do you do?

223
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,641
-I want you to meet Mary and Katie.
-Hiya, fellows. Hi.

224
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,047
Katie, I want you and my pal Stretch here
to become good friends.

225
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,243
That shouldn't be very hard.

226
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,877
And you with her.

227
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,085
Hiya, honey. Go on and get some chow.

228
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,353
That'll put hair on your chest.

229
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,804
Hey, shove over, will you, Lenny?

230
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,401
Sit down, honey. Sit right down here.

231
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,239
-Great chili.
-That's yours, Stretch. Sit right down.

232
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,450
Get your girls out of my chili.
I'm gonna hang up the runner.

233
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,539
Okay.

234
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,142
Hey, I hope you're a little shorter
sitting down.

235
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,487
Katie, he's nice.

236
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,689
You mean my guy?
If you want him, he's yours.

237
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,828
Like I always say,
one cowhand is just like another.

238
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,161
-What's going on here?
-Nothing.

239
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,393
-Sit down.
-Hello, Sugar.

240
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,638
Come on, sit down. Oh, come on, honey.
Say, you need building up.

241
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,571
Why, there ain't a pick on you.

242
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,304
I'll bet you don't weigh over 147 pounds.

243
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,679
Why, doggone me, if you ain't
guessed my weight within a pound.

244
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,513
Oh, I can guess
the weight of any man

245
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,416
within five pounds just by looking at him.

246
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,714
-So...
-Ain't never failed yet.

247
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,327
You know, I think I'm going to like you.

248
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,828
Yeah?

249
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,304
I've seen lots of good riding,
steeplechasing and jumping.

250
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,036
But you're about the best I've seen yet.

251
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,145
Yeah?

252
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,645
I got awfully excited
when you threw that steer.

253
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,508
Yeah?

254
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,280
I was scared. I screamed.
Didn't you hear me?

255
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,456
No.

256
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh, this will burn the lining
right out of your stomach.

257
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,827
You haven't touched your chili.
Maybe you don't like it.

258
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,558
Oh, I love it but it's pretty hot.

259
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,104
-It's sure hot.
-Oh, I'm so glad we agree at last.

260
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,672
Yeah.

261
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,083
Listen, you couldn't get very familiar
and tell me your name?

262
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,948
Sure, Stretch.

263
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,884
You know...

264
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,457
-Like this.
-I see.

265
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,099
Well, my name's Mary Smith.

266
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,292
-It's a nice name, Mary Smith.
-You like it?

267
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,133
-Sure, I like it fine.
-Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

268
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,635
Now, what's your name?

269
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,706
I just told you, Stretch.

270
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,310
-Oh, Stretch.
-Yeah, what did I say?

271
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,210
Oh, that's a marvelous name, I love it.

272
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,217
-Stretch. Hiya, Stretch.
-Hiya, Mary.

273
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,189
Say, Buzz, would you play a ukulele
for me sometime?

274
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,061
Sure will, sometime tonight.

275
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,425
Maybe we better go around
to the back door.

276
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,830
This is the back door.

277
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,903
What's it doing
on the front of the house?

278
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,264
-Come on, boys.
-Where are you going, Elly?

279
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,912
Well, how do you like it, boys?
This is my outfit.

280
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,176
-Jiminy Christmas.
-Great commissary.

281
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,978
These people must spend
all their time eating.

282
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,713
Oh, no. They don't eat much, do they, Elly?

283
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,948
Not much. They're all the time worrying
about their diets.

284
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,955
Well, they've got a lot of expensive
equipment for starving themselves.

285
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,053
Hang me for a cattle thief.

286
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,624
You're some general
to run a shebang like this.

287
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,061
Oh, nothing to it, Sugar.

288
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,225
Come on, I'll show you around.

289
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,664
-What's this thing for?
-That makes orange juice.

290
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,104
Scares it right out of them, don't it?

291
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,402
What's that part? A ice box?

292
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,709
-Oh, that's a...
-The dishwasher.

293
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,808
Go on, turn it on. It's cute.

294
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,315
What's going on inside?

295
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,582
-Washing dishes.
-Oh, yeah?

296
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,091
-Come on, I'll get you a towel.
-Look at you.

297
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,534
Dishwasher, huh?

298
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,763
That thing's liable
to give me a death of cold.

299
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,073
-I ought to have a drink.
-Well, step into my corral.

300
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,269
Hey!

301
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:21,946
Gosh.

302
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,584
You got to watch yourself around here.
You'll be ambushed by a bunch of gadgets.

303
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,152
Hey, have you seen this one, Sugar?

304
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,047
Where are they?

305
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,225
They're gone.

306
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,120
What do you work at around here?

307
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,267
-I'm a lady's maid.
-Lady's maid?

308
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,203
Where's your outfit?

309
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,600
-Upstairs. Would you like to see it?
-Sure.

310
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,944
-And me just a cowboy.
-You're cute, too.

311
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,376
Hey, that doesn't belong to you.
What will the boss say?

312
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,343
Well, Buzz has got a little cold,
and I thought that...

313
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,851
Elly tells me she's got
a pull with the boss.

314
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,544
-Of course she has.
-Say,

315
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,818
I know a certain cowboy
Elly's got a pull with, too.

316
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,495
-Have some.
-What's that? Champagne?

317
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,666
Mmm-hmm.

318
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,562
I had some once. It ain't bad.

319
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,510
Gee whiz.

320
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,851
Some place, huh?

321
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,793
Look.

322
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,995
-Lovely, isn't it?
-Sure is.

323
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,772
-Have you been in any other rodeos?
-No.

324
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,415
Where's your home?

325
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,250
Is it far away?

326
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,848
-Montana.
-Really?

327
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,356
What's it like? Tell me all about it.

328
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,458
Come on in.

329
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,985
-Gee whiz, I'm sorry.
-Oh, that's all right.

330
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,830
Have you got another dress?

331
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,296
I know what I'll do.
I'll borrow one from my mistress.

332
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,602
Well, you better not do that.
You'll get in a jam.

333
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,470
It's all right, she's out of town.

334
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,168
What do you do for this lady you work for?

335
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,512
Help her dress.

336
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,047
-What is she, a cripple?
-No.

337
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,543
Gee whiz, what kind of a...

338
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,357
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

339
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,028
-How old is your boss?
-About my age.

340
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,504
-Married?
-No.

341
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,510
-What's she waiting around for?
-She hasn't found the right man yet.

342
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,099
-Like it?
-Sure do.

343
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,667
-How much?
-Considerable.

344
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,310
Sit down. You're going to tell me
all about yourself.

345
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,485
Well, I can't make out
just what kind of girl you are.

346
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,224
-I'm just a working girl.
-Well, you are and you aren't.

347
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,489
I guess being around rich people
has got you mixed up.

348
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,694
Don't you ever get mixed up, Stretch?

349
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,098
Not about things that matter.

350
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,271
Do you always know what you want?

351
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,673
-Sure do.
-What?

352
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,979
I want a spread of my own,

353
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,514
a ranch that will run
about 1,000 head of cattle

354
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,217
in a pretty valley with a trout stream
running through the middle.

355
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,785
-And a nice house.
-And nobody else?

356
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,587
-Sometime, maybe a wife.
-And children?

357
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:31,963
You bet.

358
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,661
I better go down to the station and
see that Dusty gets on the train all right.

359
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,333
All right, Stretch, Dusty wins.

360
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,023
-Well, I guess you are not going.
-I guess not.

361
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,823
-Would you like to go out on the terrace?
-Yeah.

362
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,663
-I'll be with you in a moment.
-All right.

363
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,766
-How you doing?
-Very badly.

364
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,570
-Your system's no good.
-Have you tried number three yet?

365
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,171
-What is it? I've forgotten it.
-Hard luck story.

366
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,340
That's right, hard luck story.

367
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,261
I envy you, Stretch.

368
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,874
Nothing on your mind but your job.

369
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,571
No troubles, no responsibilities.

370
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,076
I wish my life was as simple as all that.

371
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,915
Isn't it?

372
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,049
You don't look to me like a girl
who's had a tough time of it.

373
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,153
You don't think so, huh?

374
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,082
That's funny.

375
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,890
That's really very funny.

376
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,992
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant that...

377
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,689
That's all right, Stretch.

378
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,268
Maybe if you'd tell me
something about yourself...

379
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,395
No, I wouldn't want to burden you
with my troubles.

380
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,636
Might be good to get it off your chest.
Maybe I can help.

381
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,306
You're very kind.

382
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,052
Is it your family?

383
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,044
Mmm-hmm.

384
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,249
-Father mostly.
-Your father?

385
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,858
His drinking.

386
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,097
His drinking.

387
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,727
Night after night,
sometimes for weeks without stopping.

388
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,136
Can't something be done about him?

389
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,109
It's no use, we've tried.

390
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,408
No ambition. No will power.

391
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,875
-Hasn't worked in 12 years.
-12 years?

392
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,047
Who supports him?

393
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,592
Any more in the family?

394
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,392
-Any more?
-Any more children?

395
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,329
-Oh, yes. Five.
-Five?

396
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,161
Well, that is five including me.

397
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,932
Don't any of them work? Why not?

398
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,675
-All girls.
-And you're the oldest?

399
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,446
Gosh.

400
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,346
Four kid sisters.

401
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,307
-And you support them all?
-Oh, not that I mind.

402
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,414
They're such darlings, all of them.

403
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,951
But sometimes it's a bit hard.

404
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,730
I can imagine.

405
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,422
Last year for instance,

406
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,796
when both Dotty and Henrietta
were down with the measles.

407
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,868
At the same time?

408
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,797
It wouldn't have been so bad
if I hadn't been out of work.

409
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,337
But what with
the doctor's bills piling up...

410
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,477
Sometimes, I just don't know
how I can go on.

411
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,552
Poor kid.

412
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,822
You're so understanding.

413
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,837
Gee willikers, that's a pretty dress.

414
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,139
We got to load the horses
first thing in the morning.

415
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,513
-There's plenty of time before 6:00...
-No, we got to go now. Here's your hat.

416
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,716
Hey, no more of that.

417
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,152
-Oh, just one more of that.
-Oh, yeah.

418
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,484
-Well, Sugar.
-So long, honey.

419
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,593
Goodbye, honey.

420
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,862
Shucks.

421
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,558
So long, sister. Come on, Stretch.

422
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,173
Yippee.

423
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,355
Cowboy,

424
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,086
give them men a hand with the hay.

425
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,903
Hey, Stretch,

426
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,440
get yourself packed.
We got this stuff all over.

427
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,951
Say, Buzz, does this stuff really get them?

428
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,780
It snares them, but it won't trap them.

429
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,823
-I mean for keeps.
-I wouldn't be knowing about that.

430
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,889
-Say, what are you talking about?
-Oh, nothing.

431
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,731
Hey, if it's for keeps,
you got to get down on your knees

432
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,204
and spout poetry.

433
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,133
-You tried it?
-I tried it once,

434
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,837
but I got a crick in my knee
so I give it up.

435
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,937
Throw my stuff in the bag
and bring it to the boat.

436
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,538
We'll meet you there.

437
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,685
-We?
-Me and the missus.

438
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,726
-Oh, gee.
-What's the matter?

439
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,601
-Oh, he's coming up the beach.
-Who?

440
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,231
Yours, daddy longlegs.

441
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,343
Oh.

442
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,242
You better go along. I'll see him alone.

443
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,543
That old buzzard, he told me
they were going to Galveston.

444
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,754
Hello.

445
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,623
Hello.

446
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,020
I was just going around to the kitchen
to look for you.

447
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,686
-Were you?
-Yeah.

448
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,092
Oh, the boss is back, huh?

449
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,559
Oh, yes. Early this morning.

450
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,027
It's sure pretty here.

451
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,970
-Suppose she'd mind if we sat down?
-No.

452
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,239
I thought you were leaving
for Galveston this morning.

453
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,573
No, we're shoving off this afternoon.

454
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,804
-Gee, I kind of hate to leave here.
-Do you?

455
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,616
You see, last night, I got to thinking...

456
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,482
Look, Mary...

457
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,319
Gee whiz.

458
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,486
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, that's all right.

459
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,633
Is that you smelling so pretty?

460
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,002
Oh, first time I ever wore
any of this stuff.

461
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,504
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

462
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,132
When I was coming down here,
I kept looking around behind me

463
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:02,008
to see who was smelling up the place.
It was me all the time.

464
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,250
Like Ma Hawkins was telling me,

465
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,945
she's the one that feeds us
out at the ranch,

466
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,545
she was telling me about the time
Jim came to ask for her hand.

467
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,115
He got all spruced up
and smelling like a barber shop,

468
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:20,459
and when he got to her front gate,
why, all the dogs in town was tailing him.

469
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,756
There aren't any dogs following me,
I hope.

470
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:23,834
No.

471
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,004
I guess I didn't put enough on.

472
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,437
Look, Mary, we're leaving today,

473
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,939
and I was thinking that...

474
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,580
You ever been out in
my part of the country?

475
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,118
-No.
-It's beautiful.

476
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,353
A girl like you would be crazy about it,
and I was figuring that

477
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,620
if it's okay with you, well,

478
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,330
Ma Hawkins could put you up
until I got my house finished and...

479
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,594
I started to build it just before I left,

480
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,598
just in case.

481
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,342
And I thought that after a while,
if we wanted to,

482
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,503
we could change things around.

483
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,743
That... That sounds wonderful, Stretch.

484
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,056
Next summer, when I get my vacation,
that's exactly where I'll go,

485
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,523
out to your place.

486
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,325
-Next summer?
-Yes.

487
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,729
We could have some more evenings
like last night.

488
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,733
I had a wonderful time. Didn't you?

489
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,099
I was just telling the girls this morning,
I was saying,

490
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,106
the next blind date we go on, we'd be
lucky if we meet such nice fellows.

491
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,676
-The next blind date?
-Yes.

492
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,144
You don't know what trouble a girl has.

493
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,614
Sometimes you meet
the most awful people.

494
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,315
Well, I guess I was all wrong.

495
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,746
All wrong?

496
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,420
It sounded like you were
on the level last night,

497
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,823
like it really meant something to you.

498
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,359
Off course it did.
I never had so much fun in all my life.

499
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,832
Oh, that's all it was, huh?

500
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,304
Well, I...

501
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,771
I always knew that cowpunchers were
just supposed to be half-human, but...

502
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,602
Well, I guess I had it coming to me.
You see,

503
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,006
I don't go out with girls much,

504
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,743
generally because
I don't like the way they think.

505
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:24,686
I joined the show because I thought maybe
somewhere I'd run into one of them that

506
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,225
didn't measure everything
by how many men she kissed in a week.

507
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,986
I guess that sounds funny to you.

508
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,163
Please, Stretch...

509
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,959
If you don't mind, I think I'll get going.

510
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,658
I kind of feel like I need a bath.

511
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,141
On second thought,
I think you're the one who needs a bath.

512
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,088
-How are you, Miss Mary?
-Are you all right?

513
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,994
-Boy, he's got a lot of nerve.
-I'd like to take a sock at him.

514
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,626
I always knew fooling around
with cowhands was a mistake. Why...

515
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,606
-Well, he's got her hooked.
-What do you know about that lunkhead?

516
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,942
He used maneuver number four.

517
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,823
He'd better get here pretty soon.
We're pulling out in five minutes.

518
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,131
Here he comes. Hey, Stretch!

519
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,929
Well, it's about time.

520
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,170
What happened?

521
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,636
Stretch.

522
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,278
-I came to see you off.
-No call for you to do that.

523
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,049
-But listen, Stretch, I want to explain.
-No need to explain anything.

524
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,681
Well, glad to have met you.

525
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,891
Stand by your spring line.

526
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,922
Hello, Stretch.

527
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,995
Please, Stretch,
if you'd just let me talk to you.

528
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,462
Would you mind letting me into my room?

529
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,060
There's something I've got to get
straightened out.

530
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:58,232
Please let me talk to you for a few minutes
and I won't bother you anymore.

531
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,168
You stubborn mule.

532
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,075
Well, you're going to listen to me
if I have to dog your footsteps

533
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,879
for the rest of your life.

534
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,960
Busy place.

535
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,496
-What's going on?
-I'm dogging his footsteps.

536
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,329
That's better.

537
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,098
You shouldn't have come on this trip.

538
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,635
-How long is it?
-Oh, about 68 hours.

539
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:02,602
I suppose it'll take me all that time
to get myself straightened out with you.

540
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,504
Say, what about your job?
You might lose it.

541
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,006
Oh, no, that'll be all right.

542
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,315
Listen, Stretch,
that's what I want to talk to you about,

543
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,879
about my being a lady's maid.

544
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,244
Poor lady.

545
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,821
She'll have to dress herself
for a couple of days.

546
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,287
I bet she'll be all tuckered out.

547
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,491
You shouldn't talk like that.
She's not so bad.

548
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,821
You might like her.

549
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,999
Uh-uh.

550
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,261
When I worked on that dude ranch,
I met plenty of her kind.

551
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,565
Show horses.

552
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,399
What are they good for,
except to dress up and look pretty?

553
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:42,069
Give me a workhorse, every time.
Like Bess, that little mare of mine.

554
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,144
You're a lot like Bess.

555
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,814
What I mean is,

556
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,382
the way you have to take care of
your father and all those kids.

557
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,056
That's the load you've got to carry,
and you do it without squawking.

558
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,759
A woman like your boss,

559
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,887
well, she ain't rigged right
to carry her part of the load.

560
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,796
That's the first time I've ever heard
horses compared to people.

561
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,028
Well, good horses are nice people.

562
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,108
You betcha, good horses are swell people.

563
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,212
Wanna know where Miss Mary is?
On the way to Galveston.

564
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,410
-To Galveston?
-This wire just came from the boat.

565
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,918
Says she doesn't want anybody
to know where she is

566
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,079
and that she's coming home soon.

567
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,349
Oh, gosh. This is awful.

568
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,550
We should have never taken her out
on that there blind date.

569
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,626
Never.

570
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,394
Hello? Yes.

571
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,766
It's Washington calling.
Must be her father.

572
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,860
-Her father?
-Yes, Operator, that's right. Mary Smith.

573
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,270
When you get her,
ask her how the plumber situation is.

574
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,409
Plumber situation, yes, sir.

575
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,445
There will be a dinner
for the members of the committee

576
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,841
and their wives on Tuesday.

577
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,108
-Then on Saturday, the one for Henderson.
-Are you certain Henderson will come?

578
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,947
I've already spoken to him.
He said he'd be pleased to come.

579
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,055
Just a minute, please. She isn't in, sir.

580
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,523
I'll take it.

581
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,755
Hello, this is Judge Smith.

582
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,528
Never mind.

583
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,220
Just tell her
when she comes in this evening

584
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,525
that we are all leaving tomorrow

585
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,623
or the day following
and are coming down to Palm Beach.

586
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,035
Coming here, sir?

587
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,736
-They're all coming down here.
-Oh, my gosh.

588
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,868
Oh, yes, sir. I'm listening.

589
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,167
Just tell her that Henderson
is coming down, too.

590
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
She'll be so happy to know
we're all coming.

591
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,703
Oh, yes, sir.

592
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,809
I know she'll be very happy.

593
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,216
Yes, sir.

594
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,307
Oh, yes, I'll tell her everything.

595
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,786
Goodbye.

596
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,619
Well, I don't know
what you're going to do,

597
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,385
but I'm going to start looking
for a new job.

598
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,593
Me, too.

599
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,137
-Hello, hello.
-Hello.

600
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,208
Hello.

601
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,503
Say, too bad we couldn't give you a moon.

602
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,240
-Oh, the fog's all right.
-Maybe it's better.

603
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,185
-Well, Stretch.
-Well.

604
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,386
-I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
-Good night.

605
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,056
I hate this good night. It's our last one.

606
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,100
Well, we can take another turn
around the deck.

607
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,993
But we can't do this forever.

608
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,367
-Couldn't sleep.
-Couldn't sleep.

609
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,841
We seem to be giving
each other insomnia.

610
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,446
-What time is it?
-About 3:30.

611
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,288
That's a fishing boat.
We're getting close to Galveston.

612
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,456
I wish Galveston would stay away.

613
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,495
We're going awfully slow
on account of the fog.

614
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,398
I love the fog.

615
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,029
It shuts out the rest of the world.

616
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,731
You're shivering. I'll get you a drink.

617
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,741
I'll get you my coat.

618
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,720
This will warm you up.

619
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,711
Feel better?

620
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,275
Tastes terrible but feels wonderful.

621
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,386
You know, Stretch,
you and I are poles apart.

622
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,881
If you really knew me,
you wouldn't like me at all.

623
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,316
And yet, I'd rather be with you
than with anyone else. Isn't that funny?

624
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:06,963
Say that again.

625
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,226
I'd have to have another drink
before I could say all that again.

626
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:15,727
Oh, no.

627
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,607
Water.

628
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,416
And now I can't remember what I said.

629
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,456
But I know this. I love you, Stretch.

630
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,059
I love you very much.

631
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,087
-You sure?
-Yes.

632
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,065
You're not mixed up about that?

633
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,163
No, that's the one thing
I'm not mixed up about.

634
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,575
-We're going to find the Captain.
-What for?

635
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,066
Because where I come from,

636
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,442
when a man feels about a girl
the way I feel about you,

637
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,447
they get married.

638
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,047
Come on.

639
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,351
Stretch Willoughby,

640
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,317
do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife?

641
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,456
I do.

642
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:41,624
Mary Smith.

643
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,958
Do you take this man
to be your wedded husband?

644
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,498
I do.

645
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,761
Then I now pronounce you man and wife.

646
00:47:56,106 --> 00:48:02,409
This day, passengers Stretch Willoughby
and Mary Smith were married.

647
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,718
That's all.

648
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,753
Yeah, okay.

649
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,055
Fog signal is off the port bow, Captain.

650
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,428
Very well.

651
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,863
I, Stretch, take thee, Mary,
to be my wedded wife,

652
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,792
to have and to hold from this day forward,

653
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,827
for better, for worse,

654
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,265
for richer, for poorer,

655
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,604
in sickness and in health.

656
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,768
To love and cherish till death do us part.

657
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,740
The Captain forgot to say that.

658
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,549
We dock in about 30 minutes.

659
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,372
-Well, I got all my stuff.
-Hey.

660
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,413
You don't suppose she married him
for his money, do you?

661
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,481
What money?

662
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,374
Well, he's got a job, ain't he?

663
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,448
Yeah, I never thought of that.

664
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:50,918
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

665
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,581
I ain't had a chance to congratulate you,
Mrs. Willoughby.

666
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,850
-Thank you.
-Me, too.

667
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,289
-Thank you.
-See you later, Stretch.

668
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,587
So long.

669
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,542
Isn't very much, is it?

670
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:25,910
I love it, Stretch.

671
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,012
We won't be here long.

672
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,058
We'll be leaving for the ranch
as soon as I can quit the show.

673
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,360
Stretch.

674
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,628
-Chief wants to see you.
-Okay.

675
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,655
Don't mind being alone, do you?

676
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,359
Oh, no. I'm going to be very busy
cleaning up here.

677
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,281
Yeah,
they're gonna be hard to handle.

678
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:01,984
Out.

679
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,911
Step on it, lady.

680
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,047
Thank you very much.

681
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,594
Careful, going in front of this horn,
you may lose him.

682
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,632
Get your weight on the end of his horn
and down he comes.

683
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,733
See what I mean?

684
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,133
Wish you weren't leaving the show,
Stretch.

685
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,235
Couple more weeks with you
and I could beat the whole bunch.

686
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,707
Sorry, Skeeter.

687
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,839
When I joined this outfit,
I was hunting for something.

688
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,917
And the hunt's over.

689
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,784
I'll be back to the ranch in a week.

690
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,614
Let it go, huh?

691
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,461
Want soap?

692
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,466
You got to be quick, lady.
You got to be quick.

693
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,092
Well, I guess I need a complete new outfit.

694
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,294
If you need them, we got them, sister.

695
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,865
Here's a pair I bet will fit you.

696
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,960
A mule team couldn't tear them.

697
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:02,905
Hey, Mary.

698
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,599
You're the one I'm looking for.
You're wanted on the phone.

699
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,209
-Phone?
-Yeah, it's Katie. She says it's important.

700
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,342
You should have heard her
when I told her you were married.

701
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,571
You told her?

702
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,581
Yeah, I thought she was going to choke
right on the phone.

703
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,309
Where is it?

704
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,181
Right there.
The phone booth is next to the door.

705
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,617
Hey, sister,
how about putting back my britches?

706
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,623
Hello? Yes, yes, operator.

707
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,354
-Hello, Katie.
-Oh, Miss Mary.

708
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,823
Oh, I phoned you every place in Galveston.

709
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,534
Something terrible has happened.

710
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,368
Your father is coming down here.

711
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,336
Father's coming to Palm Beach? When?

712
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,835
I don't know, Katie. Wait a minute.
I can't think straight.

713
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,439
Better not tell him anything.

714
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,105
Oh, no, I can't come back now, Katie.

715
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,716
Mr. Henderson is coming down, too.

716
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,717
And if it comes out
that you and Stretch are married,

717
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,317
well, you know what that means.

718
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,849
You don't want to break
your father's heart, Miss Mary.

719
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:55,913
Perhaps you're right.

720
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,086
Perhaps I ought to go back as soon as
I can straighten things out with Stretch.

721
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,789
No, he doesn't, Katie.

722
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,122
He still thinks I'm a lady's maid.

723
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:06,759
Don't be silly, Katie.

724
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,929
I've got to tell him sometime
and it might as well be now.

725
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,339
Lady's maid? What in tarnation is that?

726
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,667
She helps a show horse get dressed.

727
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,842
Snakes alive, I've been pulling up
my own britches 60-some odd years.

728
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,147
I ain't had nobody help me yet.

729
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,053
You always said you can pick
a good one from a bad one, Stretch.

730
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,422
Guess you were right.

731
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,523
You know, she supports her father
and four kid sisters.

732
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,458
That's the kind she is,
and she never complains, either.

733
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,825
She's got an honest face.
That's what I like.

734
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,990
Yeah, it'd be a shame if you
bounced upon one that wasn't honest.

735
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,398
If he did, he'd bounce on back again.

736
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,503
Wouldn't you, Stretch?

737
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,501
Yep, I guess I would.

738
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,675
What's the matter, Mary?

739
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,344
Nothing, it was cool here and I...

740
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,175
Sugar just told me about Katie calling.

741
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:29,980
Is there anything wrong at home?

742
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,621
No.

743
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,391
You must be worried
about your father and your sisters.

744
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,887
I feel kind of rotten about that.
I should've thought of it last night.

745
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,331
But I guess we didn't think much
about anything last night.

746
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,200
No, we didn't, did we?

747
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,734
Look,

748
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,870
if we could get them out to the ranch,
we could take care of them some way.

749
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,115
Oh, no, Stretch,
don't you worry about that.

750
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,082
I was thinking that maybe...

751
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,089
Maybe you'd better go back

752
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,487
and see that they get settled.

753
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,328
-Go back?
-Yeah.

754
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:16,799
Yeah, I was figuring if...

755
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,267
If you went back and got them fixed up,
you could be out to the ranch by Tuesday.

756
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,134
See, I'm quitting this outfit
at the end of the week,

757
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,729
and I'll be home by Tuesday.

758
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,532
Don't you think that's a good idea?

759
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,072
Stretch.

760
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,385
Here you are. Now, don't lose this.

761
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,711
I've got it all written down here
on how to get there.

762
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,880
You'll be crazy about Ma Hawkins.

763
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,652
And I'll get her to fix up a room for you
till the house is finished.

764
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,889
Gee, I've been talking a lot
about that house,

765
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,622
and so far it's nothing but a framework.
But...

766
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,025
All for Houston, all aboard.

767
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,200
Gee, here they go.

768
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,161
Bus for Houston, all aboard.

769
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,103
It's going to be a million years
till Tuesday.

770
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,376
-Goodbye, Mary.
-Goodbye, Stretch.

771
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,375
Pardon me, lady,
but we've got a schedule to meet.

772
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,589
It's gonna be a long trip, folks.

773
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,988
Peanuts, popcorn. I've got candy...

774
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,458
-Take good care of her, will you, buddy?
-Okay, cowboy.

775
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,257
-Give her one of those pillows, too.
-Okay.

776
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,763
-Candies.
-Hey.

777
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,499
-Give her this, too, will you?
-Anything else you can think of?

778
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,100
Yeah, sure.
Here's some gum to quiet your nerves.

779
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,673
Okay.

780
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,746
I'll see you Tuesday.

781
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,264
-Why, Miss Mary.
-Hello, Elly.

782
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,103
Oh, it's good to see you back, Miss Mary.

783
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,143
Katie and me's
been worrying ourselves cross-eyed.

784
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,177
Good heavens, Miss Mary.
What happened to your dress?

785
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,614
-Oh, I stepped on it.
-Stepped on it?

786
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,714
-Nobody knows I've been gone, do they?
-Oh, no, we didn't tell a soul.

787
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,718
Not even your father.

788
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,923
-He's here, you know.
-Here?

789
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,921
Well, not exactly here.
I mean he ought to be here,

790
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,256
according to the telegram,

791
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,626
he and all the committees
and all their wives.

792
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,665
No one must know I'm married, Elly.

793
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,562
-Oh, no.
-Better tell Katie.

794
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:33,636
-Yes, miss.
-Thank you.

795
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,264
Your Uncle Hannibal is here. He's upstairs.

796
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,731
Oh, Uncle Hannibal. So glad you came.

797
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,938
Well, you're father wasn't particularly
cordial, but I came anyway.

798
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,335
With the servants.

799
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,172
Did you know that your second butler
cheats at backgammon?

800
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,111
-I'll start your bath, Miss Mary.
-Thank you, Elly.

801
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,187
How've been? Let me look at you.

802
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,031
Something new they're wearing this year?

803
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,792
It was fixed up for me in Galveston.

804
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,528
-And two days on a bus didn't help.
-Two days on a bus?

805
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,334
Well, I didn't have any money,
and I couldn't wire anybody.

806
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,531
So I had to come back on a bus.

807
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,232
Well, that's a good reason to come by bus.

808
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,311
But what in heaven's name were you
doing in Galveston in the first place?

809
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,542
Oh, I can't tell you now, Uncle Hannibal.
I better have a bath first.

810
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,309
But don't go away,
because I must talk to you.

811
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,678
Well, from the condition of your clothes,

812
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,411
you look as if
you've had quite an experience.

813
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,146
I have. I got married.

814
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,779
Got married? Hey!

815
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,385
You can't throw a bombshell
like that at me and just step into a tub.

816
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,958
Hey, now just a minute...

817
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,023
Excuse me.

818
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,599
I've made a list of possibilities.

819
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,642
You tell me when I'm warm.

820
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,240
Is he a plumber?

821
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,713
No, too bad.

822
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,279
Airplane pilot?

823
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,615
-Cowboy.
-Cowboy? Young?

824
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,452
-A young cowboy? Say, that's wonderful.
-Is it?

825
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,061
Well, unfortunately, I'm a show horse.

826
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,493
And he thinks I'm a workhorse.

827
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,658
And workhorses are nice people.

828
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,300
-You didn't know that, did you?
-No. Are they?

829
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,029
And you know why
workhorses are nice people?

830
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,068
Because they carry their part of the load.

831
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,572
Oh, Uncle Hannibal, I'm in such a mess.

832
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,935
Have you ever been so confused that you
couldn't make sense out of anything?

833
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,473
I'm doing fine right this minute.

834
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,875
-I'm sorry.
-No, maybe I can help you.

835
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,584
Now, you met a cowboy.

836
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,011
Young, married him
and went to Galveston.

837
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,514
Now, that much I know.

838
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:37,024
Oh, and I also know that workhorses
are nice people.

839
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,527
Now, what else?

840
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,385
What are you doing here for instance?

841
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:41,563
I wish I knew.

842
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,492
Katie phoned me. And he was boasting
to his friends about me,

843
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,228
and I had to make a decision and...
I don't know.

844
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,165
-I got scared, I suppose.
-Oh, come now, you don't scare so easily.

845
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,174
I ran away, didn't I?

846
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,138
Did you?

847
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:56,771
Well, not exactly.

848
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,413
But when he suggested that I come back

849
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,914
to my drunken father and four sisters,
I jumped at it.

850
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,349
Drunken father and four sisters?

851
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,688
You know, for a minute
I was right along with you,

852
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,883
but I guess I'm lost again.

853
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,854
Oh, yes, that's another thing.
I forgot to tell you. I'm a lady's maid.

854
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,955
The father and sisters are part of
a system, how to capture a man.

855
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,200
It's Elly's or Katie's,
I forget who the genius is.

856
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,337
And he's still under the impression
that you're a lady's maid?

857
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,172
Oh, I know it's stupid.

858
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,470
But what could I do?
I couldn't tell him, I tried.

859
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,870
But he has such definite notions
about everything.

860
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,072
When does he expect you back?

861
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,741
On Tuesday, at his place in Montana.

862
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:39,087
Well, it seems to me that the first thing
to do is to clear that up.

863
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,187
Here comes your father,
America's white hope

864
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,729
with his entire entourage.

865
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,097
-Incidentally, what about him?
-Yes, what about him?

866
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,364
I certainly have done a good job.

867
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,372
All that has to happen now
is for Father to lose the nomination.

868
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,338
Uncle Hannibal, what'll I tell him?

869
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,537
Nothing. Your poor father is accustomed
to being in the dark.

870
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,807
-But think for me, Uncle Hannibal.
-My darling, I can think for you,

871
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,646
but I can't feel for you.

872
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,380
Now, do you love this cowboy fellow?

873
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,316
Real hard?

874
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,625
Well, then don't worry.

875
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,896
Maybe we can convince him
that show horses are nice people, too.

876
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,402
Come in, Father.

877
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,862
It's good to see you, Mary.

878
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,366
Hello, Hannibal. Now, you look wonderful.

879
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,271
A week in Palm Beach
is just what you needed.

880
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,278
Well, my dear,
everything's in excellent shape.

881
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,008
Probably settle the whole thing
before we leave here.

882
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,105
I expect your help.

883
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,478
The committee men
and their wives are all here,

884
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,746
and I want a dinner arranged for them
on Tuesday.

885
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,588
-Tuesday?
-Yeah, nothing elaborate.

886
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,180
Just enough to keep them in good humor.

887
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,825
But the big thing comes later.

888
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:52,287
You know who's coming down?

889
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,519
Henderson. Now, for him,
we ought to have a reception...

890
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,530
I won't be here on Tuesday, Father.

891
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,623
-I beg your pardon?
-I said, I won't be here.

892
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,993
I expect to be back in Montana
with my husband.

893
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,593
I'm married, Father.

894
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,107
This is no time to be facetious, Mary.

895
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,605
I'm not being facetious.

896
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,600
I met him last week at a rodeo.

897
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,676
-He's a cowboy.
-A cowboy?

898
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,573
You mean to tell me
you've married a cowboy?

899
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,117
Yes.

900
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,019
Why, this is fantastic.

901
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,323
I can't believe it.

902
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,991
-A cowboy.
-What's the matter with a cowboy?

903
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,423
There's nothing the matter
with the cowboy as far as I'm concerned.

904
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,265
But what about Henderson?

905
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:35,167
Can't I make you understand that without
his support my nomination is impossible?

906
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:40,303
Mary Smith in a runaway marriage
with a cowhand.

907
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,739
-That's going to look fine in print.
-Stop it, Horace.

908
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,105
Is there any reason why
Henderson should find out?

909
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,382
How do you suppose
I'm going to keep a thing like this secret?

910
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,212
The boy doesn't know who Mary is.

911
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,343
And if we keep our mouths shut,
it needn't be known.

912
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,714
At least, not until you get
Henderson's endorsement.

913
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,318
Once it's been published,
he's got to stick by you

914
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,517
just to save his face.

915
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,085
No, I won't stand for it.

916
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,822
You're going to stay right here,

917
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,298
and I'll arrange to have
the marriage annulled quietly.

918
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,863
I'm sorry, Father.

919
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,539
But if you attempt to do that,
I shall tell it to the newspapers myself.

920
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,702
All right, Mary,
if that's the way you feel about it.

921
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,010
I hope you're proud of yourself.

922
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,315
Now that you've gone this far,

923
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,016
I don't suppose that I should expect
any further help.

924
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,552
But I hope you'll have the decency,
at least, to stay here

925
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,152
until after the Henderson dinner.

926
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,958
If that isn't asking too much.

927
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,027
Of course, I'll stay, Father.
If that's what you want.

928
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,133
Don't worry, I'll stay and do
anything you want me to.

929
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:44,973
Thank you.

930
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,274
You're a fool, Mary.

931
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,437
Keep your eyes on them, fellas.
I'm going over to the house.

932
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:37,190
Here, let me park that coyote for you,
Stretch.

933
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,888
Hey, why all the service all of a sudden?

934
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,733
I don't know, state you're in,
you couldn't tell a saddle from a flapjack.

935
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:50,797
-What train is she coming in on, Stretch?
-10:00. Where's Sugar?

936
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,663
Over there talking to Bess.

937
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,310
Hey, what you telling her?

938
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,310
Oh, a lot of things she ought to know.

939
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,477
Don't pay any attention to him, Bess.

940
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,281
What you going to call the foal, Stretch?

941
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,549
Oh, I don't know. Mary, I guess.

942
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,083
Well, have the buckboard ready
by 7:00, boys.

943
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,658
7:00? The train don't get in till 10:00.

944
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,923
You can't tell. I'm taking no chances.

945
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,909
Ma.

946
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,490
Ma Hawkins!

947
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,030
What's biting you?

948
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:05,178
That will teach you to do tricks
when I'm busy.

949
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:11,375
What do you want?

950
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:15,681
What about those what-you-call-its,
those new curtains for her room?

951
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,021
New curtains?
There ain't gonna be any new curtains.

952
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,592
I'm not going to make my house over
just for her.

953
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,032
Come on, Ma.

954
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,368
Oh, I wish you'd go
and finish that house of yours

955
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,960
and stop pestering me about new curtains.

956
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,665
Hey, Ma, where do you want these
new curtains hung up?

957
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,803
How many times have I told you

958
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,041
not to come busting in here
when I'm baking?

959
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,050
Get out of here.
Now put the curtains outside.

960
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,417
Put them right there on the chair.
Put them on the chair, there.

961
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,087
Let me go, let me go.

962
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,785
-I'm busy.
-One day, I'll bite a chunk out of that neck.

963
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,161
Right there.

964
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,060
Leave me alone, Stretch Willoughby.

965
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,155
Got you branded.

966
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:01,826
One of these days, you're going to make
a mark on there that won't come off.

967
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,577
-What are you baking?
-None of your business.

968
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,283
Something for Mary, huh?

969
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,545
You think I've got nothing to do
but cook for Mary?

970
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,813
Get out of there.
Get out of there, and stop it.

971
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,956
Well, guess I'll go
and take a look at the new house.

972
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,796
What, again?

973
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,262
This is the fourth time today.

974
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,569
The fifth.

975
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,673
Stretch Willoughby,

976
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:44,234
some day I'm going to give you
a good spanking for things like this.

977
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,120
-How you doing?
-Okay, Stretch.

978
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,523
I'm just looking it over, again.

979
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,624
That's better ain't it, Mary?

980
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,478
Nice and warm in here, now,
isn't it, Mary?

981
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,151
Is it too warm? I'll open the window.

982
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,679
Wonderful air, isn't it?
Just like I told you.

983
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,180
Gee, makes you hungry. Let's eat, huh?

984
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,931
Sit down, Mrs. Willoughby.

985
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:44,322
Yes, I've had a very busy day. I've been
bringing in that new bunch of cattle.

986
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,487
Eat lots of celery, Mrs. Willoughby.
It's very good for you.

987
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,455
Well, come in.

988
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,122
Come on in.
We're just sitting down to dinner.

989
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:30,165
Hey, that's the window.
Come around to the front door.

990
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,283
Open the door. Come on in.

991
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,559
You boys know Mrs. Willoughby.

992
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:01,770
Have a drink?

993
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,971
Go ahead, make yourselves at home.

994
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,023
Sit right down on the chair.

995
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,201
Go ahead.

996
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,040
Sit down on the sofa, Buzz.

997
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,537
Now,

998
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,165
Mary's going to sing us a song.
She going to sing Annie Laurie.

999
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,169
You fellows like Annie Laurie?

1000
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,740
Go ahead, Mary.

1001
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,667
What's going on here?

1002
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,681
Have you all gone loco?

1003
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:56,944
The boys were just helping me play house.

1004
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,053
Fine goings-on
when there's work to be done.

1005
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,252
-Here's a telegram for you.
-Telegram?

1006
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,155
Gee whiz, the train must be early, huh?
What time is it?

1007
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,349
She ain't coming, next week maybe.

1008
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:02,345
From what you tell me,
I'm sure she wouldn't disappoint you,

1009
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,575
except she couldn't help herself.

1010
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:26,564
When I was in service of his lordship,
no such a to-do was made over royalty.

1011
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,344
Who is this fellow Henderson, anyhow?

1012
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,212
He has a magic wand.

1013
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:35,945
And if he waves it over Mr. Smith's head,
presto, he gets the nomination.

1014
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,814
When are you leaving for Montana?

1015
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,245
Tomorrow or the next day,
the moment everyone clears out.

1016
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,586
Are you going to come clean
with your cowboy?

1017
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,684
Even if I get tossed out on my ear,
which I probably will.

1018
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:50,196
Well, for consideration,
I'll be there to catch you when you land.

1019
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,496
Immediately after dinner,
we take Henderson aside.

1020
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,060
And I feel sure

1021
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,337
that we can get him to issue a statement
to the press tonight.

1022
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,873
Once that's accomplished,

1023
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:03,069
it won't matter if her marriage
to this cowboy does come out.

1024
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,577
Why not try speaking a little louder,

1025
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,171
make sure Henderson hears?
He's in the next room.

1026
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:09,750
-Sorry.
-Ready, Father.

1027
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,117
-Evening, Mary.
-Evening, Mary.

1028
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:15,886
Mary, I hope you realize
that if Henderson gets an inkling

1029
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,221
of your marriage,
it will be most disastrous.

1030
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,893
Of course,
your cowboy may be perfectly acceptable.

1031
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,260
But you know Henderson.
He has fixed ideas.

1032
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,161
And we've all got to be very careful.

1033
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,258
For heaven's sake,
we've gone all through that.

1034
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,537
Yes, of course.

1035
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,741
I'm sure everything
will go well tonight, Father.

1036
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,504
Please don't worry about it.

1037
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:42,515
-I promise to do everything I can to help.
-I know you will, Mary. Thank you.

1038
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,754
Hello, there.
Isn't anyone coming downstairs?

1039
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,790
-Why, of course, Mr. Henderson.
-We were waiting for you Mr. Henderson.

1040
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,824
Might I have the privilege
of escorting my favorite girl?

1041
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,262
If you mean me, I'm terribly flattered.

1042
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:00,266
Why, of course I mean you.

1043
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:11,112
Horace.

1044
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,042
Something's happened to you
that's really horrible.

1045
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,473
You discover your daughter's marriage,

1046
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,383
and it never even occurs to you
to ask her if she's happy,

1047
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,648
if she's in love.

1048
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,620
Or if, perhaps, in some kind of trouble.

1049
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:27,818
All you care about
is how it affects your own mad ambition.

1050
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,898
I'm really sorry for you.

1051
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,310
If all the young ladies in our custom
were like Mary,

1052
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,011
I'd feel more secure about the future.

1053
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,749
Our youth today seem to feel
that life is not worthwhile

1054
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,518
unless it's been scandalous.

1055
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,173
Hello.

1056
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,611
Hi.

1057
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,735
Where's my wife?

1058
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,106
I guess she's upstairs.
Will you tell her I'm here?

1059
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,015
I just got into town,
and I was kind of worried about her.

1060
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,744
Is she all right?

1061
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,050
Oh, yes.
That is, I don't know.

1062
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,057
You see, she don't work here no more.

1063
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,423
-Well, where does she live?
-I don't know.

1064
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,720
-I don't know, either.
-Well, you're friends of hers, aren't you?

1065
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:40,292
Yeah, but Mary didn't talk much.
She was very funny that way.

1066
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,461
Yeah, very funny.

1067
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,696
-Oh, you better go.
-Yeah, you better go.

1068
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,400
-We'll lose our jobs if you're caught here.
-Goodbye.

1069
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,170
Oh, you better go tell her.

1070
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,277
Say, I was just thinking,
her boss ought to know where she lives.

1071
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:58,943
Her boss? Oh, no.

1072
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,022
-She wouldn't know.
-Tell her I want to see her, will you?

1073
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,522
-Oh, we couldn't do that.
-Oh, no.

1074
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,826
I think I'll ask her myself.

1075
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:09,163
-Oh, no, you can't go in there.
-Oh, goodness, no, please.

1076
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:10,561
-Oh, please.
-Please!

1077
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,298
I beg your pardon,
you must have made a mistake, sir.

1078
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,670
I didn't mean to bust in like this.
I was looking for somebody.

1079
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,800
Anybody you wish to see, sir?

1080
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,644
This is the home of Horace Smith, sir.
I'm sure you've made a mistake.

1081
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,816
Yeah, I guess I did.

1082
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:47,901
Wait a minute, young man.

1083
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:52,530
These men are politicians.

1084
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:55,337
They're always interested
in talking to the man on the street.

1085
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,377
Why certainly.
Come on, young man, sit down.

1086
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,970
You ought to be able to get
a lot of things off your chest.

1087
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,012
Yes, guess maybe I will.

1088
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,888
-Where are you from, young man?
-Montana.

1089
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,559
Montana, a fascinating place.

1090
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,137
I've always been interested
in the Lone Star State.

1091
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,863
-You're thinking of Texas, sir.
-Yes, of course.

1092
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,167
I always get them confused.

1093
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,938
-Are you married?
-Why, yes.

1094
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,072
I'm married to a lady's maid.

1095
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,477
She supports her father and four sisters.

1096
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:38,652
You should claim to be a girl like that,
shouldn't you, Mary?

1097
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,050
I don't think so.

1098
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,619
You see, she turned out to be a fake.
Never supported anybody in her life.

1099
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,952
Turned out that she was too good for me.

1100
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,555
Couldn't stand for me to meet her friends

1101
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,761
on account of me being a cowhand,
I guess.

1102
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,299
Seems to me a cowboy
ought to be as good as a lady's maid.

1103
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,768
I must remember to look that up
and see what the book says.

1104
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:57,895
Keeping cows under control

1105
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:00,201
must be more productive work
than hooking up a dress.

1106
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,208
And what about the Indians?
Who's going to fight the Indians?

1107
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:06,041
The cowboys are the ones
who always come to the rescue.

1108
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:09,178
They have a slogan, haven't they?
"We always get our man."

1109
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,343
No, dear, those are the Marines.

1110
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,545
Oh, well, wait a minute,
everybody. Wait a minute.

1111
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,382
I want to get some advice from him.

1112
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,390
Now, I want your opinion, young man.

1113
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,619
Judge Smith, our host here,

1114
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,260
is seeking the nomination for
President of the United States,

1115
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,025
and he wants my support.

1116
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,564
Now, what would you advise me to do?

1117
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:29,364
I'd advise you to get off your high horse
and stop talking down to people.

1118
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,938
And the same goes
for your smart aleck friends here.

1119
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,064
I beg your pardon?

1120
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,801
You know you don't give a hang
what I think.

1121
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,103
Now, just a minute.

1122
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:39,408
I'm glad you asked me, though,
because I'd like to tell you.

1123
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:41,674
In the first place,

1124
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:44,616
I don't see where you get off
picking anybody for president

1125
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,449
when you haven't the decency
to treat a person like a human being.

1126
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,385
Instead of asking people
to sit down at your table

1127
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,822
so that you can laugh at them,

1128
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:53,587
maybe you ought to go out
and find out what they think

1129
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:54,787
and feel.

1130
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,057
And what their needs are
and what you can do to help them.

1131
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,831
That's all that's going to count
in the long run.

1132
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:04,098
If Judge Smith, there,
wants to be President.

1133
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,866
He ain't going to get very far
looking down his nose at people

1134
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,704
and thinking he's better than they are.

1135
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,937
Abraham Lincoln didn't have to do that,

1136
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,137
and he turned out
to be a pretty good president.

1137
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:16,483
-Are you quite finished?
-Yeah, except for one more thing.

1138
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,448
I'd like to invite you all out to the ranch,

1139
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:22,352
and maybe we could show you something
about decent manners.

1140
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:27,487
Nice work.

1141
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:38,129
Stretch.

1142
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:41,298
-Please, Stretch, let me talk to you.
-A lady's maid, huh?

1143
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,375
You were bragging.

1144
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,546
Stretch.

1145
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,685
Judge Smith.

1146
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,767
Mary, wasn't that too fantastic?

1147
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,599
Mary, I never saw anything
so brazen in all my life.

1148
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:14,902
That's what happens...

1149
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:18,501
The way he sat at the table and
lipped off Mr. Henderson as if he were...

1150
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:38,849
Oh, Dad.

1151
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:48,961
Well...

1152
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,567
Well, it turns out to be a filly.
You should have seen Bess.

1153
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,407
Kept tossing her head like she was saying,

1154
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,066
"Where's that long-legged boss of mine?

1155
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:56,666
"He thought I couldn't do it."

1156
01:26:56,811 --> 01:27:00,406
I never seen a mare like her, Stretch.
No fooling, she's just like a human being.

1157
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,642
Why, she knew
what was going on every minute.

1158
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:06,444
Well, sir, you should've heard Ma Hawkins.

1159
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:07,679
Barking at everybody.

1160
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:10,857
"Let alone with that critter," said she.
"And leave her do for herself."

1161
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,523
Two hours later,
she's wrapping a blanket around her.

1162
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:14,889
Yeah, figured she was all alone.

1163
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:16,596
Sugar and me run right into her.

1164
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:20,134
Hey, Uncle Stretch, give me a lift, please?
Uncle Stretch.

1165
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:25,367
-Hello, Mickey.
-Give me a lift please.

1166
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:26,740
Yeah, sure.

1167
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,698
Come on.

1168
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,641
I'll put your suitcase
in your room, Stretch.

1169
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:34,006
-Hello, Uncle Stretch.
-Hello, Patsy.

1170
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,285
-Not that way. The other way.
-Oh, yeah.

1171
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:43,290
Thanks.

1172
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:58,865
Hello.

1173
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:04,407
I was just looking
at your truck garden here.

1174
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,643
I used to grow tomatoes as big as this
on my farm.

1175
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,686
You know, all the way in here,
on the plane, I kept thinking

1176
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,188
of something you said.

1177
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:21,588
"People ought to get off
their high horses." You're so right.

1178
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:25,097
When you look down your nose,
your viewpoint's inclined to get blurred.

1179
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:31,103
A good many parents are that way.
Get up on their high horse, I mean.

1180
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,730
They demand respect and sacrifice
from their children.

1181
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,072
The trouble is,
they forget they have to earn it first.

1182
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,276
I never earned it.

1183
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,947
But I got a great deal of it from Mary.

1184
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:47,382
All her life, she made many sacrifices
just to safeguard a mad obsession of mine.

1185
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:52,020
Well, she doesn't have to do it anymore.
I'm rid of my obsession.

1186
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,287
I walked out on the whole business.

1187
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:59,229
-You walked out?
-Not that I had to.

1188
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:02,531
But I realized it wasn't what I wanted,
after all.

1189
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,332
As I was getting on the plane
to come here,

1190
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:08,375
Henderson begged me to change my mind,
but I refused.

1191
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:13,438
It doesn't matter. There are too many men
in the country better equipped for the job.

1192
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:18,212
Besides, I found Mary had an obsession
that's more important.

1193
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:23,756
And now, I wonder if a tired old man
could beg a cool drink from you.

1194
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,554
I've been sitting out here for hours.

1195
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,788
Sure, come on in.

1196
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,568
Right in here.

1197
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:50,744
There you are!
It's about time you were back,

1198
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,581
traipsing around the country. Sit down.

1199
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,582
I'll bet you haven't had
a decent meal in a week.

1200
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,020
The man there wants a drink.

1201
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:59,491
Oh, picking up strangers, eh?
What do you think this is? A roadhouse?

1202
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:02,119
What do you want? Iced tea?
That's all we've got.

1203
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,288
Boy, is that...

1204
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,798
I told you to keep your hand
out of that pan.

1205
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,663
Ma Hawkins?

1206
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:11,205
Hello, there, Sugar. How are you?

1207
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,772
Come on, Buzz, pump it up. Hit it.

1208
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:28,486
Ma! Ma Hawkins.
It fell. The whole cake fell. What'll I do?

1209
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:31,717
I told you to watch it. Good heavens,
I can't get anything done around here.

1210
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,387
But I couldn't help it. Somebody banged
the door and it shook the oven.

1211
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,258
...instead of cooking,
how do you think I'm gonna do it?

1212
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,401
Hello, cowboy.

1213
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,618
Ma! Ma Hawkins.

1214
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,982
Get out, get out,
there's work to be done.

1215
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:07,991
Get... Do you think this is a hangout?

1216
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:12,425
Stretch Willoughby, that's my kitchen.
