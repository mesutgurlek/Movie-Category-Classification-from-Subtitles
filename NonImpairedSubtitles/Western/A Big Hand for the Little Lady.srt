65
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,488
-Hello. Chester.

Coming up. Doc.

68
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,292
Drummond was heavy winner last year.

69
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,266
And the year before.

70
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:58,566

l gotta get back there tonight again.

75
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,079
That's a lot of riding
just for one baby.

76
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,882
Well. their mare's in foal too.

00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,740
-What's yours? How much is he ahead?
-l don't know. it's hard to figure.

86
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:48,356
l wouldn't play poker with Henry Drummond
if his back was to a mirror.

87
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,924
Even if l had the money.

88
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,026
What do you think. Sam?

89
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,822

So long. boy.

103
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,531
-Evening. Doc.
-Tate.

104
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:39,765
This is one fancy rig
old Ben Tropp rides around in.

105
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,569
Yes. it is.

106
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:46,579
Don't he give a damn what people think.
him riding around the country in a hearse?

107
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:51,152
lf you're the richest undertaker in Texas.
you're entitled to a fancy rig.

108
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,687
But if you spend your days and nights
trying to keep people alive...

109
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,485
...you ride around in the likes of this.
Giddyup.

110
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,954
-Hey. Sam.
-Who's winning?

112
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,454
Hey. they're on

113
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:12,066

Meredith. you know
you're not supposed to carry--

120
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,076
Sign outside says hotel.

121
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,274
l assume that means you have
accommodations for transients.

122
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,352
-You asking if we got rooms?
-One room for the three of us.

123
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:08,922
This is a cattleman's hotel. mister.
Not a family type.

124
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:11,685
The rooms we got
ain't fitting for women and children.

125
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,227
Please. any kind of inside accommodation
would look good to us right now.

126
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:18,833
-We've been on the road for days.

00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,974
Boy can sleep in the wood box.

130
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,406
Unless you care for two rooms
for an extra dollar.

131
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,308
Another dollar?

132
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,450
l like to sleep in the wood box.

133
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,279
One room will be fine. thank you.

134
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:39,546
-How long you fixing to stay?
-Just overnight.

135
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:42,384

137
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,817
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

138
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:50,432

-Say thank you. son.

142
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,970
Sam? Sam.

143
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,135

00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,668
-What's going on back there?
-Poker.

148
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,770
-Meredith.
-Must be a big game.

149
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,607
The biggest. mister. The biggest.

00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,268
-ln this town?
-Yes. sir. in this town.

151
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,178
You just try to find a bigger game
between here and the Mississippi.

152
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,874
-How big is that?
-Mister...

153
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:21,785
...the five richest men in the territory
are in that backroom playing for blood.

154
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,856
-How often does this go on?
-Once a year.

155
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:29,191
Twelve months they've been
saving up their blood.

156
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:32,162
Meredith. let's go upstairs.
We're all very tired.

157
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:34,359
-ln a minute. Mary.
-Come now. Meredith.

158
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,232
-l was only gonna ask--
-l know what you were going to ask.

159
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,670
-What's wrong with asking?
-You know what's wrong.

160
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,106
So let's not talk about it.
We have things to do.

161
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:45,713
-What's the big rush?
-We've got to take that wagon to the smith.

162
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,473
We've got time for that.

163
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,618
We've got to get washed up.
then we've got to see about food.

164
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:54,722
-We've got time. we're here overnight.
-Meredith. l refuse....

165
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,715
-Now. Mary.
-Now. Meredith.

166
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,398
Who's winning. Mr. Habershaw?

167
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,065
Mr. Habershaw?

168
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:19,275
-What's your pleasure. Mr. Habershaw?
-Who's winning. Mr. Habershaw?

169
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,319
Little more of that dog hair. Sam.

170
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,181
You quitting the game.
Mr. Habershaw?

171
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,086
-Just stretching my legs.
-We hear Drummond's way ahead in there.

172
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,921
He's ahead. He ain't way ahead.

173
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,723
Game's got a way to go yet. huh?

174
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,923
That's right.

175
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,370
Excuse me. you said the blacksmith
was down the street.

176
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,707
You didn't say which way.

177
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,680
Due west to the end of the street
and turn right.

178
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:33,888
Thank you. thank you very much. Sir.

179
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,158
Your health. sir.

180
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,296
And to the queen.
and to the jack.

181
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:48,993
Thank you. sir.

182
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,732
Am l correct. sir. in assuming
you're one of the players in the game?

183
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:55,877
-The assumption is correct. sir.
-ls it a private game. sir?

184
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,872
l mean to say. sir. would you permit...

185
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,642
...a passing stranger
to watch for a little while?

186
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,246
-Meredith.
-l said watch.

187
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,947
Nobody who ain't in the game
gets in that room. huh. Mr. Habershaw?

188
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,523
Meredith--

189
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,683
Jackie? Jackie. come here.

190
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:16,463
Oh. Jackie. what have you got--?

191
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,328
Meredith. we've got to get
that wagon to the blacksmith.

192
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,025
We've got to leave town tomorrow.

193
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,195
There's a lot of work
to be done on that wheel.

194
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,135
All l asked the gentleman
was to be allowed to-- Mary. please.

195
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,440
-Mary. lookit. all l want to do is watch.
-Meredith. you promised.

196
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:36,106
Good Lord. you don't want
to deprive me of that too.

197
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,482
-l can't get into trouble watching.
-l never said you were going to--

198
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,147
Please listen. You and Jackie
drive the wagon down to the smith's.

199
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,226
Let me watch the game
till you get back from the blacksmith's.

200
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:50,388
-Meredith. you know very well you won't--
-This is fate. Mary. Don't you see that?

201
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,329
Chance to get into a game of cards
in the middle of nowhere.

202
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,404
The good Lord give me this one last chance
just to watch a game of cards.

203
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:00,006
There won't be any cards
on the farm. you know that.

204
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,168
l've given my word.
Give me this one last little concession.

205
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,507
l won't be breaking my word
if l just watch.

206
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,151
You just heard the gentleman say
they don't allow any spectators.

207
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,378
ls that a hard and fast rule. sir?

208
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,087
lf l say you can watch. you can watch.

209
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,955
-But if the lady objects. l wouldn't think--
-There.

210
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,722
lt's up to you. Mary....

211
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,389
Meredith. the blacksmith
may be a long time. l don't--

212
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,502
Give me just 1 5 minutes.
then l'll join you at the blacksmith's.

213
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,003
l cross my heart. Mary....

214
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,574
Oh. Meredith.

215
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,039
Jackie. you stay right here.

216
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,310
You stay with him every second
while l'm gone.

217
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:48,354
-Don't you let him out of your sight.
-Oh. no. Mary.

218
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,390
Giddyup.

219
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,795
ls it all right if...?

220
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,455
Can't we come in too?

221
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,259
l'm in.

222
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,094
Hey. who's this?

223
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,594
Friends of mine.

224
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,290
Friends of yours?
What in the hell are they doing here?

225
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,901
-l said they could watch.
-Otto. you know the rules.

226
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,537
-Yeah.
-Ain't nobody--

227
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,866
l said they could watch.

228
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,376
Cut.

229
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:50,875
Five card draw. ante 25.

230
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,590
You on the poker wagon. mister?

231
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,692
-Mister?
-What?

232
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,925
Oh. yes. you might
put it that way. yes.

233
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,626
Little woman make you give it up?

234
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,329
Well. we talked it over.
but it was my decision.

235
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,634
You open. Otto.

236
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,505
Twenty-five dollars.

237
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,250
Like to see my wife ask me to quit.

238
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,152
Oh. l didn't say my wife--

239
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,789
Can't you just see Genevieve...

240
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:33,894
...asking me to restrain myself
from a nice. friendly little game of cards?

241
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:38,857
Twenty-five. and 50 more.

242
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,696
How long since you've seen
that wife of yours. Denny?

243
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,930
Oh. l don't know.
Two. maybe three months.

244
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,804
You don't pay too much attention
to little old Genevieve. do you?

245
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:52,140
-You're darn tooting.
-Why should he?

246
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:55,872
Any man gets himself married
is automatically stupid.

247
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:58,679
Denny's just refusing to stay stupid.

248
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,378
He just don't ever see his wife.

249
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,320
Words of wisdom
from the confirmed bachelor.

250
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,552
Confirmed and reconfirmed.
l hate women.

251
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:10,994
l believe you.
You've buried enough of them.

252
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,735
Sure l did. l put them back
where they belong.

253
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,230
-Cards. Otto.
-Come on.

254
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,864
What's your hurry. Tropp?
You nervous l might bury you?

255
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:25,906
Get it. boys?
l'll bury him. and he's....

256
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,912
We get it.

257
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,546
-Two cards.
-Three.

258
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,076
Three.

259
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,552
Where you folks bound for?

260
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,182
San Antonio. San Antone.

261
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,127
One.

262
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,824
Texas.

263
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,796
One. and dealer takes three.

264
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,299
San Antone. huh?

265
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,028
San Antone. Texas.

266
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:53,971
Oh. that's a long way.

267
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,605
Fifty dollars.

268
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:58,768
ln.

269
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,381
We bought a place there.
Plan to do a little farming.

270
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,111
And 50. Ain't no such thing
as a little farming.

271
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,754
Yeah.

272
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,755
Well. what l mean.
we don't have a big place...

273
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,589
...a big spread. just a nice piece of land
just outside San Antone.

274
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,663
-How much land?
-Forty acres.

275
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,423
Forty acres?

276
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,967
What you planning to do.
raise stinkweed?

277
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,235
Y'all listen. listen.

278
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,603
One whole year
l've been honing my backside...

279
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,870
...to sit in on this game
and what am l doing?

280
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,843
Playing poker? Hell no.

281
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:37,951
l'm talking about the stinkweed crop
in San Antone. Texas.

282
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,782
Let's play cards.
l bet a hundred dollars.

283
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,584
You know what l give up
to play in this game?

284
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,524
-A million dollars.
-No. more than that.

285
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,393
More than that to me.
Mr. Big-Mouth Lawyer.

286
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:53,363
My daughter Ceely
was getting married.

287
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,462
-Ceely?
-That's right.

288
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,267
When Tropp come for me.
she was getting married.

289
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,639
And they're holding up the love.
honor and obey part till l get back.

290
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,677
You walked out in the middle
of the wedding?

291
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,407
l did. l ain't been late
for this game in 1 6 years...

292
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,347
...and l ain't about to start now.
wedding or no wedding.

293
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,353
l told them. l said. ''You start late.
and l may not be around for the finish.''

294
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,923
The groom got held up
by the flood in Baker Flats...

295
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,357
...so the wedding
was late getting started.

296
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:22,621
''When Tropp and Habershaw
get here.'' l said...

297
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:26,460
...''l'm walking out of this house
whether Ceely's hitched by then or not.''

298
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,798
Now. that's how much
this game means to me.

299
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:39,947
Do you mind if we indulge in what l left
my little girl waiting at the altar for?

300
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:43,915
Do you mind if we play a little cards?

301
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,485
l just raised a hundred dollars.

302
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,082
l don't think that's a very nice thing
to do to your daughter.

303
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:53,694
Well. look who's mealy-mouthing me
about being nice.

304
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,855
Old Mr. Tight-Fist-30-Percent-on-My-Money-
Or-l-Foreclose...

305
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,866
...Mr. Jesse Buford himself in the flesh.

306
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,971
Now. don't you give me
no Sunday-school lesson about being nice.

307
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,936
Sit up and pay attention to this game.

308
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,371
Now. are you gonna call
or ain't you gonna call?

309
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,570
Now. l got 300 United States dollars
in that pot says that l got a hand.

310
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,848
That's a lot of money. l fold.

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,184
l got lots more.
l come loaded for bear. not chickens.

312
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:26,191
Let's play for money.

313
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:28,591
You're the one that said it.

314
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:33,427
And 5.

315
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,011
Beat three deuces.

316
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,115
Full house beats it. l guess.

317
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,615
You're an expert on the rules.
Mr. Wilcox.

318
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:54,551
According to Mr. Hoyle. the rules say
that a full house beats three of a kind.

319
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:57,089
-That's what they say.
-That's what l thought.

320
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,424
Horse shoes.

321
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:04,054
Oh. no. Henry. l am not lucky.
l'm just skillful.

322
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:05,590
Yeah.

323
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:12,330
-Pardon me.
-Yeah. what do you want?

324
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:16,443
-You bet a hundred dollars on three twos?
-l bet the way l feel like it.

325
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:21,978
-ls this a private game?
-What does that mean?

326
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,550
Well. l mean.
can anybody pull up a chair?

327
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,277
-Papa.
-Quiet.

328
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:29,119
-Pull up a chair. huh?
-Well. now....

329
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:32,355
-We got a rule about that.
-What's that?

330
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:36,520
You can pull up a chair. all right.
if you got the price of admission.

331
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:40,532
-How much is that?
-One thousand dollars.

332

-Papa. no.

335
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,375
-What did you just say?
-l said l've got a thousand dollars.

336
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:02,817
You got it. go get it.

337
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,981
-Right away.
-Papa.

338
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,490
-You mustn't take that money.
-Now. don't you worry. son.

339
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,655
Your mama knows all about it. l told her.
She knows all about it.

340
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,701
l'm not taking the money. l'm just
borrowing it. that's all. Just borrowing it.

341
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,506
Papa.

342
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,835
Papa.

343
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,304
Papa. no.

344
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:25,971
Sam.

345
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,712
You got a big man's drink?
Sarsaparilla or something?

346
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:32,785
-Sure.
-Pour one for the gentleman here.

347
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,717
ln a beer glass. if you please.

348
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:37,949
How's that. Jackie. old man.

349
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,185
Step up to the bar

350
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,829

Step up to the bar. mister.

352
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,376
-Sam. how about some chips?
-Count the money. Sam.

353
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:39,916
-One thousand even.
-Give him his chips.

354
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,235
And l thank you. Sam.
Come on. son.

355
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,878
l bet his wife
wouldn't give him the money.

356
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,215
You paid for it.

357
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:22,462
-lt's table stakes.
-l assumed as much.

358
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,030
-And Western rules on betting.
-Meaning?

359
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,929
Meaning you can't tap out
if you ain't got enough to bet.

360
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:30,593
Just bow out.
leave your money on the table.

361
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:33,332
-That's a rough game.
-lt's the game we play.

362
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:34,770
Good enough for me.

363
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,968
Then it's your deal. mister.

364
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,711
Been a long time.

365
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,718
Sure feels good.

366
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:01,993
Hi. son.

367
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,535
Wanna watch?

368
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:08,472
Wanna watch your papa buy us
another 40 acres in San Antone. Texas?

369
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,099
Will it take much longer?

370
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:43,908
-Sorry. ma'am. what'd you say?
-l said. will it take much longer?

371
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:46,376
This is a bigger job
than you think. ma'am.

372
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,540
You wanna ride that wagon for a while yet.
you better let me fix it right.

373
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,684
l'm obliged to you.

374
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,387
My pleasure. ma'am.

375
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,103
-Fold.
-l'm out.

376
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:12,805
Me too.

377
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,053
Two hundred dollars.

378
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:35,462
Beat three tens.

379
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,029
l got one good hand.

380
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,099
Why don't you wait for it?
Why keep betting on the bad ones?

381
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:47,073
-May l?
-My pleasure.

382
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:53,078
-Papa.
-Why don't you go get another drink. son?

383
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,279
Papa. when are you gonna stop?

384
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,345
Don't you ever get tired
just hanging around?

385
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,682
-Why don't you go upstairs?
-Hey. sonny?

386
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,688
Why don't you come over here
next to me?

387
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:07,259
You ain't gonna learn nothing
watching Papa.

388
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:13,690
l can see now why your old lady
made you quit this game.

389
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:16,395
Now deal.

390
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:21,167
-lsn't it time we had a new deck?
-Dealer can call for a new deck any time.

391
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,913
-Papa.
-Will you please be quiet?

392
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,048
lt's a question of averages.

393
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,693
-The cards are due to break for me.
-Famous last words.

394
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:48,068
Pretty good mitt he's got there. huh?
Handles them cards real good.

395
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah. just like
my old grandma used to.

396
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,740
Oh. he's a real expert mechanic.

397
00:34:56,077 --> 00:35:00,070
Hey. ain't it great to see
an artist handle them pasteboards?

398
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:03,083
Must have had a lot of practice.

399
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:07,312
Oh. takes a lot of practice
to keep on losing the way he is.

400
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,358
Twenty-five dollars ante.
five-card draw.

401
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,128
-Otto?
-l'm in.

402
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:05,005
Oh. God.

403
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:11,750
So you were good to yourself?

404
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,513
He's got himself a hot one this time.

405
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,648
l bet he's got himself
two dandy little deuces. eh?

406
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,488
-Come on. Ben. Come on. Ben.
-Seventy-five dollars.

407
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,063
-Call.
-Call.

408
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,496
-Call.
-Call.

409
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,095
Dealer calls. Cards?

410
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,504
Two.

411
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,303
Three.

412
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,012
One.

413
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,076
Two.

414
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:58,324
Well. now. l'll tell you something.
l'm just gonna have one little old card.

415
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:02,629
Any one of four particular ones
you got left in that deck will do.

416
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,006
And you. sir?

417
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:20,453
Oh. l guess l'll just sit tight.

418
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:23,349
Well. now. what do you know?

419
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:25,048
He's got himself a big one.

420
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,626
Why. sure he has. He said he would.

421
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:32,125
Watch out. boys.
He just might have himself five deuces.

422
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,790
Two hundred dollars.

423
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,300
What's the matter. mister?
lt ain't hot in here.

424
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,564
Why. sure it is.
That is. if you got four aces.

425
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,166
He can't have four aces. l got them.

426
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,040
No. you can't have four.
l got three myself.

427
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,314
Well. l'll call that 200.

428
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,214
And l raise 200.

429
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:00,224
That's $400 to you.

430
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,691
And you know something. mister?

431
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,730
You ain't got enough left
to stay in this pot.

432
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,561
And you know the rules.

433
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:09,497
We said Western style.

434
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,845
You just keep them there till l get back.
Don't let anybody see those cards.

435
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,454
-Hey. mister. Wait a minute. mister.
-Now. wait.

436
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,214
-Hey.
-Now. wait a minute.

437
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,554
There's nothing in the rules
about leaving in the middle of a hand.

438
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,425
So long as he leaves the cards here. Denny.
So long as he leaves the cards here.

439
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:41,526
Well. boy. it's a good thing
your mommy ain't here. huh?

440
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:44,262
She'd give him a what for.

441
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:47,601
What's Mama do
when Papa loses all the bacon?

442
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:50,608
She push him around some. sonny.
like a good little wife?

443
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:53,008
Who's bigger. sonny. Mama or Papa?

444
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,580
And who wears the pants?

445
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:00,386
Hey. wait a minute. boy.
where are you going?

446
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,482
Hey. boy. come back here.

447
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:08,457
What are you doing out here?

448
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,120
-Did anybody see those cards?
-No. Papa.

449
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,595
Sam.

450
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,940
Count it.

451
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:28,973
One thousand.

452
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,079
Two thousand.

453
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,788
-Three thousand dollars.
-No. Papa.

454
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,888
Quiet. Well?

455
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,387
Give him chips.

456
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,566
One...

457
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:58,807
...two...

458
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,881
...three thousand.

459
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,313
Ain't you gonna count them?

460
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,886
You're sure you didn't let anybody
see those cards?

461
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,615
Good boy. Now let's get rich.

462

00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,799
Sam.

465
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:30,901
So the big gambling man from San Antone

466
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:34,844
Well. l got some inside information for him.

00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,988
-The big box?
-You heard me.

472
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:53,059

Every cent of it. lt's $400 to you.

474
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:01,237
Four hundred and two.

00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,516
-There. is that right?
-That's it. Thank you.

482
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:52,681
Thank you.

483
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,829
-Sorry it took so long.
-Just as long as you did a good job.

484
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:58,658
l ain't a man to boast.
but you couldn't get a better job.

485
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,596
-Not for $2.
-l'm sure of that.

486
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,670
-Good luck. ma'am.
-Thank you.

487
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,840

-Yes. ma'am?
-Thank you.

489
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:03,694
Excuse me. but have you seen
my husband and my son?

490
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:06,494
l....

491
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,030
No. ma'am.

492
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:13,697
-Do you think they might be upstairs?
-Well. they might be. ma'am.

493
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:15,671
l don't rightly know.

494
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,102
Thank you.

495
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:42,830
Excuse me for troubling you again.
but could you let me in. please?

496
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:46,166
-My husband seems to have the key.
-Why. sure thing. ma'am.

497
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,039
He's still in that backroom. ma'am.

498
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,202
They're playing cards.

499
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:41,988
Mister.

500
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:45,125
Hear what l said. mister?

501
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:52,734
Mister?

502
00:44:57,711 --> 00:45:00,077
l don't think
you're paying strict attention.

503
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,511
What l said was.
if you wanna stay in this game...

504
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:05,982
...you better go upstairs
and get 420 more dollars out of the sock.

505
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,014
-lt isn't fair.
-What isn't fair?

506
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:12,047
This rule about not being able
to tap out of the game.

507
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:15,059
That's the rule. mister.
That is the rule.

508
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:16,924
Now. we told you all about it.

509
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,658
Well. you going upstairs?

510
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:24,132
-There's no more money upstairs.
-Now. ain't that a shame.

511
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:27,165
-Up to you. Tropp.
-Now. wait a minute.

512
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:30,003
You can't wash me out of the game.
You just can't do it.

513
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:31,439
Now. look. mister.

514
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:33,273
First rule of the game of poker...

515
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,881
...whether you're playing
Eastern or Western rules...

516
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:39,177
...or the kind they play at the North Pole.
is put up or shut up.

517
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,317
You can give me credit.

518
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,512
-Meredith.
-Mama.

519
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:44,020
-Stay out of this.
-Look here.

520
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:48,594
-We don't allow no woman in here.
-Listen. l've got-- l've got this.

521
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,227
All right. l'll give you a hundred dollars
on the watch. now you need 320 more.

522
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,300
ln the name of heaven.
what are you doing?

523
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,233
l say we ain't never allowed
no woman in here.

524
00:45:58,405 --> 00:45:59,997
-Shut up.
-But she's a woman.

525
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,869
-Shut up.
-That's a solid gold watch.

526
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:04,340
-lt's worth more than a hundred.
-No.

527
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,739
Just give me a minute.

528
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:10,649
Mary. Mary. listen.
lt's not what you think it is.

529
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:13,810
We got a chance here to earn more money
than you ever dreamed of.

530
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:17,115
ls all of our money on that table?
Have you taken every cent of it?

531
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,851
But l know what l'm doing.
With this hand. l can't lose.

532
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,291
Trust me. Mary.
you gotta trust me just this once.

533
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,590
-The whole 4000?
-But l haven't lost it. Mary.

534
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:27,893
lt isn't as if l'd lost it.
l'm investing it. l'm still in the game.

535
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:29,695
Mary. dear. listen to me.

536
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,668

537
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,173
You hear me? Once in a lifetime.
Trust me. you just gotta trust me.

538
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:37,776
Trust you?

539
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:41,210
Trust you? God in heaven.
how many times have l trusted you?

540
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,941
How many times and how many days
and how many years...

541
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:46,950
...have l trusted and trusted
and sat and waited and wept...

542
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,588
...while you played with cards
that couldn't lose?

543
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:52,748
But you lost. and you lost
until you got sick with losing...

544
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:57,192
...and you swore by all that was holy
that you would never play cards again.

545
00:46:57,364 --> 00:46:59,389
And l trusted you. Meredith.
but look at us.

546
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,126
You've thrown away every cent
we've saved in this world.

547
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:04,133
All we've got is the team
and the wagon.

548
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:06,738
l'm gonna win this time.

550
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:11,674
-Meredith!
-Did you hear me?

551
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:14,177
Meredith. whatever you do.

552
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:16,509

l got 1 1 wagons. Maybe two. 300 horses.

554
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:22,214
You need a team and wagon. Ben?

555
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:25,517
Jesse? Denny?

556
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:28,160
-Otto?
-Did you hear what l said?

557
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,990
l'll take a $200 loss
on a brand-new team and wagon.

558
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:32,563
That's a bargain. all right...

559
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,167
...but it ain't a bargain
unless it's something you need.

560
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,304
But it's a brand-new team and wagon.
We bought it--

561
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,473
Meredith!

562
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:45,236
Meredith.

563

Sam. Sam. Toby. Pete. somebody.

564

lt might not be such a good idea.
ma'am. to move him.

565

613
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,531
Madam. l haven't got time
for bedside manners.

614
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:00,798
Now answer my questions
and answer them quick.

615
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,238
How many times has this happened
to your husband?

616
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,604
Once. Only once.

617
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,663
He ain't breathing so good.
is he. ma'am?

618
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,968
Lend a hand.

619
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:37,744
Sam. where's the nearest bed?
And l don't mean upstairs.

620
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,469
We got no beds downstairs.

621
00:51:39,646 --> 00:51:41,443
lnto the kitchen. Clear the room.

622
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:45,073
-Yeah.
-Gently. gently. you clumsy....

623
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,751
All right now. boys. back to the bar.

624
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:53,859
Plenty of good liquor back in the bar.
Come on now. that's it.

625
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,222
-Come on.
-Meredith.

626
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:57,920
-Just a minute. please.
-Meredith.

627
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:00,430
l'd rather you didn't
come in here right now.

628
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,589
l'm his wife.

629
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:04,737
His wife is the last person
l want in here right now.

630
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:08,341
Be sensible and do what l say.
l'll let you in as soon as l can.

631
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:10,567
Now. you two stay here.
l may want your help.

632
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:11,836
What are you gonna do?

633
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:15,106
Whatever l can. madam.
l promise you. whatever l can.

634
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:17,011
-Doc.
-What is it?

635
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:20,684
-l just wanna ask a simple question.
-Well. what is it?

636
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:22,913
ls he gonna be able
to finish this hand?

637
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:29,292
Henry Drummond. for the love of....

638
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:33,730
Well. l was just asking.

639
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:37,262
How can you be so vile?

640
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:40,429
Now. look. lady.
you got problems. all right.

641
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,599
l'm sorry you got problems.
but l got problems too.

642
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:47,804
-l come a long way to play in this game.
-l'm with you. Henry.

643
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,881
For God's sake.

644
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,146
Look. a man's sick.
All right. a man's sick.

645
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,811
Anything l can do about that? No.

646
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,322
But l got a little girl sitting.
waiting for her daddy to come home...

647
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:00,754
...so she can get married.

648
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,488
And there's something
l can do about that. l aim to finish.

649
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:08,566
l am getting a little sick and tired of hearing
how much you give up to get here.

650
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,226
My daughter's wedding.
that's how much l give up.

651
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:12,928
l give up a man's life.

652
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,171
You gave up what?

653
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:19,139
l was defending Owney Price on a charge
of horse stealing when Tropp come for me.

654
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,280
l was fixing to make
my plea to the jury...

655
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,008
...when Ben busted in that courtroom
hollering for me.

656
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:27,312
l give you all my word l'd be ready
the minute he showed.

657
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:31,048
Did l let my duty as counsel
for the defense stand in my way?

658
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:32,452
l did not.

659
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,094
l left that courtroom
the minute Tropp showed.

660
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:39,358
l left Owney's head halfway in the noose
when l walked out of that courtroom.

661
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:43,832
That's what l did to play
in this game of poker.

662
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:49,702
But l ain't entirely forsook
my membership in the human race.

663
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:53,568
l ain't worrying
about a game of poker...

664
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:57,513
...while that little lady's husband
lays dying.

665
00:53:57,684 --> 00:54:01,279
Well. that's the difference between
you and me. let's put it that way.

666
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:04,685
The man's gonna die.
There ain't nothing we can do about it.

667
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:09,955
So l aim to finish this pot
here and now.

668
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:13,088
And if he can't be around to finish....

669
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:15,234
What happens?

670
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:18,271
Tell her. Denny.

671
00:54:19,072 --> 00:54:22,041
-We have to go by the rules. ma'am.
-What rules?

672
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:25,075
He loses the money. by default.

673
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:29,015
Oh. but that's every penny
we have in this world.

674
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:33,642
Ma'am. your husband didn't take that
into consideration.

675
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,788
Why should l?

676
00:54:36,256 --> 00:54:37,484
You better come in. ma'am.

677
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:40,785
-How is he?
-Better come in.

678
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:45,526
Meredith.

679
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:47,127
-Mary.
-Oh. darling.

680
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,927
Mary. you--

681
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:51,730
-Mary. you--
-Darling. quiet.

682
00:54:51,905 --> 00:54:53,736
-Mary. you....
-Please.

683
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:55,135
You....

684
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:56,775
What's he trying to tell me?

685
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:58,205
lt's my guess. ma'am...

686
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,437
...he's asking you
to play the hand for him.

687
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,449
He wants me to play the hand?

688
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:16,459
All right. ma'am.
you better get out of here now.

689
00:55:41,054 --> 00:55:42,885
How do you play this game?

690
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:53,991
What'd you say. lady?

691
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,397
l asked you.
how do you play this game?

692
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:00,505
You mean to tell us. ma'am.
that you don't know the rules?

693
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:03,499
l've never played a game of cards
in my life.

694
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:09,876
-Sam.
-Yeah? How is he?

695
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,041
Doc wants the shutter
used to carry drunks.

696
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:13,446
Right.

697
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:21,088
-ls he all right?
-No change. ma'am.

698
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:27,931
Oh. what are you doing?

699
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:30,035
We're a long way
from a hospital. ma'am.

700
00:56:30,203 --> 00:56:33,195
Next best thing in these parts
is my house where my equipment is.

701
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:34,965
-Now easy. boys.
-Darling. Darling.

702
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,938
Now. let's have
no more talking. ma'am.

703
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,635
-Move along. move along.
-Wait a minute. wait a minute.

704
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,577
l wish we could stay.
but l've got to get him to my house.

705
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:45,149
-Papa.
-Move along.

706
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,546
Papa.

707
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:48,653
Never mind the boy. Hurry up.

708
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,551
Jackie. Jackie.

709
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:53,021
-You go with your father.
-No.

710
00:56:53,626 --> 00:56:56,686
Well. all right then.
you sit over in that chair.

711
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:09,708
Gentlemen. l have no choice but to continue
to play this game in my husband's place.

712
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:11,503
You're gonna what?

713
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:15,907
That money represents 1 0 years
of scrimping and saving.

714
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:18,812
lt represents our new home
in San Antonio...

715
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:22,978
...and it represents all our dreams
of a decent future for our son.

716
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:25,420
l have no choice but to protect it.

717
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:28,317
And you have no choice. gentlemen.

718
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:29,894
And what do we have to do?

719
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,994
You have to teach me
how to play this game.

720
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,528
l told you when she come in here.

721
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,466
But. ma'am. it takes years--

722
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:41,766
Let's not even talk about it.
lt's crazy to even talk about it.

723
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:44,136
-Pour me one. will you. Otto?
-Women.

724
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,777
l say let's get her out of here.

725
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:47,537
-Hold it. Ben.
-Hold what?

726
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,341
Hold it.

727
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:54,349
l can explain enough to the lady to clean up
the situation to everybody's satisfaction.

728
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:58,423
How in a big fat pig's eye are you
gonna clean it up to my satisfaction?

729
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,024
Listen carefully.

730
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:02,526
Yes?

731
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,322
This is the way it is.

732
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:06,795
We're all of us holding cards. see?

733
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:12,097
And we. all of us. each of us.
we think we got better cards...

734
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:13,933
...than anybody else in the game.

735
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:17,602
-You follow me. ma'am?
-Yes.

736
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:22,774
Now. we're each of us so sure
that we got the best hand...

737
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:25,315
...that we're willing to bet on it.

738
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:28,750
That is the principle
of the game. ma'am.

739
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,823
You make a bet
you got the best hand.

740
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,481
l understand.

741
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:35,688
You bet money.

742
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:37,887
Mr. Drummond is correct.

743
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:42,262
l've got $3500 on that table
that says that l've got the best hand.

744
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:47,498
Mr. Drummond here. he's got $3500
in there saying the same thing for him.

745
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:52,611
And the same goes for Mr. Tropp.
Mr. Buford and Mr. Wilcox.

746
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,239
Everybody at this table
is betting $3500...

747
00:58:57,417 --> 00:59:00,580
...that he's got the winning hand.

748
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,483
Well. go on.

749
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:06,651
Everybody but your husband. that is.

750
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:08,288
That's the nub of it.

751
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:11,492
All your husband could throw in there
was $3000.

752
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:13,928
Now. he's gotta get up
another $500 to stay in...

753
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,695
...or he's gotta bow out of the game.

754
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,538
ls that clear. ma'am?

755
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:28,677
Oh. extremely clear. Mr...?

756
00:59:28,848 --> 00:59:33,683
Habershaw. ma'am.
Mr. Otto Habershaw.

757
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,590
You left out something.
Mr. Habershaw.

758
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,488
Tell her what happens
even if he does raise the 500.

759
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,458
Tell her it ain't gonna be enough.

760
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,066
Because this pot's
gonna get higher and higher.

761
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:49,326
l guarantee it.

762
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,135
He's right. ma'am.

763
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:53,736
And my name is Drummond. ma'am.

764
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:58,138
Mr. Henry P.G. Drummond.

765
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,674
Well. my husband offered to sell
his gold watch and chain.

766
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,147
l heard him.

767
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:07,980
Maybe you heard me say.
out of the goodness of my heart...

768
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:10,213
...that l'd give him
a hundred dollars on it.

769
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,325
He was also offering our team
and our wagon.

770
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:18,760
Oh. any you boys wanna buy
a team and wagon?

771
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,696
Gentlemen all.
All such gallant gentlemen.

772
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,871
Yeah. we're gallant on Sunday.
This is Friday. and we're playing poker.

773
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,207
Now. you wanna play with us.
you ante up $500.

774
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,475
Now. listen. Henry.
there's no need to insult the lady.

775
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:42,018
Oh. now. look. since damn when did you
climb up on that big white horse?

776
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:45,351
Just because you're teasing yourself
with some hot ideas...

777
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:47,390
...for you and the lady after the game--

778
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,959
-Henry--
-Now. don't tell me.

779
01:00:49,128 --> 01:00:51,426
l know you.
so don't tell me how to behave.

780
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:53,428
Once a year. l come here to play poker.

781
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,124
l don't come here
for a lot of sweet talk and la-di-da.

782
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,930
l didn't come to listen to you
shoot your big fat mouth.

783
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:02,165
Now. hold it.
Now. just a doggone minute.

784
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:05,004
None of us come here
to listen to a dogfight either.

785
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:06,611
Now. let's stick to the point.

786
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:08,007
You tell them. Denny.

787
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:10,513
And the point's very simple.

788
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:14,346
Now. you got $500
to play a man's game...

789
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,283
...or ain't you got $500?

790
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:19,892
lf you ain't. time's a-wasting. We wanna
get home before the rainy season.

791
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:21,720
Yeah.

792
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,419
Will you accept an lOU?

793
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:28,196
Ma'am. if you want credit
from a businessman...

794
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:31,166
...you have to come up
with some real security.

795
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:32,827
ls there a bank in this town?

796
01:01:38,177 --> 01:01:42,273
-What was that again. ma'am?
-l asked you. is there a bank in this town?

797
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,884
The Cattle and Merchants Bank.
right across the street.

798
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:49,611
-Come on. Jackie.
-Ma'am.

799
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,682
You bowing out of this game?

800
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:54,891
l'm going to the bank.

801
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:56,961
-For what?
-For money.

802
01:01:57,897 --> 01:01:59,626
From the bank?

803
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,931
Directly across the street.
did you say?

804
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:04,262
Lady. maybe you don't understand.

805
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:10,507
lf we don't extend you no money. credit.
how do you expect to get it from a bank?

806
01:02:10,676 --> 01:02:13,167
On your team and wagon?

807
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:17,248
lt ain't that kind of a bank. lady.
lt just ain't that kind of a bank.

808
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,679
Come along. Jackie.

809
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:20,113
Just a minute. ma'am.

810
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:23,215
Ma'am. Ma'am...

811
01:02:23,389 --> 01:02:26,483
...l don't like to be. like they say.
the lawyer for the devil...

812
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:30,060
...but you just can't walk out of this room
with them cards in your hand.

813
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:32,959
-Why not?
-Why not?

814
01:02:33,132 --> 01:02:35,327
lt just ain't poker. that's why.

815
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,991
lt don't go by the rules.

816
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,298
You see. ma'am.
while you're out of the room...

817
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:42,771
...anything could happen. you could....

818
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:45,410
-l could cheat?
-Well. no. ma'am. What l--

819
01:02:45,578 --> 01:02:47,273
Now. ma'am. l didn't say....

820
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:50,211
What l mean is. since you don't know
the rules of the game--

821
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:53,841
Now. let me tell you something.
all of you.

822
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:56,321
You may play poker for fun...

823
01:02:56,489 --> 01:03:00,084
...or whatever selfish thrill
you get out of this horrid game...

824
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,386
...but l am playing for my life.

825
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:03,927
My life. gentlemen.

826
01:03:04,096 --> 01:03:06,428
And l have no intention
of letting these cards...

827
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:08,362
...out of my possession.

828
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:11,298
My husband gave them to me.
and l am playing for him...

829
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:15,740
...and l will not relinquish these cards
for any reason whatsoever.

830
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:19,503
-Yes. ma'am. but--
-And you will not force me to.

831
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,547
Now. it is time for the five of you
to show one spark of human decency...

832
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,618
...and allow one compromise
in your silly rules.

833
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,612
Silly rules?

834
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:34,249
l think we can accommodate the lady
and still keep everybody happy.

835
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:37,396
Oh. he's got another suggestion.

836
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,827
-l have.
-What?

837
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,092
One of us goes to the bank with her.

838
01:03:44,604 --> 01:03:45,969
You. huh?

839
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:49,040
l'd be honored.

840
01:03:51,444 --> 01:03:54,311
l raise one little point of order. ma'am.

841
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,072
Yes?

842
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,514
Are you willing to turn your back
on them?

843
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:00,913
What do you mean?

844
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:05,748
Well. once you leave this room. you don't
know what they'll do with their cards.

845
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,157
l trust them.

846
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:22,907
Seven. eight. nine. 1 0.

847
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:24,906
A lot of money. Mrs. Craig.

848
01:04:25,678 --> 01:04:27,145
My money.

849
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:31,579
Oh. Mr. Habershaw. Mr. Drummond.
Mr. Wilcox. how do you do?

850
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,618
And Mr. Tropp.
Game over. gentlemen?

851
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,982
-No.
-Not yet?

852
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:40,751
Well. then something l can do
for you. gentlemen?

853
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:44,355
The little lady you can take care of.
We come with her.

854
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:50,199
Yes. Can l help you. ma'am?

855
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,564
Well. l'd like very much....

856
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:55,172
Oh. you're only the teller.

857
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:58,367
l am the teller. ma'am.

858
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:02,007
l'd like very much to speak
to the manager. please.

859
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:03,170
Manager. ma'am?

860
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:06,147
We got no manager.
but what we got is Mr. Ballinger.

861
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:09,718
Mr. Ballinger is the manager.
and the assistant manager...

862
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:13,188
...and the president and the cashier
and the landlord.

863
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,522
Mr. Ballinger owns the bank. ma'am.

864
01:05:16,963 --> 01:05:18,988
Then it's Mr. Ballinger l'd like to see.

865
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,363
Well. this time of day.
Mr. Ballinger's always very busy. ma'am.

866
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,633
Can l help you?

867
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:32,201
l'm the teller.

868
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:35,506
She wants to see Ballinger.

869
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:41,419
Well. l don't guarantee anything.

870
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:45,020
Come in.

871
01:05:51,797 --> 01:05:54,027
Ballinger.

872
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,836
Will you come this way. please?

873
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:08,505
-You want to see me personally?
-Yes. Mr. Ballinger.

874
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,074
Well....

875
01:06:13,718 --> 01:06:16,278
Well. well. well.
the game must be over.

876
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:18,354
lt's still going on.

877
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:20,991
We're just taking a little rest.

878
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:23,684
No rest for the wicked. Henry.
you know that.

879
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,852
And this is not siesta time.

880
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:29,193
This is an office.
designed for the transaction of business.

881
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:32,803
The little lady is here on business.
We come with her.

882
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,904
Well. all right.

883
01:06:35,139 --> 01:06:38,131
Back to your cage. Fleeson.

884
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:43,144
Sit down. madam. sit down.

885
01:06:47,285 --> 01:06:49,185
ls this yours?

886
01:06:49,354 --> 01:06:51,686
Oh. yes. this is my son. Jackie.

887
01:06:51,856 --> 01:06:53,983
Shake hands with Mr. Ballinger. son.

888
01:06:54,158 --> 01:06:56,683
How do you do. how do you do?

889
01:06:57,261 --> 01:06:58,956
Now then. madam. why do you...

890
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,792
...under the protection
of this brigade of citizens...

891
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:04,331
...insist on seeing me personally?

892
01:07:04,502 --> 01:07:08,666
Well. Mr. Ballinger. you seem to be aware
of the poker game going on at the hotel.

893
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:10,506
l am.

894
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,637
For reasons...

895
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:19,750
...too unreasonable to go into here.
l happen to be playing in that game.

896
01:07:20,785 --> 01:07:22,844
-No.
-Yes.

897
01:07:24,222 --> 01:07:26,452
-ls this true. Otto?
-lt's true.

898
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:28,683
-l don't believe it.
-Oh. it's true.

899
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:33,860
All right.

900
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:37,262
l believe it. l don't approve of it.
but l believe it.

901
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:38,493
Proceed.

902
01:07:40,438 --> 01:07:45,341
There's a grand total of $20.500
sitting in the middle of that table right now.

903
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,944
-You mean in one pot?
-Yes.

904
01:07:49,013 --> 01:07:51,709
-That must be a new record. Henry.
-lt is.

905
01:07:51,883 --> 01:07:55,080
Twenty thousand. five hundred dollars.

906
01:07:55,586 --> 01:07:59,784
-Good heavens.
-And it's my turn to bet...

907
01:07:59,957 --> 01:08:02,448
...but. you see. l don't have....

908
01:08:02,627 --> 01:08:05,323
l mean. my husband and l....

909
01:08:05,496 --> 01:08:07,464
Oh. how can l explain it?

910
01:08:08,466 --> 01:08:12,926
We've put $4000 into that game
and l have to stay with it.

911
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:15,299
l will not be forced out of that game.

912
01:08:16,207 --> 01:08:20,303
You have grit. madam.
l always admire tenacity and grit.

913
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:26,144
But just how does your desire to stick
with the game concern me and my bank?

914
01:08:26,317 --> 01:08:28,911
l don't have the money
to stick with it.

915
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:36,950
l see. What collateral
do you have to offer?

916
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:40,996
On what do you propose
to borrow this money?

917
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:42,393
On this.

918
01:08:48,372 --> 01:08:50,806
Well. it must be a good hand.

919
01:08:53,077 --> 01:08:56,513
lsn't it a good hand?
lsn't it a very good hand of poker?

920
01:08:56,814 --> 01:08:58,145
Don't you know?

921
01:08:58,316 --> 01:09:00,841
No. l'm only taking
my husband's word for it.

922
01:09:01,018 --> 01:09:02,451
Your husband's word?

923
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,020
-Well. he took sick.
-Sick?

924
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:09,182
Well. he was playing the hand.
and then he had a....

925
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,227
Now. please don't make me
try to explain it. because l can't.

926
01:09:12,396 --> 01:09:14,330
But. now. isn't that a good hand?

927
01:09:14,499 --> 01:09:16,433
Put those cards away.
young woman.

928
01:09:17,502 --> 01:09:19,902
-What?
-Put them away.

929
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:23,939
-Otto. this is one of your jokes.
-No.

930
01:09:24,575 --> 01:09:26,543
One of yours. Henry.

931
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:31,381
Young woman.
woman l've never seen before...

932
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:35,349
...tells me she's involved in the biggest
poker game that ever came down the pike.

933
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,249
That one was hard enough to swallow.

934
01:09:37,822 --> 01:09:41,155
And then she tells me she wants
to borrow money from my bank...

935
01:09:41,425 --> 01:09:43,450
...to stay in the game.

936
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:45,994
That's when l should have called
Mr. Fleeson...

937
01:09:46,163 --> 01:09:48,324
...to have you ejected
from the premises.

938
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:50,967
What was your next unholy revelation?

939
01:09:51,402 --> 01:09:54,599
You offer your poker hand
as collateral for the money.

940
01:09:55,373 --> 01:09:57,068
Pelion on Ossa. madam.

941
01:09:57,475 --> 01:10:01,172
Pelion on Ossa.
A quotation from the Greek poets.

942
01:10:01,345 --> 01:10:05,179
lt means when you pile one mountain
on top of another...

943
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,544
...one horrendous glob of flummery
on top of another.

944
01:10:09,186 --> 01:10:10,881
Now. young woman...

945
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:15,151
...you have the bile and the gall
to tell me you don't know about poker.

946
01:10:15,526 --> 01:10:19,462
All right. the joke is over.
As for me. l'm a busy man.

947
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:24,124
-You've got it all wrong. Ballinger.
-You got me all wrong. Otto Habershaw.

948
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:26,497
At compound interest.

949
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:30,038
They didn't take the trouble to tell you.
when they put you up to this...

950
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:32,368
...that C.P. Ballinger
is the kind of man...

951
01:10:32,543 --> 01:10:37,207
...who can't tolerate liquor. cards
or women. reading from left to right.

952
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,408
And l would appreciate it
if you and your fun-loving friends...

953
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,285
...would remove yourselves
from the premises.

954
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:46,381
Fleeson!

955
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:21,047
What happened? What happened?

956
01:11:38,242 --> 01:11:40,437
What happened?

957
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:54,651
Ma'am?

958
01:11:57,328 --> 01:12:00,195
Did you get the money. ma'am?

959
01:12:00,998 --> 01:12:02,932
Huh. ma'am?

960
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:12,971
lf you'd asked us. ma'am.
we'd have told you.

961
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:15,339
lf you wanna borrow money
from C.P. Ballinger...

962
01:12:15,513 --> 01:12:18,539
...you gotta at least come up
with a second mortgage.

963
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:20,308
All right. Ben. let's play cards.

964
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,911
Come on. Ben. she's out of the game.

965
01:12:27,058 --> 01:12:30,152
lf l ain't being too nosy. ma'am...

966
01:12:30,327 --> 01:12:35,560
...just what kind of collateral
did you offer Ballinger?

967
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:41,101
She asked Ballinger to lend money
on the hand she's holding.

968
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:46,570
She-- She what?

969
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:49,773
Yeah.

970
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:28,483
Hey. C.P.. how much interest would you
charge me on an inside straight?

971
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,951
Hey. me too. C.P. How about 6 percent
on a dandy little flush?

972
01:13:36,627 --> 01:13:40,063
So it was a joke. wasn't it?
l came over to see for myself.

973
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:41,994
lt was no joke.

974
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,531
Then what's so funny?

975
01:13:43,701 --> 01:13:45,498
lt ain't funny. C.P.

976
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:47,034
Don't tell me.

977
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:51,197
l told you before. l'll tell you again.
Ballinger. lt was no joke.

978
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,672
The lady meant it.

979
01:13:52,843 --> 01:13:56,404
That's what these damn fools
are laughing at. if you really wanna know.

980
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,070
lt isn't me they're laughing at?

981
01:13:58,382 --> 01:14:01,044
Hell no. C.P.

982
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:04,511
lt'd be dangerous for any man
in this room to be laughing at you.

983
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:07,179
Now. wouldn't it. C.P.?

984
01:14:09,693 --> 01:14:12,992
That it would. Dennis. that it would.

985
01:14:13,164 --> 01:14:16,133
With quarterly mortgage
payment time coming up.

986
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:19,430
-You. Sam Rhine.
-Yes. sir?

987
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:22,663
What'd l make you do before l gave you
the mortgage on your house?

988
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,831
-You made me fix the cellar.
-Correct.

989
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:30,311
Give me collateral with a solid foundation
or don't ask me for money.

990
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,448
Forty-six years ago...

991
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:39,248
...l started lending money
in Larry Bingham's backroom.

992
01:14:39,423 --> 01:14:43,883
My first customer
was a drover named Penney.

993
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:48,122
Wanted $2 on a brindled cow
at 6 percent interest.

994
01:14:48,299 --> 01:14:53,168
Said she gave 6 quarts of milk a day.
You know what l made him do?

995
01:14:53,337 --> 01:14:56,898
l made him move that cow
into my backyard for a whole week.

996
01:14:57,074 --> 01:14:59,372
And l watched him milk her every day.

997
01:14:59,543 --> 01:15:03,707
Sure enough. she gave an average
of 6 and a half quarts a day.

998
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:08,045
So l gave him the money.
at 6 and a half percent interest.

999
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:12,713
Not only that. l kept the 60 pounds
of manure she left behind.

1000
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:18,123
Show me collateral. madam.
You better make sure it's good collateral.

1001
01:15:20,898 --> 01:15:26,029
Forty-six years l've been lending money
on good old-fashioned principles.

1002
01:15:26,203 --> 01:15:30,230
And l stand here now
to tell you one and all...

1003
01:15:30,407 --> 01:15:33,467
...that l've never been offered
a better piece of collateral...

1004
01:15:33,644 --> 01:15:37,307
...than l hold in my hand
right now. Chair.

1005
01:15:47,424 --> 01:15:48,755
What did you say?

1006
01:15:48,926 --> 01:15:51,121
You heard me. Henry Drummond.

1007
01:15:51,295 --> 01:15:55,823
Keep them close to the vest. madam.
Close to your vest.

1008
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,130
Nobody sees those cards
but you and C.P. Ballinger. Sam?

1009
01:16:00,304 --> 01:16:04,070
-Yes. sir?
-Bring some chips in here. Lots of chips.

1010
01:16:04,408 --> 01:16:06,308
Yes. sir.

1011
01:16:07,278 --> 01:16:10,839
Hold this. son.
l don't like to sweat in a new hat.

1012
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:15,284
Just blues. please.

1013
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:17,647
Blues are a hundred dollars apiece.
l presume.

1014
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:20,517
Make it 55 to start with.

1015
01:16:25,896 --> 01:16:27,830
Don't go away.

1016
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:32,835
Now. how much did you say
you needed to stick. madam?

1017
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:35,868
She needs $500.

1018
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:38,909
Five hundred.

1019
01:16:39,076 --> 01:16:44,446
Four. five. Now. let's play some poker.
The good old-fashioned way.

1020
01:16:44,615 --> 01:16:47,413
Let's you and me
and the Cattle and Merchants Bank...

1021
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:50,519
...just raise the bet once again.

1022
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:52,679
You gentlemen
want to stay in the game...

1023
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:55,222
...you'll have to put in
another 5000 apiece.

1024
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:12,669
Of course. you understand there's
the usual interest charge. 7 percent.

1025
01:17:16,113 --> 01:17:18,104
Make it 6.

1026
01:17:37,001 --> 01:17:39,492
Lend a hand. sonny.

1027
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:46,067
-l've won?
-That you have. madam. That you have.

1028
01:17:47,011 --> 01:17:51,107
lf you don't mind. ma'am.
could l take a look at your cards?

1029
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:56,916
Mr. Buford.
the game is called poker.

1030
01:17:57,087 --> 01:17:59,055
The lady doesn't
have to show her hand.

1031
01:17:59,223 --> 01:18:02,351
-You ought to read the rules sometime.
-How true.

1032
01:18:02,826 --> 01:18:07,126
-Sam. cash me in. l'm going home.
-Yes. sir. Mr. Wilcox.

1033
01:18:08,165 --> 01:18:11,794
-Home?
-Yeah. home.

1034
01:18:11,969 --> 01:18:13,960
To my wife.

1035
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:17,368
Coming. Ben?

1036
01:18:28,485 --> 01:18:33,115
The Cattle and Merchants
lent you a sum total of $5500.

1037
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:38,118
At 6 percent.
that makes another $330.

1038
01:18:38,529 --> 01:18:42,295
-Now. how did you care to pay that off?
-Oh. right now. all at once.

1039
01:18:42,466 --> 01:18:44,525
That's the way to do business.

1040
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:47,397
Now. if l may escort you
to the lobby. madam...

1041
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:49,402
...we can exchange
these chips for cash.

1042
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:51,734
Oh. will it take very long?

1043
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:55,242
But one minute. madam.
Only one minute.

1044
01:18:55,412 --> 01:18:58,313
-Well. because l want to see my husband.
-Toby...

1045
01:18:58,482 --> 01:19:01,451
-...get a buggy ready.
-Right away. Mr. Ballinger.

1046
01:19:03,787 --> 01:19:05,482
Ma'am.

1047
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:17,333
lt's been a pleasure. ma'am.

1048
01:19:18,702 --> 01:19:21,398
A very great pleasure.

1049
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:54,564
Shut up.

1050
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:13,648
-To Doc Scully's you say. madam?
-Yes. and can we hurry. please?

1051
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,054
Be there in a jiffy.

1052
01:20:19,096 --> 01:20:22,691
-Let's go. sonny.
-Giddyup.

1053
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:37,910
-Henry.
-Yeah?

1054
01:20:38,081 --> 01:20:43,041
How many good women
have you met in your life?

1055
01:20:43,754 --> 01:20:46,416
l mean good women.

1056
01:20:47,758 --> 01:20:49,692
Otto?

1057
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:54,361
One.

1058
01:21:18,055 --> 01:21:20,523
Papa. Mama!

1059
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:24,652
Henry!

1060
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:26,227
How was it. Pa?

1061
01:21:26,396 --> 01:21:29,490
Welcome home. Henry.
Welcome home.

1062
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:34,626
-Mama.
-Oh. l told you he'd be back.

1063
01:21:34,805 --> 01:21:36,295
Hello there. Drummond.

1064
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:39,670
Welcome. Mr. Drummond. Dad.

1065
01:21:39,843 --> 01:21:43,370
Oh. Papa. Papa. Pa.

1066
01:21:43,547 --> 01:21:47,278
-Who won?
-You shut up.

1067
01:21:50,754 --> 01:21:52,415
What'd you do. sleep in that dress?

1068
01:21:52,589 --> 01:21:56,047
She ain't had it off since you left. Henry.
That'd be bad luck.

1069

1072
01:22:05,168 --> 01:22:09,104
-Henry. we've got a lot to do.
-You got nothing to do till l tell you.

1073
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:12,242
You. come with me.

1074
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:16,869
l said. come with me.

1075
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:20,881
Yes. Mr. Drummond. Dad.

1076
01:22:21,051 --> 01:22:23,110
Where are you going?

1077
01:22:24,121 --> 01:22:25,986
Well. what are you going to do?

1078
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:28,488
-Mama!
-Henry.

1079
01:22:30,694 --> 01:22:32,218

1080
01:22:39,803 --> 01:22:41,430
-Sit down. Arthur.
-But l--

1081
01:22:41,605 --> 01:22:44,267
-l said. sit down.
-Yes. sir.

1082
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:55,641
ls this chair all right?

1083
01:22:56,253 --> 01:22:57,948
Sir?

1084
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:12,658
Thank you. Mr. Drummond.

1085
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:17,732
How old are you. Arthur?

1086
01:23:17,908 --> 01:23:20,138
-Twenty-six. Mr. Drummond.
-Ceely's 32.

1087
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:22,972
-Oh. but l can take good care of her.
-Shut up.

1088
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:28,112
l'm talking.
Never interrupt when l'm talking.

1089
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:30,014
-What are you marrying her for?
-What?

1090
01:23:30,187 --> 01:23:33,418
Stop asking questions.
l'm asking the questions.

1091
01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:36,990
What are you marrying her for?

1092
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,754
Well. Mr. Drummond. Ceely and me.
we love each other--

1093
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,921
No. you don't.

1094
01:23:42,099 --> 01:23:44,158
You're marrying Ceely
because your old man...

1095
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:46,768
...figures it's one way
to get his hooks into my property.

1096
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:49,630
l know it. he knows it.
and you know it.

1097
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:54,343
Now then.
why is Ceely marrying you?

1098
01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:55,734
Because she love--

1099
01:23:55,912 --> 01:24:00,440
Because she's homely as a lemon
and just as sneaky as her old lady.

1100
01:24:00,617 --> 01:24:03,381
And every man sets foot
in this house needs just one look...

1101
01:24:03,553 --> 01:24:08,581
...to figure it ain't worth 40.000 acres
and a soft spot for the rest of his life.

1102
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:13,323
ls that what you were gonna say?

1103
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:19,935
-Yes. sir.
-Now you're talking sense.

1104
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:25,768
Arthur. l want you to light out
of that window right there...

1105
01:24:25,942 --> 01:24:29,742
...and shinny down the rain pipe.
and get on my horse...

1106
01:24:29,913 --> 01:24:35,442
...and get the hell and gone away from us
and your old man as far as you can get.

1107
01:24:40,857 --> 01:24:42,688
And don't waste any time. Arthur.

1108
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,928
There's a whole world
waiting for you out there.

1109
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:49,998
Good places and bad places.
Nice people and some not so nice.

1110
01:24:50,467 --> 01:24:53,493
Look them all over. Arthur.
Bide your time.

1111
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:59,438
And maybe somewhere. someplace.
you'll find a real woman.

1112
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:01,634
A good woman.

1113
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,375
Now get.

1114
01:25:11,354 --> 01:25:13,083
Why are you doing this.
Mr. Drummond?

1115
01:25:13,256 --> 01:25:16,225
Find one that will love. honor
and obey you. Arthur.

1116
01:25:16,393 --> 01:25:21,888
Find one that will comfort you
in sickness and in health.

1117
01:25:22,532 --> 01:25:25,524
-Get.
-Yes. sir.

1118
01:25:32,476 --> 01:25:34,535
Find a good one. Arthur.

1119
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:13,636
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.

1120
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:16,870
Bar was so crowded downstairs.
took me a long time to get a drink.

1121
01:27:17,047 --> 01:27:19,106
-Has the game started?
-Not yet.

1122
01:27:19,282 --> 01:27:22,410
-Ninety-four twenty.
-That's 9420 to you. C.P.

1123
01:27:22,586 --> 01:27:24,110
That's the stake and your raise.

1124
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:26,812
And one-fifth
of the net receipts. 3300.

1125
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:30,926
One-fifth of the net receipts. 3300.

1126
01:27:33,129 --> 01:27:34,824
That's 3300 to you. Ruby.

1127
01:27:39,836 --> 01:27:41,531
Thirty-three hundred to you. Doc.

1128
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:47,407
And for me. and 3300 for Jackie.

1129
01:27:48,311 --> 01:27:49,903
How about this citizen?

1130
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,139
Can l pick a crew
or can l pick a crew?

1131
01:27:52,315 --> 01:27:54,044
You can pick them. Benny.

1132
01:27:54,484 --> 01:27:55,883
Time for bed. big fella.

1133
01:27:56,419 --> 01:27:59,616
-Do l have to go to bed?
-Yeah. we gotta get up bright and early.

1134
01:27:59,789 --> 01:28:03,281
l promised your old man l'd get you back
to the carnival in time for church.

1135
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,394
Now. say good night to everybody.

1136
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:10,297
-Good night. Doc.
-Good night.

1137
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:13,230
-Good night. Ruby.
-Good night. honey.

1138
01:28:13,403 --> 01:28:15,963
-Give your mama my love.
-l will.

1139
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:18,198
Howdy-do?

1140
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:21,677
Howdy--
How do you do. how do you do?

1141
01:28:22,379 --> 01:28:25,075
l want to thank you. C.P.
for cutting me in on this deal.

1142
01:28:25,248 --> 01:28:26,715
You were Ruby's choice.

1143
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:30,578
And a very happy one. my boy.
A very happy choice indeed.

1144
01:28:30,754 --> 01:28:32,187
Yeah. well.

1145
01:28:32,355 --> 01:28:36,451
-l have just one small suggestion.
-Yeah?

1146
01:28:36,626 --> 01:28:39,527
l wouldn't show my face
around Laredo again if l were you.

1147
01:28:39,696 --> 01:28:42,597
lf any of them suspicioned
how we cheated them....

1148
01:28:43,033 --> 01:28:44,728
Cheat?

1149
01:28:45,468 --> 01:28:48,665
We didn't cheat them. we bluffed them.
That's the nature of the game.

1150
01:28:48,838 --> 01:28:50,533
l am shocked at you. C.P.

1151
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:53,198
We may have bluffed them
with a few extra trimmings...

1152
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,367
...but it was within
the spirit of the game.

1153
01:28:55,545 --> 01:28:57,945
l am horrified
that you think that we would cheat.

1154
01:28:58,114 --> 01:29:00,309
-No offense.
-That's not the point.

1155
01:29:00,483 --> 01:29:01,950
Bedtime. Jackie.

1156
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:03,415
Be seeing you.

1157
01:29:04,254 --> 01:29:06,017
What are you gonna do
with your money?

1158
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:08,157
Benny. you know Roscoe Busby?

1159
01:29:08,324 --> 01:29:10,224
Do l know Roscoe Busby?

1160
01:29:10,393 --> 01:29:14,557
Well. Roscoe come up
with a proposition....

1161
01:29:18,468 --> 01:29:20,663
When are you going back
to Laredo. C.P.?

1162
01:29:20,837 --> 01:29:22,998
Oh. tomorrow. the day after.

1163
01:29:24,674 --> 01:29:27,302
When do you go back. Joseph?

1164
01:29:27,477 --> 01:29:29,445
Who knows?

1165
01:29:36,219 --> 01:29:37,709
Doc?

1166
01:29:39,622 --> 01:29:41,590
What do you hear out there?

1167
01:29:41,758 --> 01:29:45,694
New Orleans? Chicago?

1168
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:52,700
After 40 years of fixing their chilblains
and frostbite. bellyache and pip...

1169
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:55,633
...l figure they owe me this.

1170
01:29:55,805 --> 01:29:57,705
They owe me a little vacation.

1171
01:29:57,874 --> 01:29:59,341
-Joseph.
-Yes?

1172
01:29:59,509 --> 01:30:00,942
You gave a great performance.

1173
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,650
Sweet revenge. huh. C.P.?

1174
01:30:08,818 --> 01:30:10,149
You bet it is.

1175
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,312
How many years ago they cheated you
in their real-estate deal?

1176
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,425
Sixteen years it's taken me
to get my money back.

1177
01:30:16,593 --> 01:30:19,892
But l've got it. l've got it.

1178
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:22,122
What do you intend to do
with all that money?

1179
01:30:22,298 --> 01:30:24,698
-Oh. you know. C.P.
-l do?

1180
01:30:24,868 --> 01:30:27,530
Well. we play big poker
here in Black Creek.

1181
01:30:27,704 --> 01:30:29,467
Ruby.

1182
01:30:30,907 --> 01:30:32,898
-You promised me.
-Promised what. C.P.?

1183
01:30:33,076 --> 01:30:35,738
You said if l got you a big stake
you'd give up poker.

1184
01:30:35,912 --> 01:30:38,608
l didn't say for good.
Now. you know l couldn't do that.

1185
01:30:38,782 --> 01:30:40,113
You gave me your solemn word.

1186
01:30:40,283 --> 01:30:42,478
l did not. l never did.

1187
01:30:42,652 --> 01:30:45,587
Ruby. you're lying again.

1188
01:30:46,956 --> 01:30:49,254
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby. come back here.

1189
01:30:49,425 --> 01:30:51,154
You know we talked this all over.

1190
01:30:51,327 --> 01:30:53,727
We talked. C.P.. sure.
but l never promised.

1191
01:30:53,897 --> 01:30:57,389
You did. You promised me
on your word of honor.

1192
01:30:57,567 --> 01:31:01,162
Crossed your heart and hoped you'd die
that you would never play another game.

1193
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:04,101
You weren't listening.
You weren't listening. what l said--

1194
01:31:04,274 --> 01:31:07,869
What you said was that you would never
sit in on another poker game...

1195
01:31:08,044 --> 01:31:10,877
...if you came out
with a big enough stake from Laredo.

1196
01:31:11,781 --> 01:31:13,408
Ruby--

1197
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:22,719
Ruby. listen to me.

1198
01:31:22,892 --> 01:31:25,087
Why do you want to bring on
those palpitations?

1199
01:31:25,261 --> 01:31:27,752
l'll bring on palpitations
if l feel like it.

1200
01:32:28,124 --> 01:32:30,752
-Ruby.
-Honey. a girl's gotta have some fun.

1201
01:32:30,927 --> 01:32:32,588
-Ruby. please.
-Now. C.P.

1202
01:32:32,762 --> 01:32:36,630
What am l supposed to do when you're
sitting in your big fat bank in Laredo...

1203
01:32:36,799 --> 01:32:38,994
...and l'm waiting for you
here in Black Creek?

1204
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:42,228
l'm in. boys.
l only see you once every six weeks.

1205
01:32:42,405 --> 01:32:44,134
-Hello. Steamboat.
-Hello there. Ruby.

1206
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:46,172
-Ruby.
-Quiet. C.P.

1207
01:32:50,013 --> 01:32:51,708
Let's play cards.

1208
01:33:08,498 --> 01:33:11,160
-Hello. Benny.
-Ruby.

1209
01:33:11,334 --> 01:33:13,928
-No limit poker?
-l assumed as much.

1210
01:33:14,103 --> 01:33:16,697
Western rules on betting?

1211
01:33:16,873 --> 01:33:17,999
Ante a hundred?

1212
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:20,574
That's what l like to hear. Gentlemen?

1213
01:33:25,548 --> 01:33:28,346
Doc. Doc. they're playing.

1214
01:33:28,518 --> 01:33:32,113
So am l. my boy. So am l.
