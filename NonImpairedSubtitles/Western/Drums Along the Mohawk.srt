1
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,158
Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst, take
this man to thy wedded husband

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,909
to love, honour and obey him
and forsaking all others,

3
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,316
keep only unto him,
so long as ye both shall live?

4
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,075
I will.

5
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,999
Will thou, Gilbert Martin,
take this woman to thy wedded wife

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,998
to love and honour her,
and forsaking all others,

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,509
keep thee only unto her,
so long as ye both shall live?

8
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,709
I will.

9
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,433
Let us pray.

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,112
Almighty God, look down upon
and bless these two

11
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,880
as they go forth this day
into the wilderness

12
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,640
to make for themselves
a new home.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,594
Guide them, Gracious Father,
protect and keep them

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,916
through all the trials
and vicissitudes of life,

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,432
that they never cease to remember
this hour and this pledge of love

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,710
which they have given,
one to the other

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,753
in Thy sacred sight.
Amen.

18
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,438
And now, in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,394
I pronounce you man and wife.

20
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,394
What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,393
Kiss her, my son.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,592
God bless you, Gilbert.

23
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,596
Goodbye, sir.

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,438
Goodbye, son.

25
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,234
Goodbye, Mrs...
Mother.

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,310
- Take good care of her.
- Oh, Mamchen.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,839
Goodbye.

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,750
Goodbye.

29
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,029
Sure was a nice wedding.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,468
Wasn't it?

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,154
The cow hitched easy?

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,839
Cow?

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,557
Mother, goodbye.

34
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,516
My friends, is always
been like this since Bible days.

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,113
Every generation must make
its own way in one place or another.

36
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,910
Is the most beautiful country
I've ever seen.

37
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,314
I told you so.

38
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,671
Mohawk Valley's the prettiest place
in the country, for a fact.

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,269
Susie.

40
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,429
Gin.

41
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,710
Have one, just a special
seeing is tonight.

42
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,153
You folks come far?

43
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,793
Yes. Albany.

44
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,355
Where?

45
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,915
Albany!

46
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,157
Albany.

47
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,198
Been married long?

48
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,313
Oh, not so long.

49
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,953
How long?

50
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,314
Not so long!

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,352
I thought thas what you said.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,514
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on you.

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,756
Honeymooners.

54
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,158
You got it written all over
both of you.

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,637
Honeymooners.

56
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,310
To your health, madam, sir.

57
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,390
You planning on settling here
in the valley?

58
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,031
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.

59
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,913
Deerfield? Thas pretty far
out of the way, isn't it?

60
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,515
Yes, but it suits me.

61
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,395
What political party do you folks
belong to?

62
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,835
The American.

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,473
Any Tories?

64
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,152
Not that I know of, why?

65
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,915
Nothing. I was just wondering.

66
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,795
They say the Indians will join the
British, but I guess is just talk.

67
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,879
Well, goodnight.

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,196
A queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.

69
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,996
And that patch over his eye.

70
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,318
I bet he lost it trying to see
something that wasn't his business.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,472
Goodnight.
Goodnight, ma'am.

72
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,159
Goodnight.

73
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,792
You didn't get scared at what he said
about the Tories and the Indians?

74
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,588
I wasn't even thinking
about Indians.

75
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,959
What were you thinking about?

76
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,950
I was just wondering

77
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,914
if you love me
as much as I love you.

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,755
Are there always flies like this?

79
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,357
In real woods there are.

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,715
It must be about to rain
the way these take hold.

81
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,071
You'll get used to them
up here.

82
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,510
Lana, we're home now.
Look!

83
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,397
I'll get a fire going.

84
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,079
Is just a cabin, but...

85
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,072
I've always thought id be nice
living in a cabin.

86
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,829
Is so handy to look after things
when is small.

87
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
It seems so fine to me
because I built it.

88
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,793
It must look small to a girl
who's been raised in a big house.

89
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,911
No, is all right, Gil.

90
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,989
We'll like our things
even better when we get there.

91
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,711
I'll put up the mare, we'll eat
something and feel warmer...

92
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,552
Things will look different then.

93
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,596
You better take those wet things
off. You'll be sick.

94
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,154
Gil! Gil!

95
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,035
Gil! Gil!

96
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,153
Thas only Blue Back.

97
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,113
He'll murder us!
He'll murder us, Gil!

98
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.

99
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,916
You've got to get a hold of yourself.

100
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,709
This is my wife, Blue Back.
She's kind of nervous and tired out.

101
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,753
We had a long, hard trip
and then the rain and everything.

102
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,632
Sure. Much rain.

103
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,037
She didn't expect anybody to drop in
at a time like this.

104
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,115
Me go hunting bring you
half deer. Hang outside.

105
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,753
Half deer, huh?

106
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,712
Thas mighty fine of you.

107
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
Sit down, I've got some rum.
We'll have a drink.

108
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,352
No, me go now.
Come back again, maybe.

109
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,073
Sure, anytime.

110
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,477
You're a good friend, Blue Back.

111
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,878
Sure fine friends.
Good Christian.

112
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,759
Hallelujah.

113
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,593
Lana...

114
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,678
I'm going home.

115
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,875
Home?

116
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,272
I can't stand it.

117
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,113
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.

118
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,232
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!

119
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,873
What are you saying?

120
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,595
You had no right to bring me here.
Is awful!

121
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,109
And that horrible man,
that Indian, slipping in here.

122
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,551
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.

123
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,796
He's as good a Christian
as you or me.

124
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,275
I don't care.
I'm going home!

125
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,993
No, you're not.

126
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,798
You'll stay right here
and do as I say from now on.

127
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,035
You'll get over this foolishness
and stop being scared, understand?

128
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,793
I didn't want to hit you.
I had to do it.

129
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,512
Lana, look at me.
I love you, I need you.

130
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,115
I can't live without you now.
You know that.

131
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,068
Yes.

132
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,191
Look, here's Blue Back again,
see?

133
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,595
You got a fine woman,

134
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,712
but you young man.

135
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,797
You use this on her.
Lick her good!

136
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,149
Make fine woman.

137
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,830
What are you thinking
about now?

138
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,879
Gil!

139
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,478
What are you thinking about?

140
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,235
What this place is going to look like
a couple of years from now.

141
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,639
Next summer we can start
building a barn.

142
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,115
Right on that slope, a hillside barn
like I've always wanted.

143
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,157
After that, we can think about
building a decent house.

144
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,870
I like our house just as it is now.

145
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,793
Sure. I always remember how
you ladies hanker after frame houses.

146
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,109
The place will look so beautiful
you won't care what I look like.

147
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,838
I can get blisters on my hands
and my nose peeled

148
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,270
and thas the thanks I get for it.

149
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,948
Les see those blisters
you're talking about.

150
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,759
No, now never mind.

151
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,871
Gil, let go.

152
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,712
Why, your hand is sore.

153
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,239
Maybe you oughtn't
come out here.

154
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,917
I want to.

155
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,998
But haying's hard work.
Is the hardest job there is.

156
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,909
Is no job for a woman.

157
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,678
Now, there you go.

158
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,470
Just because a woman is raised
in a town, she has to be frail.

159
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,390
I'm strong. You said you couldn't
have done it without me.

160
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,954
I sure married myself
some good hired help.

161
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,232
Stop it yourself.

162
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
Do you like me as much as
you do your old farm?

163
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,873
Hello, Gil.
Good morning, Lana.

164
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,273
Mighty pretty.

165
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,433
General Herkimer.

166
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,111
Hello, Martin.

167
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,393
This is my wife, Lana.

168
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,991
Ja, ja. Hubsch.

169
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,835
She's as pretty
as the near side of a peach.

170
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,829
Maybe prettier.

171
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,276
And Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver
and her husband.

172
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,549
I'm your nearest neighbour.

173
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,190
I've been meaning to call,
me and George and John here.

174
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,470
How do?

175
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,999
I'm so glad to meet you.

176
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,355
This is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall,
and her daughter, Martha Ellen.

177
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,118
This is my oldest girl, Mary.

178
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,469
Hello, Mary.

179
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,519
And Mrs. Demooth.

180
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,358
My husband is the Captain.

181
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,072
How do you do?

182
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,190
How do you do?

183
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,355
And Dr. Petry.

184
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,152
How do, Mrs. Martin.

185
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,876
Oh, I'll pass the lot of them.

186
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,999
- Fall in. Outside.
- All right, men.

187
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,269
Hep, hep, hep, hep,

188
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,229
hep, hep, hep, hep.

189
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,517
Don't be afraid of these women.
They're good neighbours,

190
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,475
once they get over being mad
at you for being pretty.

191
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,159
Don't be so silly.

192
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,033
That bonnet you've got on
is giving them a lot of worry.

193
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,392
And they're dying to shoo us off
so they can find out

194
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,875
- if you've a family on the way.
- Nicholas!

195
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,832
We weren't going to tell anybody.

196
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,873
Thas just fine.

197
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,954
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thas just fine, a baby.

198
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,072
I don't believe in young folks
waiting, I always say

199
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,670
a man needs help on his place
and the only way to get it

200
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,996
is to have children,
especially boys.

201
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,555
Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.

202
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,397
- Attention. Fall in.
- Fall in what?

203
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,269
Attention!
Dress to the right!

204
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,632
Thas my husband.

205
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,954
Call the roll.

206
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,034
- Amos Brock.
- Here.

207
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,239
- John Weaver.
- Here.

208
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,232
- George Weaver.
- Here.

209
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,470
Gilbert Martin.

210
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,429
Here.

211
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,069
Christian Reall.
Christian Reall.

212
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,519
Christian...

213
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,280
Thas me.
Here.

214
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,950
Adam Hartman.

215
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,871
Here.

216
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,397
James McNod.
James McNod.

217
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,797
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,877
Then I've got to fine him.
Thas the law.

219
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,675
You don't have any right to fine
a man for not coming, if he can't.

220
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,275
I thought thas what
this war was about.

221
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,358
People paying taxes when they
didn't have no say-so about it.

222
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,910
Thas right. Thas what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.

223
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,310
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the General.

224
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,352
We can let that go this time.
Thas enough of the roll call, too.

225
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,228
You can check up later.

226
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,678
Stand at ease, men.

227
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,159
Neighbours,
ever since New York

228
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,670
and the 12 colonies signed
the Declaration of Independence,

229
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,189
this Revolution has turned
into a real war.

230
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,748
So far, we've been lucky
here in the Mohawk,

231
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,952
but it looks like we are going
to be dragged into it too,

232
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,197
sure as shooting.
Thas why I got you here,

233
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,994
to get ready,
no matter what happens.

234
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,873
I guess we all feel the same way
about it.

235
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,398
This is our home and land
and I say is worth fighting for.

236
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,237
Only we got to do it by ourselves.
Congress can't help us.

237
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,674
They say Washington needs
all the troops he can get

238
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,599
and that the frontier will have to
look out for itself.

239
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,993
Maybe them soldiers don't like
the liquor we drink up here, huh?

240
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,789
Adam!

241
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,355
Maybe not,
but thas what they say.

242
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,679
Now about the Indians.
From all I hear,

243
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,917
the Tories are making them
a lot of big promises.

244
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,398
We got our agents working, too.
We can't tell which way they'll go.

245
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,229
We'll have no trouble with them.
We've always treated them fair.

246
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,348
Maybe, but just the same if you hear
the bell ringing at the fort

247
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,314
or the cannon go off, you drop
everything and come running.

248
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,149
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.

249
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,592
Else I'll have you flogged so fast
you won't know what.

250
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,793
Now, come on, show the women
how good you can drill.

251
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,717
Take them around the field,
Captain.

252
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,756
- Attention.
- Nice talk, Nicholas.

253
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,392
Carry arms!
Squads left, march!

254
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,071
I bet we can lick the whole world,
the way we march.

255
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,469
Ezra! Help us over here.

256
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,156
Put them right on top.

257
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,276
Come on, come on.
Now she's going good.

258
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,552
Is the core rotten, Adam?

259
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,875
Yeah.

260
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,675
Let it fall right down in there.

261
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,233
This'll make a nice patch for wheat.
There's good soil here.

262
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,995
I figure the loam's close
to four feet.

263
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,388
I bet there isn't better soil
in the whole valley.

264
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,636
You're just a natural born farmer,
ain't you?

265
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,796
So would you be,
if you'd marry and settle down.

266
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,958
There she goes! There she goes!

267
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,672
Thas going to be good fire wood.

268
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,874
Here goes!

269
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,033
Start her even, Cleave!

270
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,116
Push her in, Gil!

271
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,038
Push her in there.

272
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,072
Pull them straight.

273
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,157
You brought a lot of pretty
things with you, Mrs. Martin.

274
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,236
Heavenly.

275
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,750
I told Mother there was no sense
bringing a lot of clothes.

276
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,712
I'd rather spend the money
on furniture.

277
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,512
I see you've got
one of these feathers.

278
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,359
Yes. Mother had five of them
at home.

279
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,117
She said there are times when that
could be more important than bread.

280
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,595
What is it?

281
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,035
A pheasans feather.

282
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,637
It looks like an angel's wing.

283
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,150
We had a lot of them. They collected
so much dust we threw them out.

284
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,716
Yeah.

285
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,793
This is a nice teapot.
Is it a Wedgewood?

286
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,271
I don't know.
Is just white china, I guess.

287
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,799
It belonged to my grandmother.

288
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,877
We always ate off Wedgewood
at home.

289
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,078
Come out, they've started
burning already.

290
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,111
Great burning,
started it myself.

291
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,031
Les go see the burning,
come on.

292
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,029
Gil, is going to be beautiful.

293
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,313
Is Blue Back.

294
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,510
Indians on warpath.
Coming.

295
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,595
Eight white men.
100 Indians.

296
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,191
Painted.
Better hurry.

297
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,591
Johnny Weaver, get your horse
and tell General Herkimer.

298
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,150
- Stop it!
- Get the horse.

299
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,670
Take this.

300
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,950
Thanks, Joe.
Adam, watch out for Lana.

301
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,797
Come on.

302
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,516
Indians! One, two, three, four,
two, three, four, one...

303
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,792
Come on, Christian.
They're all here.

304
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,115
Get in your wagon.

305
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,639
Here.

306
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,070
Gil, the cow.
Aren't we going to take her?

307
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,350
We can't. She'll just slow us up.

308
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,479
I can't stand it. Is like leaving
part of ourselves.

309
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,999
Don't look back.

310
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,794
Hurry up, Gil.

311
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,070
Hey! Come on, Gil.

312
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,869
Mr. Martin!
Mr. Martin!

313
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,074
Come on, Mary.

314
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,632
Wait a minute.

315
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,114
Where's the rest of your family?

316
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,673
I don't know. I lost them.

317
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,752
Come on. Hurry up.

318
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,469
All right.

319
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,871
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get them in, Christian.

320
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,517
Come on, Trudy.
You help, Mary.

321
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,912
- Where's Nancy?
- Here she is.

322
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,553
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.

323
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,318
We've got to throw some of
this furniture out.

324
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,236
Oh, no, Gil.

325
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,793
We've got to.

326
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,913
We're ready, Gil.

327
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,318
I told you not to look back.

328
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,352
Keep up there!
Keep up there!

329
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,753
Mr. Martin!

330
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,275
You got her?

331
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,233
Gil, whas happened?
Oh, Mary Johnson.

332
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,874
Shut up.
Come on!

333
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,992
She was driving
and all of a sudden she fainted.

334
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,430
Never mind.
There, put her down.

335
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,430
- Get out of here.
- I won't. My husbanïs the captain.

336
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,312
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No, they'll kill me.

337
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,318
Get some water and blankets
and tell the doctor to hurry.

338
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,953
I don't understand this.

339
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,832
Never mind, she'll be all right.

340
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,758
- Whas the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.

341
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,995
Is my wife, she fainted.

342
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,714
I can't say I blame her,
all this racket.

343
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,838
Gil. Gil Martin.
They're waiting for you.

344
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,598
The company's ready to go.

345
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,991
What is it?

346
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,272
There's nothing you can do.
Go on, get out of here.

347
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,069
How is she, Gil?

348
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,156
I don't know.

349
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,078
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,589
Drummer boy, play the drum.

351
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,871
Men, follow me!

352
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,872
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?

353
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,868
No. We chased them seven,
eight miles, but they got away.

354
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,556
What happened?

355
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,069
The excitement and all the jolting
was too much,

356
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,072
but don't fret too much, you're both
young. You'll have another baby.

357
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,317
She's all right now.
Just tired.

358
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,109
But don't let her talk too much.

359
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,113
Lana.

360
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,114
Gil.

361
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,198
Lana, darling.

362
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,477
Gil, our house?

363
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,198
They burned it.

364
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,397
The crops?

365
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,068
Everything.
I saw it coming back.

366
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,633
Oh, and now...

367
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,678
Please don't, Lana.

368
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,078
I failed you.

369
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,231
No, Lana. It wasn't your fault.

370
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,073
It just happens that way sometimes.

371
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,397
My poor Gil.

372
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,513
Oh, Lana.

373
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,554
You're all right,
thas all I care about.

374
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,676
It seems impossible that people can
work as hard as we did for nothing.

375
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,116
We can build it back again.
We still have the land.

376
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,710
You think I'd let you come back
and go through all that again?

377
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,752
You were right that first night.

378
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,032
You shoulïve gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.

379
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,959
I shouldn't have brought you here
in the first place.

380
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,477
This is no place for you,
is no place for any woman.

381
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm not the only woman
who's gone through this.

382
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,079
What will we do?
How will we live?

383
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,274
Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's
hired man ran off

384
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,711
and she's looking for a couple
to work her place.

385
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,869
But, Lana, you can't hire out,
a girl like you. Do you think...?

386
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,430
It wouldn't have to be for long.

387
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,074
Just until we made enough
to come back here.

388
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,271
Lana, you can't do it.

389
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,994
It won't do any harm
just to talk it over with her.

390
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,273
No!
Hired help. No!

391
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,191
Mrs. McKlennar!

392
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,234
Good morning.

393
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,915
Your name Martin?

394
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,715
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,157
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.

396
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,150
That hired man got drunk and ran off,
he left me with everything to do.

397
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,195
I don't mind a man drinking,
if he knows how to hold it.

398
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,038
When it fixes him so he can't do
his work, he'd better go elsewhere.

399
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,357
Don't stand there with
your mouths open. Sit down.

400
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,034
Les get down to business.
You know how to farm?

401
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,629
I had my own place.

402
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,470
Yes, I heard it was burned.
Thas too bad,

403
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,037
but thas neither here nor there.
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.

404
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,199
I could eat a horse.
I don't do much farming here,

405
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,157
just take care of the meadow
and feed my stock,

406
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,839
but you can do what you like.

407
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,955
I'm a widow. My husband
was Captain Barnabas McKlennar.

408
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,830
Barney, Barney.

409
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,998
What was I saying?
I was brought up on army life,

410
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.

411
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,072
If I take your pay,
I'll do my best.

412
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,714
I just don't want you coming
afterwards complaining.

413
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,753
How much do you want?

414
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,474
I never worked for anybody else.
What do you pay?

415
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,035
45 pounds a year.
Your house, wood and food.

416
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,435
If your wife can sew,
I'll pay her, too.

417
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,312
Can you sew?
Whas your name?

418
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,589
Lana.

419
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,358
Can you sew?

420
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,390
Speak up!
You want to sew for me?

421
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,669
Yes, I'd like to.

422
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,269
Let me see your hands.

423
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,598
Thas settled.
I hate sewing myself.

424
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,588
Hate any housework, so I do the barn
and let Daisy do the cooking.

425
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,792
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.

426
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,117
I've got a long face,
and I poke it where I please.

427
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,992
You may think I'm a nuisance.

428
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,275
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,357
What? Whad he say?

430
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,317
I didn't mean it, but I guess
if you do poke, I'll think so.

431
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,393
Your thoughts are your own property,
but keep them to yourself.

432
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,116
Come on, you'll want to see
your new home.

433
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
Use the back door if you want
to ask me anything.

434
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,959
I don't want mud tracked in my house.
I track enough myself.

435
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,514
Is a mess now,
after that man,

436
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,915
but is a good house.

437
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,155
It sure is, ma'am.

438
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,318
Nice chimney.
Nice bedroom upstairs.

439
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,475
I used to live here,

440
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,629
until Barnabas decided to build
that stone place.

441
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,833
Is a beautiful house.

442
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,072
Glad you can see it. There's one more
thing I want to ask you.

443
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,951
Any furniture?

444
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,875
We have a bed and a few things.

445
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,752
I'll help you out with the rest.

446
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,554
You can consider the job
yours, Martin.

447
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,430
Now, any questions you want to ask?

448
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,639
Yes, ma'am.
I just...

449
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,074
Well, what?

450
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,475
Do you belong to the right party?

451
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,231
Right party! A woman
hasn't got any political opinions.

452
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,557
I run this farm to suit myself.
I'll shoot anybody,

453
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,469
British, Indian or American,
who interferes in my business.

454
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,752
That satisfy you?
When can you move in?

455
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,196
Will tomorrow be too soon?

456
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,311
Tomorrow?
Whas the matter with today?

457
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,748
We'll move in today.

458
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,552
Good! Good!

459
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,829
Oh, Lana.

460
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,838
Oh, Gil.

461
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,397
Is a beautiful fireplace.

462
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,235
Oh, Almighty God,
hear us, we beseech Thee,

463
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,080
and bring succour and guidance

464
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,239
to those we're about to bring
to Thy divine notice.

465
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,991
First, we're thinking
of Mary Wollaber.

466
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,388
She's just 16 years old,

467
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,876
but she's keeping company
with a soldier from Fort Dayton.

468
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,320
He's a Massachusetts man, O Lord

469
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,988
and Thou knowest no good
can come of that.

470
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,432
Hallelujah.

471
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,549
Now, we're thinking of the sick
and infirm.

472
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,755
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.

473
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,395
His Uncle Isaac,
who keeps a store in Dayton

474
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,830
asks for our prayers

475
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,554
and he says that he has got in
a new supply of calicos,

476
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,513
French broadcloths,
fancy handkerchiefs,

477
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,077
new hats and heavy boots
all at bargain prices.

478
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,110
But most of all, we call upon Thee,
Lord Jehovah,

479
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,550
O, God of Battles,

480
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,315
to aid Thy people
against the Tories,

481
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,117
for I have disturbing news for you
that will sorrow this Sabbath.

482
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,630
General Washington has advised us
that an enemy army

483
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,992
of many Tories and savage Indians

484
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,196
is even now on its way
to our beloved valley.

485
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,155
Every man capable of bearing arms
between the ages of 16 and 60

486
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,915
will report tomorrow morning
to General Herkimer,

487
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,835
at which time a regiment
of Washington's Continental Army

488
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,835
will arrive from Albany, under
Colonel Fischer, to help us.

489
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,195
Any man failing to report for duty
will be promptly hanged.

490
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,310
Amen.

491
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,836
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar
and do what she says.

492
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,794
Yes, Gil.

493
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,116
I'd better go now.

494
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,030
Watch out for those new apple trees.

495
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,355
Gil!

496
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,554
Thank you, ma'am.

497
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,797
It used to be Barney's,
but is no use to me now.

498
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,396
It might come in handy to you.

499
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,318
Gil Martin, I'm going to kiss you,
so I'd better do it now,

500
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,875
so you won't go off
with the taste of a widow.

501
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,911
Many is the time I've seen Barney
go off just that same way.

502
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,154
Goodbye.
He's off.

503
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,473
Sometimes he'd wave, but ten to one
he wasn't even seeing me.

504
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,548
He was thinking about all those men,
you see,

505
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,355
all those men going out to fight,
to kill or be killed.

506
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,588
Blast his eyes, loving it.

507
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,439
They sent you over here to tell us
to come inside the fort?

508
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,038
"Is orders."Women and children shall
be gathered together"."

509
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,834
Me and other men over 60
are to collect and protect them.

510
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,392
You old rooster! Don't you think
I can look after myself?

511
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,750
Yes, ma'am, but is orders.

512
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,393
I've been saving a corner shed
for you.

513
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,835
Shed!

514
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,158
Do you think I'd start living
in a shed at my time of life,

515
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,349
like a cow?

516
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,516
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am.

517
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,599
Go on and spit, man.
Spit and get it over with.

518
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,912
Hey! Not there, outside.
Go on, get out of here.

519
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,313
Old fool, he can't even spit
by himself.

520
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,670
Waiting, waiting.
Thas all we women do.

521
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,432
Well, no news is good news.

522
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,671
Why don't you sit down, Lana?

523
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,392
Mosquitoes.

524
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,117
Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Wake up!

525
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,392
Come on out!
Here they come!

526
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,519
Where's John?

527
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,277
Have you seen Gil Martin?

528
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,079
Gil!

529
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,392
Take them inside. Go in.
Anyone else there. Go in.

530
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,796
Have you seen Gil Martin?

531
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,512
I'm Robert Johnson, surgeon pro tem
of the First Regiment.

532
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,792
Then don't stand there yapping.
Go on in and see the General.

533
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,149
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,158
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?

535
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,874
Gil!

536
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,108
Gil!

537
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,759
Gi...

538
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,716
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.
There's nobody back of me alive.

539
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,519
No.

540
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,752
General Herkimer, a fine mess
you've got yourself into this time.

541
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,839
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.

542
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,429
Shut up! You're not giving
orders in this house.

543
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,759
What about it?

544
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,720
Is already mortified, ma'am.

545
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,077
Ill have to come off.

546
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,234
Ja, bitte?

547
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,238
Ja, Nicholas.

548
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,229
Wait till I light my pipe.

549
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,119
John!

550
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,359
Tell me something first, Doctor.

551
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,914
Did you ever cut off a leg before?

552
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,958
- Why, no, sir. I...
- Well, don't be ashamed.

553
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,469
A man has got to start somewhere.

554
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,796
I'll never forget the first deer
I shot.

555
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,558
Gil! Gil!

556
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,469
Lana!

557
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,317
Lana!

558
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,115
Gil. Oh, thank God.

559
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,755
Is so cold here,
colder here than in the woods.

560
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,318
Raining, lying there.

561
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,355
I remember thinking how
hot it was, wondering...

562
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,119
I'm cold.

563
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,189
Wondering how long we'd be away,
when it happened.

564
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,350
I heard a crack...

565
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,959
Daisy, some water.

566
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,991
...like a stick breaking

567
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,593
and all of a sudden the fellow
next to me stopped talking

568
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,677
and fell over on his side.

569
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,439
Then I heard a whistle,
shots from everywhere.

570
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,069
Somebody shouted
we'd been ambushed.

571
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,037
I saw General Herkimer slide
off his horse and grab his knee.

572
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,638
Peter Tenyck with his head
blown half off.

573
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,551
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.

574
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,717
Somebody told me to lay down
and then I saw them

575
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,988
all smeared with paint,
yellow and red,

576
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,559
every colour.

577
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,348
Oh, darling. I'm sorry.

578
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,074
And back of them, Tories
with green coats.

579
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,113
I got down behind a log
and aimed at a fellow.

580
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,317
He leaped straight up in the air.

581
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,709
Don't talk about it.

582
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,990
Fell forward on his face.

583
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,638
After that, we just kept shooting
as fast as we could load

584
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,397
for I don't know how long.

585
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,110
Amos, Adam Hartman came over
beside me.

586
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,794
His musket was broke,

587
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,039
but he had a spear.
He kept grinning.

588
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,914
I remember thinking,

589
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,749
he's having a good time,
he likes this.

590
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,069
Soon he pointed off. I saw
an Indian coming towards us, naked.

591
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,475
I tried to load,
but it was too late.

592
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,390
Adam stood up and braced his spear,
and the Indian came down.

593
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,358
I never saw a fellow look so funny,
so surprised.

594
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,437
He just hung there,
with his mouth open.

595
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,079
Looking at us
and not saying a word.

596
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,758
I had to shoot him,
there wasn't anything else to do.

597
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,036
I had to.

598
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,108
Brandy, Nicholas?

599
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,038
Ja, ja.

600
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,030
Swallow, swallow.

601
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,033
Now, Nicholas.

602
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,234
Go ahead.

603
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,557
Then it started to rain
and I was sick.

604
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,436
All the time, General Herkimer sat
there smoking and holding his knee.

605
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,710
Then he said we'd all better go home.

606
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,070
Darling, don't talk about it.

607
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,430
Out of 600 of us,
about 240 were still alive.

608
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,472
But we'd won.
We licked them.

609
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,954
Yes, darling.

610
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,797
We showed them
they couldn't take this valley.

611
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,479
Yes, darling.

612
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,596
Lana, do you hear?
We won.

613
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,870
Yes, darling.
You won.

614
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,878
Now, you've got to sleep.
You...

615
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,355
Adam, help me get him down.

616
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,799
Get that pack there.

617
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,639
Yes. Here.

618
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,313
Sleep, darling.

619
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,798
You sleep.

620
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,353
Lana.

621
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,239
Lana.

622
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,113
Oh, Gil.

623
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,634
I feel as if I've been asleep
forever.

624
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,318
You needed it.

625
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,269
I've been lying here looking at you,
thinking how pretty you are.

626
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,754
Darling.

627
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,352
It made me think of the first days
we had together at Deerfield.

628
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,914
I've been thinking about that, too.
The things we'd planned.

629
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,118
While I was out there,

630
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,356
I kept thinking about you
all the time.

631
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,355
About how good ill be when
is all over and we can go home.

632
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,951
Gil, the Indians,

633
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,469
they won't be coming back
this way again, will they?

634
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,309
I don't reckon so, after the licking
we gave them. Why?

635
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,829
We're going to have another baby.

636
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,352
Are you glad, Lana?

637
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,038
I feel as...

638
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,076
I feel as though I've begun
to live all over again.

639
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,232
Are you hungry?

640
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,037
Doctor, how's General Herkimer?

641
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,035
The General is dead.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.

642
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,552
I am the resurrection
and the life, saith the Lord.

643
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,113
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

644
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,311
yet shall he live.

645
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,553
And whosoever liveth
and believeth...

646
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,794
I know my Redeemer liveth,

647
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,232
and He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

648
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:33,272
And though after my skin,
worms destroy this body

649
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,676
yet in my flesh I shall see God.

650
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,716
Come on, don't stop.

651
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,992
You know what Doc Petry said
about having plenty of hot water.

652
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,471
I know, but the water's boiled away
twice and nothing's happened.

653
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,673
I don't know why we need so much
hot water when babies are born.

654
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,589
Mr. Martin!
Mrs. McKlennar wants you at once.

655
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,033
Gil, one of Barney's soldiers
made this cradle,

656
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,639
gave it me the night
we were married.

657
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,671
You and Lana
might as well have it.

658
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,829
Is mighty kind of you.

659
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,675
Nonsense.
What good is it to me?

660
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,952
Can't ever tell,
a good looking widow like you.

661
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,914
Shut up, you make me sick.

662
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,152
Great big good-for-nothing,
loud mouthed fool.

663
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,032
Even if you are good looking.

664
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,952
Get out of my way!

665
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,994
Poor Gil.

666
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,911
Not yet boys, not yet.

667
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,436
Is the waiting around that...

668
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,436
Not knowing whas going on.

669
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,032
Why can't Dr. Petry do something?
Why can't he?

670
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,878
I don't know, Gil.

671
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,277
Blue Back, you've had experience.
What do you think?

672
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,440
Having babies,
thas woman's business.

673
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,599
She better go far, far,
by herself.

674
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,995
Leave husband alone.

675
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,075
Daisy!

676
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,317
Hurry with those things.

677
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,835
This is terrible.

678
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,352
Gil Martin, get some hot water quick!

679
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,751
Thas all right.
Thas all right.

680
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,353
George Weaver, you keep away
from that spring house.

681
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,676
I'll get some more wood.

682
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,590
Is a boy.
Praise be to the Lord!

683
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,192
A boy! Gil!
Gil!

684
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,396
Is a...

685
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,391
- Is a boy.
- Is a boy.

686
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,558
Is a boy. Joe, we've got a boy!

687
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,519
Hallelujah.

688
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,198
Christian, is a boy.

689
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,791
We've got a baby boy.

690
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,597
What?

691
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,199
A baby boy.

692
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,196
A boy?

693
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:02,957
Yes.

694
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,149
A baby boy?

695
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,190
Sure.

696
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,632
To think at my age, another son.

697
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,639
Get some brandy.

698
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,511
Brandy! For a little...

699
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,676
No. For you.

700
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,319
Go on in.

701
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,759
Is she all right?

702
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,439
Fit as a fiddle.

703
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,229
Who does he look like?

704
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,119
He's going to faint.

705
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,193
Oh, Lana, never again.

706
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,159
Gil,

707
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,477
I prayed so hard it would be boy.

708
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,475
Take him in your arms,
just for a moment.

709
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,073
Go ahead.

710
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,313
Doggone.

711
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,670
We'II, I'll be doggoned.

712
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,592
Come on, everybody,
the dance is starting.

713
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,355
I bet Barney never kissed you
like that.

714
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,355
Barney McKlenner was a real man.
When he kissed, you stayed kissed.

715
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,357
Les see if he taught you
how to hold your liquor.

716
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,835
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.

717
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,750
Hooray! To the greatest crop
in the Mohawk Valley,

718
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,270
and the man who's responsible for it,
Gil Martin.

719
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,989
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.

720
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,668
May they always be as happy
as they are tonight.

721
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,876
Please God, please let it go on
like this forever.

722
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,399
Come on, Gilly.

723
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,191
You're going to help Mama
find some nice wild honey.

724
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,319
Ups-a-daisy. Come on.

725
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,912
Here we go.

726
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,916
That you, Daisy?
Go away.

727
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,830
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

728
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,110
What do you mean coming
in my house?

729
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,039
Burn house, fire quick.

730
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,676
Don't you dare.
You filthy drunken rascals!

731
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,870
Get out of here quick
before I skin you alive.

732
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,196
Get out of here.
What are you doing?

733
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,029
My bed! You crazy horse thieves.

734
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,959
If I could get my hands
on a butcher knife.

735
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,158
Daisy! Lana! Gil!

736
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,430
My bed!
Take your hands off that bed.

737
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,993
You go quick!
You catch fire!

738
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,794
I won't move a step without my bed.

739
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,753
My husband bought this
the day after I was married.

740
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,274
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here.

741
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,159
Get this bed out of here.

742
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,998
Sure.

743
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,792
Hurry up, quick!

744
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,675
Hurry up, you fools. I'll have
your ears lopped off for this.

745
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,434
Put it up!

746
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,995
Turn it upside down.
Now, turn it up.

747
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,269
You fools!

748
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,596
Mrs. McKlennar!
Mrs. Mc...

749
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,155
Mrs. McKlennar, what are you doing?

750
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,108
Go away!

751
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,515
My husband built this house.
I've lived in it all my life

752
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,756
and I'm not going to leave it.

753
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,313
Gil!

754
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,028
Go away!

755
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,791
Listen, you can't...

756
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,194
Lana!

757
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,073
Gil!

758
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,315
Go away and leave me alone.

759
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,080
Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Gil!

760
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,958
Gil! Lana! Andrusville has
been wiped out.

761
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,390
There's over a thousand headed
this way under Caldwell.

762
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,874
You've got to get to the fort.

763
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,951
I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived...

764
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,832
Come on, Sarah.

765
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,713
Leave me alone!

766
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,835
Oh, Almighty God,

767
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,432
by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines

768
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,071
hip and thigh with great slaughter,

769
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,912
help Thy people now gird up
their loins for the coming battle.

770
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,715
Put courage in our hearts, Lord,

771
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,677
that we may drive our enemies
back into the wilderness.

772
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,669
For we all know only too well
what will happen to us

773
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,279
if these Sons of Belial
ever get over these walls,

774
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,392
or come in through that gate

775
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,396
which, with Thy permission, Lord,
I now order closed.

776
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,595
Amen.

777
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,034
Close the gate.

778
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,715
Tether all the animals
or drive them out!

779
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,473
You women and children,
go into the church.

780
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,874
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

781
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,074
If you can't get your hair
into those hats, cut it off!

782
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,590
It won't do you any good if those
greasy devils get in here.

783
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,750
Daisy! Daisy!

784
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:55,393
Now, sing, children,
sing, in praise of the Lord!

785
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,989
Woman!

786
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,469
Brother Reall,
put down that Devil's brew.

787
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,829
I was trying to get rid of it,
so them heathens wouldn't get it.

788
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,073
Beware of the heathen within
thine own breast. Cast it away!

789
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,039
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah.

790
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,112
Do you think they'll attack tonight?

791
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,356
With Caldwell leading them,
they will.

792
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,595
Whas that?

793
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,279
Thas them.

794
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,829
Alarm.

795
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,149
There goes our barn,
off to the right of those trees.

796
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,270
There goes my place.

797
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,469
No, thas Ritter's.

798
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,159
Then mine's next to it.

799
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,317
Hold your fire. Save your ammunition.
They're trying to draw us out.

800
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,590
Back to your place.
Martin is right.

801
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,349
Trust in the Lord and wait until
you can make every shot count.

802
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,953
You filthy, painted heathens.

803
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,357
Consume them, Lord,
as Thou didst thine enemies

804
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,391
in the days of Jeremiah.

805
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,719
Gil! Adam, come on!
Here they come!

806
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,876
Ready with those rifles, women.

807
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,274
God have mercy on his soul.

808
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,516
I must be shooting a little
to the left.

809
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,758
Here you are, George.
Loaded!

810
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,511
Now shoot the breeches off them,
if they're wearing any.

811
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,948
Daisy, come on.

812
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,235
Loaded.

813
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,754
Clean shot.

814
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,233
Get to the gate.

815
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,272
Call the filthy beggars back.
We'll wait till the moon sets.

816
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,997
Oh, Barney, if you were only here,
we'd show them.

817
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,472
We'd show...

818
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,116
Hold me up.
I can't breathe lying down.

819
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,193
Lana, come beside me.

820
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,318
Give me your hand.

821
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,919
Now, now, don't start tuning up.

822
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:06,231
I want you and Gil
to have my place, everything.

823
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:10,552
You've been like my own
flesh and blood.

824
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,154
Look under the front porch.

825
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,239
I buried some gold pieces there,
just in case.

826
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,272
Divide it up among
the lot of you.

827
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,834
Gil.

828
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,478
Goodbye, good looking.

829
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,194
Barney.

830
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,313
Barney!

831
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:05,229
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

832
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,068
Amen.

833
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,758
How's the ammunition, Parson?

834
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,913
Mighty low.

835
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,433
Ammunition's mighty low, O Lord.

836
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,239
I go Fort Dayton for help.

837
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,317
Thas a job for me, Joe.

838
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,954
I know every foot of the way,
if anybody can, I can.

839
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,354
Joe!

840
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,029
Joe.

841
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,592
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.

842
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,591
Oneida trail, huh, Joe?

843
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,073
Good luck, Joe.

844
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,399
He got away.

845
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,914
Listen.

846
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,833
Adam!

847
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,751
Thas shooting, Adam.

848
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,952
You filthy murdering,
thieving...

849
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:45,511
God, our merciful Father,
forgive me for what I'm about to do.

850
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,954
Amen.

851
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,310
Get away, I'm all right.

852
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,872
Gil, what about...
Somebody's...

853
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,633
I'm going, Parson.

854
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,433
Good luck, Gil.

855
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,959
Joe, did he...?

856
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,879
He did not.

857
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,557
I'm going to try it myself, Lana.

858
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,830
If I make the woods,
I can outrun them.

859
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,073
They'll kill you.

860
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,960
You're not going to be afraid.
You're not going to be afraid.

861
01:26:59,160 --> 01:26:59,592
They'll kill you.

862
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,279
No, they won't.
If I can get in the clear,

863
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,040
there isn't an Indian living
that can catch me.

864
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,430
Say you're not afraid
and you want me to go.

865
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,838
Lana.

866
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,069
I'm not afraid,
I want you to go.

867
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,077
Lana, he got away.

868
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,869
Les start.

869
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,036
Any sign of them yet?

870
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,871
Blue Back says is quiet,
too quiet out there.

871
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,559
Quiet, Chief.

872
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:16,478
He left before sunrise.
Is almost 12 now.

873
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,916
If he reached Fort Dayton,
help would be here by now.

874
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,751
Parson!
They're over the wall!

875
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,837
Every man to his post.

876
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,038
Have you seen Lana?

877
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,592
No, I ain't Gil.

878
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,676
Parson, have you seen Lana?

879
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,315
I killed a man.

880
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,269
Lana!

881
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,232
Lana!

882
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,954
Is me. Is Gil.

883
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,953
Where's Caldwell?

884
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,157
Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?

885
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,279
Squad left, mark!

886
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,716
Company halt!
Order arms!

887
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,948
At ease!

888
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,752
- Where are you men going?
- Home.

889
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,110
- Home?
- The war's over.

890
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,517
Cornwallis surrendered
to Washington last week.

891
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:50,119
So thas our new flag,
the thing we've been fighting for.

892
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,989
13 stripes for the colonies,

893
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:55,760
and 13 stars in a circle
for the Union.

894
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,591
Is a pretty flag, isn't it?

895
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,712
Soldier, let me take that flag.

896
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,309
We did a little fighting
around here ourselves.

897
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,393
I reckon we better be getting back
to work.

898
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,309
There's going to be a heap
to do from now on.

899
01:38:41,920 --> 01:40:38,309
