00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,607
NARRATOR:
At the forks of the Ohio
stands an American city,

2
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,073
a colossus of steel,

3
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,315
whose mills and furnaces
bring forth bone and sinew
for a nation.

4
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,220
Not so long ago

5
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,794
a lonely outpost
guarded this very spot.

6
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,593
It was called Fort Pitt.

7
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,233
It stood at the edge
of an unknown land,

8
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,662
one of a line of forts

9
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,700
that ran from Virginia
to the Great Lakes,

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,775
marking the end of the known

11
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,339
and the beginning
of the unknown.

12
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,681
Civilization was east
of the Allegheny Mountains.

13
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,145
Conquest, opportunity
and death

14
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,422
lay to the west.

15
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,525
All around Fort Pitt
was a vast forest,

16
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,729
always beautiful,
always dangerous.

17
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,268
Men came into it
seeking many things.

18
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,397
Some for wealth,
some for refuge

19
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,904
some for freedom.

20
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,270
But to the Indian,
all men came as invaders.

21
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,912
Wars for survival
between red men and white

22
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,214
threatened to sweep away
these little forts.

23
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,021
Yet men kept coming west.

24
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,987
Some to build
their own fortunes,

25
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,131
even at the price
of Indian wars.

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,861
Others to build a nation,

27
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,833
even at the price
of their own lives.

28
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,302
These are the unconquered,

29
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,103
who push ever forward
the frontiers
of man's freedom.

30
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:39,084
But history sometimes chooses
its heroes and heroines
from strange places.

31
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:44,655
For one, the hope of freedom
was born at Old Bailey
in London,

32
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,123
in the year 1763.

33
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,251
(RAIN PATTERING)
Prisoner at the bar.

34
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,729
You have been found guilty
of the most heinous crime,
of murder.

35
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,397
It is my duty to pass
upon you the sentence

36
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,538
which the law enjoins.

37
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,786
Abigail Martha Hale,

38
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,952
the sentence of
this court is...
My lord.

39
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,190
Woman, be still.
My lord, hear me.

40
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,296
My brother was ill of fever
when the press-gang
broke in to take him.

41
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,735
I helped him fight to be free.

42
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,832
In that fight,
an impressing officer of
the Royal Navy was killed.

43
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,537
My brother was killed too,
my lord.

44
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,179
The prisoner is here
to receive sentence.

45
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,985
The sentence of this court is

46
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,154
that you be taken from
this place to a lawful prison

47
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,821
and thence to a place
of execution.

48
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,590
And that you there
be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

49
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,170
And may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.

50
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,095
Come.

51
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,036
One word more,

52
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,877
by the gracious generosity
of Our Sovereign Lord,
King George the Third,

53
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,376
it is in my power
to offer you the King's mercy.

54
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,878
Instead of execution,

55
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,759
you may be transported
to His Majesty's colonies
in North America.

56
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,559
Not to die, my lord?

57
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:37,900
And to serve
not less than 14 years
as an indentured slave,

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,398
to be sold at auction
to the highest bidder.

59
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,435
Slavery in the colonies
or the gallows here.

60
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,438
Speak up, girl,
which is it to be?

61
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,548
Slavery, my lord.

62
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,067
(CREW CHATTERING)

63
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,824
Get the blood
in your cheeks.

64
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,731
You'll fetch a better price
at Norfolk tomorrow.

65
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,266
Mr. Leach, you won't
sell me away from
my husband, will you?

66
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,430
You'll sell according
to your indentures.

67
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,532
Seven year, l'll be free
and get me a bit of land.

68
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,276
And maybe even
a strong wife.

69
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,069
LEACH: Get along, get along.

70
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,311
Me, l'll get me bought
by a nice rich widow
and marry myself free.

71
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,016
I ain't a rich widow,
but l'm willing.

72

(GROANS)

73
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,624
Ain't you got
a wife already, Tom?

74
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:12,152
Wife. I'm serving time
for all four of them.

75
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,932
Break your ranks
and save your shanks.

(LAUGHING)

77
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,339
Our land of opportunity.

78
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,807
Jeremy,

79
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,247
how old shall l look
in 14 years?

80
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,843
(LAUGHING)
Fourteen years
older, of course.

81
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,357
LEACH: Here, here,
have a care there.
Have a care.

82
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,857
MAN: Hold onto the slate.

83
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,954
MAN 2: Make fast
to the pin rail.

84

MAN 3: Ease that on the deck.

85
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,896
And at ease.

86
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,064
Some sort of
chopping instrument.

87
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,939
LEACH: Stand by your braces.

88
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,500
Let go of the last one.

89
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,639

before the owner sees you.

has seen you.

Hand me that tomahawk.
Tomahawk?

92
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,890
I was just remarking
to this young lady...

93
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,796
Convicts should know
the punishment for stealing.

94
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,664
Captain.
Well, he didn't steal it.

95
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,202
No, well, perhaps...

96
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,997
Who are you?
My daughter, sir.

97
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,200
The devoted daughter
of Jeremy John Love.

98
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,835
Jeremy,
l'm not your daughter.

99
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,675
No, not in fact,
but in spirit.

100
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,544
You seem a gentleman
of discernment, sir.

101
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,642
Tell me, can you
always spot the queen?

102
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,150
I believe so.
Excellent, I've heard...

103
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,155
No, no.
Don't go away, my dear.
Jeremy, please.

104
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,316
You show a taste
for entertainment, sir,

105
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,020
entertainment with
a dash of risk.
Well?

106
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,087
Well, sir, observe your queen
is now between two knaves,

107
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,854
thus.

108
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,999
But can you tell me
where the queen is hiding now?

109
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,664
And if l do?
The stake is yours
to name, sir.

110
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,207
A pound.
A pound it is.

111
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,367
Put it up.

112
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,908
Oh, well, l seldom carry
large sums of money upon my...

You have other assets.

114
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,242
Perhaps a kiss
from your daughter-in-spirit.

115
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,185
Jeremy, l won't be...

MAN: Man the mizzen
top-sail sheets.

118

A golden sovereign.
Gallant risk, sir.

119
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,187
Now, sir.

120
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,859
Now, can you tell me
where the queen is hiding?

121
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,130
Yes. Up the sleeve of a cheat
who is about to get 30 lashes.

122
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,826
Thirty?

123
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,001
You wouldn't have a man
of his age whipped.

124
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,269
His age hasn't improved
his honesty or yours.

125
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,833
Slave driver.
Wait.

126
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,772
I'll give you the kiss.

127
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,408
You're not giving it,
l won it.

MAN: He's got her
anchored all right.

Another cheat.

131
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,058
I paid you.

132

You can do better.

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Garth.

Yes, Mr. Garth.
They're all for sale.

Indentured servant?

No, sir. Felon.

138
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,867
Felon?
It ain't deep in her
character, Mr. Garth.

139
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,932
She's good manners,
gentle, sweet.

140
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,840
Fit for all kinds
of housework.

141
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,373
I'll buy her.

142
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,307
I won't be sold to this man.
What's her price?

143
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,284
Mr. Leach,
the judge said public auction.
LEACH: Hold your tongue.

144
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,512
She's right.

145
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,347
We'll have an auction
right here.

146

would any of you care to bid

MAN: Not me.
I don't hold much
with slavery.

148
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,530
That red hair
could change a man's mind.

149
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,627
I'm starting at £20.

150
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,939
£20 is bid for
Abigail Martha Hale.

Offering 14 years
of servitude.

Let them see your face, girl.

153
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,008
Going once, going twice.

But l dinnae ken

00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,926
Did you say something, sir?
Yes, l said, "And sixpence."

159
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,761
Lend me your bodkin, Fergus.

160
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,332
It's an Indian knife throw.

161
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,796
Captain Holden has
a reputation for joking.

162
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,902
Make your sale.

163
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,670
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Garth.

164
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,304
Going to Mr. Garth for...
You heard my bid?

165
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,240
LEACH: Yes, sir,
£20 and sixpence.

166
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,347
Would your humor desert you,
Captain Holden, at £50?

167
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,753
MAN 1: £50, did you hear that?
MAN 2: What do you know!

168
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,193
£50 for this likely
servant maid.

169
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,096
Strong and willing.

170
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,796
Do l hear another bid?
And sixpence.

171
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,096
LEACH: And sixpence.

172
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,503
£50 and sixpence.

173
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,066
LEACH: Do l hear £55?
Cash on the barrel.

174
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,971
Cash on the barrel.

175
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,104
Try another.

176
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,546
£50 and sixpence, l'm bid.

177
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,174
£60.
And sixpence.

178
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,778
£60 and sixpence...
That's better.

179
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,948
He must be very rich
or very interested.

180
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,854
He hasn't even looked at me.

181
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,520
£60 and sixpence
for this rare gem.

182
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,223
Smile, you little scut.

183
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,993
Do l hear another bid?
GARTH: Yes.

184
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,561
£65.

185
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,493
(GASPS)

186
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,868
(ALL MURMURING)

187
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,369
And sixpence.

188
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,606
LEACH: It's £65 and sixpence.
Hey, Chris,

189
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,049
the game's getting
a wee bit rough.
Here's your coat.

190
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,517
Do l hear £70? You will not
see the likes of this maid
in all His Majesty's colonies.

191
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,383
You seem to want this girl.

192
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,852
The Ohio country
won't be a healthy place
for a white woman

193
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,757
when the Indians get these
toys you're bringing them.

194
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,727
Usual trade goods.
Usual?

195
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,030
What you've got aboard
the brig Minerva
and the ship Paragon?

196
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,658
It might pay you
to mind your own business.

197
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:28,298
I found that out
from one of your Senecas
on the Catawba Trail.

198
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,408
You met one of
the bad shots.

199
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,802
£70.
£70.

200
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,608
That one will never learn
to shoot any better.

201
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,705
And sixpence.

202
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,478
I hear £70
and another sixpence.

203
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,686
Have a closer look, gentlemen.

204
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,254
Skin soft as satin.

205
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,654
Cheerful as a meadowlark.

206
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,319
MAN 1: Muskets.
MAN 2: That's guns in there.
They're all new.

207
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,591
Even this ship is loaded
with your usual trade goods.

208
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,164
Indians don't trade
furs for Bibles.

209
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,335
They don't trade
for bond slaves, either.

210
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,535
What are your plans for her?

211
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,007
Field hand
on your plantation?

212
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,102
I apologize
for Mr. Garth, ma'am.

213
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,043
In Virginia we use
dirt to grow tobacco
and bury our dead.

214
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,074
We don't like
your kind of dirt, Mr. Garth.

215
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,980
MAN 3: Watch out.
No, gentlemen, no.

216
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,980
Not on my ship.

217
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,886
You are quite right,
Captain Brooks.
His purse.

218
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,862
Perhaps someday he'll come
west of the Alleghenies.

219
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,430
Dueling code is very different
in the Ohio country.

220
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,629
£70 and sixpence is bid,
gentlemen, for this
dainty little package.

221
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,933
Look at her slender form,

222
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,199
the tilt of her head.

223
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,243
You, sir, would you care
to put in a bid, sir?

224
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,204
No, thank you.
I've never had to buy trouble.

225
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,176
Here's my bid,

226
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,581
£103.
£103. A Turk's ransom.

227
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,785
Jeremy, l'm frightened.

228
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,820
A hundred quid would
frighten the wings
off an angel.

229
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,917
And sixpence.

230
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,427
I'll double that
tomorrow at Norfolk.

231
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,258
Cash on the barrel, Mr. Garth.

232
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,163
Is that yours?
No, mine's in the Captain's
strongbox.

233
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,064
He's right. Cash is the law.

234
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,531
Make the sale.

235
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:08,061
£103 and sixpence,
once, twice.

236
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,737
Sold to Captain Holden
for £103...

237
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,275
And sixpence.

238
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,312
Sorry, Mr. Garth.

239
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,518
Quite a price
for a rose of Old Bailey.

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,387
Here's your bonnet.

241
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,747
Have the bill of sale
ready in the morning.

242
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,291
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

243
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,788
My dear Captain,
allow me to present my ward.

244
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,267
I hope you had
a very pleasant voyage, ma'am.

245
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,098
Well...

246
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,507
Chris...

247
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,737
Chris, a loony man would seem
wise alongside of you.

248
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,177
Why did ye do it?

249
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,882
Garth is bad medicine,
Fergus.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,746
She'll be safer with him
than with your promised
bride tomorrow

251
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,720
when she sees yon red-headed
purchase you just made.

252
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,347
Aye. Diana.

253
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,019
MAN: Land ho!

254
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,788
(MEN SHOUTING)

255
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,668
MAN 1: Haul away on the...
MAN 2: Clear tire.

256
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,937
Clear tire.

257
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,269
Your longboat's
making fast, sir.

258
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,343
Does it carry a young lady
armed with a musket?

259
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,116
The ship's agent
brought this aboard, sir.
Thank you.

260
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,051
Oh, will you have my luggage
lowered to the longboat?

261
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,418
Certainly, sir.

262
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,719
From the impatient bride?

263
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,051
No, from John Fraser.

264
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,589
Pittsburgh blacksmith.
Pittsburgh?

265
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,027
Little village in Virginia.

266
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,563
Listen to this.

267
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,236
"Trouble's busting everywhere.

268
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,669
"When you get yours,
if you ain't killed nobody,

269
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,004
"meet me
at the Peakestown Fair."

270
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,237
John must have dipped
his pen in applejack.

271
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,641
He can't have known
you're getting married.

272
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,646
If you'll sign
Mistress Hale's papers, sir.
Whose? Oh.

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,488
Have the notary certify these,
then give them to the girl.

274
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,257
Yes, sir. She's on deck.

275
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,995
If he likes sugarplums,

276
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,029
you look just like one.

277
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,262
He's probably married,
with six children.

278
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,704
Stop babbling.

279
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,173
Just get him to buy me
and l'll have you riding
in your own carriage.

280
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,235
Love accomplishes
all things, my dear.

281
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,405
For instance, for luck.

282
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:33,281
Jeremy, it's a gold piece.
Uh-huh.

283
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,550
King Charles double guinea.

284
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,122
It was given to my mother
by a prince of the blood.

285
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,183
There he is.
Well, go to him. Go to him.

286
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,525
Keep your gold in your fist,
your tongue in your cheek,

287
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,325
and don't be too forward,

288
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,060
and not too backward, either.

289
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,668
MAN: Pick up,
you're slacking that line.

290
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,277
Good morning, Captain Holden.
Good morning, Miss...

291
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,357
Well, l'm all ready.

292
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,550
Yes. I see you are.

293
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,026
Bend your bonnets.

294
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,327
Do we go now?

295
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,867
I'm sorry, Miss...
Abby.

296
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,797
Miss Abby.
But l'm not taking you.
You're free.

297
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,700
But didn't you buy me?

298
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,245
Oh, yes, l bought you...
MAN: Watch yourself.

299
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,209
Stand clear, you.

300
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,414
And now l've set you free.

301
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,877
ABBY: You mean really free?
HOLDEN: Yes. Leach will
give you your papers.

302
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,183
I'm very grateful,
but l won't accept
my freedom.

303
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,652
You won't?

304
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:54,061
I owe you £103 and sixpence
and l intend to work for you
until it's paid.

305
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,659
Oh, not for me.

306
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,030
You're much too pretty
to pass the porridge
on my honeymoon.

307
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,165
Your honeymoon? But...

308
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,042
You're married?

309
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,242
I will be within the week.

310
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,343
Goodbye, Abby.

311
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,449
Then why did you buy me?
What?

312
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,485
Why did you buy me?

313
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,955
Oh, to see if sixpence

Well...

375
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,783
He said that?
Yes, he set me free.

376
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:36,378
Free? That's carrying
a joke too far.

377

What is?

378
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,717
First he pretends to buy
the girl, then he pretends
to set her free.

379
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,055
He did buy me.

380
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,619
If he bought a girl
as pretty as you,
he'd never set her free.

Mr. Leach?

382
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,266
I'm sure the gentleman
meant no harm.

383
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,394
But he'd have told me.

384
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,335
He didn't have the courage.
It is rather a grim joke.

385
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,373
You bought me.

386
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,180

You're not for sale.

You'll go all right.

Cider here.

470
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,255
...hazard and risk
for your education
and recreation.

471
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:20,491
Neptune's loveliest daughter,
she has the face of a female
and the body of a fish.

472
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:25,332
She has lured, my friends,
many a brave sea captain
to his destruction.

473
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,770
Now, you with
the spinning wheel there,
don't go away. Come on in.

474
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,898
Come in, folks.

475
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,238
You've never seen
anything like it before.

476
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,505
You'll never see anything
like it again.

477
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,912
Scales on her tail and...
Thank you very much, sir.

478
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:42,009
Scales on her tail
and seaweed in her hair.

479
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,647
The greatest exhibit
at the Peakestown Fair.

480
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,556
HOLDEN:
You can't take her home
to your wife, John Fraser.

481
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,995
Chris. Chris Holden.

482
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,361
I've been looking
all over for you.
By gollys, how are you?

483
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,928
Did you expect
to find me in there
with the mermaid?

484
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,664
Aw, shucks. I wasn't...
Pile your loot in the back
and climb aboard.

485
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,071
Say, ain't you
traveling kind of fancy?

486
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,371
What did you bring back,
the London Bridge?

487
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,138
Well, a green dress
for a bride

488
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,737
and women's doodads,
which l expect to swap
for trade goods.

489
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,111
Well, get over.

490
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,710
Yep. I heard about her.

491
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,810
(CLICKING TONGUE)

492
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:20,085
Chris, you wasn't cut out
to marry no Tidewater lady
and just rusticate.

493
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,190
I don't know
what the good Lord was about

494
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,093
when he made a female
out of a perfectly good rib.

495
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,225
We'll tote your doodads
over to Fort Pitt.

496
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,824
Officers' wives will pay
more for them.

497
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,630
That's quite a speech
for you.

498
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,763
But you didn't
bring me out here
just to tell me that.

499
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,330
What's going on?
Trouble, Chris.

500
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,842
You can smell it as far
as a flea can smell a dog.

501
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,080
Keep this covered.

502
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,019
Where did you get this?

503
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,488
Off an Injun that aimed
a mite too high.

504
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,679
(WHISTLES)

505
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,791
The Indian Commissioner
seen it?
Sir William?

506
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,886
No, not yet.
I kept it for you.

507
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,268
MAN: Going twice.
Sold to the gent
in the butternut vest for £14.

508
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,027
Pay the notary, mister.
He'll give you your papers.

509
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,101
Put your hat on, lad.
It's your sweat l'm buying,
not your spirit.

510
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,733
You don't have to bow
and scrape to me.

511
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,608
Take this one for £1.
He'll keep the crows
off your field.

512
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,044
All right, come along.
Let's see.

513
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,241
Say, you. Yeah.

514
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,442
I'm looking to buy
a wife for my son.

515
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,507
Oh, wife.

516
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,575
(GROANS)

517
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,321
Here, young lady.
A buxom lass from Lancashire.

518
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,387
She can outwork a horse.

519
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,524
Kind and loving as a dove.

520
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,761
Made a little mistake,
that's all.

521
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,460
She'll make your son
a fine, affectionable wife.

522
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,058
What do you say, Son?

523
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,597
Joshua,
what's the matter with you?

524
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,766
Ma, buy me that one.

525
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,178
She ain't for sale.

526
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,672
Get back on the wagon.

527
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,307
Why did you tell me
to stand here and smile?

528
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,784
For bait. Get going.

529
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,319
BONE: Now, lady,
what's your bid?

530
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,325
WOMAN: Let me talk
to this girl private.

531
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,826
Look, Abby,

532
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,921
there's Captain Holden
going into the tavern.

533
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:12,127
BONE: Here you are, folks,
this young fella's as strong
as a goat and smart as a fox.

534
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,606
I'd rather look
at the devil himself.

535
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,867
BONE: Takes to work
like a duck to water.
What do you say?

536
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,071
Colonel Washington
is here too, Chris.

537
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,248
I thought maybe
you and him might get
the Indian Commissioner to...

538
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:34,851
What's biting you?
You ain't going to buy
a bond slave, are you?

539
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,027
That girl looks like
one l've already bought.

540
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,393
It is, Captain.

541
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,956
The moment you left,
she came to me.

542
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,933
I use her for drawing crowds.

543
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,660
And l thought
she was only a thief.

544
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,832
Hello, Chris,
Mr. Garth. Mr. Lee.

545
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,638
Colonel Washington.
You said to fetch him, George.

546
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,439
You know
the Indian Commissioner,
Sir William Johnson.

547
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,843
How are you, Captain?
Sir William.

548
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,350
I haven't seen you
since the Indians chased us
off Braddock's Field.

549
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,978
What's the matter?
You look as though they'd
just caught up with you.

550
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:07,047
Mr. Garth was just
enlightening me on the manners
and morals of bond slaves.

551
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,926
My wife was a bond slave,
you know, Captain Holden.

552
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,554
One of my teachers was
an indentured convict, Chris.

553
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,292
Fine man. Never could
teach me to spell.

554
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,267
Coming?
Yes, sir.

555
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,660
I'll join you inside,
Sir William.

556
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,800
BUYER: Fourteen.

557
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:29,077
Only £14 for as handy
a couple as you'll find
this side of Cape Henry.

558
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,014
I don't want both.
I bid £14 for the man.

559
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,684
The woman is yours, mister,
for £6 more.

560
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,379
A woman's no good
in my fields.

561
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,083
Oh, Ben, hold me close.
I'm frightened.

562
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,649
Who'll say £20
for them both? You?

563
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,125
MAN: Not me.
You?

564
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:49,064
Then it's £14 for the man.
Sold to this gentleman here.

565
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,833
Now, what am l bid
for the woman?

566
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,267
Don't sell us apart,
Mr. Bone.

567
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,999
You'd be apart if you was
serving your terms in prison.

568
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,473
Now, what am l bid for this?
Who'll say six for the woman?

569
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,136
It's not human to sell a man
away from his wife, Mr. Bone.

570
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,702
Shut your yap.
Don't buy him alone, sir.
Please.

571
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,146
I don't buy women.
But she's his wife.

572
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,710
Keep quiet.

573
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,715
You never said
they're man and wife, fella.

574
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,878
They're slaves, ain't they?

575
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,854
I'm not breaking up
a family.

576
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,681
The girl's right.
Get down there.

577
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,726
Don't whip her
because of me, Mr. Bone.

578
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,421
Keep out of this.
Don't worry about me, Maggie.

579
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,090
Get on down there.
Take over, Art.

580
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,157
Don't go away, gentlemen.
Don't go away.

581
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,998
Come on,
we can see over the top.

582
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,498
Here's a good,
strong field hand
for your plantation.

583
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,271
Strong of back.

584
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,706
Strong of arm.

585
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,305
What am l bid.
Do l hear £10?
You'll get it now.

586
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,471
Please don't.

587
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,344
MAN: Hold your tongue.
You've been asking for this.

588
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,284
It's time to learn
who's your master.

589
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,848
Maybe it is, Bone.

590
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,389
She spiked a sale.

591
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,254
Loose her.
MAN: Ain't they
gonna tan her?

592
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,489
WOMAN:
They're taking her down.

593
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,624
Fix your dress
in the tent, Abby.

594
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,865
Are you out of your mind?
You said to gentle her.

595
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,804
Flogging collects a crowd.
Chris Holden's here.

596
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,039
Has he seen her?
Yes.

597
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,710
Sell what you can
and get going for Pittsburgh.

598
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,278
(GASPS)

599
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,792
He hurt you.

600
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,289
I'm all right.

601
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,687
I'm sorry about this.

602
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,722
Why did you stop him?

603
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,231
I hoped you would
forgive and forget.

604
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,834
Slavery hasn't
taught me forgiveness.

605
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,538
Or gratitude.

606
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,769
I'm grateful
for what you've done.

607
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,911
I can do more.

608
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,849
Would you help me
get away?

609
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,147
Where?

610
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,016
There isn't a town in these
colonies big enough to hide
that red hair of yours.

611
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,186
Some try for the west.
The west?

612
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,889
You've never seen
a doe dragged down
by a wolf pack

613
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,264
or a white woman
when an Indian war party
had done with her.

614
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,329
You don't know
what freedom's worth
until you lose it.

615
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,474
Isn't worth much against
a Shawnee torture stake.

616
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,777
Hanging in England
is quick, Abby.

617
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,610
Is it worse than
14 years of bondage with Bone?

618
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,910
(MEN LAUGHING)

619
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,177

from my father.

Well?

Guyasuta say to Garth,

626
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,276
Hannah, look after this girl.

White one. Pretty.

Who are you?
A bond slave.

His wife.

For years, gentlemen,
l've had the Indians'
friendship.

only an Irishman can really
understand the red man.

Now, maybe l'm getting old,
but l still know the signs.

638
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,319
There's a cloud of trouble
coming down over the Ohio

639
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,524
with the sound of
war drums in it.

640
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,730
I've heard them before.

641
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:47,464
And l know that closing
your ears to them
can cost you your scalp.

642
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,299
What's behind it,
Sir William?
Mr. Carroll,

643
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:57,375
when old enemies
like the Ottawas,
the Shawnees, and the Senecas

644
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,815
meet together in council,
the thread's off the bobbin.

645
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,380
Perhaps just a meeting
to bury the hatchet.

646
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,046
In somebody's skull.

647
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,687
Do you think there's war
in this, Colonel Washington?

648
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,885
The whole frontier's
a powder keg.

649
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,687
And those two gentlemen
were almost the fuse.

650
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,699
Mr. Mason and Mr. Dixon,
the London astronomers,

651
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,224
have been running a survey
to settle Pennsylvania's
boundary line

652
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,931
and her claim to Pittsburgh
and the Ohio country.

653
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,203
Pittsburgh, gentlemen,
is in Virginia.

654
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,770
You can see for yourselves.

655
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,212
But, Brother Lee,

656
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,307
Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania

657
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,379
and the whole
Ohio Territory is...
Mine.

658
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,985
Yours, Mr. Garth?
Yes.

659
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,126
I'm no surveyor, gentlemen,

660
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,059
but the Allegheny runs here
and the Monongahela.

661
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,500
Here's Pittsburgh.

662
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,306
Colonel Washington wants
this territory for Virginia.

663
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,940
Mr. Andrews thinks
it's in Pennsylvania.

664
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,209
But l hold deeds to it
from the Indians.

665
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,908
The Indians cannot
deed lands, Mr. Garth.

666
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:09,543
Not by law.
Whose law?
Pennsylvania's? Virginia's?

667
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,949
The King's law.

668
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,949
The King's law moves
with the King's muskets.

669
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,326
And there are
very few King's muskets
west of the Alleghenies.

670
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,227
There's only bear,
beaver and muskrat,

671
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,026
and they don't need
boundary lines.

672
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,465
Mr. Garth.

673
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,670
The very heavens
need boundary lines.

674
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,972
Mr. Mason and l have
measured the distance
from Earth to Mars.

675
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,070
There are no savages between
Earth and Mars, Mr. Dixon.

676
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,707
There are 10,000 red hot ones
between here and the Ohio.

677
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,343
And it's no place
for surveyors or settlers.

678
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,647
You're there.

679
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,546
I rule it.

680
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,451
You can't rule
part of Pennsylvania.
Nor Virginia.

681
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,426
Nobody rules it until
this survey is completed.

682

And l regret to inform you

683
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,464
that the Mason and Dixon Line
has been stopped.

684
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,727
Stopped?
When?

685
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,429
How could it be stopped?
WASHINGTON: Mr. Mason.

686
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,233
Stopped rather thoroughly
at Dunkard's Creek

687
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,798
by a band of
painted aborigines.

(ALL GRUMBLING)

689
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,442
It must have been
a hunting party.

690
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,139
Why should Indians
stop a survey?
Why?

691
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,610
To hide the movement
of war parties
across the Ohio trail.

692
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,878
ALL: War parties?

The Senecas, the Ottawas,

694
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,023
Delawares, Shawnees...
You mean a general uprising?

695
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,889
MAN: Have they powder
and lead?
War parties?

696
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,393
Is that possible,
Sir William?

697
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,398
So possible that we have
forbidden the sale of
firearms to the Indians.

698
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,094
But, Sir William,
no one could bring
those tribes together.

699
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,363
I think there is someone,
Mr. Garth.

700
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,571
Who?
Pontiac.

701
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,573
Pontiac?
The Ottawa chief?

702
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,632
Pontiac's a friend
of the white man.

703
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,075
Which white man?

704
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,212
Those who stay
east of the Alleghenies.

705
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,081
Mr. Garth has just
been in England

706
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,211
trying to get a law passed
prohibiting settlement
west of the Allegheny.

707
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,755
He wants the whole
fur empire to himself.

708
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,583
Settlers will never be safe
west of the mountains.

709
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,217
Why, their homes are there.

710
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,285
Their graves will be there,
unless you call them back.

711
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,352
Mr. Garth.

712
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,800
Those people will never
abandon a settlement
like Pittsburgh.

713
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,534
I'm sorry,
Colonel Washington.

714
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,596
I know you selected
that site yourself,

715
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,904
but after all,
a fort at the end
of the earth,

716
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,238
guarding nothing,
on a couple of
useless rivers.

717
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:18,770
That triangle of land, sir,
may be the most vital spot
in this country.

718
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,942
Oh, my dear Colonel.

719
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,777
I visited John Fraser's
forge there once.

720
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,779
And saw...
Coal and iron,
that's what he saw.

721
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,894
Pittsburgh's like a hen
sitting on more coal than she
can hatch in a thousand years.

722
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,760
Cook the iron with that coal
and what've you got? Steel.

723
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:38,825
Why, that town'll sprout
into a city of maybe
four or five thousand folks.

724

(ALL LAUGHING)

725

Don't laugh, gentlemen.
John's a good gunsmith

726
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,366
and we may need more guns
than words to build a future.

727
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,437
I've given my opinion.

728
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,081
If you ignore it,
l'll wash my hands clean
of the whole matter.

729
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,674
I hope they stay clean.
Captain Holden.

730
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,719
Mr. Garth knows the Indians.
He ought to.

731
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,723
He's married to Guyasuta's
daughter and is a blood
brother of the Senecas.

732
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,588
Watch your words, man.

733
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,828
Didn't you exchange
blood with Guyasuta?

734
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:07,986
Yes.

735
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,926
That's why the Senecas
trade with me rather than
with Crawford or Croghan.

736
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,766
My trading posts
would be the first to go up
in the smoke of an Indian war.

737
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,241
Then why did you send
hundreds of muskets
from England?

738
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,540
Thousands of flints,
tons of bar lead
and powder to...

739
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,375
Captain Holden,
what are you suggesting?

740
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,573
(LAUGHING)

741
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,850
Captain Holden is
somewhat bitter toward me

742
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,352
because of a pretty
bond slave aboard ship.

743
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,117
Seems he's lost
his famous luck
with the ladies.

744
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,557
You still haven't
explained the shipments
of arms, Mr. Garth.

745
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,318
Explain them?
I deny them.

746
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,727
Any other information
you'd like?
Yes.

747
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,767
In case of an Indian war,
which side would you be on?

748
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,565
I've killed men
for less than that.

749
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,035
For much less.

750
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,577
Captain Holden, l suggest
that you control yourself

751
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,872
and leave Mr. Garth
to control the Indians.

752
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,005
Control?

753
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,915
No one can control
the Indians, once they've sent
around the red belt of war.

754
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,754
But if you close
the Ohio to settlement,

755
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,123
the war belt will
never be passed.
It has been passed.

756
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,957
What?
When?

757
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,394
MAN: That's hard to believe.

758
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,620
How do you know?

759
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,496
John Fraser took this off
an Ottawa near Venango.

760
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,434
Crossed tomahawks.

761
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,062
The war belt.
A war belt!

762
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,137
That otter there
is Pontiac's sign.

763
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,607
On its way to Guyasuta.
Mr. Garth's blood brother.

764
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,646
Colonel Bouquet,
that belt makes it
a matter for the army.

765
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,011
I have no army.
What? Why?

766
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,655
The Black Watch is
just in from the Caribbean,
fever among the men.

767
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,351
Do you expect miracles?

768
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,461
We cannot be ready
for four months.

769
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,620
Four months?

770
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,494
There won't be a live settler
west of the mountains.

771
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,466
Then pull your settlers back.

772
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,433
Or stop the war
before it breaks.

00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,270
Keep both hands
on that drink, Mr. Bone.

931
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,873
Where's the pouch?

932
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,809
Is this what
you're looking for?

Shut your...
Bone.

934
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:24,152
Yes, that's it.
You've certainly come down
in the world.

935
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,080
So has my opinion of you.

936
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,916
Is this Mr. Garth's
hospitality?

937
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,927
You're not going anywhere.
Keep your hands
flat on the bar.

938
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,592
I figured you'd do better
with your freedom.

939
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,501
What freedom?
Freedom to be beaten
with a whip,

940
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,506
to serve and to scrub
and milk, from sunup
to midnight?

941
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:49,034
Then crawl into
a cornhusk bed too tired
to sleep or even cry?

942
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,242
Why don't you quit?
A slave can't quit.

943
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,579
Slave?

944
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,250
But l set you free.

945
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,817
You never set her free.

946
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,952
No. He bought me and tonight
he's selling me to Garth.

947
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,988
Shut up, you.
Keep both hands
on that drink, Mr. Bone.

00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,192
Tonight, huh?

949
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,739
Get your things, Abby.

950
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,736
I haven't any things.

951
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,177
You have two feet,
get up on them
and bring the pouch.

952
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,841
I'll break your arms if...
No, you won't.

953
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:31,148
I bought her and if
she's not free, she's mine.
Get behind me, Abby.

954
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,422
Now start for the door.

for it, Mr. Bone. Get your
hand back on that drink.

There's another one
here for Joe Lavat

01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:30,621
You mean birds of a feather?
No, you think l'm a thief.

1081
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:34,032
And you thought
l was a liar.

1082
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,507
I've seen that
girl somewhere.

1083
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,512
Must have been heaven.

1084
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,039
(SIGHING)

1085
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,942

11:00 and all's well.

GUARD 4: Post number five.
11:00 and all's well.

1089
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,932
All's well, isn't it?

1090
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,005
Too quiet.

1091
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,508
You seem to be
watching for something.

1092
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,451
Watchfulness isn't
a bad thing, Abby,

1093
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,010
when you are at the edge
of the end of the world.

1094
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,488
Why? What's there?

1095
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,048
Forests and savages.

1096
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,358
The end of the present,
the beginning of the future.

1097
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,558
The beginning of the future,
Captain Holden?

1098
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,394
Chris.

1099
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,837
Why did you really come
to Pittsburgh, Chris?

1100
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:49,444
The moonlight is turning
your dress into green fire.

1101
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,614
It wasn't to set me free,
as it?

1102
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,877
And the stars are
dancing in your eyes.

1103
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,415
Did you come through
500 miles of wilderness

1104
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,513
to tell me the stars
are dancing in my eyes?

1105
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,058
Can you think of
any better reason?

1106
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,560
A woman only thinks
what she wants to.

1107
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:10,188
And you want to think
l came to set you free?

1108
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:16,333
Maybe no one has the right
to own anyone else.

1109
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,939
Men and women weren't
made to be bought
like yards of cloth.

1110
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,139
At the tavern,
you said you owned me.

1111
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,576
I do.

1112
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,344
But you want to be free,
don't you?

1113
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,785
I wonder...
Hey, you're ruining
the ordnance.

1114
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:40,625
I'm not sure l want
to be free of you, Chris.
Why do you say that?

1115
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,531
Because you've taken me
out of a horrible nightmare.

1116
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,967
Because you've given me
kindness and happiness
and understanding.

1117
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,868
Abby, listen to me.

1118
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:54,035
It wasn't kindness
and understanding that
made me bring you here.

1119
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,601
No? Why did you bring me?

1120
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,916
Because l know
Garth will follow.
Garth?

1121
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,117
When he sees you here
like this, he'll try
to take you back,

1122
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,021
and then l can do
what l came to
Pittsburgh to do.

1123
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,618
Kill him? Is that it?
Yes, that's it.

1124
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:18,258
And l'm the bait, staked out
like a deer to draw a tiger.
That's true, isn't it?

1125
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,428
Yes.
And you said the stars
were in my eyes.

1126
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,566
They were there.
Because l thought...

1127
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,505
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1128
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,601
Everything that you've done
for me is because you wanted
to challenge Garth.

1129
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:30,906
You're not a man.

1130
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,780
You're a walking loaded rifle
with one bloodthirsty purpose,
to kill Garth.

1131
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,410
You haven't blood
in your veins,
you've gunpowder.

1132
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,954
Abby, maybe you're right.

1133
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,248
But this is more important
than you or me, or both of us.

1134
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,351
If Garth doesn't die
within the next few hours,

1135
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:49,091
a lot of men and women
on this frontier will.

1136
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:51,793
You're either
the world's greatest liar
or the world's greatest fool.

1137
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,300
You're probably both.
I'm going.

1138
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,337
You'll stay
and see it through.
Why should I?

1139
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,962
Because l own you.

1140
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,439
A few minutes ago
you said nobody
should be owned.

1141
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,671
Do you ever mean anything
you say, Captain Holden?

1142
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,940
Here's your good-luck piece.

1143

You'll need it
when you meet Mr. Garth.

Yes, l know.

No, this one's mine,

No, l'm sorry.
Perhaps the next one,
Miss Hale.

Mistress Hale,
you promised
this dance to me.

1150

What's happened to Chris?
Gentlemen, l'm not dancing.

may l have this dance?
I'd love to.

Mistress Hale.
You promised.

1154

There'll be no living
with Baillie after this.
Yeah.

a cheat and a coward.
Captain Holden.

1178

Captain, l bought this girl,
which makes him a liar,

1179
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,450
he stole her from me,
which makes him a cheat,

1180
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,510
and he won't fight,
which makes him a coward.

l'll take my property.

over in there, now.

one scrap of reason

or evidence to support
your claim to this girl.

1206

The law requires
a bill of sale.

killing Indians,
stealing bond slaves

1211
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,139
and now you answer
his rightful claim

1212
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:37,743
by hurling challenges
like a bully in a schoolyard.

1213

Captain Holden's been trying
to pick a quarrel with me
ever since we left England.

Why?

not to answer that.

that's all.

girl and he's followed me here
to repair it with a bullet.

Is that true?

1219

Did you come here
because of this girl?
Yes, sir.

This woman is yours,
Mr. Garth.
You can take her.

Do you realize
what you have done
to this woman?

1222
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:25,529
Mr. Garth has the legal right
to give her the whipping post,
the pillory,

1223
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,831
or the branding iron
if he chooses to use it.

Mr. Garth won't

Good evening, Captain Ecuyer.
Come, Abby.

1226
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,533
You'd better
take her out this way.

1227
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:42,215
Captain Holden,
you are under my orders.
If you harm...

1228
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:47,517
l'll send the dress
back to you, Captain Holden.

1229
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,258
I'm going after that girl.
No, you are not.

1230
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:01,002
If you try, you'll spend
the next five years
in the fort's dungeon.

1231
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:04,334
And don't look
as though you'd like
to cut my heart out.

1232
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,465
It's against regulations.

1233

Shall we join the ladies?

1234
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,882
Bone leave for Venango?
Yes, two hours ago.

1235
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,091
You know what to do.

1236
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,061
Abby. You. Get out.

1237
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,895
A little sherry, perhaps.
No.

Why did you go with Holden?
To be free.

1244
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,694
He can't set you free.

1245
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,790
He may, when he meets you
at sunup tomorrow.

to fight him?
I don't have to fight for you.

You're mine,
just as my horse or my dogs

We've had no word yet
from Colonel Bouquet's
relief column.

1702
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:36,461
Are you suggesting
we surrender?
Put your weight on that.

much of our chances.

this is our home

this ground till the last

I'll send my wife
with your message,
Captain Ecuyer,

1709
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:56,754
but after two months
of siege, you've only
a few days' provisions.

1710
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:59,347

Get out, get out,
both of you.

you are in command.

1713

Yes, sir.

What's going on here? At ease.

1715

What are you doing
with that rope?
We're raising a ghost.

1716
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:18,575
I hope it's a scout
from Bouquet.

1717

Oh, Chris, where in blazes
did you come from?

1718
02:00:23,115 --> 02:00:25,549
I'm sure glad
to see you breathing.

1719
02:00:25,618 --> 02:00:27,449
Go down
and give Abby a boost.
Sure.

We didn't expect
you'd come this way again,

I have a report
for Captain Ecuyer, sir.

There's been treachery
at Fort Venango, sir.
Treachery?

1724
02:00:37,263 --> 02:00:39,288
That's a strange
word from you.

1725
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:41,162
You were under orders
to burn the town of Pittsburgh

1726
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:44,032
and report back
to Captain Ecuyer,
were you not?

You're under arrest
for desertion
in the face of the enemy.

But, sir...
Mr. Hutchins, disarm him.

That elusive little bond slave

1733
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:59,946
will be held
as a material witness
until the court martial.

I don't believe
this cock-and-bull story
that Venango surrendered.

Bone here got through.
He says the fort still stands.

1736

Captain Holden is
obviously trying to protect
himself and this girl.

1737
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:20,169
The Mohawk Trail to Albany
and Boston is what they were
headed for,

1738
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,537
and the Indians
drove them back.

1739

That's probably Indian blood
on this flag.

beneath it.

Captain Holden
is out of order.

1748

Attacking Mr. Garth
will not alter the record.

Was the accused headed for
he Mohawk Trail and Boston?

What difference does it make?

Confine yourself
to the question.

02:02:05,551 --> 02:02:08,384
Was he trying to escape
with you to Boston?

1756
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:11,146
I won't answer that.
You must answer.

Upon consideration
of the matter before it,

this court finds the accused
guilty of desertion
in the face of the enemy.

In accordance
with the articles of war,

02:21:39,557 --> 02:21:41,354
Three?
I'm taking Abby.

1995
02:21:41,426 --> 02:21:44,156
And stock up
three saddlebags. Move.

1996
02:21:45,797 --> 02:21:48,231
See them, Mr. Garth,
ain't it grand?

1997
02:21:50,768 --> 02:21:52,133
(LAUGHING)

1998
02:21:52,203 --> 02:21:55,138
If l had me a wife,
l'd raise hallelujah.

1999
02:21:55,206 --> 02:21:56,764
I'll marry you.

2000
02:21:56,841 --> 02:21:58,240
(ALL LAUGHING)

2001
02:22:06,451 --> 02:22:08,214
Something's wrong
with that column.

2002
02:22:08,286 --> 02:22:10,220
Looks awfully
good to me, sir.

2003
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:19,329
We'll head south
into Cherokee country
and build back from there.

2004
02:22:19,397 --> 02:22:21,957
We can go down the Mon side
and hug the bank.

2005
02:22:22,367 --> 02:22:24,232
MAN: Hurry up
with that bridge, soldier.

2006
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:27,863
WOMAN: Glory be,
you're a grand sight.

2007
02:22:27,939 --> 02:22:29,531
(ALL CHEERING)

2008
02:22:47,725 --> 02:22:51,161
Chris. Chris, the stables.

2009
02:22:51,229 --> 02:22:53,356
Get to the stables.

2010
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:02,103
MAN: Look at them.
Why are they so still,
Jeremy?

2011
02:23:05,209 --> 02:23:06,836
The gentlemen are dead.

2012
02:23:13,484 --> 02:23:14,974
We'll mount in here.

2013
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:16,208
Hey.

2014
02:23:17,488 --> 02:23:20,116
They've stopped yelling.
Give her a hand up.

2015
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:23,683
Chris.

2016
02:23:26,998 --> 02:23:28,522
Get over there, Bone.

2017
02:23:32,637 --> 02:23:34,036
That's far enough.

2018
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:37,539
Stand clear, Abby.

2019
02:23:38,676 --> 02:23:40,200
She's coming with me.

2020
02:23:40,745 --> 02:23:42,975
Where you're going,
you're going alone.

2021
02:23:43,047 --> 02:23:44,514
Let him have it, Bone.

2022
02:23:44,582 --> 02:23:45,947
HOLDEN: Bone won't shoot me.

2023
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:47,575
BONE: I won't, huh?
No.

2024
02:23:47,885 --> 02:23:49,477
Abby, stand over there.

2025
02:23:51,489 --> 02:23:54,219
Because l'm the only one
between you and
the hangman's rope

2026
02:23:54,292 --> 02:23:56,089
for double-selling a slave.

2027
02:23:56,394 --> 02:23:59,227
Fergus out there
doesn't know
you acted for Garth.

2028
02:23:59,764 --> 02:24:00,856
I do.

2029
02:24:01,366 --> 02:24:03,095
But you won't be talking.

2030
02:24:04,636 --> 02:24:07,867
Bone, turn your back
and get your hands up
on that ladder.

2031
02:24:16,781 --> 02:24:18,180
All right, Holden.

2032
02:24:20,084 --> 02:24:22,951
I'm not fool enough
to try to beat you
on the draw.

2033
02:24:23,254 --> 02:24:24,346
You win.

2034
02:24:24,989 --> 02:24:26,479
You can take my gun.

2035
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:30,925
I know you wouldn't
shoot a man in the back.

2036
02:24:30,995 --> 02:24:32,360
ABBY: Look out, Chris.

2037
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:33,419
(GRUNTS)

2038
02:24:49,013 --> 02:24:51,846
You are a better man
than you are a soldier,
Holden.

2039
02:24:51,916 --> 02:24:54,976
You have earned a firing squad
for deserting this fort.

2040
02:24:55,887 --> 02:24:58,185
And our gratitude
for helping save it.

2041
02:24:59,557 --> 02:25:03,653
When Colonel Bouquet arrives,
the frontier can start moving
west again.

2042
02:25:04,062 --> 02:25:05,290
Move with it.

2043
02:25:07,031 --> 02:25:08,896
Captain Ecuyer.
What?

2044
02:25:09,033 --> 02:25:11,160
Would you... Could you...

2045
02:25:11,235 --> 02:25:13,760
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Who stands for you?

2046
02:25:16,808 --> 02:25:18,400
Here, put it on.

2047
02:25:19,243 --> 02:25:20,369
Hold hands.

2048
02:25:20,945 --> 02:25:24,005
I pronounce you man and wife
until you find a minister.

2049
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:27,341
Marriage frees you
from slavery, Mrs. Holden.

2050
02:25:27,518 --> 02:25:29,349
It won't do
the same for you, sir.

2051
02:25:33,524 --> 02:25:34,752
You're sweet.

2052
02:25:34,826 --> 02:25:35,815
(CHUCKLES)

2053
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,429
East or west, Abby?

2054
02:25:44,635 --> 02:25:45,863
Make it west.

2055
02:25:46,370 --> 02:25:48,861
And don't get caught
by the Indians again.
Yes, sir.

2056
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:51,408
Or anybody else. Stay free.

2057
02:25:52,376 --> 02:25:53,365
Yes, sir.

2058
02:25:58,316 --> 02:25:59,749
And close that door.

2059
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:12,920
