1
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,952
By the year 1880, all but one of
the scattered bands of the Apache nation

2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,355
had been forced to surrender.

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,949
This one band,
inspired by their leader Geronimo,

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,992
tried to defy the odds and hold out.

5
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,398
But driven by starvation and under
the attack of Mexican and American troops,

6
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,036
even they realised
they must compromise or die.

7
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,153
In the summer of 1883
they left their hiding place in Mexico

8
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,397
to surrender at the United States border.

9
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,633
It's them all right. What's left of them.

10
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,671
Here.

11
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,351
Have you ever seen Apache before?

12
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,992
No, sir.

13
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,679
Take a good long look
and keep facing front.

14
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,711
You might keep your hair.

15
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,957
They seem pretty peaceful now, Captain.

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,595
Nothing but a pack
of wild and dirty animals.

17
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,713
Don't you forget that, Lieutenant Delahay.

18
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,751
Fall in.

19
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,071
Here's your horse, sir.

20
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,591
Prepare to mount.

21
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,359
Mount!

22
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,757
Company, forward, ho!

23
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,069
Company, halt!

24
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,950
Geronimo, under the terms of this treaty...

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,072
I'm not Geronimo. I'm Natchez.

26
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,989
Geronimo sends word he will
surrender at sundown. He asks you to wait.

27
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,316
- Why sundown?
- Because the treaty says sundown.

28
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,758
- Where is he now?
- He has unfinished business.

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,236
Oh? What sort of unfinished business?

30
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,994
He's keeping a promise.

31
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,559
Get back.

32
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,511
(Wild whinnying)

33
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,671
(Horse calms)

34
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,513
You have your own horse now, Giantah.
You're a man.

35
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,439
- From now on you act like a man.
- Yes, Geronimo.

36
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,472
Ride with your shoulders back
and your head held proud.

37
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,395
When anyone asks you who you are, say,
"I am an Apache" and they won't ask again.

38
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,431
Yes.

39
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,836
It's time.

40
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,674
Do we have to surrender?

41
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,236
They won't change us.
I won't let them. I promise you that.

42
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,871
You've got a man for a son, Showshawn.

43
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,951
I wish he were mine.

44
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,511
Company, ho.

45
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,669
Geronimo?

46
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,996
Lieutenant John Delahay,
C Company, Third Cavalry.

47
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,156
This is Captain William Maynard.

48
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,469
Geronimo, under the terms of this treaty,

49
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,956
you and your tribe hereby
relinquish rights to all lands

50
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,912
except those
at San Carlos Reservation, Arizona.

51
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,953
You allow yourselves to be escorted under
military supervision

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,513
to said reservation,

53
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,429
and once there promise
to live peaceably and without conflict.

54
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
In recognition of this sacred promise,

55
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,749
the United States government
agrees to give you food, shelter

56
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,597
and the aforementioned land,

57
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,518
which will belong to you
and your tribe forever.

58
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,388
Signed General George A Crook,
Department of Arizona.

59
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,871
Is something wrong?

60
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Where does it say on the paper
that we are Apaches?

61
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,478
That's understood.
You'll be treated accordingly.

62
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,912
We proceed immediately to San Carlos.

63
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,396
(Knock at door)

64
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,431
Come in.

65
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,830
Ah-ah-ah. Take off the moccasins,
my child.

66
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,158
Fine rich carpeting.
Mustn't soil it with the dust of the world.

67
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,156
What is it you want to tell me?

68
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,191
Geronimo's coming?

69
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,551
Get me the Bible, Mother.

70
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,591
(Bugle call outside)

71
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,358
- Do you think there'll be trouble?
- Trouble? I don't think so.

72
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,194
It'll take more than a child of the devil
to beat the Lord.

73
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,711
(Bugle call)

74
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,316
- Mr Burns.
- Captain Maynard.

75
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,794
My name is Jeremiah Burns.
I'm in charge here.

76
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,638
Tell your braves to dismount.

77
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,876
We'll hold the ponies in the back corral
until we can determine the rightful owners.

78
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,911
- Yes.
- Wait.

79
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,872
These ponies belong to my people.

80
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,593
You are wrong, brother.

81
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,236
Those ponies belong to the hard-working
settlers you stole them from.

82
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,799
The Lord says
what's stolen must be returned.

83
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,711
Then how do we hunt and live?

84
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,038
You won't have to hunt. The government
takes care of everything. You will see.

85
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,355
We are children of God here in San Carlos.

86
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,870
We work the ground.
You'll have no need of a horse.

87
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,115
- Captain Maynard.
- Wait.

88
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,991
Take them away.

89
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,753
I'll go see if the book came in.

90
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,112
My house is right over there.
If you have any problems, let me know.

91
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,713
My door's always open
for love and understanding.

92
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,671
Sergeant, divide them into three groups.

93
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,030
I'll take the first to Turkey Creek.
The others go to Arroyo Seco.

94
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,640
- This way.
- All right.

95
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,671
I'll show you where you're quartered.

96
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,191
What about a man's dignity?
Does the government take care of that too?

97
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,314
It was the government sent out Mr Burns.
Does that answer your question, sir?

98
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,512
We issue rations once a week here.
Beef, flour, sugar.

99
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,552
You're getting special treatment today.

100
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,798
Next week you'll have to wait in line,
just like the others.

101
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,798
- Geronimo.
- Porica.

102
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,711
I remember how it used to be.

103
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,237
Over here.

104
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,674
Hello, Captain.
Got me some new customers?

105
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,397
This is Geronimo, Mr Henry. He'll be up
at Turkey Creek with Mangus and his tribe.

106
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,237
Welcome to San Carlos.

107
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,272
Each week we issue you
sugar, flour and beef.

108
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,440
Teela. When are you going
to teach me to read?

109
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,995
Captain, I don't think
I need to teach you anything.

110
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,955
May I take the book, please, Mr Henry?

111
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,276
- Is that the new reader?
- Yes, it is.

112
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,834
All right, Teela.
You go on. I'll mark it down.

113
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,074
Books.

114
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,997
(All laugh)

115
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,393
I wouldn't laugh. Books are
very good for you. Yes, indeed they are.

116
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,151
Yes, they certainly are.
Put out your hand, please.

117
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,752
It'll wash off.
It just means you got your ration.

118
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,791
I'm not an animal that has to be branded.

119
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,070
Let him go.

120
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,872
I said let him go.

121
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,391
(Crash)

122
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,278
Don't you ever touch a white man again.

123
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,311
You savvy?

124
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,954
You behave yourself. That's
all you have to do. We'll get along fine.

125
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,233
Otherwise I'll lock you in a cage
where you belong.

126
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,031
If you issue their rations,
I'll get this group on their way.

127
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,595
(Shouts of encouragement)

128
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,191
Maybe he'll learn to read now,
like the other children.

129
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,555
Food, shelter, land.

130
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,273
Better than starving in the mountains,
Geronimo.

131
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,472
Geronimo?

132
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,511
Geronimo, you coyote!

133
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,075
You son of a coyote,
you son of two coyotes!

134
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,270
- Mangus!
- (Laughs)

135
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,799
Oh! Oh!

136
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,400
You look fine. Just fine.

137
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,908
- What are you doing?
- I'm growing corn.

138
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,430
See? Here, look. Look at this sprout.

139
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,630
Did you ever see such a sprout? Huh?

140
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,559
Who'd have thought we could grow
a sprout like this? But we did.

141
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,559
In my mind's eye I can see this whole field.
This high with corn.

142
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,273
- Will you stop talking like a fool?
- What?

143
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,231
You're a chief, not a farmer.

144
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,475
Let your woman work in the field.

145
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,310
She's got to take care of the baby.

146
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,920
She can take care of the baby
and work too.

147
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,714
Mangus, the people I've seen here
aren't Apaches any more.

148
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,791
What have they done to you?

149
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,228
They don't understand us,
so we do the best we can.

150
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,272
- At least we stay alive.
- Are you alive?

151
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,669
Mangus, what did he say?

152
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,837
What we all said, one year ago.

153
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,757
- Mr Henry would like to see you, sir.
- Very well.

154
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,954
Have Lieutenant Swanson
double the patrols for the next few nights.

155
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,234
We're closing up for lunch. Sorry.

156
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,477
Come back after lunch. After lunch. Sorry.

157
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,590
- You've heard from Kincaide?
- From Mr Kincaide himself.

158
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,835
He's coming to look it over tomorrow.

159
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,758
If there are no problems,
it should make us very rich.

160
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,032
- Have you talked to Burns?
- I thought maybe you should handle him.

161
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,479
He's no problem.

162
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,796
Speaking of problems,
what about Geronimo?

163
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,956
Bad timing.

164
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,434
Geronimo.

165
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,429
I'll have him broken in a couple of days,
just like the rest of them.

166
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,230
We have a new boy with us today, Giantah.

167
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,636
Would you please sit next to Mahila,
Giantah?

168
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,036
Mangus.

169
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,230
- I heard.
- You'll come with us?

170
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,750
Lt'll be like before.
You'll starve or they'll kill you.

171
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,429
- We need brave men.
- I have a wife and child.

172
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,040
You can bring them.

173
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,152
In a little while
my field will be rich with corn.

174
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,159
We'll have money. Maybe that's the answer.

175
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,873
You don't believe that.

176
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,151
No. But my wife, she does.

177
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,111
(Children laughing)

178
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,873
- That girl out there with the book.
- Teela. Do you like her?

179
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,708
- Is she a good cook?
- I wouldn't know. Why don't you ask her?

180
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,752
What do you think, Natchez?

181
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,870
Does it matter?

182
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,957
Boys should learn to be warriors,
not schoolteachers.

183
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,991
Huh, Mangus?

184
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,079
The big white cat runs and plays.

185
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,230
- Cat.
- (All) Cat.

186
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,918
- C...
- C.

187
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,518
...A...
- A.

188
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,516
...T.
- (Gasps)

189
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,916
Class is dismissed. Go on.

190
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,997
- Except for you, Giantah.
- C-A-T, cat.

191
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,750
Not that. You come and help me
get this arrow out of the book.

192
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,473
- When do you leave?
- Tonight or tomorrow. The first chance.

193
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,590
Will you change your mind?

194
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,273
But if I can help in any way.

195
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,153
Please come
and get your arrow out of my book.

196
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,316
- What?
- Your arrow.

197
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,511
You're right. It's a good arrow.
It shouldn't be wasted.

198
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,755
You'll get us all in trouble.

199
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,511
It's still good.

200
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,314
- Maybe it's time you learned to read.
- I know about cats and dogs.

201
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,874
- That isn't what the book's about.
- No?

202
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,912
To learn how to read and to read
are not the same.

203
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,919
- My father didn't read.
- Maybe if he did they'd respect you more.

204
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,349
I want respect for what I am,
not for what they want me to be.

205
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,633
But what you are
isn't good enough for them.

206
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,068
When you can read, when you can write,

207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,037
when you don't smell
of fish and horseflesh,

208
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,071
then maybe you will be.

209
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,439
- Who taught you that?
- Nobody taught me.

210
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,836
I looked around and I saw
and I'm improving myself.

211
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,395
- Are you ashamed of what you are?
- No.

212
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,477
- Of course not.
- Then act like it.

213
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,676
- Geronimo.
- Porica.

214
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,280
I'm having trouble finding her a husband.

215
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,230
- I wouldn't doubt it.
- For you, a special price. Nothing.

216
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,551
I'll think about it.

217
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,436
- Well?
- I didn't think it could be done.

218
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,072
Not in this desert.

219
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,998
If Mr Burns is agreeable,
I think we can do business.

220
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,235
- Fine. He's waiting for us now.
- Good.

221
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,511
Mr Kincaide is the owner
of the Arizona Land Investment Company.

222
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,634
That's a prosperous company. I've heard
about you. Your company, that is.

223
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,717
- Thank you.
- Mr Kincaide has a business proposal.

224
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,954
Oh?

225
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,949
50,000 acres up at Turkey Creek, Mr Burns.

226
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,798
You've turned wasteland
into top-grade pasture.

227
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,230
I want a place to run prime cattle
for the western beef market.

228
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,636
If you make the land available,
it'll be worth your while.

229
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,831
As I've already explained,
that is government land.

230
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,352
That's right, Mr Kincaide. We have
150 devoted souls working up there.

231
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,678
I thought you could move them anywhere
on the reservation. On your option.

232
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,950
I could, yes, I could.

233
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,515
But I would need an authorisation
for a major decision.

234
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,711
- Is this a major decision, Mr Burns?
- That would also be my option.

235
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,591
How long will it take
to get an authorisation?

236
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,995
Six, maybe seven months.

237
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,871
- You know Washington.
- (Splutters) Excuse me.

238
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,999
They don't pay much attention
to what's out here.

239
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,191
We're just
a forgotten little corner of the world.

240
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,711
The government's happy as long as
we keep the Apaches from causing trouble.

241
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,639
What's the problem, then?
Dollar an acre? 50,000 acres?

242
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,116
The normal land guarantees.

243
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,720
On the other hand,
even though they are savages,

244
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,797
there... is a moral obligation.

245
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,633
Of course, there are ways
of easing moral obligations, Mr Kincaide.

246
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,671
How much?

247
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,269
I'm sure the Lord recognises the devotion
of this reservation beyond what we're paid.

248
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,238
I'd say two dollars an acre.

249
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,272
In writing.

250
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,557
Done.

251
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,275
- Huera?
- Yes?

252
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,312
- Where's Mangus?
- There he is, in the field.

253
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,311
- You know.
- Yes.

254
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,909
It's a rumour. I don't believe it.
They wouldn't take away the land.

255
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,475
They wouldn't watch us break our backs
to make it work, then take it.

256
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,548
- What other promise have they kept?
- It's more than the land, Geronimo.

257
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,160
It was my way of finding
some peaceful answer.

258
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,395
It's better to find the truth.

259
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,111
(Muffled yelp)

260
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,516
What are you doing here? Get out of here.

261
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,154
We've come to find out the truth.

262
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,190
- What truth?
- About our land.

263
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,872
I don't know what you're talking about.

264
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,708
- Get out of here.
- Not until we find the truth.

265
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,670
There's only one truth, brother.

266
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,279
The truth of the Lord.

267
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,356
His sword is swift.

268
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,238
It smites down those who disbelieve.

269
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,271
I disbelieve.

270
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,439
You're a heathen, Geronimo.

271
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,789
Maybe the Lord will forgive you.

272
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,877
I heard you signed a new paper
that takes away the land.

273
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,708
Washington decides that, brother, not me.

274
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,958
- You've got to talk to Washington.
- He's not here. You are.

275
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,711
(Yelps)

276
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,756
- Is that the paper?
- No... Ah... yes.

277
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,236
- And you signed it?
- It was a mistake. I promise I'll tear it up.

278
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,350
Which hand signed the paper?

279
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,950
Which hand?

280
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,239
Pick it up.

281
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,031
Pick it up!

282
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,271
(Yells)

283
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,232
Tie her up.

284
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,748
Savages! Animals!

285
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,791
Apaches!

286
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,190
This'll hold you till the doctor gets here.

287
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,232
Captain. They've cut the lines.
We can't get through.

288
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,795
Ride to Bowie. Tell Crook
I'll prevent them crossing the border.

289
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,875
Yes, sir.

290
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,879
(Horse whinnying)

291
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,798
Tell them every horse counts.
Only warriors go.

292
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,354
If they have women, they ride double.

293
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,470
Porica, out.

294
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,473
- Get dressed. I'm going back to Mexico.
- I thought you would.

295
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,114
I've decided I need a woman.
I can teach you.

296
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,958
You need someone to teach you
how to be more than an animal.

297
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,151
- They're taking away the land.
- I know.

298
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,430
But it doesn't mean your way is right.

299
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,677
It's hopeless to fight any more.
Don't you understand?

300
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,996
You don't understand, but I'll change that.
Are you coming?

301
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,595
I asked you a question.

302
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,234
Is that all there is to your question?

303
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,874
Just that you need a woman?

304
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,435
Get up.

305
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,150
No.

306
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,757
- C Company ready for pursuit, sir.
- Very well.

307
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,473
There was a rumour
Burns was going to sell the land.

308
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,080
Yeah, I heard.

309
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,953
- Can I go?
- Sorry, Porica.

310
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,434
Take me with you, Geronimo. I can fight.

311
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,471
There's your horse.

312
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,913
- Let's go.
- Everybody, quick!

313
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,988
Wait here.

314
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,599
A Mexican border patrol.

315
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,879
I'll draw them off. Meet me at Vista Diablo.

316
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,509
(Geronimo yells)

317
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,279
Vámonos!

318
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,390
Right back where they were
a few days ago.

319
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,750
They learned a lot in those few days,
didn't they, Captain?

320
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,791
Be careful, Johnny.

321
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,994
One Apache. It's not worth it.

322
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,431
(Horse whinnies)

323
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,114
Get these guns cleaned and ready to use.

324
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,149
- Geronimo.
- We're going to fight them.

325
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,636
- Yes, I see.
- No, you don't see at all.

326
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,831
This time we don't fight just to stay alive,
like before.

327
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,871
This time, we declare war.

328
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,792
50 men declare war
against the whole United States?

329
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,154
- What kind of a war is that?
- Don't laugh at me.

330
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,512
I'm not laughing.
I'm crying because you're crazy.

331
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,348
Geronimo, we have no chance.
We can't win.

332
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,789
And we'll probably all die.

333
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,751
Even I know that.

334
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,711
No, Mangus.

335
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,751
We can win.

336
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,631
We can win because we have no chance
and yet we fight.

337
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,069
But we've got to fight long enough.

338
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,556
Long enough so the people
of the United States begin to wonder

339
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,637
why such a small handful of men

340
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,708
go on fighting a war
against such a big country as theirs.

341
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,469
Long enough until they ask themselves,

342
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,116
"Why do the Apaches starve and die
instead of surrender?"

343
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,954
That's when they'll begin to understand.

344
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,190
And when they do,
maybe their leader, Mr Washington himself,

345
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,913
will come right here,
and he'll have a new treaty.

346
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,228
A treaty that says how important it is
for all men to be proud and strong.

347
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,748
And believe in what they are.

348
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,030
I love you.

349
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,439
Of course, you have no sense.
You have a soul but no sense.

350
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,468
You think Mr Washington himself
will leave his house and come right here?

351
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,755
- I don't know.
- Well, who knows?

352
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,911
Maybe.

353
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,839
(Screams)

354
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,754
(Shouts of encouragement)

355
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,038
Company, halt!

356
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,437
- In the gully, sir.
- Forward, ho!

357
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,719
At San Carlos
I was waiting for an opportunity

358
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,638
to put a bullet through Geronimo.

359
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,310
I shouldn't have waited.
This time he's declared himself at war.

360
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,069
Maybe now we won't have to wait
for him to come to us.

361
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,517
Attention.

362
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,799
Gentlemen, we have just received
permission from the Mexican government

363
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,912
to cross the border in pursuit of Geronimo.

364
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,359
This is Colonel Morales.

365
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,868
He'll act as liaison
between our governments

366
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,992
and assign men
to accompany you on your details.

367
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,600
My government
is pleased to be of assistance.

368
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,191
With Mexico's aid, we've arranged to patrol
every river, every camping ground,

369
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,835
every possible route into the United States.

370
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,273
Now, God willing, we can bring an end
to this so-called war. Rest.

371
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,958
- General Crook? Sir?
- Yes?

372
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,149
- What about terms, General?
- Terms?

373
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,796
- Suppose they want to arbitrate?
- The orders are no terms.

374
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,559
Unconditional surrender.

375
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,915
Lieutenant, you were at San Carlos,
weren't you?

376
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,475
Lieutenant Delahay,
C Company, Third Cavalry.

377
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,428
What's bothering you, Lieutenant?

378
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,994
Just human compassion.
I know who I'm fighting.

379
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,233
I'm not sure I understand why.

380
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,395
I wouldn't think about it personally.

381
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,035
You can't afford to. It's a job.
That's the way you have to look at it.

382
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,352
Is that the way you look at it, sir?

383
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,678
Don't set yourself up as a judge,
Mr Delahay. That could be a fatal mistake.

384
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,075
Yes, sir.

385
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,109
Captain Watson, Captain Burke,
proceed with your companies

386
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,879
to the east and south of Hermosillo.

387
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,071
They're crossing all along here. And here.

388
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,277
They've signed a paper with Mexico.

389
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,073
They must have talked
with Mr Washington.

390
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,716
Right this minute he's probably saying,
"Now the Apaches will have to surrender."

391
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,072
We're running out of food.
Soon the patrols will be everywhere.

392
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,910
But they'll never find us up here.
Huh, Natchez? Never.

393
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,235
Mangus, it's almost time.

394
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,032
Oh.

395
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,479
Come.

396
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,191
North.

397
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,591
South.

398
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,631
East.

399
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,399
West.

400
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,628
(Crying)

401
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,393
The first step is always the most difficult.

402
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,916
He's a fine boy.

403
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,996
You notice he looks just like me?

404
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,190
I mean, my better side.

405
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,708
I mean, when I'm dead,

406
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,957
people will look at him and say,
"There goes Mangus.

407
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,389
"Handsome, wasn't he?"

408
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,230
Even in war, life...
life goes on.

409
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,630
Here, you ought to try it sometime.

410
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,911
Geronimo, what about Nitah? Hm?

411
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,951
- Nitah?
- My cousin.

412
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,151
She's right behind you. Don't turn around.

413
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,630
- No.
- Why not?

414
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,038
- She's my cousin. What's wrong with her?
- Nothing's wrong with her. She's a pig.

415
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,389
She's a pig.

416
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,318
(All coo and cheer)

417
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,833
May he be just like his father.

418
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,110
And he is too.

419
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,476
Here, you do it.

420
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,909
I-I'm sorry there are only flowers.
There wasn't enough food to go round.

421
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,435
I promise you there will be.

422
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,511
Quick.

423
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,631
Put up your hands.

424
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,830
Did you hear what I said? Put 'em up.

425
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,433
What do you think you're doing?
Those are my oats.

426
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,155
Dump those sacks back in that bin
right this instant.

427
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,952
Go on, dump 'em back.

428
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,228
(Shrieks)

429
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,913
You're hurting me.

430
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,352
Please, tell your men to get out of my barn.

431
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,031
They're hungry.

432
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,991
I... I got some chicken frying on the stove.

433
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,949
Oats ain't supposed to be ate like that
anyhow. Not like animals.

434
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,671
Well, come on.

435
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,233
I'm sorry it took so long.
Now there's enough for everybody.

436
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,077
No!

437
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,113
You got to sit down at the table,
like decent folks.

438
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,151
Well, sit down.

439
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,593
Not yet.

440
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,673
Billy, you go study. I can manage fine.

441
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,199
Bless this food, O Lord, in thy name.
Amen.

442
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,316
Now you can help yourselves.

443
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,589
- Go and study your spelling.
- But I want to look at them.

444
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,950
You can look at them later.
First you do these lessons.

445
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,958
When you're finished
you can come back and look at them.

446
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,117
- Hear me?
- It's women. They're all alike. You notice?

447
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,151
Always teaching.

448
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,594
Guest in the house or not, mister,
I don't allow chicken bones on the floor.

449
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,431
You hear?

450
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,516
Now, please pick it up.

451
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,431
Natchez.

452
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,996
Go outside and wait.

453
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,550
Everybody. Go on.

454
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,959
Whatever you're thinking, don't think it.

455
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,474
Where's your husband?

456
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,478
I expect he'll be home any time now.

457
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,678
He's a trapper. He comes and goes.

458
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,280
You know how it be with setting the snares.

459
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,788
He said he'd be home Monday week.

460
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,391
I looked on the monthly this morning,
and Monday week is today.

461
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,435
My husband's a strong man.
He's not afraid of nothing.

462
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,630
Don't!

463
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,389
You have to kill me first, I swear it.
You have to kill me first.

464
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,438
- Tell me about the boy.
- Don't you touch him.

465
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,471
Is he like his father?

466
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,510
(Menacingly) Is he like his father?

467
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,151
Well, yes.

468
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,555
Yes, I suppose in many ways he is.

469
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,871
Like I told you,
my husband's overdue coming home now.

470
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,516
- You'll see. And when he does...
- Your husband's dead, isn't he?

471
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,511
He's a fine-looking boy.

472
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,114
Through him your husband lives.

473
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,956
You go on, Mangus.
I've got something else to do.

474
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,911
Where is he going?

475
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,315
He's got something else to do.

476
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,595
"Meg had a cushion, Jo a book,

477
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,632
"Beth a basket and Amy a portfolio.

478
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,275
"All walked quietly through the garden,
out of the little back gate,

479
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,515
"and began to climb the hill."

480
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,030
What are you doing here?

481
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,355
I've come back for you. Get ready.

482
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,470
No. I told you before.

483
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,229
- I've decided to change your mind.
- You've decided?

484
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,955
Are you coming or do I have to take you?

485
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,231
Try. Go ahead. Try.

486
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,231
Here.

487
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,676
You're coming with me. I need you.

488
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,233
Why? You can find some other girl
to cook you food and chop you wood.

489
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,714
Get one of them. Don't ask me.

490
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,149
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

491
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,749
But I don't believe in you.
Don't you understand?

492
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,030
We'll talk about it later.

493
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,191
Go to sleep.

494
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,075
Halt.

495
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,196
(Gunshot)

496
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,431
We'll rest here.

497
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,352
- Your shoulder's hurt.
- It's all right.

498
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,594
- No, it's not.
- I didn't bring you along to nurse me.

499
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,674
Then why did you?

500
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,877
Teela, where did you grow up?

501
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,631
On the reservation, mostly.

502
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,558
They taught you things in books?

503
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,878
I'm gonna tell you a secret about the earth.
This isn't in any book.

504
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,035
The earth is pregnant. Everywhere.

505
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,629
Dig right there.

506
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,274
- What for?
- Why don't you find out?

507
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,469
Why don't you dig yourself?

508
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,193
See? The earth is filled with life.

509
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,954
Dig there.

510
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,919
Teela, I want you to be like the earth.
I want a son.

511
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,999
- I want you to want me.
- You'll bear my son. Isn't that enough?

512
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,270
I want you to want me.

513
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,678
(Horses' hooves clattering)

514
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,392
(Man) Get along!

515
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,429
- What did you see?
- Never mind.

516
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,834
- Huera will show you where we sleep.
- This way.

517
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,872
- I knew you were coming.
- You did?

518
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,913
Two wagons and a pack train
moving toward Hermosillo.

519
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,315
Enough food for a month or more.

520
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,797
Quick.

521
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,511
Let's go. Yah!

522
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,436
(Wild whinnying)

523
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,151
Yah!

524
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,678
- Nitah, where's Teela?
- In the jacal.

525
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,431
Here's some food.

526
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,791
Here's something else.

527
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,078
Thank you.

528
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,112
You could have gone back
while I was away.

529
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,678
Company... halt!

530
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,630
- Sargento, consígase un padre por ahí.
- Sí, teniente.

531
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,195
- I sent him to get a priest.
- Enough food for a month or more.

532
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,038
It's the lives I regret, señor.

533
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,318
You see, the captain has plans
for being rich and obscure.

534
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:59,196
With this, his plans are put off,
at least until the hostiles run out of rations.

535
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,229
The grain bins were guarded,
but not the chickens!

536
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,909
Your shoulder's hurt again.

537
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,320
Was the fighting bad this time?

538
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,952
I couldn't sleep.

539
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,515
I lay here all those nights and I thought,

540
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,759
"Now, tonight, Geronimo will die tonight

541
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,872
"because he has to prove himself brave."

542
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,797
That's what I thought.

543
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,831
You think too much.

544
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,589
I have no courage. I am not like you.

545
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,752
Why aren't you pregnant yet?

546
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,791
Why aren't you ever here?

547
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,037
- Would that help?
- Not any more.

548
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,116
Teela...

549
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,637
Let me feel him kick.

550
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,314
He's no bigger than a poppy seed.
Not right now.

551
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,352
- How do you know that?
- I read it somewhere.

552
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,875
- Show me.
- Not that book.

553
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,158
Teela, I've been thinking.

554
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,954
He'll be a fine warrior because of his father.
He has to be.

555
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,918
But maybe he should read too, huh?

556
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,271
How long can we go on?

557
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,630
Until he takes my place, if necessary.

558
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,671
Company, halt.

559
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,310
- How much longer will it be?
- No comment.

560
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,796
- Is Congress investigating you?
- Excuse me, please.

561
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,469
- We hear Washington's fit to be tied.
- No comment!

562
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,188
I take it you heard Congress is sending
a couple of senators to investigate us.

563
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,231
For our failure, gentlemen.

564
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,508
I'm very much afraid I can't argue the point.

565
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,758
We represent a great nation.
Manpower and facilities without limit.

566
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,268
Over 5,000 men in the field.

567
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,595
We can't bring to a successful conclusion

568
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,156
a campaign against a handful of Apaches
who must be low on food and ammunition.

569
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,671
Now you tell me why,
because I'm interested in knowing.

570
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:49,118
Now, then. We have some intelligence that
may give you the help you seem to need.

571
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,151
Colonel Morales.

572
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,397
The evaluation
of the combined scouting reports

573
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,193
narrows the location to somewhere in here.

574
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,755
Lacosardi on the west, Janos on the east.

575
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,791
Narrowed down to an area this size,

576
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,116
it shouldn't take a military genius
to find their hiding place.

577
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,151
And soon.

578
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,312
There are soldiers here and here
and at Horn Bend.

579
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,079
The mountain is
almost completely surrounded.

580
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,759
He's tired. Please let him rest.

581
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,916
We'll talk later.

582
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,438
Teela, you should rest too.

583
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,074
- Where did you go?
- To Janos.

584
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,635
I was careful. A doctor there
said he'd take care of your shoulder.

585
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,912
- I have everything ready. We can leave.
- I don't need a doctor.

586
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,674
Here. Show me how strong you are.

587
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,479
Show me.

588
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,631
Go on.

589
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,477
You have no right to lead anyone this way,
and you know it.

590
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,193
If you must die, at least die able to fight.

591
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,038
Mangus was right. Women are all the same.

592
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,992
Mangus was this, Natchez was that.
Please treat me...

593
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,077
- Quiet.
- I will not keep quiet.

594
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,908
- I have some clothes for you...
- I said keep quiet.

595
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,111
(Bells tinkling)

596
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,112
- Señorita?
- Yes?

597
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,151
You forgot your cantaro.

598
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,191
Gracias.

599
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,835
(Knocks)

600
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,110
- Well?
- The doctor said he'd see my husband.

601
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,833
- You got the money?
- Yes.

602
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,550
Go around the back.

603
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,074
This is my husband, Dr Sanchez.

604
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,873
Sit down.

605
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,911
Yaqui?

606
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,031
Apache.

607
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,751
Your wife told me about your arm,
Señor Martinez.

608
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,868
Let's take a look at it.

609
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,036
The wound is festered.
I'll have to clean it out.

610
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,037
- I'm gonna need some of this.
- Never mind the whiskey.

611
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,231
- I need it to clean...
- I said start without the whiskey.

612
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,317
- I'll get some.
- Across the street.

613
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,999
- Señorita?
- A bottle of whiskey, please.

614
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,555
- A bottle of whiskey? What kind?
- Any kind.

615
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,397
- Any kind?
- Please hurry.

616
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,875
Company, halt.

617
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,512
Dismount.

618
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,556
Two reales.

619
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,036
Three reales.

620
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,711
Five reales.

621
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,591
I'll take this one.

622
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,911
Hey.

623
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,951
Cómo estás, honey?

624
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,629
Teela!

625
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,119
Trouble!

626
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,513
Move!

627
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,792
- (Loud mooing)
- (lndistinct shouting)

628
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,192
Company, ho!

629
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,431
Yah! Hup!

630
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,873
Get back to the general. Tell him he should
close off the slope and move down.

631
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,911
- Yes, sir.
- Ho!

632
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,351
They're too close.

633
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,319
(Gunshot)

634
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,038
Old Indian trick. You never can tell.

635
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,359
Geronimo...

636
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,596
When Mr Washington
comes to talk with you,

637
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,551
tell him...

638
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,874
tell...

639
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,359
Mangus!

640
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,551
Mangus!

641
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,113
No more fires.

642
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,517
Mescal, Senator. It's very good.

643
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,348
If you read some of these, General,
you'd understand our position better.

644
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,517
Letters, newspaper articles,
pressure from all sides.

645
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,791
Some of them angry,
some simply asking for an explanation.

646
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,910
Like this one, a New York editorial.

647
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,111
"Are we overlooking some important
principle behind Geronimo's fight?"

648
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,391
Or this one.
"Are we fighting a war without honour?"

649
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,838
It's hardly a war.

650
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,792
(Senator) It's still the same question.

651
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,310
We're asking it of you because
it's being asked of us by the people.

652
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,033
For three months,
since that encounter in Janos,

653
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,355
Geronimo's attacks have been diminishing.

654
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,393
They're facing starvation.
They can't have much ammunition.

655
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,591
- It's a hopeless position.
- Why doesn't he surrender?

656
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,236
You've got to understand,

657
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,829
the man's occupying an area
that's like a maze.

658
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,509
500 square miles
of some of the wildest country in Mexico.

659
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,676
We're patrolling it the best way we can.

660
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,188
You still haven't answered my question.

661
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,877
Why does any man hold out
in the face of impossible odds?

662
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,510
I don't know the answer to that one.
I'm a soldier, not a philosopher.

663
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,070
The rest of the committee's in San Carlos.

664
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,078
I'm waiting for their report.
We'll have the answers.

665
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,237
Yes. You may not need them.

666
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:23,593
Someday our patrols will find their hiding
place and you'll have your surrender.

667
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,631
And that'll be that.

668
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,473
When the time comes,
you lie down and hold on to the post.

669
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,789
Kill your baby, Teela. Don't let him live.
Don't watch him die of hunger like mine.

670
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,831
Kill him!

671
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,231
Whoa!

672
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,317
(Soldier) See anything?
(Guide) Not yet, sir.

673
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,071
You go on.

674
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,352
Whoa!

675
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,392
- Any sign?
- Broken branches, berries picked.

676
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,389
- They're up there somewhere.
- Let's turn around, get back to Maynard.

677
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,711
Get back to Maynard!

678
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,392
(Gunfire continuing)

679
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,631
Get their guns and ammunition.

680
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,671
Hurry!

681
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,513
How soon will more soldiers be here?

682
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,551
Soon enough.

683
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,994
That poppy seed,
you sure it wasn't a watermelon?

684
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,396
Leave me alone.
Just let me have my baby in peace.

685
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,839
(Horse whinnies)

686
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,512
They've gotten to the river
and camped there for the night.

687
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,552
- How many men?
- I don't know. 100, maybe.

688
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,638
- 100 against 20.
- Santo just died.

689
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,754
19.

690
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,349
They're blocking the north canyon.
There's no escape.

691
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,069
- We want to talk about surrender.
- No. No surrender.

692
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:55,796
We're beaten! What you fought for means
nothing to them. It's all been for nothing.

693
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,435
She's a woman
and she thinks like a woman.

694
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,630
Is there any other woman here?

695
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,072
When they get here we'll be ready for them.

696
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,432
Company, halt!

697
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,471
Well, there it is, sir.

698
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,555
And you can figure they're watching us.

699
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,875
I always do, but I'll make sure.

700
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,037
Prepare to dismount. Dismount.

701
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,589
With your rifles, arm.

702
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:06,108
Company, ho!

703
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:10,358
Company, halt!

704
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,358
Prepare to kneel.

705
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,470
Kneel.

706
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,711
Prepare to fire.

707
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,196
Fire.

708
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,798
They're out of range.

709
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,195
Save your ammunition.

710
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:43,676
Find the general. Tell him they're trapped.
Tell him just one cannon's all I need.

711
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,792
- Yes, sir.
- Ride two horses into the ground.

712
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,799
Giantah.

713
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,671
See where he's going.

714
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,473
- How much ammunition?
- About 300 rounds.

715
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,829
300.

716
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:31,471
- They've sent for a cannon. It's on the way.
- (Concerned murmuring)

717
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,636
Are you beaten by one cannon?

718
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,433
A cannon that hasn't been fired yet?

719
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,914
Go on, get back to your positions.

720
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,552
General, I've just received that report
from Washington.

721
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,674
- Can you ride a horse, Senator?
- What?

722
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,792
I'm afraid your report arrived
an hour too late.

723
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,597
Lieutenant.

724
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,598
What would you say
is the range of the target?

725
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,949
About 340 yards, sir.

726
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,313
Very well. Set range for 310 yards.
We'll fire short.

727
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,395
Yes, sir.

728
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,796
- Set range at 310 yards.
- Yes, sir.

729
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,751
They're almost ready.

730
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,111
It's too far from here.

731
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,951
Cannon's ready to fire, sir.

732
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,991
Fire.

733
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,396
Reload. Set range for 20 yards
beyond the target centre.

734
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,429
Yes, sir.

735
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,756
Reload. Set range for 360 yards.

736
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,875
We're not high enough.

737
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,229
The cannon's ready, sir.

738
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,998
Fire.

739
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:00,155
Reload. Set range for 340 yards. On target.

740
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,716
But you'll annihilate them.

741
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,753
I suggest you give them the opportunity
to surrender first.

742
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,597
I suggest you reload.

743
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,433
Lieutenant?

744
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,918
Quick.

745
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,356
You're under a direct military order.
Reload.

746
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,876
Reload. Adjust cannon to target.

747
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,070
Yes, sir.

748
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,232
Don't worry, Johnny, I won't press charges.

749
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,875
Is it hate, Captain? Or is it fear?

750
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,956
I said I wouldn't press charges.

751
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,991
I'd prefer it if you did.

752
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,550
More powder and double shot.

753
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,554
Hurry.

754
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,310
- Aren't you ready?
- Another moment.

755
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,475
Come on!

756
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,314
Maynard!

757
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,551
(Screams)

758
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,591
(Teela screams)

759
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,309
(Slaps, baby crying)

760
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,791
You have a son.

761
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,633
Don't touch him. Don't ever touch him.

762
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,068
- We can't fight any longer.
- Yes, you can.

763
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,032
Are you waiting for the gods to save you?
Nobody else can.

764
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,435
- Don't talk.
- No.

765
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:17,278
If you won't listen to me,
you'll listen to the baby.

766
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:22,792
He'll die like the others died,
because I have no milk to give him.

767
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,392
I have nothing and neither do you.

768
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,874
If we go back to San Carlos,
at least we can live.

769
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,034
No.

770
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,830
Please. I beg you.

771
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,792
Understand me.

772
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,030
I do. I think I always have.

773
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,069
(Baby murmurs)

774
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,274
Teela.

775
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:03,189
When I left San Carlos, I believed
in fighting. It was the only way I knew.

776
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,358
Every night since then,
I've thought about surrender.

777
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,073
I've wondered if I was right

778
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:14,079
and I've been afraid
because I don't want to die either.

779
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,430
But today when I look at you

780
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,393
and I see our child in your arms,

781
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,637
I stop wondering and I stop being afraid.

782
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,148
Now, even more, I must stay.

783
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,671
You take the women and surrender.
They won't hurt you.

784
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,151
We'll stay too.

785
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,471
Geronimo!

786
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,871
Quick.

787
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,675
Natchez,
you see the man with the long coat?

788
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,711
Geronimo!

789
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,991
We want to talk.

01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,434
- That's Geronimo?
- Yes, sir.

791
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,119
Geronimo?

792
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,350
Mr Washington?

793
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:44,833
Geronimo, Senator Conrad
represents President Cleveland.

794
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,990
Washington is the city
where Mr Cleveland lives.

795
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,796
The president has asked me
to come here and talk with you.

796
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,754
He thinks there might be a way
for us to settle our differences

797
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,236
with a greater understanding
on both sides.

798
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,312
He feels that if we ask you
to live under our laws,

799
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,835
then these laws should give you
the respect and dignity

800
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,235
that is your rightful heritage.

801
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,871
We're going down.
