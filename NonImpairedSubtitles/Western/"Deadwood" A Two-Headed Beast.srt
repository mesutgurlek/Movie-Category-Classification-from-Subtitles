1
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,340
" A Two-Headed Beast "

2
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,780
Engine room!

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,440
This is the Captain!

4
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,020
Throw coal to the fuckin' boiler!

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,930
And a hard right rudder!

6
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,310
Hello, the galley!

7
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,230
Fuckin' jeroboam of champagne to the bridge immediately!

8
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,330
Uh, Mr. T.

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,630
Uh,

10
00:01:58,377 --> 00:01:58,911
brief uh,

11
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:00,191
idle time, uh,

12
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,914
a harmless, uh,

13
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:02,899
wilin' away

14
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,461
I'm considering, Con,

15
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,670
being Swearengen's decided a

16
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,753
underling'll represent him in certain of our mutual transactions,

17
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:12,311
would it be my seemly tactic

18
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,242
to do likewise?

19
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:16,352
Hmm

20
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:20,273
I'd need to know my man had discipline and

21
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:22,763
appetites in fuckin' harness and the like

22
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:26,990
Well, what this is, Sir, uh…

23
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,333
yesterday, I occasioned to fuck a woman

24
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:33,160
after a considerable period of abstention,

25
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,050
and that seems now to have…

26
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:36,220
throwed me

27
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:38,430
unawares, uh,

28
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,550
into a fuckin' spasm of

29
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:42,690
sex interest,

30
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:44,641
which I…

31
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:46,941
fuckin' pray will be brief

32
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,483
Well…

33
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,840
I believe I'll

34
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:56,321
defer enlisting you in this other aspect

35
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,581
Prudent, Sir,

36
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,471
till I get well on the other fuckin' side

37
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,600
Iceberg fuckin' avoided

38
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,442
Looming fuckin' catastrophe

39
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,860
Mr. Tolliver and Mr. Swearengen are…

40
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:22,241
uneasy colleagues

41
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:23,900
I wouldn't know, Sir

42
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,772
That feels to me less than a full verity

43
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,113
I don't know what that means, Mr. Hearst

44
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:33,672
That you not knowin' about any

45
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,413
uneasiness between Tolliver and Swearengen

46
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:38,951
sounds to me like a lie

47
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:39,861
Yeah

48
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:41,320
I guess so

49
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:42,413
Better

50
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,890
Would you want me saying my first loyalty was to you, Mr. Hearst,

51
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:52,623
to verity instead of Mr. Swearengen?

52
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,830
hat'd sound like a lie too, and peg me a liar in the bargain

53
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:58,643
So I'll have to win you away

54
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,443
I guess so

55
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,691
But I oughtn't to imagine the process will be quick

56
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:05,380
Guess not

57
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,261
Good, Adams

58
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,000
Did he coach you long?

59
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,210
Didn't fuckin' coach me at all, Mr. Hearst

60
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,293
Captain Turner

61
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,541
Go tell your friend I know he's afraid of me

62
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,650
Dority? Big guy?

63
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,423
I guess he looks big to you

64
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:38,131
Is that what you brought me here for?

65
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,510
You want me to take that back to Dority?

66
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:41,453
I guess so

67
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,613
Crazy nigger at the livery's in your debt

68
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,131
Crazy nigger at the livery ought not plan on this becomin' no habit

69
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,790
No chance of that

70
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,401
He's bound for Oregon, Miss Lady,

71
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:01,011
with the handsome nigger you're talkin' to right now, if our luck holds to the afternoon

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,160
Get off your ass and start to walkin'

73
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,851
Your friend might get to eat that warm

74
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:07,951
Go ahead

75
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,041
Put a hole in that thing

76
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm measuring the stroke to move you along with the rest of this shit

77
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:16,813
Much obliged!

78
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,451
Travel safe

79
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:28,372
Biggest day of my Goddamn life, and I get a fuckin' spittoon spilled over my head

80
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,432
That you already knocked on its side when you were fuckin' dozing

81
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm glad I did it

82
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:37,513
I've enough blood and guts spilt in my Goddamn place, Steve

83
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,632
For a lifetime, you understand?!

84
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,742
If it takes the contents of a spittoon to make you fuckin' wash,

85
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,982
then so fuckin' be it!

86
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,093
What does washin' have to do with the other, Tom?

87
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:55,440
Well, to put you on the fuckin' path, fuckin' respect yourself,

88
00:05:55,976 --> 00:06:01,492
and the fuckin' occasion, and bring no more fuckin' shame onto my place, God damn it!

89
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:12,491
After  I own the livery, you slanty-eyed bastards,

90
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,261
maybe you'd like to come by and look at me then!

91
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,693
Now get the fuck outta here!

92
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:20,760
Here!

93
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,463
Harry, what time is it?

94
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,292
Hour's 17 minutes till 10:00

95
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:30,583
67 minutes until my fuckin' luck changes forever

96
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,752
No harm in him showin' up early

97
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,550
You've done this camp a great service, Mrs. Ellsworth

98
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:44,540
You're very kind

99
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:51,023
And yet, Mr. Merrick, in candor,

100
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,542
witnessing the events of late in the east,

101
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,352
oughtn't any depositor pause and consider

102
00:06:58,805 --> 00:06:59,860
before trusting

103
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,132
his savings to a bank?

104
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,360
Uh, well, I suppose that's true

105
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,282
Which is why

106
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,711
a bank owned locally

107
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:21,361
wishing to make available funds to organize and develop our community…

108
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,361
to build businesses

109
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:24,761
and homes,

110
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:30,631
and whose deposits are guaranteed by gold not two miles distant from

111
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,973
this building in which we sit,

112
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:34,461
isn't that

113
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:39,053
why the depositor at the Bank of Deadwood, having considered,

114
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,292
ought come forward in assurance and confidence

115
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,021
Yes!

116
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:46,342
Yes

117
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:53,681
Have you any questions for me?

118
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:56,743
I have not, Madam

119
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:57,230
Not

120
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:58,123
not at the present moment

121
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:35,710
Well,  I guess that argues for me showing Captain Cuntface how Goddamn afraid I am

122
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,122
It wasn't aftertalk between you and Turner?

123
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:40,971
Hearst was there when Turner said it,

124
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,381
and Hearst I asked did he want it brought back to you

125
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,943
Hearst says to me, "I guess so."

126
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:48,840
"Guess so" don't sound like Hearst

127
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:50,301
I'd said "I guess so" before

128
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:51,690
I think he was making small of me

129
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:58,793
What is there to consider over, Al?

130
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,920
That sea creature Turner called me out

131
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:03,523
It's Hearst calling you out

132
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,362
I'm trying to decipher his reason

133
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:08,710
Well, me seein' to Turner will not delay your Goddamn decipherin'

134
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:11,852
Can you shut up now, Dan, that you fuckin' couldn't before?

135
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:12,503
He hurt you,

136
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,320
then he calls to you like a dog

137
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,542
I had to tell him to fuck himself

138
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:21,591
Even as I forbore till I could see to my fuckin' arrangements

139
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,421
Think they'll get seen to by the snows?

140
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:50,800
Ready your pen

141
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,193
You're addressing me like a fuckin' field hand won't impede me cooperatin'

142
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,863
Now go!

143
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:04,642
That

144
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:05,841
that's it, Hostetler

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,824
'Cause I keep my sense of priority on what the fuck is important

146
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,089
I broke your fuckin' tip

147
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:31,350
"Mrs. Alma Ellsworth, serene and comely principal of the just opened Deadwood Bank,

148
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:37,750
assured this reporter that depositors need fear no local echo of eastern financial panics

149
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:39,550
A locally-owned bank

150
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:42,483
Careful, be careful

151
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,232
Uh, "Lending to develop businesses and build homes in the region,

152
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:52,260
and backed by the underground assets of one of the strongest mining concerns in the Dakota territory,

153
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:53,923
such a bank cannot help but

154
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,613
Do you mind if we, uh,

155
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,183
walk on more level ground, Mr. Blazanov?

156
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:00,710
Oh, no no no no

157
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:01,923
I'll watch out for livestock

158
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:02,392
Thank you

159
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:09,252
"Such a bank cannot help but draw prudent customers in great numbers from every area of our black hills."

160
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,280
Mrs. Ellsworth, being so elevated,

161
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,160
so sweetly radiant in spirit,

162
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:22,743
I wonder if her words resonated with me at the time as being

163
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:26,393
more poetic and compelling than

164
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:28,133
now they seem in cold transcription

165
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:29,932
And with the lady herself absent

166
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,283
This is bad

167
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:39,232
To abandon a friend like that when he's taken by drink

168
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,200
I think this is more woeful, Mr. Merrick

169
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,741
We shall fetch the Sheriff, Mr. Blazanov

170
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:11,600
Leon

171
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,083
Mr. Tolliver

172
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:20,300
That's a guilty skulkin' fuckin' look on your features, son

173
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:26,711
I think by now you'd be more come to terms with your weaknesses

174
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,410
Merciless conscience, Sir, since childhood

175
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:32,833
You're buyin' drugs?

176
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,351
I was buying drugs, yes, Sir

177
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,591
That is the fuckin' cross my weakness has to bear

178
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,813
And do you bear it for yourself alone, Leon,

179
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,851
or long as you're about it, with others as well and earn

180
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,843
the extra dollar thereby?

181
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:49,550
I do not do that, Sir, no

182
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,722
I got to wonder, son…

183
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,500
is it you been helpin' Lila in her fall?

184
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:58,680
It is not, Mr. Tolliver

185
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,051
Lila drops her own bucket down the well

186
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:02,572
I'm telling you, Sir!

187
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:06,200
Takin' a whore o' yours down, that's next to directly robbing you

188
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:07,841
Fella like me that's been

189
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,033
indisposed

190
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,732
To show he's back in play might

191
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:15,941
cut a thief's throat

192
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,941
You're fuckin' misinterpreting it. I

193
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,182
I was copping for another but it wasn't fuckin' Lila

194
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:25,742
I was coppin' for that cunt at the bank

195
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,410
Their faces weren't familiar,

196
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,561
the  men who left him here

197
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,331
His name was Pasco

198
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,050
Does Pasco have a friend here?

199
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:04,601
How do you know his name?

200
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,813
Cornishman, talked Union

201
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:08,680
Worked for Hearst

202
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,282
Do you feel there's a significance to that?

203
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:17,771
The third of those organizers's been killed

204
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,330
You  got nothin' to say to that or on any other fuckin' topic

205
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,562
On Hearst's orders, you believe?

206
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,700
A knife to the chest,

207
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,581
body atop Hearst's works in the thoroughfare

208
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,463
I withdraw from our agreement

209
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,062
I'd ask it's very brief extension

210
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,873
No. No

211
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,960
Or we're both just fuckin' cowards

212
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,711
I ain't no fucking coward!

213
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:44,000
Though Dan might support your position

214
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:52,300
What's he talking about?

215
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:56,400
Wait a bit, Bullock

216
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,171
Don't go for Hearst yet

217
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,342
You know Al

218
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:08,120
I've got the briefest of other bidness

219
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,093
See to it

220
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,090
Yes, s-see to it, Bullock

221
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:47,560
Watching us advance on your stupid teepee, Chief,

222
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:49,861
knowing you had to make your move…

223
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:59,613
did you not just want first to fucking understand? Huh?

224
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:17,691
Your repayment of the loan we make you now, Mr. Fields,

225
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,831
whose proceeds purchase Mr. Hostetler's livery,

226
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:27,162
is secured by the livery deed itself to be held as collateral

227
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:32,081
in the possession of the bank until the debt shall be satisfied

228
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:35,091
Understood and agreed to

229
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:38,832
And don't lose one second to wakefulness or worry

230
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,280
I'll repay in a timely fashion

231
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:50,571
Will you be paid in specie or currency, Mr. Hostetler?

232
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,421
Gold, please

233
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:05,750
Thank you, Trixie

234
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,592
I don't suppose a handshake

235
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:19,423
signaling the

236
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:23,211
transaction's completion is absolutely required

237
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,420
Then I guess we don't have to do it then

238
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:54,283
And if you're hoping to pass as a man before you hightail it to Oregon,

239
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,153
you will return to me that board you made me sign

240
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,943
Thank you so much for squiring me,

241
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:21,670
these gentlemen being so obviously compelled by other responsibilities

242
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,690
Such acid scrutiny by former boon companions

243
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,933
We was never your fucking boon companions, E.B

244
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,012
Forgive me my confusing, Dan,

245
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:38,691
my own deep feelings for you with what yours may have been for me

246
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,463
I did not offer my hotel to Hearst

247
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,231
which sale has made me outcast among you

248
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,611
Hearst forced the transaction upon me

249
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,013
I miss our morning coffee

250
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:07,171
Yeah?

251
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,572
Bein' no one is frequenting the main bar, Davey,

252
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:24,122
what in fuck business you think you're gonna do standing behind there?

253
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,160
Boss says I'm to attend the auxiliary bar

254
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:32,103
The auxiliary bar ain't made a cunt's hair bit of business sense since it's fuckin' inception!

255
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,402
Go on up and set the boss straight

256
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,141
Hey, you don't want to take that smart-aleck tone,

257
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:43,741
that fuckin' attitude with me, Davey

258
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:44,483
You hear me?

259
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:47,943
Hearst organizes violence between his man and Dority

260
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:48,720
Does he?

261
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:51,452
Orchestrates  combat between them, mutilates me,

262
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,712
plants that organizer's body like a flag in the fuckin' thoroughfare

263
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,162
That last is fresh news

264
00:19:56,805 --> 00:20:01,292
Makes of me and Tolliver a two-headed beast to savage

265
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:05,180
what might be healthy borne out of the fucking election and gnaw its own privates off-hours

266
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:11,652
Plans keep coming to the cocksucker that their final sum is this:

267
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:16,313
But for what brings income to him, break what he can;

268
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:16,652
what he can't,

269
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:21,152
set those parts against themselves to weaken

270
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:22,160
Scoundrel!

271
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:26,251
Hearst

272
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:33,292
The why's

273
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,673
what fucking confounds me

274
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,640
What's in his head, I cannot fucking find in mine

275
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,373
Don't suppose you talk to the Captain?

276
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,713
Hails and farewells, but he never replies

277
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:48,751
Or the cook?

278
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,001
The negress and I are not intimate

279
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,082
Alright, E.B

280
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:54,780
May I ask your plans, Al?

281
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:55,680
No

282
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:58,411
Only to further their achievement

283
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,033
No

284
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:01,613
All right

285
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:03,612
All right

286
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:08,813
Yeah

287
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:15,951
Glad to have been of help

288
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:18,221
Always available for counsel

289
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,032
I dare not think what you've been through to reach us

290
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,620
It's been a crucifixion

291
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,010
Too painful, even the merest details

292
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,413
Formidable, even at bay

293
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:01,882
My last camp, Jack

294
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:04,073
As it may be for us all, young man

295
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:09,072
The place is yearning for elevation and festering with wealth

296
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:10,671
Oh dear

297
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,562
Augment of cupidity in the Iris, a healthy augury

298
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:20,332
We must help them however we can

299
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:27,310
Heave ho, young man, but slowly

300
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,241
It's past me

301
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:37,590
I cannot figure the fuckin' angle

302
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,071
Go ahead and fucking fight him

303
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,073
All right then

304
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:01,280
What you want to be carryin', Dan?

305
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,601
Nothing I would want found secreted on me,

306
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:05,651
worse comes to worst

307
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:07,763
Well don't say you ain't bringing your blade

308
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:13,362
Naked, visible in it's fuckin' sheath and disposable before we join

309
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:16,622
If he dispenses with his

310
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,823
If it's getting to go wrong, Dan,

311
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,591
you just drop down flat

312
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:25,903
What the fuck did you just say?

313
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:27,640
Drop flat if it's going wrong,

314
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,673
and I'll blow his fucking head off

315
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,263
You do and it'll be the last Goddamn thing you do on this fucking earth

316
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,552
Going wrong is not the end of fucking things, Johnny

317
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:39,931
Fuck no!

318
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:45,271
I have come back from plenty of shit that looked like it was going wrong

319
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:47,242
All right, Dan

320
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,631
He's got the advantage of you there, don't he?

321
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,332
That short-cropped fucking hair?

322
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,330
Well, he's not lacking for brass

323
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:08,113
"Come scare me in the thoroughfare."

324
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:15,521
Star City, Captain, you remember the man's name?

325
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,000
Leonard

326
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,140
That was a fight

327
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:24,031
Not how I remember

328
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:29,351
…As an object lesson to every man watching

329
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:31,263
For not much fight,

330
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,190
it did not end quickly I suppose is what I'm trying to say

331
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:35,942
Do you understand me?

332
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,042
Yes, I understand

333
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,001
Thank you, Jack

334
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,130
I am your Jack, Chesterton,

335
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:31,613
but your producer too

336
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,782
A rigor we've always sustained

337
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:41,092
To carry a performer through illness when recovery is in prospect

338
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:44,900
is an indulgence one can sometimes justify

339
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:49,512
But  support of idleness destined for the grave,

340
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,093
that, Chesterton,

341
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:55,031
the narrow economy of our art

342
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:57,142
does not permit

343
00:30:59,327 --> 00:31:02,132
You would have me die destitute?

344
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,542
You will purchase your keep with that voice

345
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:07,430
intrusive and incessantly opinionated

346
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:11,103
no vagary of our past has yet stilled

347
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:13,481
The subject?

348
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:14,701
We have but one

349
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,321
In this instance, the theater is formerly a bordello

350
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:23,250
The eye lines must be all wrong

351
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,242
In the morning,

352
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:32,092
it meets with your atrabilious scrutiny

353
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:46,863
Oh…

354
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,312
I must rest

355
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:08,591
Bellegarde?

356
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:11,770
We proceed

357
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:17,842
Costumes, Countess, will you chair?

358
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:18,580
Ja

359
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,161
Props and scenery, chair?

360
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,493
Only if you serve as second

361
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:26,092
I'm so so so so sorry

362
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:28,090
Is costumes taken?

363
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:29,833
Are they performing now?

364
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:30,681
Quiet

365
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:35,713
Civic relations

366
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,861
I'd appoint myself…

367
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:40,002
without objection?

368
00:32:42,256 --> 00:32:44,710
Will we continue as if all among us are well

369
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:47,763
when one so plainly is not?

370
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,083
And what committee, Bellegard,

371
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,062
to address the old man's mortal illness would you have us fucking form?

372
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:55,011
No committee

373
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:56,823
Committees is the task before us

374
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,191
No business as usual

375
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,283
Business and tasks is what we'll have,

376
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:05,572
just as you are tardy and ginger on your bum for the usual fucking reasons,

377
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,361
despite your deep personal grief

378
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,283
Not offered as a case for change

379
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,072
Civic relations is me,

380
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:22,420
and we'll include here a subcommittee for the renovation of the bordello

381
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:24,081
Supervision of the work, subcommittee head

382
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,540
Countess, done, with thanks

383
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,313
Civic relations, construction, Claudia

384
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:35,313
Countess is the second

385
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,391
Hiring laborers

386
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,243
A truth divinely writ:

387
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,900
we make more devotees of theater

388
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:51,061
engaging 20 laborers at $2 apiece than two of the same at $20

389
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:57,513
Busy busy busy

390
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:01,372
Is he receiving as yet?

391
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:03,052
Let me go see

392
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,421
Tell him last fucking call

393
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:17,693
Broken bones mortally interfering with organs is what I would like to rule out

394
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,700
Doc's back, Dan

395
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:27,471
Don't need the fucking Doc

396
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:28,802
Come on, Dan

397
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:30,831
Let him look at you

398
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,153
He come back special

399
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,320
You heard what the fuck I said

400
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:37,920
He wants to poke around in some innards,

401
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:39,762
tell him to work on the one I killed

402
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:45,211
Bottle?

403
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:47,883
One of the girls?

404
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:51,491
There's a clamoring line to see to you

405
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:53,963
Get the fuck out of here, Johnny

406
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:56,503
Sure

407
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,170
Listen for

408
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:20,800
raspy fucking shallow breathing in the course of the fucking night

409
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:25,123
Him going blue too, would hint to you to fucking come get me

410
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:26,682
Definitely

411
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,813
Have you ample towels?

412
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,451
Uh, ample, thank you

413
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,392
Enough hot water?

414
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:19,262
Well, I could almost wish it cooler

415
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,691
May I help you with your back?

416
00:37:38,097 --> 00:37:38,793
What?

417
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,160
Scrubbing your back

418
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:48,063
Uh, I'm out--now

419
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:51,200
Thanks anyhow

420
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:12,493
Does it occur to you, banging repeatedly on the fucking wall,

421
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:13,841
either I'm not in

422
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:15,822
which makes what you're doing stupid

423
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,343
or being in, don't want to see you

424
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:20,971
which makes you a pain in my balls!?

425
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:27,280
Doubtless now nodding agreement like little boy fucking lost

426
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:43,960
What?

427
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:45,910
Hello

428
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,670
You fucking work at the bank

429
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:50,862
I do now

430
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:53,743
Not a noble "Hello" at opening,

431
00:38:54,437 --> 00:38:56,831
and regal fucking look-by at the closing up of shop?

432
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm at the hardware store all day, Trixie

433
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:00,641
I'll switch with you

434
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:03,622
Bank's a Jew's proper province anyways

435
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:06,143
along with the addled self-deceived

436
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:09,091
Our depositors?

437
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,520
The bank's founder and president, Chief Officer, as well,

438
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:17,280
of air-headed smugness and headlong plunges unawares into the fucking abyss

439
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,240
I-I don't understand

440
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,293
You wouldn't

441
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,233
You're too fucking healthy-minded

442
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:29,123
You'll sit here waiting for me to materialize from a piece of fucking furniture and think the world is normal

443
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,181
Do you want to get fucked or not?

444
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,042
Please

445
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:45,360
Your hair looks like a porcupine

446
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:47,581
Forgot the brush

447
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:58,550
Do you mind?

448
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:00,143
Well, no no no

449
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:02,053
That's…

450
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:06,091
How's it now?

451
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:07,543
Better

452
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,072
Thanks very much

453
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:12,693
I haven't finished

454
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,850
Oh, go ahead then

455
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:16,863
Go on

456
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:24,603
Presentable?

457
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:26,490
Very

458
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,552
You're young for failing eyesight

459
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:41,730
Spiny too, like a porcupine?

460
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:43,832
Huh-uh

461
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,103
I guess it'd be unmanly to

462
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,040
fear I may faint

463
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:13,423
Please don't

464
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:06,990
I'll make some arrangement

465
00:42:09,517 --> 00:42:10,553
What do you mean?

466
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:14,161
For my things and the like

467
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:17,693
arrange to collect my things

468
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:26,130
Will you have me…

469
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,892
bring the little one back?

470
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:34,433
I'll collect Sofia

471
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:35,611
Don't forget

472
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,251
5 hours looking for this Goddamn board

473
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:48,372
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah

474
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,221
Think this is pretty fucking funny, don't you, Hostetler?

475
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:58,642
No

476
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:03,032
Watch me crawl around here like a Goddamn fool,

477
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:05,770
and you laughing up your fucking sleeve

478
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,783
Hostetler don't know where the board is

479
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:11,432
I'm the one hid it

480
00:43:12,608 --> 00:43:13,950
Oh, I believe that

481
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,100
Definitely

482
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:17,603
Assisstant fucking baboon

483
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,363
You hid it, he don't know where and you can't remember where it is!

484
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:25,213
I wasn't too drunk not to know I should hide it,

485
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,203
but I was too drunk to keep track of where

486
00:43:40,957 --> 00:43:41,661
Is this it?

487
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:42,823
Is this the board?

488
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,913
Clean it the fuck off!

489
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:51,020
Well, yeah. Ha ha ha

490
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,253
Bring it here. Bring it in

491
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:55,903
Unwrap that cocksucker!

492
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,653
What the fuck is that supposed to be?

493
00:44:20,315 --> 00:44:21,282
Give him the board

494
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:25,503
You think I'm a fucking moron?

495
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:30,882
You think I'm a moron to fall for your fucking lies

496
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:32,282
Don't you call me dishonest

497
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:33,820
I'll call you that and worse

498
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:38,040
You hand me that then ride off with the actual board?

499
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:41,303
This is the actual board, wrapped in the cheesecloth that I stole off a horse

500
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:48,202
I never knew this board was took from where I had it until I looked for it during last night,

501
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,362
and that's when he told me that he had hid it

502
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,081
To keep you from doing something stupid

503
00:44:54,747 --> 00:44:56,813
This is the board!

504
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,401
For Christ's sake, what difference does the rest of it make?

505
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,583
I don't know it's the actual board

506
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:03,331
There's no more fucking writing on it!

507
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,730
Shall I accept myself as satisfied,

508
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,683
only for Hostetler once escaped

509
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:10,902
to send the real fucking board back from Cheyenne

510
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:13,592
while he's laughing up his lying sleeve?

511
00:45:15,997 --> 00:45:19,852
For Bullock to open the package and humiliate me?

512
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:24,681
Or for the fucking bank woman to humiliate me with the true fucking board?

513
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:29,590
Or to revoke my fucking security on my fucking loan?

514
00:45:30,508 --> 00:45:34,122
Or whatever your fucked-up plan is to make me a fucking cunt!

515
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:38,412
I will not be called a fucking liar

516
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:41,183
I didn't live my life for that

517
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,522
Yeah, fuck you, Steve

518
00:45:43,025 --> 00:45:43,692
We're leaving

519
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:45,530
Talk stupid to our fucking dust!

520
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:13,531
Yeah?

521
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:19,792
I wish you'd look in on Dan, boss

522
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,833
Not for being poorly as…

523
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:24,831
down

524
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:26,813
Johnny,…

525
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,773
some shit's best walked through alone

526
00:46:31,868 --> 00:46:33,092
Dan's killed people before

527
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:33,812
You have too

528
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:37,122
But neither've been solitary after

529
00:46:37,657 --> 00:46:38,741
A fair fight,

530
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:43,273
something Dan and I have always struggled to avoid, is different

531
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,410
You see the light go out of their eyes

532
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:49,260
It's just you left

533
00:46:50,427 --> 00:46:51,491
and death

534
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,783
So that's why Dan wants to be alone

535
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:56,533
He knows where to find me

536
00:47:01,338 --> 00:47:02,032
Sit down

537
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,130
If you want to

538
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:28,620
What are, what are we waiting for?

539
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,851
To see what kind of hell breaks loose

540
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,320
Uh, Whiskey, please

541
00:47:53,316 --> 00:47:54,323
And leave the bottle

542
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,173
I just saw to the remains of a friend

543
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:03,103
Yes, Sir

544
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:13,262
George Hearst

545
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:16,132
Jack Young

546
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:19,001
Jack Young

547
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:20,160
Yes, Sir

548
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:22,343
How do you do, Jack?

549
00:48:22,977 --> 00:48:23,880
How do you do?

550
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:28,960
Sheriff

551
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:29,622
Is he up there?

552
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:30,180
Who?

553
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:32,251
Is Hearst fucking up there, Farnum?

554
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:33,111
I cannot say

555
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:34,721
I cannot say

556
00:48:35,307 --> 00:48:40,173
I cannot betray the whereabouts of an owner-guest

557
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:53,713
Mr. Hearst…

558
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:57,822
I regret not being out here with you before, Sir

559
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,430
Help too stupid to wake me from my nap

560
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:01,360
Not at all

561
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:03,913
On down there now, Jack

562
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,090
At least do that much right

563
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:14,112
Helluva fucking day

564
00:49:16,285 --> 00:49:17,681
How much do you know?

565
00:49:20,828 --> 00:49:23,821
I heard there was a set-to in the thoroughfare

566
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,102
Did you know it was my man killed?

567
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:28,233
Was that the outcome?

568
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:31,400
My man was killed, yes

569
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:33,190
I'm sorry

570
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:36,080
It happens

571
00:49:36,586 --> 00:49:37,542
It's the nature of things

572
00:49:38,098 --> 00:49:39,423
It don't lessen the sadness

573
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:42,032
when it's a friend's

574
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,392
The Sheriff joins us

575
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:54,440
Whiskey

576
00:49:55,207 --> 00:50:02,070
The Sheriff recently put me on notice he is vigilant of my possible transgressions

577
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,273
You sound drunk to me

578
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:13,253
Whom are you addressing?

579
00:50:14,065 --> 00:50:14,603
You

580
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:16,902
You sound drunk

581
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:18,233
Do I?

582
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,041
Mm-hmm

583
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:24,710
When I say "Fuck yourself, Sheriff,"

584
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:27,701
will you put that down to drunkenness or a

585
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:30,192
high estimate of your athleticism?

586
00:50:34,107 --> 00:50:35,060
Did you just tell me

587
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,503
to fuck myself?

588
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:42,333
I think I did and to shut up or I'll quiet you myself

589
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:45,312
You're under arrest

590
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:46,491
Fuck you,

591
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:47,960
and shut up

592
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,741
or I will shut you up for good

593
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:59,051
Threatening a peace officer,

594
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:02,261
I'm taking you into custody

595
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:03,800
Don't be stupid, Bullock

596
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:04,713
Don't you be fucking stupid

597
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,272
Fuck you

598
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:21,071
Johnny

599
00:51:26,807 --> 00:51:29,182
The Sheriff eliminates several of our options

600
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,583
Not a fucking word comes to print

601
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:47,583
Understood
