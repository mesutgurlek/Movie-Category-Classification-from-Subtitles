00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:19,973
MIGHT SAY I WAS RAISED
ON THAT SONG.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,540
HEARING IT TAKES ME BACK--

19
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,640
BACK TO THE OLD TIMES
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

20
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:27,906
BACK TO WALESBURG.

21
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:29,407
ACCORDING TO THE WORDS
OF THE SONG,

22
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,407
WE'RE PROMISED A CITY OF GOLD
IN THE HEREAFTER.

23
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:36,073
I USED TO THINK THAT WAS
A LONG TIME TO HAVE TO WAIT.

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,407
BUT I KNOW NOW THAT
THERE IS A CITY OF GOLD

25
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,173
RIGHT HERE ON EARTH
FOR EVERY ONE OF US--

THE CITY OF OUR YOUTH.

I JUST HAVE TO SHUT MY EYES,
AND I'M THERE.

NOTHING'S CHANGED.

31

EVEN I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

I'M ALWAYS A BOY
IN WALESBURG.

JUST AS HE'LL ALWAYS BE,
IS THE PARSON--PARSON GRAY.

00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:11,473
AND PASSING BEFORE ME ARE
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
A PART OF MY GROWING UP--

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,373
PEOPLE LIKE MRS. BELCHER,
WHO TOOK IN BOARDERS,

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,674
AND HER NIECE FAITH SAMUELS,
THE DISTRICT SCHOOLTEACHER.

WHO COULD REMEMBER

SERVED AS DRUMMER BOY
AT THE FIRST BULL RUN.

THE GENERAL STORE AND HAD
A FINGER IN EVERY PIE.

00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,906
EVEN CHLOROFORM WIGGINS.

44
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:43,373
HIS MA HAD NEVER HEARD
OF CHLOROFORM UNTIL HE WAS BORN,

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,773
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
A MIGHTY PRETTY NAME.

46
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,006

AND YET AS CLOSE TO ME STILL
AS PEOPLE IN A FAVORITE STORY--

50
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,307
A STORY THAT HAD ITS BEGINNING
BEFORE I WAS BORN

51
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,640
ON THE DAY THE PARSON
ARRIVED IN OUR TOWN.

52
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,207
OF COURSE, THIS WASN'T
MUCH OF A TOWN THEN

53

IN THOSE
FIRST HARD YEARS

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,207
THAT FOLLOWED
THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES,

55
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:12,574
BUT IT SUITED
THE PARSON

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,540
RIGHT FROM THE MINUTE
HE STEPPED OFF THE TRAIN

57
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,373
AND STARTED
TO LOOK AROUND.

[TRAIN WHISTLES]

59
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,440
HE MUST HAVE ATTRACTED
PLENTY OF ATTENTION

60
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,640
AS HE WALKED DOWN MAIN STREET
FOR THE FIRST TIME

61
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,574
IN HIS BRAND-NEW
BLACK PULPIT COAT

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,706
AND FADED GRAY
CAVALRY BREECHES

63
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,040
AND HIS BIG OLD
BIBLE IN HIS HAND.

64
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:40,140
BUT HE JUST KEPT ON WALKING TILL
HE GOT TO JERRY HIGGINS' SALOON.

[MEN TALKING
AND LAUGHING]

HE DIDN'T HAVE
TO CALL FOR QUIET.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,507
IT JUST FOLLOWED HIM THROUGH
THAT ROOM LIKE A HOUND DOG.

NEW PREACHER,

YOU KNOW,

110
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,607
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING
THE PARSON DOES.

YES'M.

112
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,340
YOU KNOW,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

113
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,073
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY
GOOD SERVICE MYSELF.

114
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
DON'T YOU LAUGH
AT ME, MR. GRAY.

WHAT GIVES YOU THE IDEA
I'M LAUGHING AT YOU?

117
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,106
HERE I AM STANDING AROUND
WITH A BIG SMILE ON MY FACE

118
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,373
JUST 'CAUSE
I FEEL GOOD,
AND YOU--

119
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,706
YES, WELL, ALL
I HAVE TO SAY IS,

120
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,006
YOU OUGHT TO FEEL
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

121
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,507
I WAS BROUGHT UP
TO BELIEVE

122
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,540
THAT A MAN WHO BROKE
HIS SOLEMN PROMISE
TO A LADY

123
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,373
WAS A PRETTY POOR
SORT OF A MAN.

124
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,873
OH, HARRIET, I GUESS
YOU FOUND ME OUT.

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,706
I AM A PRETTY
POOR SORT OF MAN.

126
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,540
I WAS INTENDING
TO MENTION IT SOONER.

127
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,739
SOMETHING ALWAYS
CAME UP.

128
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,607

I PLAYED THE ORGAN
FOR THE SERVICES,

131
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,674
I COULD CHOOSE
THE HYMNS.

132
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,806
SO I HAVE.

133
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,640
YES, AND PROMISE
IS ALL YOU DO.

134
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,006

OF THE SUITORS

FROM GOOD PREACHING.

01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,706
KINDLY ALLOW ME
TO KNOW MY BUSINESS.

1228
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:18,806
DID YOU VISIT JOHN
THIS MORNING?

1229
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:19,873
YES.

1230
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,873
YOU STOOD AROUND
TALKING TO HIM?

1231
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,073
SAT ON HIS BED--
TOUCHED HIM?

1232
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,873
YES, I SUPPOSE
I DID.

1233
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,373
WELL, THAT MAKES YOU
A POTENTIAL CARRIER.

1234
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,940
DON'T YOU
REALIZE THAT?

1235
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:28,640
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT BY COMING
DOWN HERE TODAY,

1236
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,073
YOU MIGHT HAVE
EXPOSED THESE
CHILDREN

1237
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,407
AND MISS SAMUELS
TO INFECTION?

1238
01:01:31,473 --> 01:01:32,906
YOU CAN STOP
RIGHT THERE.

1239
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:34,839
SURE, I'VE BEEN
GOING IN AND OUT
OF JOHN'S ROOM.

1240
01:01:34,906 --> 01:01:36,407
SO HAVE YOU.

1241
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,906
I'VE BEEN GOING
ABOUT MY BUSINESS,

IN WHAT YOU SAY,

I RECKON THEY OUGHT TO
LOCK US BOTH UP.

WAS DOWN WITH SLOW FEVER.

LIGHTS WERE BURNING
TILL DAYLIGHT

I'M SCARED MYSELF.

UNLESS WE FIND
THE SOURCE.

WE'VE GOT
TO FIND IT.

1272
01:03:02,507 --> 01:03:06,407
WHEN MR. BACKETT CAME BY
WITH MY PROVISIONS,

1273
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:08,540
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
IT MIGHTY STRANGE
THAT YOU HADN'T

1274
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,440
THOUGHT TO EXAMINE
THE SCHOOL WELL.

HALF THE BRAINS
HE WAS BORN WITH,

HE'D KNOW
IT COULDN'T BE
THE SCHOOL WELL.

JOHN CAME DOWN WITH
THE FEVER FIRST.

1278

THAT WAS
BEFORE SCHOOL
EVEN STARTED.

1279

THAT'S SO.

1280
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,806
THIS CHICKEN PIE
IS GOOD.

WHY, MR. CARROLL.

01:03:32,873 --> 01:03:34,373
WHAT IS IT, THAD?

1285
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,806
THE MISSIS
SENT ME, PARSON.

1286

IT'S OUR BOBBY SAM.

HE'S--PARSON,
WILL YOU COME?

1288
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:42,607
OF COURSE I WILL.

1289
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:55,739
OH, GO IN
IF YOU WANT TO.

1290
01:03:55,806 --> 01:03:57,839
I'VE GIVEN UP
TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO.

1291
01:03:57,906 --> 01:03:59,739
BUT THERE'S A CHILD
DEAD IN THAT HOUSE

1292

WHO MIGHT BE ALIVE
AND WELL IF IT
WEREN'T FOR YOU.

1293
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:02,873
YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH!

1294

HE'S DEAD.

1295
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,839
OH.

1296
01:04:55,906 --> 01:04:57,273
I'LL GO
STRAIGHT OVER.

NO, WAIT.

1298
01:04:58,973 --> 01:05:00,906
I TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T I,
ABOUT HAVING WORDS

1299
01:05:00,973 --> 01:05:03,340
WITH DAN HARRIS
DOWN AT
THE SCHOOLHOUSE?

1300

HAPPENED AGAIN
TONIGHT.

1301
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:07,574
HE HAS A NOTION
ALL THIS IS
MY FAULT.

HE'S PRETTY
NEAR GOT ME
BELIEVING HIM.

1303
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,674
HOW DOES HE MEAN,
YOUR FAULT?

1304
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:14,906
HE MEANS I PICKED UP
THE FEVER FROM JOHN

1305
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:17,173
AND PASSED IT ON
TO THE OTHER KIDS
SOMEHOW.

1306
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,340
EVEN GAVE IT
TO FAITH

AND NO TELLING
HOW MANY OTHERS.

IT ISN'T TRUE.

WHO ARE WE TO SAY
IT ISN'T TRUE?

1310
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,873
HE'S A DOCTOR,
HE'S A GOOD DOCTOR.

1311
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,440
HE KNOWS
HIS BUSINESS.

1312
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,373
I GUESS I SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED
TO HIM THAT DAY,

1313
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,540
BUT HE RILED ME,
KIND OF.

1314
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:32,973
NOW I KEEP THINKING
MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT.

1315
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,373
MAYBE HE'S
BEEN RIGHT
ALL THE TIME,

1316
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,440
ONLY NOW
IT'S TOO LATE--

1317
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:41,440
TOO LATE
FOR BOBBY SAM,
ANYWAY.

TO DO?

AND STAY THERE."

1326
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,906
I WASN'T MAN
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

1327
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:03,273
I CAN'T SAY WHETHER
I'M MAN ENOUGH
TO DO IT NOW, BUT--

1328
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,373
I AIM TO FIND OUT.

WHEN THE PARSON CLOSED
THE DOOR TO THE CHURCH,

1337
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:36,906
HE ALSO CLOSED
THE DOOR ON HIMSELF.

1338
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:38,373
IT WAS ALL
HE COULD DO NOW

1339
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,873
FOR THE FOLKS
WHO TRUSTED HIM.

1340
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,373
THE REST WAS UP TO
YOUNG DOC HARRIS.

1341
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,806
SO, IN A WAY, YOU SEE,
THIS UNHAPPY TIME WAS

1342
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:48,940
YOUNG DOC'S REAL HOMECOMING.

1343
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:53,373
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
HE KNEW HOW GOOD IT WAS
TO BE NEEDED;

1344
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,173
GOOD TO BE WATCHED FOR
AND WELCOMED LIKE
A TRUSTED FRIEND.

1345
01:06:59,873 --> 01:07:02,839
IT WAS EVEN GOOD TO GO
RED-EYED AND DOG-TIRED,

1346
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:04,839
SNATCHING SLEEP
WHEREVER HE COULD

1347
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:07,407
ON THE ROAD
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE

1348
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:10,839
IN ORDER THAT OTHERS
MIGHT SLEEP EASIER
BECAUSE OF HIM.

1349
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:13,340
HE JUST COULDN'T GO ON
FEELING A STRANGER

1350
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:15,273
AMONG FOLKS WHOSE LIVES
HAD SUDDENLY BECOME

IT'S ALL RIGHT.

OH, THANK GOD.

LIKE THE ISBELLS,

01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:30,839
WHOSE FACES SPOKE
THEIR THANKS TO HIM
BETTER THAN ANY WORDS,

1356
01:07:30,906 --> 01:07:33,507
AND THE OTHERS,
LIKE KATE AND HARRY WARE,

1357
01:07:33,574 --> 01:07:35,173

I RECKON WHAT
WE NEED NOW

1362
01:08:01,706 --> 01:08:03,173
IS ANOTHER KIND
OF HELP.

Narrator:
THEN IT BEGAN TO SEEM
TO YOUNG DOC THAT PERHAPS

1364
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:13,839
HE, TOO, STOOD IN NEED
OF ANOTHER KIND OF HELP.

1365

BUT BEYOND THAT LIGHTED WINDOW,
IF HE'D ONLY KNOWN IT,

1366
01:08:17,906 --> 01:08:20,839
WAS A MAN
IN DEEPER NEED THAN HIS.

1367
01:08:20,906 --> 01:08:23,340
ALL THAT WE HAD
IN THOSE DAYS CAME

1368
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:25,340
FROM THE PEOPLE
OF WALESBURG.

THAT SHELTERED US,

THE FOOD WE ATE,
THE CLOTHES WE WORE.

1371
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,839
BUT WHAT WE LEARNED
TO VALUE MOST WAS
NONE OF THESE THINGS.

1372
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,773
IT WAS THE LIVING FAITH
IN THE HEARTS

1373
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:37,340
OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEM.

1374
01:08:37,407 --> 01:08:40,873
WE'D NEVER BEEN RICH--
EXCEPT IN THAT.

1375
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,940
AND NOW

1525
01:17:49,006 --> 01:17:50,440
YOU CALL--
NOW HOLD ON,
PARSON.

1526
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:51,806
I'M
A CHURCHGOING MAN,
AND YOU KNOW IT,

1527
01:17:51,873 --> 01:17:52,806
BUT THAT DON'T
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT

1528
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:53,806
TO COME BUSTIN'
INTO MY STORE

1529
01:17:53,873 --> 01:17:54,739
AND INTERFERIN'
IN MY BUSINESS.

1530
01:17:54,806 --> 01:17:55,806
RIGHT NOW, MR. BACKETT,

1531
01:17:55,873 --> 01:17:58,373
YOUR BUSINESS IS
INTERFERING WITH MINE.

1532
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,806
I'M ASKING YOU,
BEFORE GOD--
DON'T YOU REALIZE

1533
01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:01,806
WHAT YOU'RE SETTING
OUT TO DO HERE?

1534
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:04,207
MURDER ONE OLD MAN,
STEAL HIS PROPERTY,

1535
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:06,806
TAKE YOUR CUT,
AND THEN CALL
THE JOB DONE?

1536
01:18:06,873 --> 01:18:08,873
IT WON'T END THERE.
DON'T THINK IT.

1537
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,340
YOU--ALL OF YOU.

1538
01:18:13,407 --> 01:18:14,839
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
IN THE LAST WEEKS?

1539
01:18:14,906 --> 01:18:16,340
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
THE SLOW FEVER AT WORK?

1540
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,340
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
ONE POISONED WELL

1541
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,340
SPREAD GRIEF AND TROUBLE
THROUGH HALF THE TOWN?

1542
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:22,340
DON'T YOU REALIZE
THE POISON IN THAT WELL

1543
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:24,307
WAS CATLAP
COMPARED TO THIS?

1544
01:18:24,373 --> 01:18:26,006
IF THAT POISON'S
ALLOWED TO START,

1545
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:27,839
IT'LL SPREAD
UNTIL THERE ISN'T A WHOLE SOUL

1546
01:18:27,906 --> 01:18:29,273
OR A HEALTHY CONSCIENCE
LEFT IN WALESBURG.

1547
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,940
WELL, I AIM TO SEE--

1548
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,273
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

1549
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,906
THERE'LL BE
NO ROPE AROUND
ANYBODY'S NECK

1550
01:18:33,973 --> 01:18:36,607
AS LONG AS THERE'S
ONE MAN OF US
LEFT TO STOP IT.

1551
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,240
NIGHTRIDERS.

1552
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:40,340
YELLOWBACKS
IN FANCY DRESS.

1553
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:41,873
YOU SHAME ME,
AND YOU SHAME

1554
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:43,940
THE LORD THAT MADE YOU
AND CALLED YOU MEN.

1555
01:18:44,006 --> 01:18:47,207
AND IF I WASN'T HIS SERVANT,
I'D TAKE A BUGGY WHIP
TO THE LOT OF YOU.

1556
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,307
WE GONNA TAKE THAT
FROM HIM?

1557
01:18:55,373 --> 01:18:56,307
WE DON'T WANT
NO PREACHER--

1558
01:18:56,373 --> 01:18:57,473
SHUT HIS MOUTH
FOR HIM.

1559
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,806
IF HE WANTS A FIGHT,
LET'S GIVE IT TO HIM.

1560
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:02,173
KIND OF LOOKING
FORWARD TO TONIGHT.

1561
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:20,674
ROLFE HERE TELLS ME
YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
WITH LON BACKETT'S CROWD.

1562
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:21,906
THAT'S ONE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

1563
01:19:21,973 --> 01:19:23,739
WELL, IS THERE
ENOUGH TROUBLE
FOR 6 OF US?

1564
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:25,839
OH, JED,
YOU NEVER CHANGE,
DO YOU?

1565
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:27,839
HA HA!
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

1566
01:19:27,906 --> 01:19:29,006
WELL, I BRUNG YOU
A HORSE,

1567
01:19:29,073 --> 01:19:30,906
SO GET YOUR PISTOLS,
AND LET'S GO.

1568
01:19:30,973 --> 01:19:32,906
I'M NOT TAKING
MY PISTOLS
WITH ME THIS TIME.

1569
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,040
AFRAID I MIGHT
FORGET MYSELF
AND USE 'EM.

1570
01:19:35,106 --> 01:19:36,906
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE
FOR, AIN'T THEY?

1571
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,906
MAYBE,
BUT IT'S NOT
WHAT I'M FOR.

1572
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:41,407
LORD KNOWS,
I WANT YOU
BOYS ALONG--

1573
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:43,240
WANT YOU BAD.
BUT IF YOU
WANT TO COME,

1574
01:19:43,307 --> 01:19:45,407
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
LIKE I TELL YOU,
AND ON MY TERMS.

1575
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,340
SO I'LL JUST
TAKE CHARGE
OF THOSE GUNS.

1576
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,940
OH, NOW,
LOOKIT HERE.

1577
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:51,207
YOU AIN'T GOT A FRIEND
IN THAT CROWD
SINCE THIS MORNING.

1578
01:19:51,273 --> 01:19:52,873
AND IF YOU'RE AIMIN' ON
SPOILING THEIR PARTY,

1579
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,540
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME CARE TAKEN OF YOU.

1580
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,940
I FIGURE I'LL BE
TAKEN CARE OF,
ALL RIGHT.

1581
01:19:57,006 --> 01:19:59,273
OH, J.D. GRAY,
I DON'T KNOW YOU
NO MORE.

1582
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,973
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
SHUCK OFF
THAT LONG TAIL COAT

1583
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,873
AND BE A MAN AGAIN?

1584
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,806
WHEN YOU COMIN'
TO CHURCH, JED?

1585
01:20:04,873 --> 01:20:06,207
OH--COME ON, BOYS.

1586
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:20,706

Narrator: I'LL NEVER FORGET
HOW I FELT THAT NIGHT

1588

AS I WATCHED THE PARSON
SET OUT, LEAVING ME BEHIND.

1589
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,240
BUT I KNEW THE WAY
TO UNCLE FAMOUS'
AS WELL AS HE DID.

1590
01:20:40,307 --> 01:20:42,407
AND IF HIS TOWN
HAD FAILED HIM,

1591
01:20:42,473 --> 01:20:44,273
THAT WAS NO REASON
FOR ME TO DO THE SAME.

1592
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,373
COME ON OUT, FAMOUS,
OR WE'LL COME IN
AND GET YOU!

1593
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,207
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S FETCH HIM.

1594
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:15,307
YOU'RE WASTIN'
YOUR TIME, PARSON.
HE AIN'T GOT A CHANCE.

1595
01:21:15,373 --> 01:21:16,873
STAND ASIDE.

1596
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,073
STAND ASIDE,

1597
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,739

01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,073
AND BEFORE YOU MEN
GO ANY FURTHER,

1601
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,739
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO TAKE UP WITH YOU.

1602
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:40,739
MIND YOU, I'M NOT
OUT HERE TO TRY

1603
01:21:40,806 --> 01:21:42,407
AND TALK YOU OUT
OF ANYTHING.

1604
01:21:42,473 --> 01:21:44,906
IF YOU'RE STILL DETERMINED
TO DO THIS THING,

1605
01:21:44,973 --> 01:21:46,839
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY WAY
I CAN STOP YOU.

1606
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,507
I CAME OUT HERE TO--

[INDISTINCT YELLING]

UNCLE FAMOUS!
DON'T LET THEM

1609
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:55,407
DON'T LET THEM!
LET GO OF ME!

1610
01:21:55,473 --> 01:21:59,006
PARSON! PARSON!
WHY DON'T YOU STOP THEM?

BELONG HERE,
ANYHOW.

1613

YOU DIDN'T
LET ME FINISH.

1614
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,373
I CAME OUT HERE
TONIGHT

1615
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,040
BECAUSE UNCLE FAMOUS
ASKED ME TO COME.

1616
01:22:13,106 --> 01:22:15,373
HE KNOWS
HE'S GOT TO DIE.

1617
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,873
BUT LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE,

1618
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,873
HE WANTED TO GET
THINGS STRAIGHT

1619
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,906
WITH GOD AND MAN
BEFORE HE GOES.

1620
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:20,906
WE'VE PRAYED
TOGETHER,

1621
01:22:20,973 --> 01:22:23,373
AND WE'VE
TALKED TOGETHER.

1622
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,373
UNCLE FAMOUS HAS
EVEN MADE A WILL.

1623
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,407
A WILL?
WILL?

1624

WHO'S GONNA GET
HIS PROPERTY?

1625

YES, WHO'S GONNA
GET THE MICA VEIN?

1626

Gray: WAIT A MINUTE.

1627
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,407
JUST SO THERE WON'T BE
ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS,
