1
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,867
There he is...
First to give up.

2
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,733
I never thought
he'd sell out.

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,867
I suppose he's going to
deposit all the money

4
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,433
He got for the herd.

5
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,067
How's the cattle business?

6
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,067
No sense sitting
around here all day

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,933
Chawin' like a bunch
of old women.

8
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,333
Anybody has a right
to sell out if he wants to.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,300
I suppose Steve
wanted to get his

10
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,867
Before the price
dropped to nothing.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,067
And he was going to be
the cattle king of Wyoming.

12
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,633
Well, the rest of you will
soon do just what he's done.

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
We're not selling out.

14
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,067
You just stick around
and see.

15
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,667
Sure, I'll stick around.
I got nothing better to do.

16
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,333
As a matter of fact,

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,167
I'll be here long after
you two-bit ranchers

18
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,633
Are all starved out.

19
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,600
If I were 20 years younger...

20
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,367
You won't live
to be 20 seconds older

21
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,300
If you keep running off
at the mouth that way!

22
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,400
Go ahead, let's see
how fast you are.

23
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,733
All right, graycoe.
That's enough.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,067
Says who?

25
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,833
I've been wanting to talk
to you men about something.

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,433
Aw, we got nothing
to talk to you about.

27
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,600
Thanks, Steve,
for what you just did for me.

28
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,833
I didn't ask for your help.

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,100
Now wait a minute,
please.

30
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,567
Look, I just wanted
to tell you this.

31
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,067
If you can help it,
don't sell out.

32
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,067
You sold.

33
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,567
Now, look,
if you trust me,

34
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,467
You'll hold on
as long as possible.

35
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,567
How long are you
talking about?

36
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,933
Till next spring.

37
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,367
You can manage that
all right, can't you?

38
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,800
What is your scheme?

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,600
I can't tell you just yet.

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,533
We'll think it over.

41
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,967
Hi, Larry.

42
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,233
Hello, Steve.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Afternoon, Mr. mccullum.

44
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,233
Good afternoon, Steve.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
Got a minute?

46
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,300
Of course. Sit down.

47
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,267
Thanks.

48
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,900
So you've sold
your cattle, huh?

49
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,433
All but a few head.

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,133
After paying off the crew,
this is all that's left of it.

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
$8,000. Not very much
for all those steers.

52
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,200
Longhorns are a drug
on the market.

53
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,933
I was pretty lucky
to sell them at all.

54
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,400
If you'd held them
a while longer,

55
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,567
The smaller ranchers
might have had some hope.

56
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,967
Now, I don't know.

57
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,067
Hope for what?

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,533
For the price of longhorns
to go up?

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
You know better than that,
Mr. mccullum.

60
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,900
Well, something
might have happened.

61
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:38,767
Sure, but not if somebody
doesn't make it happen.

62
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,367
I'd like to mortgage
my ranch.

63
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,967
You'd get more
if you sold it.

64
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,500
I want to keep it.

65
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, I see.

66
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,467
Well...
It's not worth very much.

67
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,500
5,000 acres is
always worth something.

68
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,233
You were just getting ready
to buy it.

69
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,067
How much do you need?

70
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,533
About $20,000.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,533
$20,000!

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,167
You expect me to take
a mortgage for $12,000?

73
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,067
I can't do it.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,700
You can cut the place up
into farms and make that much.

75
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,467
I'll let you have $6,000.

76
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,867
$8,000.

77
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,533
$6,000, Steve.
Take it or leave it.

78
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,667
I'll take it.

79
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,667
Make out the papers.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,133
What are you planning
to do with the money?

81
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,933
You'll find out.

82
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,067
Hi, Bob.

83
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,900
Steve.
How was the trip?

84
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:45,500
Well, about what
you would expect.

85
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,700
I got the going rate
for longhorns...

86
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,600
Half cent a pound.

87
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,067
I can pay
your back wages now.

88
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,633
Thanks for waiting.

89
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,967
That's all right.

90
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:58,067
Well, thanks
for everything, Steve.

91
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,100
I'll be seeing you.

92
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,400
Now hold on.
You've still got a job.

93
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,100
You're still my foreman,
regular foreman's wages.

94
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,500
You don't need me.

95
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,567
You just sold
almost all your cattle.

96
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,900
And half a cent a pound,
the few you got left

97
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,833
Aren't worth paying anybody
to look after.

98
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,800
Climb on your horse
and come with me.

99
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,467
Where to?

100
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,433
Just over the hill.

101
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Remember him?

102
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:38,167
Mewhhh!

103
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,167
It's your little crossbreed.

104
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,800
How does he look to you?

105
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,800
He looks fine, Steve.
He's coming along great.

106
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:48,067
Gonna have
some good steaks on him.

107
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah, he's tough, too.

108
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,667
He's as tough as any steer
we've ever grown around here.

109
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,133
It's going to work, Bob.
I'm sure of it.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,133
Looks like you're right,
Steve.

111
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,633
It's going to take
a lot of money.

112
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,733
Did you consider that?

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,433
Yeah.
I mortgaged the ranch.

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm leaving for Oregon
tomorrow morning.

115
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,367
I sure wish
you'd come along, Bob.

116
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,433
You don't waste much time.

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,133
I can't afford to.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,267
I'm ready.

119
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,633
Good.

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,633
We'll button down the place
and we'll get packed.

121
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,867
Mewhhh!

122
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,433
[ Player piano plays ]

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,933
Where are you going?

124
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,667
I'm going to see Maddox.

125
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:54,933
Maybe he's busy.

126
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,667
He won't be too busy
to talk to me.

127
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,067
If it's about a job, Andrews,
I'm the man to see.

128
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,267
It's about a job,

129
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,167
But you'll probably
be working for me.

130
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,767
Oh? Sounds interesting.

131
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,467
Hmm. It is.

132
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,700
What is it?

133
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,533
I want to talk
to you, Maddox.

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,933
This is Bob Andrews.

135
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,800
Come in.

136
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,967
I have a proposition
for you, Maddox,

137
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,733
But it's confidential.

138
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,667
Mr. graycoe is
a trusted associate.

139
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,400
All right, Mr. Andrews.
I'm a busy man.

140
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,133
What is your proposition?

141
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,667
This is big, Maddox,

142
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,233
Bigger than anything
you've ever done.

143
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
And I'm going to be
your partner.

144
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:56,967
Yeah? Go on.

145
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,267
Steve Patrick has an idea
he thinks is going to make him

146
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:04,633
The biggest cattleman
in Wyoming.

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,867
I can't see any advantage

148
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,233
In being any kind
of a cattleman in Wyoming.

149
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,767
He's bringing in a herd
of white-face.

150
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,767
He's crazy.

151
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,867
If you don't shut up...

152
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:11,933
Who do you think
you're talking to?

153
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,267
Graycoe!

154
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,633
Mr. Andrews, graycoe's
a very impulsive man.

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,133
I suggest you be
more careful with him.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,933
Sit down
and please go on.

157
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,067
Patrick has an idea
for a new crossbreed.

158
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
He's tried it and it works.
I've seen it.

159
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,967
It's a cross
between the Texas longhorn

160
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,433
And hereford dairy cattle.

161
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,400
It's got half again
as much meat as the longhorn

162
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,567
And it's just as rugged.

163
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,333
These winters won't
bother it at all.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,900
It'll change the whole
cattle picture in this state.

165
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,200
And how does Patrick expect
to keep this a secret?

166
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,800
He doesn't.
Once he gets started,

167
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,367
He plans to furnish
his neighbors

168
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,267
With all the breeding stock
they need.

169
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,800
Very charitable man.

170
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,733
Just what do you expect us
to do about all this?

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,833
Some of the ranchers
around here have quit already

172
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,433
And their land's for sale.

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,567
The rest of them
have mortgages.

174
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:58,267
You have enough cash on hand

175
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,667
To buy up 10 or 15,000 acres
of land and paper tomorrow.

176
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,967
Then we'll go ahead.

177
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,200
We? I see you're
a partner already.

178
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,467
Not a very good
businessman.

179
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,700
You've told me a secret.

180
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,733
You've told me
how to capitalize on it.

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,633
Now if I should decide
to go ahead,

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,733
I don't need you.

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes, you do.

184
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,133
You need the hereford cattle,
and I'll have them...

185
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
$14,000 worth
of the best breeding stock.

186
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,233
Where do you expect
to get them?

187
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,367
Oregon.

188
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,933
Patrick and I are leaving
in the morning.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,300
I see. You figure
to grab Patrick's herd.

190
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,233
That's right.

191
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,267
And I know just the place
to do it.

192
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,933
I know this country
like the palm of my hand.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,767
Mr. Andrews...

194
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,367
You've got a deal.

195
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,300
Now just tell me
when and where.

196
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,967
Can you furnish
about six good men?

197
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,200
Yes.

198
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,033
We'll be gone
a couple of months.

199
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,800
You set up a camp
above canyon river.

200
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,700
I'll meet you there
when we get back.

201
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,900
Let's see, you better be there
in about six weeks

202
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,000
In case we make better time
than we expect to.

203
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,100
I'll tell you the rest
of the plan then.

204
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,300
We'll be there.

205
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,300
In the meantime,
you buy up the land.

206
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,633
Maddox, between us,

207
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,600
We'll have the biggest spread
in this state.

208
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,533
Before we're through,
we'll own 50,000 head of cattle.

209
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm curious
about one thing.

210
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,700
I thought you and Steve Patrick
were close friends.

211
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,567
I'm through
working for other people.

212
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,167
I want a ranch of my own...

213
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,667
A big one.

214
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, if this works out...

215
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,367
It will,
if you do your part.

216
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,667
Don't worry
about that.

217
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,667
I've got a question, too,
Andrews.

218
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,667
Just what do you figure
on doing with Patrick?

219
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,200
You don't think he's
going to sit there

220
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,433
While you steal
his cows, do you?

221
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,933
We'll decide that
when we come to it.

222
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,100
All right.

223
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,767
We'll meet you
above canyon river.

224
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,400
Right.

225
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,067
So we're going into
the cattle business now, huh?

226
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,833
I don't see why not.

227
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,433
Maybe Patrick's all wrong
about this crossbreed.

228
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,767
I don't think so.

229
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,767
He knows more about cattle
than anybody around here.

230
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,533
If he says it'll work,
it will.

231
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,500
And you're going
to take the gamble

232
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,267
And sink all that cash
in land?

233
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,967
It won't be
much of a gamble.

234
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,833
The land that's available
around here is pretty cheap.

235
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,567
And after Patrick leaves,
it'll be cheaper.

236
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,067
Tell me, in your wide circle
of acquaintances,

237
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,067
Would there be any rustlers?

238
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,900
Some of my best friends.

239
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,300
Get me a body
of good ones, will you?

No, thanks.

243
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,167
Enough for morning.

244
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,867
I'll take
first shift tonight.

245
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:41,900
All right.

246
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,267
Wake me up
about midnight, huh?

247
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,433
Yeah.

248
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,933
If you get tired,
wake me up before that.

It's only me, boy.

256

How is it?

257
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,233
It's not good.

258
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Did you find the horses?

259
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,867
No. There must have been
quite a few of them.

260
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,133
I saw a lot
of moccasin tracks

261
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Around where they
picked them up.

262
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,567
Sorry, Steve.
It's my fault.

263
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,067
I fell asleep.

264
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,100
Forget it.
How about a little water?

265
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,833
Our problem right now is
to get a doctor for you.

266
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,700
There's no horses.
You can't walk.

267
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:30,833
I can try.

268

Look, you take it easy.

272
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,867
I'll get back
as soon as I can.

Stole our horses last night,

Shot my partner up

Got to get a doctor to him
before he bleeds to death.

How did you get this far
since last night?

Walked.

290

All right,
so it's impossible.

00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,367
Are you going to get me
some help or aren't you?

00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,133
I'm sorry.

considerable blood,

But a couple weeks rest
will put him back on his feet.

Where's the lung, doc?

314

Didn't you, Steve?

to go to bed, Charles.

You promised not
to call me that, mom.

That's right.
I'm sorry, Chuck.

00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,233
Good night, Chuck.

325
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,033
You know what I'm going
to be when I grow up?

326
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,133
I can guess.

327
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,133
What?

328
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,633
A cowboy,
that's what.

329
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
This is probably
the most exciting thing

330
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,633
That's ever happened
to him.

331
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,967
He's a fine boy.

332
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,700
Can I get you
some coffee, doctor?

333
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,367
No, thanks. I have
a couple more calls to make.

334
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:52,067
I'll stop in in a day or two
and change his dressing.

335
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,933
Thank you, doctor.
What do I owe you?

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Oh, I don't know.

337
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,367
It depends on how many calls
I have to make.

338
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,200
I'll collect from you later.

339
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,300
Good night, Janet.

340
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,667
Good night, doctor.

341
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,067
Mr. Patrick...

342
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,833
You may not realize it,
but...

343
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,767
You saved
that young man's life.

344
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,467
I'm glad I was able
to help, doctor.

345
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:13,467
Good night.

346
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,767
Night.

347
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:19,933
How are your feet?

348
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,333
Much better, thanks.

349
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,733
I've done enough walking
to last me a long time.

350
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,633
Sure glad a cowboy can do most
of his work sitting down.

351
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,467
Shall I heat that up
for you?

352
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,300
No, that'll be fine.
Thanks.

353
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,967
You've been very good
to us, miss hale.

354
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,833
You had as much to do
with saving Bob's life

355
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,167
As any of us did.

356
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:43,767
Well, I'm glad I was around
at the right time.

357
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm sorry to impose on you,

358
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,500
But if Bob has to rest up,
Mrs. hale...

359
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,133
He's welcome to stay here.

360
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,067
I'll sleep in Chuck's room.

361
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:54,700
You and the boy alone?

362
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,567
Yes, my husband died
almost a year ago.

363
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,433
I'm sorry to hear that.

364
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,133
It's a pretty rough country

365
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,733
For a woman and a child
to live in alone.

366
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,300
Well, I'm trying
to sell this place.

367
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,900
As soon as I do,

368
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,067
I'll use the money for our
transportation back east.

369
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,900
I want Chuck to have
a proper education.

370
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,967
He's getting to be
as wild as the country.

371
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,900
Oh, he isn't so wild, ma'am.

372
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:23,067
No more so than any
other healthy youngster.

373
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,233
Maybe not.

374
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
I wouldn't be so concerned

375
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:30,467
If he had a father
to educate him.

376
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,967
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mrs. hale,

377
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:37,233
Unless all the men
in Oregon are blind,

378
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,933
There must be quite a few
who'd like to be Chuck's father.

379
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:46,733
None that I'd care
to marry, Mr. Patrick.

380
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
You must be...

381
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,100
Very particular.

382
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,400
Yes, I am.

383
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,567
Very.

384
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,267
I'm afraid you'll
have to sleep in the barn.

385
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,533
There's no other place
I can offer you.

386
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,267
That'll be fine.

387
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,733
Thanks again.

388
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,067
Good night.

389
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,433
Good night.

390
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,700
[ Rooster crows ]

391
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,600
How are your feet today,
Mr. Patrick?

392
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:52,067
A bit tender, but I reckon
they'll be all right

393
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,067
By the time
I reach Pendleton.

394
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,867
I made you some sandwiches
for your lunch.

395
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,300
Thanks.

396
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,567
Thanks for the loan
of the horse, too.

397
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,700
Hey, Steve!

398
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:11,533
You're not leaving
without saying goodbye to me.

399
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,367
Now you know better
than that, cowboy.

400
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:15,367
So long.

401
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:16,433
So long.

402
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,867
I'll see you
in about two weeks.

403
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:19,900
All right.

404
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,400
Don't worry
about Mr. Andrews.

405
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:22,500
I'll take good care
of him.

406
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,833
Good. Goodbye.

407
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,433
Goodbye, Steve.

408
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,467
Steve don't have any boys
of his own, you know, mom.

409
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:52,233
Doesn't have any boys,
dear.

410
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,833
Yeah. He'd like
to have a boy, you know.

411
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,200
He told me so.

412
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,067
Oh, he did, did he?

413
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,800
Mom, why don't we go
on the trail drive

414
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,867
With Steve and Bob
when they go back to Wyoming?

415
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,500
It'd be a lot of fun.

416
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm sure it would,
but it's much too far

417
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,500
For a couple of tenderfeet
like us.

418
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:17,067
Besides, we can't ride
well enough anyway.

419
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,600
We could learn, I bet.

420
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,800
Steve wasn't any older
than me when he learned.

421
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,967
We got plenty
to keep us busy

422
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,333
Around here
for a while, Chuck...

423
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,067
Till we sell this place.

424
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,600
Nobody wants to buy it.

425
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,600
Well,
they certainly won't

426
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,067
If we let it get
in any worse shape

427
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,567
Than it is already.

428
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,267
You didn't finish hoeing
the vegetable garden yesterday,

429
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,933
For instance, now did you?

430
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,400
No, ma'am.

431
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,467
Yes, sir, Mr. Patrick,
they're all prime beef.

432
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,700
You won't find better herefords
than them anywhere.

433
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,133
Glad to hear that.

434
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,500
What's your price
if I take the whole thousand?

435
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,600
$15 a head.

436
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,200
That would include
30, 40 new calves.

437
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,800
I'd let them go along
with their mothers.

438
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,400
This is all there is,
Mr. Reed.

439
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:19,067
I need the whole thousand head.

440
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,633
Hey, $14,000.
All cash.

441
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,233
Mister, you got a deal.

442
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,700
You have pretty
good-looking cows, all right.

443
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,133
Course they won't be
by the time I get 'em up home.

444
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
Where's that?

445
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,300
Powder river country...
Wyoming.

446
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,633
Wyoming? Mr. Patrick...

447
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,267
Selling a thousand head
of cattle

448
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,333
Is something that I just
can't do every day.

449
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,933
Much as I want
to make the deal,

450
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,733
There's something
I got to tell you.

451
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,067
Them herefords just won't live
on the open range.

452
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,600
Only Texas cattle's
got a chance

453
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,533
Against them hard
Wyoming winters.

454
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
They'll live.

455
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,733
I'll see to it,

456
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,200
If I have to hand-feed
every one of them myself.

457
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,133
All right, but I hope
you're not making

458
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,267
An expensive mistake.

459
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,100
I hope the same, Mr. Reed.

460
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,233
When will you have
the bill of sale ready?

461
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,867
Tomorrow before noon
be all right?

462
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:10,333
Fine. I'll be back either
in the morning or afternoon.

463
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,667
It depends on how long
it'll take me

464
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,067
To hire a trail crew.

465
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,200
Now you might just have
a little trouble there.

466
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,233
That's a long, hard drive
you got in mind,

467
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,367
Going the wrong way
on the Oregon trail.

468
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,567
Where do you think
I should start looking?

469
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,200
Might try the cattlemen's
association in town.

470
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,267
All right, I'll do that.
Thanks.

471
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,667
Be looking for you
tomorrow then.

472
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,200
Good luck.

473
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,633
I'm afraid
that's the story, Patrick.

474
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,467
No punchers have registered
with us for some time.

475
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,067
I guess they're all working.

476
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,067
Roundups have been over
for two months.

477
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,700
What happened to the men
who worked them?

478
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:55,767
I wouldn't know.

479
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,133
I think you would know.

480
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,067
When I told you
what I wanted the men for,

481
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,533
You didn't even check
your listings.

482
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Listen, Patrick...

483
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,400
You listen!
Men who are looking for work

484
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,700
Aren't going to like
the way you represent them.

485
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,767
They'll thank me.

486
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,300
No cowboy in his right mind

487
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,267
Wants any part of a job
like yours this time of year.

488
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,733
So good day, sir.

489
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,833
[ Player piano plays ]

490
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
Whiskey?

491
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,567
Yeah.

492
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,467
My name is Steve Patrick.

493
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,367
I'm a cattle rancher.

494
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,833
I'm looking for a trail crew.

495
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,767
Have any idea
where I might find one?

496
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,867
This is as good a place
as any, mister.

497
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:06,267
Take your pick. A

498
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,167
I got a crew of eight good men
and a cook, Mr. Patrick.

499
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,200
Experienced?

500
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,367
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,167
All right.
You're hired.

502
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:16,433
I pay regular wages...
$40 a month and grub,

503
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,367
Bonus of $20 a man if we lose
less than 5% of the cows.

504
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:22,333
How many cows
and where are you taking them?

505
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,567
Does that make
any difference?

506
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,733
No, just curious,
Mr. Patrick.

507
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,167
A thousand head of white-face.

508
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,133
I'm taking them to Wyoming.

509
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,167
You mean that?

510
00:29:33,233 --> 00:29:36,700
Sure I mean it.

511
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:37,800
No, thanks.

512
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:40,233
You men can't want work
very bad.

513
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,667
We don't, Mr. Patrick.
This is the off-season.

514
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,967
We can get along
without a trip to Wyoming.

515
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,233
I've been there in the winter
and I don't like it.

516
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,967
Neither will your cows.

517
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:58,533
Any other saloons in town?

518
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,733
There's only
one other place

519
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,133
Where you might
pick up a crew,

520
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,533
But I wouldn't
recommend it.

521
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,033
Where's that?

522
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,767
It's around the corner.
It's called mcclary's.

523
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,867
Why wouldn't you
recommend it?

524
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,100
If you were looking for
owl hoots

525
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,033
Or ex-convicts
or rustlers,

526
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,767
Mcclary's would be
the place to find them.

527
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:19,967
No rancher with any sense
would hire them for punchers.

528
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,700
If you're going
to mcclary's, mister,

529
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:23,533
You'd better figure on
shooting your way out.

530
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,533
I'm taking three.

531
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,600
20.

532
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,033
Raise.

533
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,733
I'll see you...

534
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,233
See the raise...

535
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,233
And bump you 50.

536
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,233
I'll see you,
lynch.

537
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm light.

538
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,900
You're always light.

539
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,233
A house full of 3's.

540
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,100
That makes 30 you owe me.

541
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:57,900
Put it in the book, Ben.

542
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,333
How much does he owe me
altogether?

543
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,467
Well, let me see now.

544
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:04,933
That makes it $170...
$178,000 and 50 cents.

545
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,200
Nothin'.
I can afford it.

546
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,233
Whiskey.

547
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,733
You know him, Ben?

548
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,367
Never laid eyes
on him before.

549
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,767
Mister,
you're either the law

550
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,067
Or you're
running away from it.

551
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,067
Which is it?

552
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,133
And the answer
had better be right.

553
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,567
Neither one.

554
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,733
I'm a cattle rancher...

555
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,133
Looking for a trail crew.

556
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,767
Now that's not
very clever.

557
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,067
This is the last place

558
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,200
Anybody would look for
cowpunchers.

559
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,767
Yeah, it's the last place,
all right.

560
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,400
Nobody else wanted the job
I'm offering.

561
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,067
We make our own jobs.

562
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,667
We do all right
without hiring out to anybody.

563
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:56,233
Yeah, you look it.

564
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,733
Nice clothes...

565
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,233
A good livin'...

566
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,467
Lots of money
to play around with.

567
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:07,067
Yeah, you look like
you're doing real fine.

568
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,700
You came in here
looking for trouble,

569
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,833
Didn't you?

570
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,733
Well, you came
to the right place.

571
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,867
Make your play, big man.

572
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:28,167
I've had a bad day.

573
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,467
I reckon it's
a good a place as any

574
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,067
To get it off my chest.

575
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,700
Stand still, will ya?

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,333
I'm gonna keep
gettin' up,

577
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,933
So you better
get your gun.

578
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,633
'Cause you're gonna
have to kill me

579
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,867
To keep me down.

580
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:20,100
I don't want to kill you.
I want to hire you.

581
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,067
Want to talk business?

582
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,233
Talk.

583
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,667
Like I said,
I'm a rancher.

584
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:34,533
I'm going to Wyoming with
a thousand head of herefords.

585
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,433
I couldn't get
a trail crew

586
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,633
Because everybody thought
I was crazy to try it.

587
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,067
Are you interested?

588
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,867
Well, any man that can hit
the way you do

589
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,900
Can't be altogether crazy.

590
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:47,600
What's your proposition?

591
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,433
Regular puncher's wages...

592
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,800
And a permanent job
on my ranch

593
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:55,133
After we get
the herd through.

594
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,800
Mister,
you got a crew.

595
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,333
But being a stranger,

596
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,567
Maybe you don't
know about us.

597
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:02,667
Oh, I know about you,
all right.

598
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,433
You're mostly ex-convicts
or ex-outlaws.

599
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,133
Nobody will give you a job.

600
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,867
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you're my crew.

601
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,533
As long as you do your job
and play square with me,

602
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,867
That's all I ask.

603
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't care who you are
or what you've done.

604
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,533
You're the first man
that's talked that way to us

605
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,533
In a long time.

606
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,067
You may be loco at that,

607
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,733
Driving cattle backwards
on the Oregon trail.

608
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,467
But if that's what
you want us to do,

609
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,533
We'll do it.

610
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,800
We're all
pretty good cowhands.

611
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,833
I believe you.

612
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,067
Maybe you won't think
I'm so loco

613
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,900
After I tell you what
I plan to do with the cows.

614
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,400
How about a drink?

615
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,700
Uh, I'd like
to go along, too.

616
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,067
I can cook.

617
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,567
You can cook?

618
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:44,533
All right.
Then you're hired.

619
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,533
There.

620
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,333
Well, you won't
need me anymore.

621
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,533
Thank you, Chuck.

622
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,733
That's fine, doc.

623
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,333
How soon will I be able
to ride again?

624
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,100
Right now,
if you want.

625
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,733
But don't overdo it.

626
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,100
Hey, let me do that.

627
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,400
Doc says I'm going
to live again.

628
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,400
Oh, he does?

629
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:09,567
He's healed up
very nicely, Janet,

630
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,700
Thanks to your care
and good cooking.

631
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,567
He doesn't owe it
all to me, doctor.

632
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,567
Steve Patrick helped him.
So did you.

633
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,467
Well, you're right
about Patrick.

634
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,967
There's no doubt
he saved Bob's life.

635
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,067
He must be
quite a man.

636
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,533
Yeah.

637
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,367
Yes, he is.

638
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,833
Well, goodbye.
See you soon.

639
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,567
So long, doc.
Thanks again.

640
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,967
Bye, sir.

641
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:34,267
You're getting to be
mighty polite all of a sudden.

642
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,367
How come?

643
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,067

a burden to you either.

Well, I'll be a dirt...

810

That is to say,
well, I'll be doggoned.

811

Would you take a look
at those?

812
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,733
Hot apple pie!

813
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,900
Get in line.

814
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,900
The smartest thing
the boss ever did

815
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,900
Was to hire you to cook
instead of me.

816

I sure never expected
nothing like this.

Oh, me neither.
Sure looks good.

Right there,

Thank you, lady.

Thank you, Janet.

836
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,067
Lucky thing for Bob
that you came along.

837
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:01,733
He's gotten
so used to your cooking,

838
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,767
He'd probably
starve to death

839
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,233
If he had to eat
any other kind.

840
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,633
We're all going to be spoiled
before this drive's over.

841
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,900
This could be serious.

842
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,133
Well, now I never
thought of that.

843

You're right, Ben.

844
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,567
Maybe I better
stop making pies.

845
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,200
Janet, don't you
pay any attention

846
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:17,267
To this half-pint.

847
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,633
You just keep
cooking like this,

848
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,800
And we'll drive them cows

849
00:44:19,867 --> 00:44:22,600
All the way
to the Atlantic ocean.

850

get your pie.

a good little cowboy, ma'am.

to eat his pie.

we can all bear up

do better tomorrow, huh?

To see if she had
a sense of humor.

You know,
a trail cook has to have

876
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,433
A better sense of humor
than anybody else.

877

Yes, sir.

878
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,400
Besides
a sense of humor,

879
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,867
The cook also
has an appetite.

used to the saddle

of the crew is.

the nighthawk job, Steve.

He's been inactive too long.

897
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:27,800
I think he just wants to feel
he's doing his share.

Listen, Steve.

Oh? What about them?

When I get them to Wyoming.

972
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,900
Now, we've lost
quite a few head

973
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,767
Because of the rough going.

974
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:25,267
That's why I'm not going
to kill any more for food.

975
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,933
We need every head
that can make it.

976
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:30,133
I'll probably
lose a lot more

977
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,267
Before I get
that new strain bred.

978
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,767
Sorry, but...

979
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:37,333
That's the way
it's got to be.

980
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,933
All right, boys.
You heard it.

981
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:44,533
Now do a little less complaining
and more work,

982
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,067
And we'll get where we're going
much faster.

983
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,233
Kincaid,
you've got nighthawk tonight.

984
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,067
Got a half an hour to finish up
and get out there.

985
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,067
I don't feel so good,
lynch.

986
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:54,767
Let somebody else
do it tonight.

987
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,100
Somebody else
will do it tomorrow.

988
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:57,567
You've got it.
Take it.

989
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,267
I'll take
nighthawk tonight.

990
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,133
You're not due
for three days.

991
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,600
I said I'd do it.

992
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,733
Good night, Steve.

993
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,867
Night.
Sleep well.

994
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,967
Thank you, Steve.

995
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:24,100
Ooh, it's getting colder.

996
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,800
Yeah, and it's not going
to get any warmer.

997
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:30,700
I only hope
we don't get a snow.

998
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:34,500
How much longer
do you think it'll be, Steve?

999
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:37,867
Oh, about a week
if our luck holds out.

1000
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,267
I'll be glad
when it's finished.

1001
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,467
Me, too.

1002
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:45,200
But I wouldn't have
missed it.

1003
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,467
You're quite a girl, Janet.

1004
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,900
It's been
a pretty rough trip.

1005
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,933
That's the second time
you've called me a girl.

1006
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:56,533
You liked it
the first time.

1007
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,967
Well, not anymore.

1008
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,233
Oh, why not?

1009
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,200
I'm afraid
you mean just that.

1010
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,367
Why shouldn't I mean it?

1011
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,800
I'd rather you thought of me
as a woman.

1012
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:17,600
Janet, i...

1013
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,867
I never had to ask a man
to kiss me before.

1014
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,633
I guess I've wanted
to do that for...

1015
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,800
For a long time.

1016
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:39,167
I don't believe it.

1017
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,900
If you'd wanted to,
you would've done it.

1018
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,167
I love you, Janet.

1019
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:45,633
Oh, I hope you do.

1020
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,233
Otherwise I'm making
an awful fool of myself.

1021
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,433
You are kind of bold at that.

1022
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,700
And you're
kind of backward.

1023
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,433
No wonder
you're still a bachelor.

1024
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,300
Oh, it's good to hear you
laugh again, Steve.

1025
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:02,067
I don't know why I am.

1026
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:03,533
I'm only adding
one more trouble

1027
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,133
To all my others.

1028
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,467
Oh...

1029
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,200
There are a couple answers
I'd like, Janet...

1030
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:19,900
If you don't mind.

1031
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:20,900
Very well.

1032
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:21,933
Do you love me?

1033
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,200
Yes.

1034
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:26,933
Want to marry me and move to
that dirty old cattle ranch?

1035
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,500
Oh, yes.

1036
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:30,500
What about Chicago?

1037
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:32,600
I never heard of it.

1038
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,900
Hold it right there.

1039
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,067
I want to see Maddox.

1040
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:51,500
Who are you?

1041
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:52,500
Andrews.

1042
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:53,467
Okay.

1043
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:06,733
[ Whistles ]

1044
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:15,800
Someone's coming
into the canyon.

1045
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:27,933
All right, boys.

1046
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:29,400
This is the man
we've been waiting for.

1047
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:31,433
How are you, Andrews?

1048
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,200
Right on time.
Come on in.

1049
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,400
All right.

1050
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:41,167
Just so we're sure
we got everything straight,

1051
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:43,067
Let's go over it again.

1052
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,567
Here's where we are now,

1053
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:48,200
And here's the herd
coming this way.

1054
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:50,767
We should be about here
by tomorrow night.

1055
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,267
I see.
We stampede the herd.

1056
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,400
That's right.

1057
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:55,767
I'll be out here
on the far side

1058
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,267
To turn the point
into the canyon.

1059
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,433
Then we do the rest.

1060
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,767
If Patrick and his men
follow the cattle,

1061
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,767
We'll be up in the rocks.

1062
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,600
And it'll make it
a real shooting gallery.

1063
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:05,767
It better.

1064
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,800
Patrick's got
a crew of gunslingers

1065
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:08,400
That he picked up
in Oregon.

1066
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,167
Looks like
you've made up your mind

1067
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:12,333
We can't do this
without killing Patrick.

1068
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,300
That's right.

1069
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,133
Now you're getting smart.

1070
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,067
Did you buy up the land
and mortgages like I told you?

1071
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,267
We've got all the land
we could possibly use.

1072
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,067
Good.

1073
00:57:21,067 --> 00:57:22,067
Tell me something.

1074
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,733
Does Patrick
know about this canyon?

1075
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,867
Sure he does.

1076
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:27,167
What better place to
turn a stampeding herd?

1077
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:28,467
He'll think
I'm doing him a favor

1078
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:29,733
By starting him
in there.

1079
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,733
Yeah. Good plan.

1080
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,867
Keep the cows bottled up here
in the canyon for a while,

1081
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:35,167
Put our brand on them,

1082
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,667
Drive them onto our own land
in a few days.

1083
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:40,600
You sure you can get that
nighthawk job in tomorrow?

1084
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,333
Don't you
worry about that.

1085
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,200
The time to
start the stampede

1086
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:46,567
Is about midnight
or 1:00 in the morning

1087
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,833
When everybody's
sure to be asleep.

1088
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,700
Graycoe, you ride out
and meet me.

1089
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,167
Okay.
You're the boss.

1090
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:54,933
Now there's just
one more thing.

1091
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,600
We've got
a woman in camp.

1092
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,233
Who is she?

1093
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,900
She's our cook.
She's got a kid with her.

1094
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:04,233
All right, Andrews.
It's your party.

1095
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,400
What'll we do about her?

1096
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,067
Don't do anything
about her.

1097
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,067
I'll kill the first man
who lays a hand on her

1098
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:10,300
Or that kid.

1099
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:14,067
Your job to
keep her quiet afterwards.

1100
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,600
That's right.

1101
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,800
It's my job,
and I'll take care of it.

1102
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:19,500
Everything straight now?

1103
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:21,067
Yeah.

1104
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:24,067
I better get back to the herd
before daylight.

1105
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,067
Give me some coffee.

1108
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,867
I guess I don't.
I'm sick.

1109
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,900
Give me some coffee.

1110
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,367

Kincaid.

1131
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:30,967
Get your stuff together.

1132
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:32,100
I'll handle him.

1133
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:33,667
You're not sick,
and you know it.

1134
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:35,833
You've been a cowhand
long enough to know

1135
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,800
That nobody drinks
on a trail drive.

1136
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,467
You're through,
Kincaid.

1137
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,733
Sure, I've been
a cowhand a long time.

1138
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,967
Long enough to know
that no trail boss

1139
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,100
Ever kept his crew
from eating meat.

1140
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,467
None of them worried more
about his fool cows

1141
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:50,300
Than he did about his men!

1142
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:51,967
You're crazy, Patrick.

1143
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:54,567
You're drunk, Kincaid,
and you're lucky to be.

1144
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:55,433
For that reason,

1145
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,567
I'm not going
to shoot you.

1146
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:58,800
Take your hand away
from that gun.

1147
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,633
Now get going.

1148
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:22,667
You sure you don't
want some grub?

1149
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,800
No, I don't want no grub.

You know,
Steve was right, Kincaid.

1151

You are a lucky man.

1152

He was within his rights
to have blown your head off.

1153

Good morning, Bob.

1154

clear through.

1156

1159
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:59,133

1164
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,467

Steve said
to take the herd

Up as far
as the flat rocks

1172

of river canyon.

where it was.

1174
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,800
Yeah, I know.
What happened to Steve?

1175
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:00,133
He's up scouting ahead,

1176
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,333
Said he'd meet us
back in camp tonight.

1177
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,600
All right.

1178
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,100
I've been meaning to talk
to you about this morning.

1179
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,533
That was a pretty quick piece
of thinking.

1180
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,833
A good shot, too.

1181
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,067
I'm sorry about Kincaid
going bad like that,

1182
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,233
But, well,
it happens sometimes.

1183
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,233
The whole crew's
gone a little sour.

1184
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,300
Oh, they'll be all right,

1185
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:21,233
If I have to sit on
every one of them myself.

1186
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,700
I still can't figure out

1187
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:24,700
Why you all signed on
as cowpunchers

1188
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,067
For $40 a month.

1189
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:29,233
That's $40 more
than we were making.

1190
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,133
You don't have
to kid me, lynch.

1191
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,133
I'm not.

1192
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,833
Bob, let me
tell you something.

1193
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,767
I've done a lot of things
in my life to make a living...

1194
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,867
A little robbing,
a little rustling.

1195
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,233
An awful lot of running.

1196
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,367
Yes, sometimes we made
more than $40 a month,

1197
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:46,467
But I haven't felt this good
since I was a kid.

1198
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:47,767
I feel good.

1199
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,067
Maybe you won't
when you get into town

1200
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,333
And try to do anything
with that money.

1201
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,767
$40 doesn't go very far.

1202
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:54,867
Far enough.

1203
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:57,367
Steve's promised us jobs
on the ranch.

1204
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,067
I'd work for that man
for nothing.

1205
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:02,200
You know, I feel
I'm pretty lucky,

1206
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:03,733
Having met up with Steve.

1207
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,667
But you're
even luckier, Bob.

1208
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:07,400
Why?
How do you figure?

1209

You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

1210
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:12,067
If you're smart,
you'll stick with Steve.

1211
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:14,067
He's going to be
a big cattleman some day,

1212
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:15,833
And you'll grow
right along with him.

1213

He likes you...

1214
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:21,067
As much as if you were
his own brother.

But whatever it is,
I hope you get over it...

Whoa! Go!

you're doing, Chuck.

this time you're wrong.

1230

We might as well admit it.

to be much longer.

on his side.

That's why we want
to quit right now,

1238

had meat for a few days,

But it's
a pretty small deer.

Couldn't be more than
30 or 40 steaks on him.

Only a 6-pointer.
