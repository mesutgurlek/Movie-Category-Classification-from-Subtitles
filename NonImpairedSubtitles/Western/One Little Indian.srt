1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Bring the rope.

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,000
Get on your feet, Keyes.

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,800
You gotta give him one thing, Sergeant.
He's a gambler.

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No gamble.
We got nothing to lose. Put it on him.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Come on, gambler.

6
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,000
If I can't trust you on a horse,
you're gonna have to walk.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Start getting used
to that rope around your neck.

8
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Get that rope off of him.
Put him back on his horse.

9
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Corporal! Let 'em rest.

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Down. Sit down. Rest.

11
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,800
- Sergeant Raines, sir.
- Lieutenant Cummins, Fort Dorado.

12
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,400
- Where are you headed?
- Escorting a prisoner to General Crook.

13
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Your prisoner
looks a little worse for wear, Sergeant.

14
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,200
- What happened to you, soldier?
- I fell off my horse.

15
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,800
He tried to make a break for it
three times, sir.

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- I could sure use another man.
- I'm sorry, Sergeant. I can't spare one.

17
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,200
We're still two days from Dorado.
You can reach the general by tomorrow.

18
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
Move him out, Schrader.

20
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Platoon dismissed!

21
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Lieutenant Cummins reporting, sir,
with 19 hostiles. Cheyenne, sir.

22
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
This far south, in Apache country?

23
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
I ran onto 'em just north of Santa Fe.

24
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Their braves must be dead
or on a reservation, I guess.

25
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
You guess?

26
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, Lieutenant,
that's just what we needed for Christmas.

27
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Some of the men
are gonna have to miss the holidays

28
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,000
taking this crew
to the Cheyenne-Arapaho agency.

29
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
You'll be in charge of the detail.

30
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Have the doctor examine them.

32
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,600
You can set up a quarantine tent outside
if it's needed

33
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
and let the rest sleep in the old barracks.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Corporal, move them out
over to the barracks.

36
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Right this way.

37
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,800
You people, move over this way.

38
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Right this way.

39
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,000
All right, spread 'em out. Sit 'em down
here on the porch. All along here.

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sit down. Sit.

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Mail call! Mail call!

42
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Mail call!

43
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,400
All right, now.
I'm gonna look at you one at a time.

44
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,800
Nothing to be afraid of. You understand?

45
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If any of you are sick, we'll try to help you.

46
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Will you stand up here, please?

47
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
Go get him.

48
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Open your shirt, please.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
Could you open your shirt?

50
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,400
Come on, not like that.
What's the matter with you?

51
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
- Hey, come back, you!
- Here, doc.

52
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Hey, what's going on?

53
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Give me that horse.

54
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

55
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
- Give me your hand.
- Never mind me, get the kid.

56
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Come back here, Bill. This way.

57
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
You men, get after those mules!

58
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,000
- Come on, move.
- Come back.

59
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Give me a hand here, Murphy.

60
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
- Hey, kid, come here.
- Look out.

61
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Stop him, Kaplan.

62
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,400
- Son, come on back.
- He's a real wildcat, he is.

63
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,800
- He's white, sir.
- I'm not blind, Sergeant.

64
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Come on, get down from there.

65
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,400
- The guardhouse is empty, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,800
- Then lock him up.
- You can't sentence him to there.

67
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,400
I am not sentencing him, John.

68
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,000
But I got to put him someplace
while I figure out what to do with him.

69
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
I suppose there's no chance
of finding his parents?

70
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
None. He's probably one of those captured
by the Cheyenne after the massacre.

71
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
Indians raised him
as a member of the tribe.

72
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
What I mean, sir, is... I'd like to take him.

73
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
He'll have to be kept under lock and key.

74
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,400
I want him out of the way when we send
those others to the reservation next week.

75
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Yes, sir, I understand.

76
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,200
All right. I'll hold both of you responsible.

77
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Well, come on, son.

79
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,800
Come on, you.

80
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You're being given a name.

81
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you understand?

82
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,600
Dearly beloved,
none can enter the kingdom of God

83
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,800
except he be regenerate and born anew
of water and the Holy Ghost.

84
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,200
Who speaks for this child?

85
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Sergeant.

86
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
I do.

87
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Dost thou, in the name of the child,
renounce the devil and all his works?

88
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I do.

89
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The child's name?

90
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
Mark.

91
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I baptize thee Mark

92
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
in the name of the Trinity.

93
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,200
From this day forward,
you will be known as Mark to all men.

94
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Lead, kindly light,
amid the encircling gloom

95
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Lead thou me on

96
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,200
The night is dark and I am far from home

97
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Lead thou me on

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Keep thou my feet

99
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,000
I do not ask to see

100
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
The distant scene

101
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,600
One step enough for me

102
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Amen

103
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
You men can put out your candles now.

104
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
During the offertory,
we'll sing "Silent Night".

105
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,000
Silent night

106
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,400
Holy night

107
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,800
All is calm

108
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
All is bright

109
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Round yon virgin mother and child

110
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Holy infant so tender and mild

111
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Sleep in heavenly peace

112
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Sleep in heavenly peace

113
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Silent night

114
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Holy night

115
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Shepherds quake at the sight

116
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,200
Glories stream from heaven afar

117
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah

118
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Christ the savior is born

119
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Christ the savior is born

120
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
You look for Cheyenne?

121
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,400
He can't have gone far.
You check over there, I'll look on this side.

122
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
- Did you see the boy come out?
- No, sarge.

123
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Hup. Let's go. Hup.

124
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Boy...

125
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Let me see that arm.

126
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,800
That's not too bad.

127
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
We'll put something on it.

128
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
All right, now sit down there.

129
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll get you some water.

130
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Oh, shut up, you rotten, no-good piece of...

131
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Here, drink some of this.

132
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Don't overdo it. Slowly.

133
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Got some carbolic in here.

134
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,400
I can promise you
it's gonna hurt you more than it will me.

135
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Give me that arm.

136
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That'll keep it from festering, anyway.

137
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
That military disaster over there,

138
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
she's called Rosebud.

139
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,400
You can call her Rosie, if you've a mind to.

140
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Shut up.

141
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
Give me that gun.

142
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,400
I said give me that gun
before I break it over your backside.

143
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
All right. I shot you.

144
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Now we're even.

145
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Next time you use a Winchester,

146
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,400
you just make sure
there's a cartridge in the chamber, huh?

147
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
What's your name?

148
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm not gonna ask you again.

149
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
Mark.

150
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,400
Mark? Mark what?

151
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,000
Just Mark.

152
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm Clint Keyes.

153
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,200
What are you doing out here all
by your lonesome? Where are your folks?

154
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Can't leave you out here by yourself, so...

155
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
I'll take you as far as those mountains.

156
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,800
Then I'm heading south, to Mexico.

157
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Do you understand that, boy?

158
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's the thirstiest critter I ever saw.
He don't even know he's a camel.

159
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,200
Thirsty?

160
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Appears to me he answered to that.

161
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,200
I've been looking for a handle for him.
Come here, Thirsty. Come on.

162
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Camels don't cotton to me too much.
Why don't you call him?

163
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
Here, Thirsty.

164
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Come on, Thirsty.

165
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Seems like he knows who he is
when you say it.

166
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
All right. Down. Come on.

167
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,800
Coosh. Down. Coosh.

168
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Down.

169
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Most miserable animal I ever saw.

170
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,000
What I need is a good horse.

171
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Come on over here and get up.

172
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
There you go.

173
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
OK. Clamp a jaw on that, huh?

174
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Up, Rosie. Up.

175
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,400
Two camels. Keyes here.

176
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Small boy here also.

177
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
A small boy?

178
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Girl, maybe.

179
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
- Thirsty!
- Thirsty can't keep up.

180
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,000
- He'll have to go it alone.
- Thirsty!

181
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Now, who told you to do that, huh?

182
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
One more time
and you're gonna be camel stew.

183
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,000
You're not lovable and you're not ridable.

184
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Maybe you're eatable.

185
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Come on, Thirsty. Come on.

186
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
All right, we'll go a little slower.

187
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,200
First decent place we find, we'll stop.

188
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Come on, bring him along.

189
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,000
OK, Rosie. Let's do it right for a change.

190
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Rosie, you rotten animal.

191
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,400
Rosebud!

192
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,000
All right, that does it.
Mark, go get me a stick.

193
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Shut up.

194
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm gonna teach this big bag of trouble

195
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,000
it can be more painful sitting down
than standing up and walking.

196
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
Up, Rosie. Up!

197
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,600
Come on.

198
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
- What are you laughing at?
- You look like big Cheyenne chief.

199
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,200
You're gonna look like a wet papoose,
'cause you're next.

200
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
All right, now. Come here.

201
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Come on.

202
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,200
- You no catch me.
- It ain't gonna hurt you. Come here.

203
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,200
All right, all right, all right.
You win. Forget it.

204
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,800
You wanna stay that way,
you stay that way.

205
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,600
Bring me my boots and my britches, then.

206
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
No!

207
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,200
You haven't had those buckskins off
since they sewed 'em on you.

208
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Stop!

209
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
You ain't any more Cheyenne than I am.

210
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,200
That white skin
ain't gonna get you out of taking a bath.

211
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm tired of walking downwind of you.

212
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
No! No! Stop!

213
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,200
- All right. Give me those britches.
- No. No.

214
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,000
You give me those britches
or I'm coming in there to get 'em.

215
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Give 'em here.

216
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,200
And here, use that. That's soap.

217
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Go on, use it. Nobody ever died from it.

218
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,600
Go on, rub. It won't hurt.

219
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
You see? Doesn't hurt a bit, does it?

220
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You don't know your name
or who your folks were, huh?

221
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,600
- Where did you learn to speak English?
- We had other white-eyes.

222
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Other captives?

223
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
You long knife now?

224
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I was a soldier.

225
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Now you'd call me a deserter.

226
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,400
They were gonna hang me
until I bust out of the guardhouse.

227
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,000
I couldn't figure out a way
to get a horse out of that fort.

228
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,200
Had what was left
of the camel corps outside,

229
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,400
so I grabbed
that moth-eaten bag of misery,

230
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,400
not knowing she was the mother
of your friend Thirsty over there.

231
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,000
You take me to Blue Feather?

232
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
- Who's that?
- My mother.

233
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,200
Oh, I see.

234
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
You take me?

235
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,800
I can't do that, son.
See, I'm headed for Mexico, in a hurry.

236
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I go, then.

237
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Wait a minute.

238
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,000
You're not going anywhere.

239
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Not with that patrol on my tail, you're not.

240
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,800
Look, Mark, by now they know
you're traveling with me.

241
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,000
You know where I am
and where I'm headed.

242
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If they grab you, they'll sweat it out of you.

243
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
I don't talk.

244
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,800
Well, I don't take chances.

245
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,600
I'll turn you loose when I think it's safe,
and not before.

246
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,600
In the meantime, Mark,
we gotta trust each other.

247
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You understand?

248
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Boy with Keyes.
Water two camels last night.

249
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
No fresh sign?

250
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,800
See if you can pick up their trail.

251
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Hold it.

252
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
Now turn around and face the water,
all of you.

253
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
Drop your weapons behind you.

254
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,400
This ain't gonna make it
any easier for you, Keyes.

255
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,200
Nobody ever made it easy for me, Raines.

256
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
All right, now. After those horses.

257
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,800
Both of you first.
And, Raines, you stay right in front of me.

258
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Move.

259
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,600
Schrader, get rid of the horses!

260
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Get out! Get out!

261
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,200
All right, move! Move! Move!

262
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,200
That's far enough.

263
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
All right, Schrader. Where's your gun?

264
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Well, Sergeant, you'd better get moving.

265
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,400
With no horses,
it's gonna be a long, dry walk.

266
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Yeah, I know. Get moving.

267
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
We do good, huh, Clint?

268
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, sure.

269
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,800
Sure. No horses, no grub.
We really cleaned up.

270
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,200
They'll be back. You can count on it.

271
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Come on. See if we can fool 'em.

272
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,400
We'll hide out in these mountains
for a couple of days.

273
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,200
Right now, though,
we better find us some grub.

274
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,600
- That's cattle.
- I hear a long time ago.

275
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Thanks for telling me.

276
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,000
What's the matter, Clint?

277
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,800
You talk to camels.
Tell her to get off my foot.

278
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Move, Rosie.

279
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,400
You...

280
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,000
That's beef for Fort Dorado, likely.

281
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Bacon. I smell.

282
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,600
You'd like a little of that, huh?

283
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Clint, we got nothing to eat.

284
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
Cheyenne quiet. I steal.

285
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,200
You gotta get over the idea that any time
you want anything, you can just go steal it.

286
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
We'll wait till they quiet down.

287
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Then I'll steal the bacon.

288
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,400
- Something wrong, boss?
- They're kinda spooky tonight.

289
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm gonna get me some water.

290
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm kinda thirsty myself.

291
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
- Drink.
- Much obliged.

292
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah, they look kinda dancey, at that.

293
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,600
It's funny. There's no wind, no sand.
Nothing to make 'em spook.

294
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,600
We better keep an eye on 'em.

295
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Rosie! What are you doing here?

296
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Come on, Rosie.

297
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Coosh. Coosh down.

298
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Rosie, get down.

299
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,200
Get up. They're spooking. Get your horses,
quick. Get up over there. Let's go.

300
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,600
Get down.

301
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
Pull 'em in, Tom! Pull 'em in!
Come on, get 'em in!

302
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,800
Oh, you dumb... Rosie! Easy.

303
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
- What was that?
- I don't know.

304
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Go, Rosie. Let's go. Go!

305
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Go! Go, Rosie! Go!

306
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,800
No, Rosie!

307
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Rosie! Rosie, stop!

308
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Rosie! Rosie, stop!

309
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,000
Rosie, now you've gone far enough!
No, Rosie. No.

310
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Stop that camel!

311
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh, no!

312
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
How many more?

313
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,000
I know about those. How many more?

314
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Not many, Clint.

315
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,400
Well, what are you doing, Rosie?

316
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
Get outta here! Go on! Get, Rosie!

317
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,800
- She's sorry, Clint.
- Yeah, she's sorry.

318
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,000
Before getting mixed up with her
I should have stayed in the guardhouse

319
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and let 'em hang me, peaceful, like.

320
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,000
That's all, Clint.

321
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,400
Carbolic. Like you said,
it's gonna hurt you more than me.

322
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,000
Won't fester.

323
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
Whoa, Rosie. Whoa.

324
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
I gotta get down, kid.

325
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,200
Take this. Here.

326
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I've sat on campfires
that were more comfortable.

327
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
Come on, Rosie.

328
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, this looks
like as good a place as any.

329
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What's that?

330
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,000
All in a wood there grew a tree

331
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,200
The finest tree you ever did see

332
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,800
And the green leaves
grew around and around

333
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
And the green leaves grew around

334
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
- Let's do it again, Mama.
- All right.

335
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,600
One more chorus
and then we have to finish our packing.

336
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,600
And on this tree there grew a limb

337
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,800
The finest limb you ever did see

338
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,200
The limb was on the tree

339
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
The tree was in the wood

340
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,200
They don't have camels in New Mexico,
do they, Mama?

341
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,200
No, dear, they don't.

342
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,000
- And the green leaves grew...
- Something's eating at our corn.

343
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,600
And the green leaves grew around

344
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Judas Priest, it is a camel!

345
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,400
- But you said that...
- I know what I said. Get back inside.

346
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,800
It's only a little camel, Mama.

347
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Let's hope it's big enough
to know what a shotgun is.

348
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Git! Come on! Get out of my corn.

349
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,200
I said git! Get out of here!

350
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Git! Git!

351
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
Don't go in the barn! Git!

352
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,800
- Nothing to be afraid of, ma'am.
- Who are you?

353
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,600
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

354
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Well, we'd just like something to... eat,
if you've got it, ma'am.

355
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,400
We'll be leaving here in a few days.
You can take everything then.

356
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,200
Oh, well, we'll be gone long before that.

357
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,600
Are you... Is there anyone else here?

358
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
No, just me and my little girl.

359
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
We sold everything. Even the stock.

360
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,400
You can take anything you want.
Just leave us alone. Please.

361
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,000
There's no need to worry, ma'am.
We're camped nearby.

362
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,400
Here. We won't make any trouble.

363
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Come on, Mark.

364
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Is he yours? I never knew anyone
who had a camel before.

365
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
They're here!

366
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,200
- These are fresh this morning.
- Well, thank you.

367
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
My name is Clint Keyes and this is Mark.

368
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,200
Oh, I'm Doris Mclver.
This is my daughter Martha.

369
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,200
- Are you with the army, Mr. Keyes?
- Not just now, no, ma'am.

370
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,800
- Where's the camel?
- We left it back at camp.

371
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,800
I don't understand. I didn't know they had
camels in the middle of New Mexico.

372
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,200
Jeff Davis brought them over when he was
Secretary of War, for the desert troops.

373
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,200
- But yours is just a baby.
- We have the mother camel too.

374
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,200
A big camel? Mama, can I see it, please?

375
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah. Mark'd love to show it to her.

376
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,600
- Well, I don't know...
- It's all right. Mark loves to show 'em off.

377
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,800
You said you were leaving. Maybe
there's something I could do to help.

378
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,800
No, thank you. They're sending a wagon
out from town for us tomorrow morning.

379
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We'll take the stagecoach from there.

380
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,400
We're going back to Colorado.
Mountain Creek.

381
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,800
We came out here
for my husband's health.

382
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,800
But it was no use. It was too late.

383
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,200
I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.

384
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,600
If you'll take these, I'll cut some wood.

385
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Oh, thank you.

386
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,000
Oh, Mr. Keyes.
I notice you're limping.

387
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,000
- Are you hurt?
- Oh, I just had a little accident.

388
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,000
I've had some nursing.
Would you like me to look at it?

389
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,400
No, ma'am. It'll be fine. Just fine.

390
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,400
- Do you ride it?
- Sure.

391
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,600
Could I ride it? Please.

392
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,600
Could I ride the little one?

393
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Why not?

394
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,200
You're a girl.

395
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,600
Well, she's the mother. She's a girl too.

396
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,000
All right. You ride.

397
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
Coosh, Rosie. Coosh.

398
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,800
Coosh down. Coosh. Coosh.

399
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,000
- Coosh. Ready?
- Yeah.

400
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
Up, Rosie. Up.

401
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Come on, Rosie.

402
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,800
Take this requisition to Fort Dorado.

403
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,600
They'll give you cash
for your saddles and side arms

404
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,200
and replace them horses
we're taking there.

405
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,000
Fine. This man you're after...

406
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,400
If it ain't a government secret,
what did he do?

407
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,200
Mutinied. Deserted up in Wyoming.

408
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,800
We caught up with him,
took him to General Crook's headquarters.

409
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,600
Busted out of the guardhouse there
and attacked a noncommissioned officer.

410
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,200
And you say he was headed for Mexico?

411
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,000
Heading south. Figures.

412
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,400
Well, maybe, but if it was me on the run,
I'd stay off that open desert.

413
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Hole up in these mountains around here
for a while.

414
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,800
You just may be right. Thanks.

415
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Good luck, Sergeant.

416
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,600
Thank you.

417
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,200
There's more than enough fish
if you and the boy'd care to stay for supper.

418
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,200
Well, no, I don't think we ought to.
That's very kind of you.

419
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,000
- You mean you don't like fish?
- No, ma'am, it's not that.

420
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's just that Mark and I
aren't exactly dressed. I have to shave.

421
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,400
Well, there's plenty of time
if you want to shave.

422
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,400
Well, the truth is I just lost my razor.

423
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
You're welcome to use my husband's
if you like.

424
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,600
You're already packed.
I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble.

425
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,600
Oh, no trouble.

426
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
Why don't you and Mark sleep in the barn?

427
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
You'll be more comfortable there.

428
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,200
I'm obliged again, ma'am.

429
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,400
Come on, Mark!

430
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,200
He depends on you a lot, doesn't he?

431
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, I guess, but mostly he's just trying
to use me to get to Blue Feather.

432
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Are you going to take him?

433
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,800
I can't. I'm headed to Mexico.

434
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
Oh. I didn't know that.

435
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,800
With the boy?

436
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,200
No, ma'am.

437
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,600
What are you gonna do with him?

438
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,600
- My problem, I guess.
- You just can't leave him.

439
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,800
Well, I know that.

440
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,600
But he doesn't belong in Mexico

441
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,800
any more than he belongs
in a teepee on a reservation.

442
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,400
What he needs is a home and a family.

443
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,400
It's a mite hard to tell
whether a camel loves you or hates you.

444
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,000
- Either way, they're ornery as sin.
- I love 'em.

445
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,600
I guess you've gotta give 'em credit,
though.

446
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,200
Heat doesn't bother 'em,
neither does the cold.

447
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,800
The biggest ones can travel 15, 16
miles an hour carrying a ton of weight.

448
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,400
They can outlast any horse.

449
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,000
You certainly know a lot about camels,
Mr. Keyes.

450
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,800
- Just hearsay.
- Oh.

451
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,600
- Where are you going?
- Camels.

452
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,800
First you say excuse me.

453
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,200
And then you say thank you to Mrs. Mclver.

454
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Go on, say it.

455
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,200
- Uh, Martha...
- I just wanna talk to Mark.

456
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,400
- I think you'd better go to bed now, dear.
- But it's early.

457
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,800
Martha, we're leaving tomorrow.
It's gonna be a very long, hard day.

458
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
I can't figure out what's eating Mark.

459
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,400
Oh, he just feels out of place.
A little jealous, I think.

460
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,200
I don't mean to pry,

461
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,800
but is there some reason
you can't take him to Mexico with you?

462
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Yeah, there sure is.

463
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,200
Doris, I'm on the run.

464
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,200
- You mean somebody's after you?
- An army patrol.

465
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,400
Well.

466
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,400
What I did I'm not exactly proud of,
but I'm not ashamed of it either.

467
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,400
Well, I'm sure what you did
you thought was right.

468
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,400
Well, I guess I'd better put these away.

469
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,800
Let me help you.

470
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,200
I don't know exactly how to say this,
but you've been honest with me.

471
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,600
- I'd like to explain to you about Mark.
- What about him?

472
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,400
Let's not pretend. You've been hinting all
day, trying to get me to say I'd take the boy.

473
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Well, you're right. I have.

474
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,000
You say what he needs
is a home and a family.

475
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,800
A family. Not half a family.

476
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,400
I'd be less than human if my heart didn't go
out to the boy, but I can't listen to my heart.

477
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,600
It's gonna be hard enough
for Martha and me.

478
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Teach a little piano and do a little nursing.

479
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,600
But a mother and daughter
can always get along.

480
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,600
Oh, you figure
I'm just trying to get shut of the boy.

481
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,400
Right now, that's true.

482
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,200
- If I had a choice...
- But you don't have a choice.

483
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,200
- I know that.
- I can't keep him either.

484
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,400
I know that too.

485
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,200
Could I dry the dishes for you
or something?

486
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,200
No, I'll just let 'em soak.

487
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,200
I think you better go out
and see how he is.

488
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Clint?

489
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,800
I tell you what I will do.
I'll take Mark up north with me tomorrow.

490
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,600
I'll do my level best
to find him a good family.

491
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:22,000
- That's the most I can promise.
- Nobody could ask for more than that.

492
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,200
I want to thank you.

493
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,000
Well... I've got a busy day tomorrow.

494
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Doris...

495
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Doris, uh...

496
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,800
Doris, I forgot to give this back to you.

497
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh. Why don't you just keep it?

498
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,800
Well, I can make good use of it. Thank you.

499
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,800
I must say,
it's made quite an improvement. You.

500
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
Without the beard.

501
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Good night, Doris.

502
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,800
- Clint?
- Yeah?

503
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,800
I do wrong, huh, Clint?

504
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,200
Well, they're good people, Mark.

505
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,600
You eat their food.
A little thank-you's not too much to ask.

506
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,000
It's one of those things you'll have to learn.

507
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,200
But you're not mad at me now?

508
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,400
No. No, we're friends, aren't we?

509
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,800
You good friend, Clint. I not forget.

510
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,000
Mark? I have something to tell you.

511
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,800
- You're going to come with us.
- Shh.

512
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Mark.

513
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,400
Clint would have taken you if he could,

514
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,400
but he thought it was better
if you stayed with us for a little while.

515
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,000
You'll love Colorado.
We're gonna ride on the stagecoach.

516
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Mark, let me talk to you.

517
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,200
Please, Mark, listen.

518
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Martha and I both want you to go with us.

519
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,200
You can stay with us as long as you like.

520
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,600
Mark.

521
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Wait.

522
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,400
Please.

523
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,400
Please.

524
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,000
Cheyenne don't cry.

525
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Mark.

526
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,400
- Where's Clint Keyes?
- Keyes?

527
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,200
Schrader, search the house.

528
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,400
Dixon, you take the barn.

529
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,800
I said, "Where's Keyes?"

530
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,800
I'm gonna find out, ma'am.

531
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's my job.

532
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,600
Anything?

533
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,400
- Give me the boy.
- He's done nothing wrong.

534
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,600
If you won't tell me about Keyes,
he'll have to.

535
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,000
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Keyes... isn't here.

536
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,200
He... He left last night.

537
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,000
- Which way did he go?
- I don't know. I didn't see him leave.

538
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,800
You might as well tell me the rest of it.

539
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Um... well, he talked about north, I think.

540
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,600
Try south.

541
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Jimmy Wolf!

542
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,400
- Any signs?
- Camel tracks. This way.

543
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,200
Get after him.

544
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,000
Much obliged for your help, ma'am.

545
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Get up! Come on!

546
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Mark!

547
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,000
Martha? Martha?

548
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,600
Martha? It's time to go.

549
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,800
Mama, I can't find Mark anywhere.

550
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,200
I know, dear, but you've been looking
and calling for a long time now

551
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,800
and we really have to go now.

552
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,400
That's right, ma'am. We better hustle.
You're gonna miss your stage.

553
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,800
But we just can't leave Mark, Mama.

554
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,200
I don't wanna leave him
any more than you do, Martha.

555
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,400
But he must be
miles away from here by now.

556
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,400
He's not. He's still here. I know he is.

557
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Martha, he'll find Mr. Keyes.
I'm sure he will.

558
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Now, come on.

559
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Now, up we go.

560
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,600
Get up!

561
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,000
Mark! Mark!

562
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Goodbye, Mark!

563
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Goodbye!

564
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,600
Goodbye, Mark!

565
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
Goodbye!

566
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,800
Rosie! Ho!

567
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,400
Rosie, if you wanna be the only humpless
camel in the world, you just keep that up.

568
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,000
Coosh, coosh. Coosh.

569
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Coosh.

570
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,600
Steady, now. Easy.

571
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Whoa. Whoa, girl.

572
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,800
Up, Rosie, up.

573
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,600
Well, Rosie, this is the end of the line.

574
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,800
All right, Rosie. Hightail it outta here.

575
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,400
Rosie, it's what you've always wanted.
Now go.

576
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,200
Rosie,
don't go getting sentimental on me now.

577
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,200
I haven't got that much time.
Now, get outta here.

578
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,600
All right, Rosie. Ha! Ha!

579
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,000
Camel. This way.

580
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,000
Looks like we're driving him
down towards the desert.

581
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,400
Come, Thirsty. This way.

582
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Carbolic?

583
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,200
Sure bet you didn't expect him to trap
himself in no box canyon, huh, sarge?

584
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,800
Shut up, Dixon. You just be ready
when he flushes him out of there.

585
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,200
- What did you see from the rim?
- He is not there.

586
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,600
What do you mean he's not there?
Where is he?

587
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,000
We follow empty camel.

588
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
We fo...

589
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Follow empty camel!

590
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,200
Dixon, go get that camel.
We're heading back.

591
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,800
What do we need
that old camel for, sarge?

592
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,000
Because we haven't got but four horses.

593
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,200
Or would you rather ride double
with Keyes?

594
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Move.

595
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,600
Tell Schrader
he can quit looking for Keyes.

596
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,200
Help!

597
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,200
Rope him, you dumb john!

598
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,200
Get back!

599
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Stop!

600
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,400
I wish I'd have let you
ride double with Keyes.

601
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,400
All I was trying to do was find you a family.

602
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,400
That's nothing to get sore about.

603
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,600
I only promised to take you
as far as the mountains, remember?

604
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,200
- You left me.
- Sure I left you.

605
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,600
I left you with Mrs. Mclver
so you could live regular.

606
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,800
Maybe go to school
and make something out of yourself.

607
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,600
- I'll fix you something to eat.
- Not hungry.

608
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
All right.

609
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,600
Why didn't you go with 'em, Mark?

610
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,400
I go to Blue Feather. You take me now?

611
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,600
You know I can't do that.
Not with that patrol still on my tail.

612
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,600
I'd lose too many miles.

613
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,800
- I got a good idea, Clint.
- Yeah. What kind of idea?

614
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,600
You take me to Cheyenne.
They hide you. They my friends.

615
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,800
The Cheyenne hide me?

616
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,400
Oh, kid, neither one of us could get
within spitting distance of that reservation.

617
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:54,000
Set one foot inside that fort and they'll
grab you just like they did at Fort Dorado.

618
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,800
To them you're just a white captive,
kidnapped by Indians.

619
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:03,800
To the Indians, you're nothing but trouble,
and they know it.

620
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,800
Now, Mark...

621
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,000
Ah, Blue Feather...

622
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Blue Feather won't take you back
because she can't.

623
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,400
You gotta understand that.

624
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Son, I... I'm sorry.

625
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,800
I'm sorry, I know it's tough.

626
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,400
It's not like you're gonna be alone.

627
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,800
I mean, you'll be with me.

628
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,800
I'm not gonna leave you here.

629
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:48,800
All right, I know I left you at the farm,
but I explained about that.

630
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Hey. We always got along.

631
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,000
We're partners, ain't we?

632
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:01,800
We can go on down to Mexico together.
We can make it down there.

633
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,000
No.

634
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,400
You don't want me.

635
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,600
I go to Cheyenne.

636
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,600
Now, wait a minute, kid.

637
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,000
I'm tired of arguing with you.

638
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,600
All right. You want your Indians?

639
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
I'll show you how to get there.

640
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,400
And I hope you like what you get.

641
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,400
Here's our mountain right here.

642
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,800
You go on the other side of it.

643
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
You get over there, you go north,

644
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,200
maybe three, four days
till you hit the Canadian River,

645
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,800
and it's gonna be high this time of year.

646
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:41,000
When you hit it, you turn east,
maybe seven, eight days.

647
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,400
And right here's your reservation,
long knives and all.

648
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
We got you surrounded, Keyes!

649
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,600
Rosie.

650
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
Hold it, Keyes.

651
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,800
All right, Corporal.

652
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,000
This time I give the party.

653
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,000
Troopers, fall in!

654
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,600
Dress right! Dress!

655
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,000
Ready! Front!

656
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,200
Parade! Dress!

657
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,200
Whoa! Ten-hut!

658
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,000
- Take 'em out, Sergeant.
- Forward!

659
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,600
Welcome back, sir.
How did the maneuvers go?

660
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,600
Lieutenant, what is that thing doing
on my parade ground?

661
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,200
It's a gallows, sir.

662
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
What I want to know, Lieutenant,

663
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,200
is why is it there
and who authorized its construction?

664
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,600
A patrol under Sergeant Raines
brought in a prisoner.

665
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,800
He has orders from General Crook.

666
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,600
Well, Lieutenant, you bring that sergeant
and his patrol to my office.

667
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,000
- Yes, sir.
- And on the double, Lieutenant.

668
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,200
What are you, Sergeant?
Some sort of traveling hangman?

669
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,000
No, sir. But my orders are
to capture the prisoner and execute him.

670
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,400
Signed by General Crook, sir.

671
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:33,200
Do your orders refer to the usual courtesies
extended a commanding officer?

672
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:38,000
I didn't know when you'd be back, sir.
Nobody here could tell me.

673
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,400
So you simply took over my command?

674
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,000
No, sir. I was just following my orders.

675
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,800
- Where is the prisoner?
- I can get him for you, sir.

676
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,200
Sergeant!
When I need your help, I'll tell you.

677
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,600
- I asked you where he is.
- He's in the guardhouse, sir.

678
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,800
Have the prisoner brought in here.

679
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,600
- You're Corporal Clinton Keyes?
- Yes, sir.

680
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,600
You took part in McKenzie's raid
on Dull Knife's village.

681
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,400
Yes, sir.

682
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,000
You were convicted
of mutiny and desertion.

683
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,400
That's all it says here, Corporal.
I'd like to know what happened.

684
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,000
There were 173 lodges in
Dull Knife's village. We destroyed them all.

685
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,600
The man next to me started shooting
the women, so I hit him with my rifle.

686
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,400
When you say a man,
you mean another trooper?

687
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,800
Yes, sir.

688
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,800
Then what did you do?

689
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,800
I tried to help the braves with their families.

690
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,400
Against your officers
and your fellow troopers.

691
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,600
If you mean did I shoot at them, no, sir.

692
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,000
- But you did mutiny.
- That's what they called it.

693
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,000
Corporal, you seem to feel that each man
has a right to consult his conscience

694
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
and decide which orders he will obey
and which he will disobey.

695
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Take him out.

696
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,000
Sergeant, I want this execution finished
as quickly as possible.

697
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,600
There will be no formalities.

698
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,200
No members of my command
will participate in any way whatsoever.

699
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,600
You are solely responsible, Sergeant.
You understand?

700
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,400
- Sir, my orders state that...
- Dismissed, Sergeant.

701
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,800
I'm glad you asked for me,

702
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,400
but I wanted you to know
that I'd have come in any event.

703
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,000
- Now, is there anything...
- I know all that, Reverend.

704
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,400
Uh, Reverend,

705
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,400
do you remember a boy brought here with
some Cheyenne, by the name of Mark?

706
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,800
Mark? Yes, I do.
Is he all right? Where is he?

707
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,800
That's what I don't know.

708
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,000
He should be halfway across the desert
if he's heading towards the reservation.

709
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
- Looking for Blue Feather.
- Yeah.

710
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,600
- How do you know about the boy?
- I ran onto him north of here.

711
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,600
We were sort of partners for a while
until we had a little set-to.

712
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:22,400
I guess I sort of forgot which one
was the man and which one was the boy.

713
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,000
- Chaplain, what I wanna ask is a favor.
- Anything, if I can.

714
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,400
Well, if the boy makes it to the reservation,
the army'll grab him for sure.

715
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,600
They'll need a home for him.

716
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,600
I ran onto this widow woman
up in the mountains where we stopped.

717
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,400
She had a little daughter.

718
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,800
They were headed toward Colorado,
a place called Mountain Creek.

719
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Her name is Doris Mclver.

720
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,800
Now?

721
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,200
Just a minute. One minute, please.

722
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,400
I want you to know that
I'll do everything I can to find that boy.

723
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Thank you.

724
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,800
Do you...

725
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,000
Would you like me to go up there with you?

726
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,600
It's funny.

727
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,800
I've memorized whole books of words
to say at a time like this.

728
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,800
I just can't remember any of them.

729
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,800
I've had to live with this
for a long time, Chaplain.

730
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,200
I won't need any words.

731
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,800
- Get 'em away from here!
- Hold on!

732
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,600
Look out! On the porch!

733
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,600
Get out of the way!

734
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,800
Get Keyes!

735
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,000
- Clint!
- Here, Mark.

736
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
- Let's go, Mark.
- There he is!

737
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,000
Go, Rosie!

738
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,800
Let's go after him!

739
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,800
Gotcha!
You aren't getting away this time. Come on.

740
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,400
Giddy up there!

741
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,400
Come on, Rosie.
Move! Let's go!

742
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,000
That camel's faster than the horses.
We're never gonna catch him this way.

743
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,400
Give me that Springfield.

744
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,200
On the double!

745
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,600
Missed.

746
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,800
Let's get back to the fort.

747
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,800
Rose, come on, now. You can outrun 'em.

748
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,800
Come on, don't quit on me now, Rosie.

749
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,600
Come on, Rosie, don't quit.

750
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,000
All right, Rosie, easy.

751
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,400
OK. OK, girl.

752
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,600
OK, I ain't going anyplace.

753
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
It's all right, girl.

754
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,800
I know he's in the guardhouse, John.
I ordered him put there.

755
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
If you think you're taking him back
to the chapel, you can forget it.

756
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,000
Only temporarily, sir. Now, I have an idea.

757
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
John, you...

758
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,200
Excuse me, Captain, it's urgent.
I need fresh horses and more men.

759
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,800
- Sergeant...
- He outran us, sir.

760
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,800
But he can't keep running.
When he stops...

761
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,600
Sergeant, there'll be no more horses,
no more men. Your manhunt is over.

762
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,800
Sir, you read General Crook's orders.

763
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,200
General Crook's orders
call for the hanging of Corporal Keyes.

764
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,000
The noose was placed around his neck,
the trap was sprung, the man was hung.

765
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,600
It is my personal view, Sergeant,

766
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,200
that Corporal Keyes has more than paid
for his misdeeds, such as they were.

767
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,600
I have no intention of hanging a man twice
for the same crime.

768
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,200
Dismissed, Sergeant.

769
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Tell 'em I won't give 'em any trouble.

770
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,600
I came to tell you you're free.

771
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,600
I don't think I understand.

772
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,400
Well, the captain says you've been hung
once already anyway.

773
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,400
He's sending that patrol
back on to General Crook.

774
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,400
That's mighty good news, Reverend.

775
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,600
Real good news.

776
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,400
Reverend, what about Mark?

777
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,600
Oh, he's fine.

778
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,600
I brought your things.

779
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Look, if the cavalry doesn't want me, is
there any reason why I can't see the boy?

780
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,800
Well, he's a ward of the army.

781
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,400
I'm supposed to find a home for him.

782
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,400
I told you about that Mrs. Mclver.

783
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,400
The home he really wants is with you.
Only he's afraid that you don't want him.

784
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,400
Well, now, that ain't true. I offered
to take him with me once. He knows that.

785
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:41,800
Yes, but was that because you wanted him
or because you just had no choice?

786
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,600
Well, things were different then.

787
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,200
Look, how do you truly feel
about the boy now?

788
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,800
I don't know if anybody will trust me,
with my record an' all,

789
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,400
but if I could have the boy, Reverend,
well, you bet I want him.

790
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,400
- We do good, huh, Clint?
- Yeah, you did just great. Just great.

791
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,000
Well, I guess I better be getting on back.

792
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,400
This arrangement was my decision.

793
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,800
I might have some explaining to do
to the captain.

794
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,600
- Thank you, Chaplain, for everything.
- That's all right.

795
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,400
She's dead.

796
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
Ah, well.

797
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,400
She wasn't much to look at.

798
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,800
Pure impossible to get along with, but

799
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,400
she saved both our lives
more than once.

800
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:52,000
You know, there near the end
I think she even kind of enjoyed hating me.

801
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,000
Well, maybe a little, anyway, huh?

802
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,600
- Clint?
- Yeah?

803
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,600
When do you take me to see Blue Feather?

804
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600
How about next summer?

805
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,400
We'll go visit her on the reservation,
the both of us.

806
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,400
After we go to Mexico?

807
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, well, Mexico, uh...

808
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,800
You know, since I'm a free man,
I've been thinking maybe we could,

809
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,200
oh, run up maybe to Mountain Creek,
Colorado, someplace like that instead.

810
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,800
What do you think?

811
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
All right, come on.

812
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,000
Well, looks like
we're back to riding double again.

813
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,800
Come on, Thirsty.
