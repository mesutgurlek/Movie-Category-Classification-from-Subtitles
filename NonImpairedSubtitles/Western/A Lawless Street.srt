1
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,173
- Hi.
- Morning, Molly.

2
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,041
I just saw Dingo Brion riding into town,
looking meaner than ever.

3
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,247
Thought you'd like to know.

4
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,046
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning.

5
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,846
And how is the flower of the West
this morning?

6
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,150
Gone to seed.

7
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,691
- Calem Ware, you didn't sleep again.
- I slept fine.

8
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,691
Then what's troubling you this morning?

9
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,890
How do you make yourself
so fresh and beautiful this early morning?

10
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,493
It's glasses you need, my bucko.
You like some ham and eggs now?

11
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,027
You don't eat right or regular.

12
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,673
- You look after me like a mother hen.
- Old hen.

13
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,407
Now who is it this time?

14
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,305
Dingo Brion.

15
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
He rode into town this morning
with blood in his eye.

16
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,975
Hiram Hays run over
from the livery stable to tell me.

17
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,450
Will you marry me, Molly?

18
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,522
How can you joke when you know
he said he was coming back to kill you?

19
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,857
- The snarling beast.
- What?

20
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,891
Can't you hear it,
growling out there? Listen.

21
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,127
This town is like
a wild animal in chains, Molly.

22
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,760
It doesn't fight back right away.

23
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,568
It just lies there and snarls,
waiting for a chance to pounce on you.

24
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,836
- You hear that?
- Everyday.

25
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,044
- Be careful, Calem.
- What's for lunch?

26
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,549
- Cabbage and mutton.
- Then I'll be in for a double order.

27
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,147
It's not me you love, but my cooking.

28
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,687
Right you are, Molly.
But you know what they say?

29
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,623
A man's stomach had more sense in it
than either his heart or his head.

30
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,766
- Morning Calem.
- Marshal.

31
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,914
Marshal.

32
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,879
- Morning, Asaph. Mrs. Dean.
- Will you be in your office later, Calem?

33
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,323
- As soon as I have a shave.
- I'll be by.

34
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,833
I don't want to waste a lot of time
in town today.

35
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,471
I said I don't want to waste
a lot of time in town today.

36
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,675
No, of course not.
Your wife might enjoy herself a little.

37
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,411
Now, Cora, let's not go into that.

38
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,750
As soon as I get my business finished,
we're going back to the ranch.

39
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,016
Yes, dear.

40
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,286
- Good morning, Mr. Thorne.
- Good morning, Mrs. Dean.

41
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,685
My! How lovely you've done it over.

42
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,700
Mr. Dean and I are so looking forward
to seeing the young lady.

43
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,065
Cora, you fool.

44
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,567
Why haven't I seen you?
It's been two weeks.

45
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,472
I've been busy.
There's been no time or way. I...

46
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,474
You want everyone to see us together?

47
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,711
You used to find time and ways.

48
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,610
You're very clever at inventing ways.

49
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,654
Yes, Mrs. Dean. The remodeling
of the opera house has made it...

50
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,553
the finest little theatre west of Chicago.

51
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,821
I assure you, there will be two tickets
at the box office tonight...

52
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,384
for you and your husband.

53
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,379
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning.

54
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,686
Morning, Juan. Morning, Cody.

55
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,083
Quite a looker, isn't she?

56
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,421
- Is she? I hadn't noticed.
- Thorne's noticed.

57
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,227
Leave it to Thorne to get the best.

58
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,262
A man's tongue works
like a shovel sometimes, Cody.

59
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,307
- It can dig his own grave.
- So I've been told.

60
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,270
- He's back, you know.
- Who?

61
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,275
- Dingo Brion.
- Is that so?

62
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,177
Says he's gonna put a slug
through that badge of yours by night.

63
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,948
- But I'm laying bets six to five he can't do it.
- Only that much?

64
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,922
Odds are getting shorter, Calem, each time.

65
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,519
- You worried?
- Not at six to five.

66
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,832
It's only long shots that worry gamblers.

67
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,093
Can I buy you a drink?

68
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,664
- Maybe later.
- Anytime.

69
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,539
Theatrical troupe arriving.

70
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,047
Welcome.

71
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,931
- Welcome to Medicine Bend.
- A whistle stop.

72
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,934
- I'm Thorne. You must be...
- I'm Mr. Willis. I'm the stage manager.

73
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,474
I'm glad to know you.
Your trunks have already arrived.

74
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,874
And I've make arrangements
for everyone at the hotel.

75
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,878
I may as well be frank with you, Mr. Thorne.

76
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,743
I opposed this small town from the first.

77
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,078
We'll do everything we can
to make you comfortable.

78
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,677
It's Miss Dickinson's idea
that we play Medicine Bend, not mine.

79
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,381
Tally!

80
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,519
- The beautiful Taleen.
- Hello, Thorne.

81
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,558
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Taleen Dickinson...

82
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,728
a star of great renown,
fresh from her triumphs in Chicago...

83
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,760
and all points West.

84
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,701
She comes to grace our theatre.
And I hope our town, permanently.

85
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,773
Because in front of all you nice people...

86
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,575
and for the 10th time...

87
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,783
I'm asking the lovely
Miss Dickinson to be my bride.

88
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,445
- Please, Thorne, I'm very tired.
- Yes, of course.

89
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,757
Thorne, aren't you going to
introduce me to the lady?

90
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,987
I've never met a great star before.

91
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,052
Marshal.

92
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,525
Miss Dickinson, our marshal, Calem Ware.

93
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,496
How do you do, Marshal?

94
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,903
You did say "Miss Dickinson"?

95
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,935
A stage name, Marshal.

96
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,968
Our marshal has been a peace officer
in many tough towns in the West.

97
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,881
- Dodge City, Abilene, Apache Wells.
- She wouldn't know Apache Wells.

98
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,418
That's a rough, dirty, untamed spot.
A place to forget.

99
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,283
But I do remember Apache Wells.

100
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:31,558
I mean, I do know the marshal's gun
has quite a reputation.

101
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,000
I manage somehow to keep alive.

102
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,070
- Perhaps till now.
- Till now?

103
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,375
He's betting with his friend,
but don't let him tell you any fairytales.

104
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,911
You'll love it here, Tally.

105
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,175
I'll make you love it and you'll want to stay.

106
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,277
You'll never want to go back
to San Francisco.

107
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:59,415
I wish you hadn't said what you did
about us in front of all your homefolks.

108
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,292
- But in Chicago you said that...
- I said I'd think about it.

109
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,392
Let me show you to your dressing room.

110
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,457
Lilly Langtry never had better.

111
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,812
- Morning, Tony.
- Howdy, Mr. Marshal.

112
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,143
A fine morning.

113
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,742
They always start out fine
until you wake up and get out of bed.

114
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,355
I heard some miners had another fight
in the south-end last night.

115
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,891
They don't open up the mines
pretty soon, there'll be...

116
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,950
No more talk, Tony.
I'll have the silent treatment this morning.

117
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,325
I'm shut.

118
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,255
Dingo! No!

119
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,401
Go over to Doc Wynn's
and tell him what happened.

120
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,213
Doc, the marshal just killed Dingo.

121
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,388
Hold off.

122
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,820
I never knew you packed a derringer, Calem.

123
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,364
Lots of things you don't know, Cody. Men!

124
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,462
Cody Clark's buying drinks.
He won all the bets.

125
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,831
That's right, drinks are on the house.
Everybody welcome.

126
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,537
Also, take up a collection to bury Dingo.
Add this to it.

127
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,603
That's right nice of you, Calem.

128
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,376
Funny how a man softens to another
when once he's killed him.

129
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,078
I don't know about that.
I'd do as much if it were your funeral.

130
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,386
I think you would. The feeling is mutual.

131
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,121
The odds are getting shorter, Calem.
Next time it'll be even money.

132
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,832
- You want that drink now?
- You drink it.

133
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,431
I never had any doubts
you would beat him, Calem.

134
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,338
Yes, sir, you're doing a job. A great job.

135
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,239
I've lived the greater part
of my life in Colorado.

136
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:44,373
When the mines didn't pan out, I drove
herds of longhorns north from Texas.

137
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,577
Started out a big cattle business.

138
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,652
We've built a great country.
Now I've only one dream left.

139
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,292
I want to live long enough
to see our territory become a state.

140
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,989
- It will be a state, Asaph.
- We've tried for 12 Years.

141
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,392
A measure to enter the Union
was vetoed twice.

142
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,603
And the bill will never be passed
until conditions...

143
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,133
like we've had in Medicine Bend
are completely corrected.

144
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,477
I'm not as rough and tough as I once was,
but if there's ever any way I can help...

145
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,207
You know what happens
when you put a lid on a boiling pot?

146
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,150
- It either boils over or it explodes.
- Unless you put the fire out under it.

147
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,188
- I guess we should pray for rain?
- You're storm enough, Calem.

148
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,883
You're putting out the fire and I'm grateful.

149
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,250
Calem...

150
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,791
I brought over what worldly effects
Dingo Brion had on him.

151
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,663
- Howdy, Asaph.
- Morning, Doc.

152
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,861
And look what else I found on him.

153
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,767
Five double eagles!

154
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,568
Dingo never had six-bits to jingle
in his pocket his whole miserable life.

155
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,271
- Where would he get $100?
- Probably stole them.

156
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,678
You can figure better than that.

157
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,716
I'd say someone wants you dead.
Enough to pay in advance for it.

158
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,645
It seems the evidence
supports Doc's theory.

159
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,782
That means somebody stands to profit
with you out of the way.

160
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,827
- Who? And for what reason?
- I never was much good at guessing.

161
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,795
If there's anything I can do.

162
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,134
They're all alike.

163
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,232
Hire a man to fight their battles,
then call it their town.

164
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,036
He has his own problems.

165
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,774
I sent out word to Dingo's wife and brother.

166
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,105
They'll be calling here
for him and his things.

167
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,308
Thanks, Doc.

168
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,510
- I guess, there's no use talking to you again.
- Probably not.

169
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,023
- Why don't you walk out, Calem?
- Where'd I go? lt'd be the same anywhere.

170
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,821
- My name's a hard one.
- You could change it.

171
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:39,159
No, I have got just one chance,
only one, to outlast the times.

172
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,860
- And I'm gambling I'll live to see it.
- You're fooling yourself, Calem.

173
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,802
Duty is one thing
and self-preservation is another.

174
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,406
You walk the streets a living legend...

175
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,602
yet all the time you're afraid
men will know you're human.

176
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,939
Cody knows it.

177
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,305
He knows that someday
something will fail you inside.

178
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,974
Call it what you will.

179
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,643
The urge to kill, fighting heart,
survival instinct...

180
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,048
or just guts.

181
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,256
When that happens...

182
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,691
Do you suppose
I haven't thought of that, Doc?

183
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,695
Do you think I sleep at night?

184
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,988
Don't you think I know
Dingo was a married man, had three kids?

185
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,762
He wasn't much good,
but that doesn't make it any easier for me.

186
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,005
And no matter how hard it was this time,
the next time it'll be worse.

187
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,467
Each time it gets harder.

188
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,305
Think it over, Calem.

189
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,725
It's Dooley Brion and Dingo's widow.

190
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,332
What a monster of a man.

191
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,669
He got that scar on his face from a cougar.

192
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,967
You know how he got even?

193
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,372
He killed that cougar
with his own bare hands.

194
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,035
Don't rile him, Calem.

195
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,254
- You killed my brother.
- Dooley, I'm not fooling with you.

196
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,881
Did you come here
to make trouble like Dingo?

197
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,291
No, I want no trouble.

198
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,388
Dooley, what happened
was Dingo's own fault.

199
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,024
You can pick up his body down at my office.

200
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,260
- The marshal has his things.
- Here.

201
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:30,406
- Guns. Stinking man-killing guns.
- Stop it, Dooley. It's over, Dooley.

202
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,072
Get in. Let's get Dingo
and go back to the ranch.

203
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,072
This money was Dingo's. He was carrying it.

204
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,354
I reckon you're feeling sorry for me,
Mr. Ware. You shouldn't.

205
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,586
I know Dingo was no good.
He was never no good.

206
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,784
But he was all I had.

207
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,530
Now that's he's gone,
I reckon I'll be better off without him.

208
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,832
It ain't Dingo and it sure ain't me
folks should feel sorry for.

209
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,697
It's you, Calem Ware. You that killed him.

210
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,408
You're the one folks should feel sorry for.
At least Dingo's at peace.

211
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,779
You never will be.

212
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,480
- Get in, Dooley.
- Give me that money.

213
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,812
- No. We need it.
- It's dirty money.

214
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,888
You know Dingo never earned
$100 in his whole life.

215
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,723
Marshal, I ain't holding no grudge.

216
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,664
But I'm telling you, keep away from me.

217
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,131
I don't hold with guns,
but there ain't a gun made...

218
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,503
can stop me before I can get my hands
on the men holding it.

219
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,205
So leave me be.

220
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,151
Doc, give these to Cody Clark
to put with Dingo's funeral collection.

221
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,653
Sure thing. What are you gonna do now?

222
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,887
For the first time in days,
I'm going to have some peaceful sleep.

223
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,601
A sell-out. Biggest thing ever to hit town.

224
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,367
Are you sure it's the show...

225
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:49,567
or that they're curious to see that lady actor
you announced you were gonna marry?

226
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,236
I hadn't thought about it
but it doesn't sound like a very bad idea.

227
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,008
Wait till you see her on the stage.
Real class.

228
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:05,925
Calem.

229
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,064
- Hello, Tally.
- You got my note?

230
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,874
I sort of hoped that you might
come to see me on your own.

231
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,312
What do you expect, Tally,
bands and bugles after nine years?

232
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,983
- Did you think it was easy for me?
- I don't know, was it?

233
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,348
Forgetting Apache Wells?

234
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,014
When we met,
you knew I was a peace officer...

235
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,389
that I was going to be
the marshal at Apache Wells.

236
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,020
Yes, you told me that.
I didn't know what it was like...

237
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,793
for a man to make his living by his gun,
walking the streets, a living target.

238
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,926
I died a little more each day
and I died more at night.

239
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,030
I think it's best we both forget.

240
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,600
Apache Wells?

241
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,843
Every time I hear those words
I get sick inside. Sick.

242
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,273
I can see that whole terrible thing.

243
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,781
That dirty little street,
the shootings every night, the killings.

244
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,341
That's what you saw.

245
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,311
When I think of Apache Wells...

246
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,818
I see a beautiful woman.

247
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,820
She loved a man, she said,
but she ran away.

248
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,630
I tried, Calem. I tried.

249
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,799
But that last night when the bullet hit you,
it was as if it hit me here inside.

250
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,431
I wanted to go to you, I wanted to.
Then I saw your face.

251
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,666
I didn't know you, you weren't human,
crawling about there in the dirt...

252
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,975
like some kind of an animal,
shooting until you killed.

253
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,345
Tally, stop it.

254
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,707
- Cora, you didn't tell her about us?
- No.

255
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,146
I knew you wouldn't.

256
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,014
I was deeply hurt when I learned
you wanted to marry her...

257
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,747
but now I don't think I have to worry.

258
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,483
Of course not.
Nothing is going to change between us.

259
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,391
I was going to tell her.
But Marshal Ware changed my mind.

260
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,729
Do you remember when you dropped it?

261
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,205
And the minister had to get on his hands
and knees to find it.

262
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,908
- You still wear it.
- I never could get you out of my mind.

263
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,413
I went back to work, I tried to.

264
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,745
- That's past. You're back.
- I wonder.

265
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,107
Thorne?

266
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,419
He doesn't know yet that we're married.

267
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,048
- I'm going to tell him.
- Then you've decided?

268
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,219
I wanted to see you once more to be sure.

269
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,624
I thought it was gonna be
so easy to tell you, Calem, but it isn't.

270
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:51,759
- Seeing you, talking to you, I'm not sure.
- You know I'm still in love with you.

271
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,533
- That's the way it's always been.
- But there must be other women, Calem.

272
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,733
Not for me.

273
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,975
I'm so confused.

274
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,276
- Tally, l...
- Look, Calem, I've got another show to do.

275
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,990
Good night, Tally.

276
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,622
So, here you are.

277
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,065
You'd better get over
to the new frontier in a hurry.

278
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,692
Dooley Brion's gone crazy wild.

279
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,637
I heard he's about killed Cody Clark,
and he's wrecking the whole place.

280
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,209
Let's go, Calem.

281
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,415
Dooley. Stop it, Dooley!

282
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,323
Why don't you try your hand
at stopping me?

283
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,167
- What's got into you?
- Him.

284
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,632
He came out to our farm
with all that dirty money, that's what.

285
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,508
I took the collection money
out to Dingo's wife like you asked, Calem.

286
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,375
When I gave it to her,
this moose blew his cork.

287
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:14,214
I had to put a gun on him to get away.
Later he comes roaring in here.

288
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,116
You can see what he's done...

289
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,257
I should have known it was all your doings.
I warned you to leave me be.

290
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,088
That's far enough, Dooley.

291
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,630
I told you before you couldn't stop me...

292
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,757
before I could lay my hands on you,
Calem Ware.

293
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,061
Now we'll see.

294
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,083
Two to one on Dooley.

295
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,171
Stand up to me, Calem Ware,
stand up to me now or I'll break your back.

296
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,008
Now I'll break you in two.

297
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,904
Even money.

298
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,913
You two men,
take him to the jail and lock him up.

299
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,867
I knew you'd want to make it alone this far.
Still keep them thinking you're not human.

300
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,564
From now on, I'm taking over.

301
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,515
Harley Baskam.

302
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,200
- And what did it sound like this morning?
- The beast? Still growling, Molly.

303
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,135
- Loud?
- Loud and angry.

304
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,606
I thought maybe with Dingo Brion gone,
it'd be over.

305
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,235
When one man goes down,
there's always another itching...

306
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,403
to take his place.

307
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,380
Somebody else so soon? Who is it now?

308
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,115
- Somebody I haven't seen in a long time.
- Calem, you can't.

309
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,713
- With your hurt hand you won't...
- What's for lunch today, Molly?

310
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,717
- Pot roast and potato pancakes.
- I'll just have to marry you now.

311
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,988
I know, "the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach."

312
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,754
Now, get out of here.

313
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,735
- $5,000.
- $5,000!

314
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,136
- We want him out of the way, don't we?
- Yeah, but...

315
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,607
I didn't expect you boys
to make such an offer.

316
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,076
You're not complaining
we've offered too much?

317
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,170
- You know I am.
- I don't get you.

318
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,516
Let's put it this way. I don't get you boys.

319
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,816
It's a lot of money,
even for Calem Ware's scalp.

320
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,923
- Why do you want him so bad?
- He's in our way.

321
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,859
He? What about the other people
around here?

322
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,657
Half the people in this town
are too yellow to fight back...

323
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,427
- and the other half look to me for a living.
- I can understand that.

324
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,902
- But why just one man?
- This has to be our town.

325
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,371
What's stopping you?
You're a big man, Mr. Thorne.

326
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,973
There's one bigger.
There's a cattleman named Asaph Dean.

327
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,846
He's the big power in this community.
He made this town, made the good rules...

328
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,715
and brought in Calem Ware
to see everybody lives by them.

329
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,914
Gentlemen, I don't move a finger
until I know some more.

330
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:05,294
- There's no reason not to tell you, I guess.
- That's friendly all the way around.

331
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,025
There's gonna be a boom in this town.

332
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,465
- What kind of boom?
- The mines.

333
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,801
I thought the mines were shut down here
because of no smelter.

334
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,101
There's gonna be
a smelter built here, a big one.

335
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,664
Thorne heard about it confidential.

336
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,575
That means the ore won't
have to be shipped hundreds of miles.

337
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,476
That means the mines open up.

338
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,515
Payoff again. And big.

339
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,844
The miners go back to work,
big times for all.

340
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,680
You cutting in on every place in town.
Sounds exciting.

341
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,851
I'll do it...

342
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,754
for one-third.

343
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,819
One-third?

344
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,862
We're not cutting you in.
You're only a hired gun.

345
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,796
The fastest you've ever met.

346
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,267
And don't call me that again.

347
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,999
Don't rush yourselves, gentlemen.

348
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,275
I'll be around until you come up
with the right answer.

349
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,575
And the right answer's one-third.

350
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,049
Next time don't offer
more than the going rate.

351
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,558
Aren't you smart.

352
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,822
Offering him $5,000,
making him ask questions.

353
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,798
Because you've got to be bigger
and better than everybody else.

354
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,766
- Shut up.
- That's your trouble.

355
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,428
Always got to do everything
in a big way, your way.

356
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,268
Always reaching out
for something you can't have.

357
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,640
- I can get anything I go after.
- It isn't just for money, either.

358
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,076
You got to make your pride feel good.
Like with Asaph Dean.

359
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,581
Up to now, the only way
you could figure to hurt him...

360
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,242
was in going after his wife.

361
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,151
Now you got another way,
you dump her for that singer.

362
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,019
Always the biggest and the best.
So you can brag.

363
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,286
One of these days your high conceit's
gonna trip you up for good.

364
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,359
You let me worry about that.

365
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,625
We're partners. What trips you, trips me.

366
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,922
Howdy, Calem, I've been waiting for you.
So is Mrs. Brion.

367
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,462
Dingo, and now Dooley.

368
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,593
Dingo was no good, but Dooley...

369
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,998
there ain't really nothing bad
or mean about him.

370
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,403
It's just that he's so big
he ain't never been treated like a human...

371
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,270
and he don't understand people.

372
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,004
But he's good. God knows he's good.

373
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,938
- He tried to kill me.
- I know.

374
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,313
I said yesterday
it wasn't Dingo I was sorry for, it was you.

375
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,944
- Sit down, Mrs. Brion.
- I ain't finished yet.

376
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,214
Dooley had his licking, plain and proper...

377
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,084
and that's the first time it ever happened.

378
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,724
You didn't shoot him down like a mad dog.

379
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,562
You stood up to him
like you would to any other man...

380
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,124
and Dooley knows it.

381
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,996
He'll never come after you again.

382
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,271
I swear to that.

383
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,535
And I'm asking you to let him go.

384
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,010
I'm begging you.

385
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,235
Dooley.

386
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,613
You can go home.

387
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,153
Dooley, I want you to know
why I'm letting you go.

388
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:58,354
It's for the sake of Dingo's widow.
She went begging for you. You hear that?

389
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,229
That should make you feel proud, Dooley.

390
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,267
She's all alone. Now, she's scared.
She needs a strong man's help.

391
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,130
You're going to be that man.
You understand?

392
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,471
I'll do right.

393
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,604
- The marshal's letting Dooley go.
- Why shouldn't he?

394
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,800
You would have fought the marshal, too,
if he'd killed your brother.

395
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,106
I guess another killing
for the marshal ain't nothing new.

396
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,652
Lord, give them the breaks
they never had before.

397
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:00,913
Amen.

398
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,587
Look out!

399
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,693
Why didn't you get him?

400
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,929
A man talks well if he's alive.

401
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,145
Patron, I have failed.
The life of <i>Señor</i> Ware is blessed.

402
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,710
My knife only missed him by inches.

403
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,914
What are you talking about?

404
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,217
I hear from behind the door...

405
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,088
when you give Dingo Brion
five pieces of gold to kill Ware...

406
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,752
and I think you do same thing for me.

407
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,295
Patron, you must hide me.

408
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,661
- Calem saw you?
<i>- Sí, señor.</i>

409
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,825
You stupid fool.

410
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,370
You shot straight, Cody. He's dead.

411
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,336
Now, that's one you owe me, Calem.

412
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,708
Juan was screaming
how he tried to knife you.

413
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,814
It was the only way
I could stop him from trying again.

414
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,881
- What would Juan have against me, Cody?
- I wouldn't know. Would you?

415
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,119
Too bad. We might have
both been interested.

416
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,263
Couple of you boys
give me a hand here, will you?

417
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,997
Can I make reservations
on the first stage East?

418
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,371
Are you leaving us, Miss Dickinson?
Something wrong?

419
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,467
Please, I want to leave tomorrow,
if possible.

420
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,603
No stage tomorrow.
Next stage out is on Sunday.

421
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,840
Sunday then.

422
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,223
- Who is it?
- Calem.

423
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:25,626
Come in.

424
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,928
Tally.

425
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,931
Don't try to talk me out of leaving.

426
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,807
- But last night you said...
- Yes, that was last night.

427
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,177
- But today, it'll never be any different.
- Perhaps you can't see it.

428
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,478
Times are changing.
Things will be different.

429
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,178
Perhaps, but it's too late for us.

430
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,652
- No, Tally.
- Please, Calem, it's useless.

431
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,480
There's no going back for either one of us.

432
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,584
I'm going to Chicago,
I'll get a divorce quietly.

433
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,358
Is it Thorne?

434
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,724
I don't know.

435
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,791
I haven't decided yet.

436
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:00,293
If I married him,
I'd have to live here, close to you.

437
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,466
I couldn't help seeing you,
hearing about you.

438
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,941
I'm sorry it had to end this way, Calem.

439
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,875
I wanted to give you this.

440
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,250
I've kept it all these years.

441
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,181
I feel I have no right to keep it any longer.

442
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,323
Goodbye, Calem.

443
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,040
No need to get your blood
in a boil, Mr. Thorne...

444
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,742
just 'cause a man pays a call
on his own wife.

445
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,752
- His wife?
- News to you?

446
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,047
lmagine a smart operator like you
missing out on a little fact like that.

447
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,493
They've been hitched for a long time,
ever since he was Marshal of Apache Wells.

448
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,194
And you figuring to outrank Ware
in the lady's affections.

449
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,361
You've got your deal.
The cut you want. What are you waiting for?

450
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,598
Till the sun goes down, Mr. Thorne.

451
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,306
Listen...

452
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,877
it's none of my business
to be butting into your private affairs...

453
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,252
- I have no private affairs, Doc.
- How's your public affairs?

454
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,189
Juan worked for Cody.
That doesn't prove anything.

455
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,227
I don't know what you're tying to prove.

456
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,264
Why don't you walk out, Calem?
No one will blame you.

457
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:40,629
- A meal fit for a condemned man, Molly.
- Don't talk like that, not tonight.

458
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,366
- I guess it wasn't very funny.
- Yeah, I guess it wasn't.

459
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,011
A man rode into town this morning.
By invitation.

460
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,176
- A stranger?
- To you, not to me. Name's Harley Baskam.

461
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,011
Baskam? Sure.

462
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:03,515
He used to be tied in with Ben Wryson
and the bunch down at San Antone...

463
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,256
until Wryson got three bullets in him.

464
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,264
I know, Doc, I put them there.

465
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,327
Baskam swore he'd never forget it.

466
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,829
I guess it's time to make my evening rounds.

467
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,602
Here, try this liniment.

468
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,809
- You want me to drink that, Molly?
- I didn't say to drink it.

469
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,938
Give me your hand, takes out the stiffness.

470
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,505
- That's what you said, Doc.
- Try it on him.

471
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,085
Calem Ware.

472
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,088
Come on, put up your money.

473
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,186
I'll take any bet you want.

474
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:42,693
I'll lay you any bet you want.

475
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,328
Any bet.

476
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,869
- Two to one.
- What do you mean?

477
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,601
Calem Ware can clear leather faster
than any man in this part of the country.

478
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,937
"In this part of the country."

479
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,275
But there's a man here tonight
from another part of the country.

480
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,712
Cody, you're drunk.

481
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,986
I'm drunk. I'm celebrating in advance.

482
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,451
Two to one, I said.
Two to one in favor of Harley Baskam.

483
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:08,648
Baskam?

484
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,319
He's in town?
Harley Baskam from San Antone?

485
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,056
Like I said, two to one.

486
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,731
Do you know why Baskam's here?

487
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,025
He came to pay his last respects
to Calem Ware.

488
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,885
- They tell me you're a friend of Calem Ware.
- I am.

489
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,320
Then go tell him
he's got another friend waiting for him...

490
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,585
an old friend.

491
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,355
You look like a brave man, you tell him.

492
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,557
I said, go fetch Calem Ware.

493
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,576
Hello, Baskam.

494
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:12,217
- I see you remember me, Calem.
- I remember you.

495
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,788
- Like you remember Ben Wryson, maybe?
- Like that.

496
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,521
I've been looking for you all this time.

497
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,859
- I heard.
- Is that why you ran out?

498
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:25,331
There's a law in Medicine Bend, Baskam,
against packing guns on the street.

499
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,664
You don't say.

500
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,935
I'm taking your gun, Baskam.

501
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,599
- No man takes my gun.
- Then use it.

502
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,487
Get away from him, old man.

503
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,789
You do it and I'll drop you, so help me.

504
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,423
He's dead, what more do you want?

505
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,629
You got nerve.

506
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,062
- All right, your town's wide open.
- Yeah.

507
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,701
Drinks are on the house, everybody!

508
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,077
Dooley, give me a hand.

509
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,259
- Doc, look, he isn't...
- Get him out of here, quick.

510
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,975
Now we'll let them hear it.

511
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,415
Let them hear it.

512
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:59,792
- All right, folks! It's wide open!
- Yeah!

513
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,769
Yeah, the marshal's dead!

514
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,317
No, sir...

515
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:33,120
there'll be no drinking
to the death of Calem Ware in my saloon.

516
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,031
You don't seem to get the drift.

517
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,967
This isn't your saloon anymore.

518
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,410
But you just can't rob me of my business.

519
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,244
No one's robbing you,
we're just buying you out.

520
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,541
Sign it.

521
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:01,685
- There's nothing on this paper.
- We'll fill it in later. Sign it now.

522
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,749
You see, you're through
in Medicine Bend, Abe.

523
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,523
You and everyone else
who supported Calem Ware.

524
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,357
All right.

525
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,561
I'll sign it.

526
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,138
You all saw that. Abe drew first.
We were only trying to buy him out.

527
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,472
All right, serve them up.

528
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:25,971
Rest of the night, boys, drinks are
on the house in every saloon in town.

529
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,812
Now, hold it.

530
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,717
Now, we're not drinking
to the death of Calem Ware.

531
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,382
It's unfortunate that he got it,
even though he didn't understand.

532
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,422
But tomorrow you're all going to have
gold in your pockets.

533
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,019
The mines are opening up again.
So drink up.

534
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,626
Number two. Who's next?

535
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,465
Yeah. Anything you say, gents.

536
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,742
Drink up, everybody, the town's wide open.

537
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,561
Come on in!

538
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,937
Come on! Drinks for everyone!

539
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,033
Tomorrow the mines open!

540
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,302
Tomorrow everyone has money
in his pocket!

541
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,536
Don't be afraid to have fun.

542
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,478
There's no one around
to cramp your style. Come on.

543
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,107
The mayor and some of the town council.

544
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,708
In the name of heaven, Thorne...

545
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,118
help us stop this mob
before it gets out of hand completely.

546
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:44,159
You can see for yourself, Mr. Mayor,
what the situation is without a peace officer.

547
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,822
At the town council meeting on Sunday,
appoint Mr. Baskam marshal.

548
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,135
- There goes the end of the opposition.
- Not all of it.

549
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,031
The big trouble-maker's still left...

550
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,407
and I want the pleasure
of talking to Mr. Asaph Dean myself.

551
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,260
Dead or alive?

552
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,776
Drop the gun, Asaph.

553
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,625
See, this is just a social call.

554
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:01,061
Condolences, you might say.
See, Calem Ware is gone.

555
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,191
Mr. Baskam here
had to shoot him down in self-defense.

556
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,627
Calem dead?

557
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,668
So you just stick to your ranch
and leave the town to us...

558
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,365
or worse than this will be happening.

559
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,603
I knew you were capable of many things,
I didn't know you'd go this far.

560
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,805
- This is only the beginning.
- But the night ends it all.

561
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,813
If I'm to stay out of your town...

562
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,942
then you are to keep away
from my ranch and my wife.

563
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,816
I didn't say anything before...

564
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,822
because I figured Cora is old enough
to know her own mind.

565
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,585
But now I'm warning you.

566
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,893
You are warning me?

567
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,451
I'm too old to call a man out,
but I will if I have to.

568
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,226
Your wife wouldn't be worth
the trouble, Asaph.

569
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,501
You don't think I really wanted her, do you?

570
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,470
It amused me, that's all, to take
something away from the great Asaph Dean.

571
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,131
She's unimportant now.

572
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,015
It'll be as it was 20 years ago.

573
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,988
Only I won't be 20 years younger
to fight them.

574
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,961
It'll be the old order again,
plundering, fighting...

575
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,800
A lifetime of hard work...

576
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,396
and hopes...

577
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,396
nothing.

578
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,969
- I'll leave the ranch as soon as I can.
- Leave?

579
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,971
Knowing about Hamer Thorne and me...

580
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,814
Look for yourself, Asaph.

581
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,819
What do you see?

582
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,322
I'm getting old.

583
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,050
Even I can understand that now.

584
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:43,255
We're both too old for such foolishness.
Soon we'll forget and look ahead.

585
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,368
I'll let you turn out the lights.
I'm rather tired.

586
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,732
Calem.

587
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,570
Calem Ware?

588
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,843
Mrs. Dean. What are you doing here?

589
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,179
- I want to see the marshal.
- Come in.

590
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,551
I guess you haven't heard the news.

591
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,822
Harley Baskam shot down Calem Ware
earlier tonight.

592
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,593
- I'm too late.
- Too late for what?

593
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,195
It's as if I killed him. I'm the one to blame.

594
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,932
I should have told the marshal.

595
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,808
- I didn't know it could happen.
- What...

596
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,340
What could you have told Calem?

597
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,384
I've been very foolish, Doc.

598
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,785
I've been a very close friend
of Hamer Thorne for a long time.

599
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,462
I knew all about the plans
he and Cody Clark had...

600
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,397
for taking over Medicine Bend.

601
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,765
Would you be willing to swear to that?

602
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,060
Yes, I would.

603
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,197
Knowing what it would do
to your reputation?

604
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,808
Women close their eyes
to a lot of things, Doc...

605
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,247
when they love the wrong man.

606
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,912
Not to murder.

607
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,786
I'll testify any time you say.

608
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,183
You'll find me at the ranch
when you want me.

609
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,535
Dooley.

610
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,172
Any change?

611
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,336
Okay, take them back to the mine.

612
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,816
- So this is where he lived.
- Ever since he come here three years ago.

613
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,450
Never changed it none. Kept it simple.

614
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,780
Marshal Ware was a simple man.

615
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,553
He never asked for much
or never expected much.

616
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,495
I guess I'll have to pack what there is.

617
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,028
I remember the day he walked in,
carrying this same old carpet bag.

618
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,227
This held everything he owned...

619
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,435
and still will.

620
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,040
He used to have these shirts
made special in Kansas City.

621
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,737
Wouldn't trust nobody
to wash them, except me.

622
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,950
No, I ain't going to touch nothing
till Doc Wynn tells me to.

623
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,913
I didn't know Calem Ware had many friends.

624
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,356
Only those who really understood him,
like me and Doc Wynn.

625
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,660
The others he fooled
so they'd think he was tough.

626
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,993
But he wasn't.

627
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,993
I remember the first meal
I ever cooked for him.

628
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:16,732
He usually ate in the kitchen.
He right away asked me to marry him.

629
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:19,967
- Marry you?
- That was just his little joke.

630
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,409
He always said it
when I'd cook something special.

631
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,350
You loved him, too, didn't you?

632
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,220
It weren't no gunman killed him.

633
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:36,384
It was the beast that killed him,
the wild beast, that's this town.

634
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,891
He could hear it every morning.
Knew it was out there waiting for him.

635
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,988
He was only living for the day
when he didn't hear it.

636
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,096
Then he'd know it was dead.

637
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,502
This was Calem Ware's room.

638
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,332
- You asked to see it.
- Yes.

639
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,672
Yes, thanks.

640
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,362
My things at the theatre will be packed
after tonight's performance.

641
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,868
Would you see that
they get to the stage depot for me?

642
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,837
- Yes, Miss Dickinson.
- Thank you.

643
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,135
- This message is for you.
- Thank you.

644
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,103
Mrs. Ware.

645
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,906
It's a long time
since I heard that name used.

646
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,971
I'd like to see you a moment...

647
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,808
alone.

648
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,292
- lf it's about Calem, I know.
- Do you now?

649
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,123
Do you know that I have got him
in a cell over at he jail...

650
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,630
right this minute, as alive as both of us?

651
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,725
- Alive?
- We don't want it to get around just yet.

652
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,204
He'll carry a permanent part in his hair,
but by tomorrow...

653
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,832
he'll be waking down the streets
of this town again.

654
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,102
When they said he was dead...

655
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:04,306
I thought it was the worst thing
that could happen to me. Now I wonder.

656
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:08,176
I've known for years something had
been eating on Calem like an acid.

657
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,448
- Now I know it was you.
- You think I'm a coward?

658
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:16,080
- You're not woman enough for Calem Ware.
- You wouldn't understand...

659
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,026
but it doesn't matter
because I'm leaving tomorrow.

660
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,419
Go ahead, run out.

661
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,566
Losing you again is gonna hurt him...

662
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,506
not any more than he's been hurt already.

663
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:35,005
But it's a cinch he's better off
without a woman like you.

664
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,933
Last chance to get your bets down,
the race is about to start.

665
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,967
Once around the town
and finish at the hotel.

666
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,231
Let's start the race. Are you ready, boys?
Get set.

667
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,543
I wouldn't go out in the streets, ma'am.
Miners and riffraff are overrunning the town.

668
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,224
Look out for the horse race!

669
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,483
Doc.

670
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,196
- What do you want, another lecture?
- Please, may I see Calem?

671
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,027
I'll get him.

672
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,565
Doc.

673
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,775
- Your wife's here, she wants to see you.
- How does she...

674
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,745
Why'd you tell her, Doc?

675
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,581
She's leaving town tomorrow.
I figured she should know.

676
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:29,591
It's all over between us.
Goodbyes have been said, and maybe...

677
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,790
Maybe it's better that way.
Maybe then she'll find peace of mind.

678
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,527
Wish her the best of luck.

679
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,710
Calem's in no shape
to see anyone, Mrs. Ware.

680
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,911
You mean he won't see me.

681
01:05:55,751 --> 01:06:00,415
- What did he say?
- Just said to wish you the best of luck.

682
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,254
- That's all?
- Yes, ma'am.

683
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,252
What were you going to tell him?

684
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,197
Nothing. Now.

685
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,965
- Look at it. It's only the beginning.
- And every third one's mine.

686
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:21,325
- Don't worry, you'll get yours.
- What do you mean by that?

687
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,701
Think of the prestige a man would have
if he killed the man who killed Calem Ware.

688
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,403
Don't pay no attention to Cody.
He's drinking.

689
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,309
- Here's to the first million.
- And to the second.

690
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,943
Something's wrong.

691
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,955
You're crazy, everything's all right.

692
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,760
No, listen.

693
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,828
You're hearing things.

694
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,800
That's the trouble, I'm not. Listen.

695
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,241
Out on the street, what do you hear?

696
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,648
There ain't a sound, no yelling, nothing.

697
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,981
What of it?
Everybody's in saloons. Everybody...

698
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,926
Give me a shot, quick.

699
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,104
- What's the matter?
- I saw him. Plain as day.

700
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,644
Closed up my place.

701
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,303
But he'd dead. He's dead.

702
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,474
- What are you talking about?
- Calem Ware, heading this way.

703
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,212
And all Texas streets dying in front of him.

704
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,379
Let him sleep it off in the back.

705
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,459
- He says he saw Calem Ware.
- How could he? I killed him.

706
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,154
- Are you sure you killed him?
- Cody was there.

707
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,057
Don't know.

708
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,430
I don't like it.

709
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,798
I don't like it quiet like.

710
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,733
Shut up!

711
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,550
It's Calem. Calem Ware. He's alive.

712
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:20,685
I don't know how, but he's alive.
And he's closing up the whole town.

713
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,681
That crazy doctor. I should have known.

714
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,023
You heard it, Baskam? You missed him.

715
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,786
He's coming back to give you a second try.

716
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,367
Ever hear of a man who faced
Calem Ware's gun twice and lived?

717
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:05,825
Baskam, the law against
packing guns still stands.

718
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,202
There's another charge against you now.

719
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,870
The murder of Abe Deland
of the Prairie House.

720
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,640
Drop your gun and come out
with your hands high.

721
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,679
Come and get me.

722
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,164
Folks, Medicine Bend is closed for tonight.
Get out of here, everyone of you.

723
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,807
A whole town fallen flat on it's face
because of one man.

724
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,777
And he won't stop at Baskam. We're next.

725
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,907
You're a gambler.
Sometimes you've got to lose.

726
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,383
Get my fast rig.

727
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,512
Meet me behind the opera house.
I'll clean out my safe.

728
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,890
You've got 10 minutes to close this place.

729
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,353
I never saw you
wear a pistol before, Thorne.

730
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,251
That gun-slinging husband of yours
has gone crazy.

731
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:39,385
He's already killed Harley Baskam
and now he's out to gun me down.

732
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:43,830
Yes, I know. Doc told me all about you.
You had me fooled completely, Thorne.

733
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,027
Sorry, I don't have time to discuss it
right now, we're in a hurry.

734
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:49,070
- We?
- Not you, my dear.

735
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,197
Cody Clark is waiting for me out back.

736
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,503
Not that I wouldn't enjoy
your company more.

737
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:29,869
Your nosey husband
better not get in our way.

738
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:31,105
Calem!

739
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:37,140
Calem, don't go around to the back,
they'll be waiting for you!

740
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,518
We will be waiting for him.

741
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,187
No, Thorne, no.

742
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,132
Thorne, you fool.

743
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,039
Hold it.

744
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:15,841
Calem...

745
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,310
Cora told me everything.

746
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,915
I've been a fool, Calem.
I and others like me. Cowards.

747
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,355
Sitting back and letting one man,
just because he wears a badge...

748
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,454
do a job single-handed
that all of us should be doing.

749
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,565
But we're backing your play now.

750
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,295
- What'll we do with him?
- Ask Mr. Dean here.

751
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,971
Calem, what does this mean?

752
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,031
The people of this town
don't need a man like me any longer.

753
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:44,670
It isn't just the badge that makes the law,
it takes the right people to stick together...

754
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,044
fight and find out what it stands for.

755
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,683
Now you've done it.

756
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,182
They sound clean, don't they?

757
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,883
I guess I never heard them
right before, Molly.

758
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:28,184
Marshal, when you get to your ranch,
you'll be hungry for a hot meal.

759
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,090
Just take this and heat it up.
It's Mulligan stew.

760
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,227
I meant to ask...

761
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,995
what did you hear this morning?

762
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:41,126
Nothing, Molly, nothing but church bells.
The beast will never growl again.

763
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,067
<i>Adíós.</i>

764
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,043
- Calem!
- Take care of yourself.

765
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,391
Seeing as how you're really leaving,
I made up some stuff you better take along.

766
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,394
Some bandages and medicine
you'll be wanting.

767
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:11,125
- How much medicine do you think I'll need?
- That isn't all medicine.

768
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,528
Here's the real medicine I fixed up for you.

769
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:19,134
And it's the only medicine in the world
that'll cure what ails you right now.

770
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,377
I tried to tell you yesterday...

771
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,646
that I finally saw the town as you saw it.

772
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,016
If you could spare the time,
I'm out of muscle.

773
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,124
So long, Doc.

774
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,330
Souvenir for you.
