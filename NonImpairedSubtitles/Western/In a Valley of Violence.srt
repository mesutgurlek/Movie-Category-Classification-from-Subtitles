1
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,578
Hello!

2
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,983
Over here!

3
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,185
Whoo!

4
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,288
Please help me!

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,092
Help!

6
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,932
Whoo!

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,003
Can you hear me?

8
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,006
I see you!

9
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,183
Ah, ah, the lord
has answered my prayers.

10
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:28,287
Bless you, my son,
bless you. Good dog.

11
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:32,291
Ah, that's me poor mule here.

12
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,926
She's hurt,
she's hurt really bad.

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,030
How long you been
walkin' her like that?

14
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,599
Ah, not far.

15
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,142
Well, if she's in pain,

16
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,777
you oughta put her down.

17
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,779
Nah.

18
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,948
I don't think I could do that.

19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,983
She was good to you.

20
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,985
It's only right.

21
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,020
No sense in lettin' her suffer.

22
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,291
No, you misunderstand me.

23
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,927
See, it's not that I lack the
conviction to shoot this animal.

24
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,163
The lord is himself would give
me the strength for that.

25
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,299
No, it's more it's a,

26
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,336
it's a matter of practicality.

27
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,038
See, do you believe
in god, my son?

28
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,645
Ah, well, me and this mule here,

29
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,814
we do the lord's work

30
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,583
in traveling
all across this land

31
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,919
preaching the good word.

32
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,289
And over that hill
there down into the valley

33
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,091
is the town of Denton.

34
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,093
That's our next stop.

35
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,095
You familiar?

36
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:47,666
Ah, let me give you a little
insight into our situation.

37
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,869
Denton is a town that
is run by sinners.

38
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,105
Just like many of the others
that we visited.

39
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,174
No church, no religion left
to speak of.

40
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,111
Many of its residents have...
They've lost their way.

41
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,780
So you see, traveler,
if I cannot get this

42
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,116
goddamn mule
over that goddamn hill,

43
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,118
then I cannot heal
those poor souls

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,054
with the gospel of our lord
Jesus Christ, praise his name.

45
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,623
I've been praying,
and I've been praying all day

46
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,992
for the lord
to heal my troubles.

47
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,227
I've asked him,

48
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,729
and I know that he wants me
to help those people.

49
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,766
I know that he wants me to save
those that need to be saved,

50
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,136
especially the women.

51
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:27,139
They are ripe with sin.

52
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,642
So I asked the lord,
I said "do not forsake them,

53
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,977
and do not forsake me.

54
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,048
Send me someone to help
get over that hill."

55
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,150
Sure enough,

56
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,118
he answered my prayers.

57
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,526
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna be
needin' that horse of yours.

58
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,529
So please, my son,

59
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,165
kindly climb down.

60
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,500
Hand over the reins

61
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,302
for the lord.

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,176
Did you not hear me, boy?

63
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,044
Aren't you listening?

64
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,180
No, father.

65
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,615
I don't believe I was.

66
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,120
Ah! Ah! Get it off!

67
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,421
Get it off me!

68
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,857
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Get her off of me!

69
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,040
I stopped listening to men
like you a long time ago.

70
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,141
Don't... don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Quiet.

71
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,277
Don't... don't shoot.
Be quiet!

72
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,946
Or you'll be speaking
to your lord directly.

73
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,216
Now, I'm willing to make you a trade.
A trade?

74
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,251
Yeah, I ain't no thief.

75
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,220
I'll trade you your life

76
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,922
for these bullets and whatever water
you've got left there in your canteen.

77
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,960
Considering the circumstances
that seems more than fair.

78
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,230
Unless, as a man of god,
you don't fear death

79
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,232
and you're content
in your convictions

80
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,235
and prepared to meet your maker
right here and right now,

81
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,238
in which case,
I will oblige you.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,774
Because I'm not a thief,
but I am a killer.

83
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,610
And I've killed
better men than some drunk

84
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,178
wanderin' around pretending

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,247
to preach the word of god.
So are you prepared?

86
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,416
You got confidence
in your convictions

87
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,151
or you wanna make a deal?

88
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,252
Deal.
What?

89
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,254
Yes, I want to make a deal.

90
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,623
All right good.
'Cause I promised my dog

91
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,258
I wasn't gonna kill
anybody on this trip,

92
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,928
and I don't wanna break
my promise here today.

93
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,900
Hey, now, the trade wasn't
for the whiskey.

94
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,271
No, it wasn't.

95
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,207
There.
Ah, you!

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,446
You say there's a town
right beyond that Ridge?

97
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:51,116
Well, you give this mule
a little rest,

98
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,151
he'll get ya there just fine.

99
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,520
But I don't ever
wanna see you again.

100
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,255
I hate charlatans.

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,392
I want you to stay right here...

102
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,629
Till you learn
to respect your animal.

103
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,531
Goddamn you.

104
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,999
You'll pay for this.

105
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,634
The devil is waiting
for men like you.

106
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,136
He's waiting!

107
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,171
Well, if the devil's
looking for me,

108
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,240
you can tell him
I'm headed to Mexico.

109
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,309
He can meet me there.
Come on.

110
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,628
Hyah!

111
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,440
That's all there is.

112
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,343
I know! I'm thirsty too.

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,284
Sh...

114
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,703
I'd say the border's
about 10 days away.

115
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,605
What do you think?

116
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,378
We'd waste a lot of time going
around that valley...

117
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,081
And there's no guarantee
there's water on the other side.

118
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,251
Uh, it's a straight shot
right through that town.

119
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,554
Oh, Jesus.

120
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,322
I don't know about you, but...

121
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,027
Oh, fresh meal and a warm bath

122
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,795
sound pretty good
right about now.

123
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,536
Cathy'd roll her eyes if
she could see us now, huh?

124
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,773
All dirty and starvin'.

125
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,641
You can't live on flies alone,
you know.

126
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,510
Hm.

127
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,519
We gotta keep our heads down,
okay?

128
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,522
No trouble. You gotta be
on your best behavior.

129
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,427
I know. I know.

130
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,761
Same goes for me.

131
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,766
Looks like that priest
was right.

132
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,568
God must've packed up

133
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,969
and left with the rest of them.

134
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,489
Come on.

135
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,837
Shit.

136
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,292
How would someone spend
an hour in this town?

137
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,728
Huh?

138
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,708
If your name was dollar bill,

139
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,042
is that where you'd be?

140
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,312
All right, listen.
You stay here with lady.

141
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,513
If I'm wrong and he comes back,

142
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,648
you give a bark.
You got it?

143
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,454
Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

144
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,197
Now, gentlemen, gentlemen,

145
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,765
please allow me to keep
your attention

146
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,066
for just a few moments more.

147
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,668
I came all this way,

148
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,705
and I must admit that I have
indeed saved the best for last.

149
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,708
Although I am disappointed you
did not take to the lilac powder

150
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,410
or the ladies elixir.

151
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,412
I am certain
these next two items

152
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,680
are just what
you're looking for.

153
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,049
Men of your ilk require
something very special,

154
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,218
very special indeed.

155
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,453
And if I can't see to that, well,
then my name isn't William t. Baxter.

156
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,857
Now, I know that sounds
braggadocious of me to say,

157
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,392
but as you can no doubt see,

158
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:46,698
I'm quite confident
in what I have to offer.

159
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,066
What'll it be?

160
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,968
I'm looking for a man
named dollar bill.

161
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,704
Oh, uh, DB's shop's
across the street.

162
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,706
Yeah, sign on his door
says he's out.

163
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,812
Well, 2:00 he takes a break
to feed his pigs.

164
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,814
Now, it's almost 3:00.

165
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,649
You should be able
to catch him then.

166
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,018
Can I get you a drink?

167
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,722
Some water.

168
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,490
Just water?

169
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,459
Yeah, an a...

170
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,227
A bowl?

171
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,097
You want the water in a bowl?

172
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,899
The bowl's for my dog.

173
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,068
Bowl is for the dog.

174
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:32,143
These here are the finest
handguns currently available,

175
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,012
the greatest equalizers,

176
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,781
45 calibers designed
by Samuel Colt himself,

177
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,183
24-karat gold inlaid,

178
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,617
raised elephant ivory grip.

179
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,486
And when I tell you
that the front sight

180
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,923
is accurate enough to pick
a flea off a dog's ass...

181
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,460
I do not exaggerate.

182
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,763
Now, I can let you have them
for only $30 apiece...

183
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,765
Or 50 for the pair.

184
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,867
Now gentlemen, please,
before you speak,

185
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,602
that isn't just a bargain.

186
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,271
That is a steal.

187
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,106
Quite frankly,
there's no better revolver

188
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,341
on the market today,

189
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,777
and I lay my reputation on it.

190
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,045
As you can imagine,

191
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,980
being in the industry
that I'm in,

192
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,250
my reputation, gentlemen,
is everything.

193
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,355
You never mind your...

194
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,192
Reputation.

195
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,904
So you're saying that this...

196
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,405
This is the best gun
on the market?

197
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,140
Yes, sir, I say it with pride.

198
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,510
Well, nobody west of Texas

199
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,412
will be able to handle it
better than me.

200
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,818
Hell, that is nice.

201
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,887
What do ya say, boys?

202
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,823
Oh, Harris, you even see that?

203
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,058
No, can't say I did.

204
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,327
I almost put one
right between your eyes there.

205
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,829
What about you, Roy?
Did you see anything?

206
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,831
I ain't seen nothing.

207
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,168
Tubby, I know
you didn't see shit

208
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,105
'cause you were too busy thinking what
you were gonna have for lunch, right?

209
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,339
Hey!

210
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,710
Stranger!

211
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,680
You ever seen anybody
so neat with a pistol before?

212
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,886
Hey! Pard!

213
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,454
You deaf or something?

214
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,989
I'm talking to you.

215
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,863
You think this thing's loaded?

216
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:32,985
What do you say we find out?

217
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,968
You should be careful
who you point a gun at.

218
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,042
So... do we have a deal here?

219
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,311
Thirty dollars?

220
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,883
Do I look like I have $30?

221
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,253
You take a look
around this town.

222
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,288
Nobody buying nothing from you.

223
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,931
Do you, uh...

224
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you know what
they call this place?

225
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,669
Hmm?

226
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,006
They call it...

227
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,041
"Valley of violence."

228
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,912
Now, why don't you pack up

229
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,513
before you find out why.

230
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,249
Move.

231
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,731
Now...

232
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,401
What were you saying to me?

233
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,040
You answer me
when I talk to you.

234
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,518
What's the matter?

235
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,887
Cat got your tongue
all of a sudden?

236
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,933
Well, you look like a bum.

237
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,445
You smell like a bum too.

238
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,216
Jesus...

239
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,185
That's one ugly scar you got.

240
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:41,626
Hey, fellas, I don't think
this bum knows where he is...

241
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,498
And you must not know
who I am neither.

242
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,405
Wanna find out?
Huh?

243
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,010
You talk too much,

244
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,611
whoever you are.

245
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,686
All right! Anyone who wants
to see a fight

246
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,022
better get out here right now!

247
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,690
I'm about to show you

248
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,026
what it's like when you run
your mouth at Gilly Martin!

249
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,127
You gonna get him, Gilly?

250
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,696
Oh, tubby,
I'm gonna get him so good

251
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,299
he's gonna be looking to you
for tips on places to sit.

252
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,302
Ellen. Ellen!

253
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,703
Sweetheart!

254
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,572
Where the hell are you?

255
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,140
Get out here and see this.

256
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,875
You are definitely
gonna wanna see

257
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,643
what I am about to do
to this man.

258
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,205
What's going on?
What's all this hubbub?

259
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,047
What's going on?

260
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,050
Baby, some dried up dick licker

261
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,618
came in town this morning,

262
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,086
and I'm about to teach him
a lesson

263
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,422
on how things work around here.

264
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,790
You gonna fight him?

265
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,558
Oh, I'm gonna beat him bad,
baby.

266
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,494
It's time to watch
your man go to work.

267
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,930
Oh, I love a good fight.

268
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,066
Y'all could learn something
out here today. Yes!

269
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,701
This here...

270
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,571
This is my town.

271
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,073
Anybody who don't know it,

272
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,708
you better take notice!

273
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,646
Are you gonna face me
like a man or what?

274
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,254
No offense, mister...

275
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,623
I don't know you

276
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,091
and I don't think
nothing cross about you,

277
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:23,995
but that shot is on the house
if you will get out of here.

278
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,172
N-now, don't worry, everyone!

279
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,941
You are gonna see a fight!

280
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,378
Get him, baby!

281
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,613
Be a man!

282
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,154
I know what the problem is.

283
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,023
Now I know.

284
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,325
You're afraid I'm just gonna
pull my pistol,

285
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,027
lean into you.

286
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,629
All right, well, listen.

287
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:02,200
Nobody here is shooting
nobody today.

288
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,668
No guns.

289
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,304
This here, this is a fair fight.

290
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,139
No jumping in neither.
All right?

291
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,140
Man to man.

292
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,142
Tubby, you hang on to this.

293
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,144
Don't eat it.

294
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:19,150
There, now you have it.

295
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,551
All right, come on.

296
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,321
Let's get this over with.

297
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,824
Everybody's waitin'.

298
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,599
Son of a bitch.

299
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,607
All right!

300
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,175
Five dollars to the winner!

301
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,077
What do you say to that?

302
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,045
Do you even have $5?

303
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,161
Now, wait just a minute.

304
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,798
What...

305
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,202
Is that?

306
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:15,006
Is that... that your dog?

307
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,180
Come here, pooch.
Come here.

308
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,892
Oh, dear.

309
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,131
- Hey!
- Here he comes now, Gilly!

310
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,466
Get away from my dog.
Is that your wife?

311
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,935
Roy, I've seen you with
some long-in-the-tooth ladies,

312
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,637
but this one here
takes the cake.

313
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,906
You started this.
I'm gonna finish it too.

314
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,980
I don't care where I am,

315
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,249
and I don't care
who you think you are.

316
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:01,686
Men like you don't scare me.
You understand?

317
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:05,990
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

318
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,266
I don't want any trouble
with y'all.

319
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,435
Put it away. Put it away!

320
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,504
Harris, he just laid Gilly out
in front of half the town.

321
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,840
We can't just...
Yes, we can.

322
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,277
He's right. It was a fair fight.
It's settled.

323
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,113
What do you think the marshal's gonna say
when he finds out we didn't do nothing?

324
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:33,284
I imagine he'll be upset.
We'll deal with it.

325
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,986
Aw!

326
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:39,223
He just spit on him!
He just spit on Gilly!

327
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,626
Get up, kid.

328
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,063
How's the pigs, bill?

329
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,136
Oh, my god! Gilly!

330
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,210
He shouldn't have
threatened me or my dog.

331
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,313
A man can only take so much.
Yes, sir.

332
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:06,083
How much for all this?
No charge.

333
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,285
I'm not a thief.
How much?

334
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,923
I insist.

335
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,893
What, you afraid of me?

336
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,296
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,067
That's...

338
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:29,573
Tell you what. There's a man
out there who owes me $5.

339
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,575
When he wakes up,

340
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:36,347
you take all this
outta that, okay?

341
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,517
Thank you.

342
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,232
What are ya'll lookin' at?
Go back inside!

343
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,201
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

344
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,737
Oh, he's leaking.

345
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,072
Wait. Why are we outside?
He's leaking! Ah!

346
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,375
Clean him. Clean him.
He's leaking.

347
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:07,378
Come on. Come on.
Get up. Get up.

348
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,580
Gilly!

349
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,549
- Ugh!
- Don't break my hat!

350
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:16,220
Come on. Get up. Oh!
There we go. Okay.

351
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,465
Sit down.

352
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,234
Don't worry.

353
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,403
We're okay.

354
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,639
Comin! I'm coming!

355
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,175
Ugh! I'm sorry.
I fell asleep.

356
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,078
My sister should be down here.
I don't know where she is.

357
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,281
I'll let her have it.
Ellen!

358
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,126
Hi. What can I do for you?

359
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:59,363
You got any, uh, hot water?

360
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,365
Sure do.
You want a bath?

361
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,934
Yeah.

362
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,238
Oh, my goodness! Who is this?

363
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,209
Hi there, cutie.
What's your name?

364
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,945
Aren't you just precious?
She do any tricks?

365
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,314
She bites.

366
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,883
She's not gonna bite me.
Look at us.

367
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,185
We look just like each other.

368
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,455
Oh.

369
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:28,292
Anyways, about that bath.

370
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,295
Uh, you could use one.

371
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,631
Well...

372
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,165
Oh, my, what...
What happened to your hand?

373
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,035
You're bleeding.
Let me get you a rag.

374
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,237
Oh, no, it's all right.
I just need some hot water.

375
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,474
I know you want a bath, but I can't
have you painting my floors.

376
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:47,344
Ellen!

377
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,046
Ugh! Where is she?

378
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,415
She got red hair
and a white dress?

379
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,884
Yeah, that's right.
Tall and dimwitted too.

380
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,453
You know her?
She's outside.

381
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,990
Figures.

382
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,494
I swear, she's about as useful as a
fork in a sugar bowl around here.

383
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,501
How'd you do this
to your hand anyway?

384
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:13,704
Well, it was a...

385
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,106
It was an accident.

386
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,111
Hold that on there.

387
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,289
Oh, my goodness!
Did you punch Gilly?

388
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,857
Oh, my goodness!

389
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,760
This is the best day of my life!

390
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,896
Let's get you
right on up to this bath.

391
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,397
In fact, let's get
both of you a bath.

392
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,467
Come on, whatever your name is.
Come on. Oh!

393
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,402
Okay, here we go.

394
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,272
Got some fresh towels,
and a comb,

395
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,808
and brush, if you
wanna wash your teeth.

396
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,211
And one for you, Abbie.

397
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,321
I hope you don't mind me
being in here for the moment.

398
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,557
Trust me, I've seen it all.

399
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,227
Not that I'm a whore or nothing.
I'm not. This is just a hotel.

400
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,663
So if you're looking for someone to
give it a rub, you're out of luck.

401
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:16,233
There's no women for sale here.
They all left with the silver.

402
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,402
Can I get you anything else?

403
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,105
No.

404
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,507
I can't believe I
missed you punching Gilly.

405
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,576
I would've given anything
to have seen that.

406
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:27,611
I gotta say, I'm just real
interested in who you are.

407
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,648
We don't get many visitors anymore.
Not since the mine went dry.

408
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,618
I spend more time sweeping dust
than I do prepping rooms.

409
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,521
It's exciting to have
someone new to talk to.

410
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,590
You a miner?

411
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:40,758
No.

412
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,559
You a cowboy?

413
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,828
No.

414
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,399
You a gunfighter?

415
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,336
No.

416
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,271
Is that 'cause you ain't, or
'cause no one's hired you yet?

417
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,607
'Cause let me tell you, there are
plenty of people in this town that...

418
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,509
I'm not a gunfighter.

419
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,878
Well, what are you then?

420
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,281
I'm passing through.
Well, I know that.

421
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,818
Nobody stays.

422
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,421
Not even my husband.

423
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,627
Anyway, let me know when you're done.
I got some coffee brewing.

424
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:19,630
You do like coffee?

425
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,131
Ah, well, good.

426
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,367
At least I got something right.

427
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,239
Abbie, next time, I'm just gonna talk
to you. You might have more to say.

428
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,684
Where the hell is he?

429
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:45,155
Mary-Anne... Mary-Anne, you
better not be serving that man.

430
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,425
I am too. You shut your mouth. I
don't want him hearing none of this.

431
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,028
Did you see what he did to Gilly?
Look at my dress!

432
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,930
The whole town practically saw!

433
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,899
Good! Gilly deserves some egg on
his face the way he treats people!

434
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,701
Oh, you watch your mouth!
No!

435
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,670
I'll sway what I want,
and I'll serve who I want.

436
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:02,005
Dad said for us to run
this hotel, not just you.

437
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,676
He could be a criminal.
So have some sense.

438
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:09,213
Oh, Ellen, shut up.
You let me worry about this.

439
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,081
I think he's handsome,
and I like his dog,

440
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,716
and I wanna know
more about them both.

441
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:15,052
I'm not scared, and you're
not gonna ruin this for me.

442
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,887
You foolish little girl.

443
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,389
One day you'll realize there's
no sense in being difficult.

444
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,526
You make the best of what you can.
Now, Gilly takes care of me.

445
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,362
So every time you put him down,
you ought to remember

446
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,699
that he's why I'm always
in nice dresses and jewelry,

447
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,702
and you're still lookin'
like a little old farm girl.

448
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:34,138
There's a reason we have it better
than most people in this town.

449
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,108
So wise up. Maybe then you'll find
someone to take care of you too,

450
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,877
but it's not gonna be
that man upstairs!

451
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:44,581
Because he is a rapscallion!
And we don't serve rapscallions.

452
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,750
Well, maybe I like rapscallions.

453
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,719
Now, go tend to that
nincompoop fiancé of yours

454
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:49,987
and leave me be.

455
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,288
Show him how you ruined
your dress.

456
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,723
See if he buys you
a new one then.

457
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,725
Maybe he can fix that
black tooth of yours

458
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,894
while he's at it.

459
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,531
Gilly! I'm coming, baby.

460
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,007
What did I tell you
about staying out of trouble?

461
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,476
Oh, I know.

462
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,913
Probably was all my fault.

463
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,250
Hey, you know what?

464
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,352
What Cathy'd say?

465
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,821
She'd say, "you got sand,

466
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:27,357
but you could use a little bit
more in your mouth."/

467
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,495
isn't that funny?

468
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,770
Shit.

469
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,905
Fair fight or no fair fight...

470
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,142
Whatever law they got
in this town

471
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,877
is gonna want to talk
to us soon.

472
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,316
So we best be moving on.

473
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,756
Thank you.

474
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,946
From your description, I
expected you to be a lot taller.

475
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,115
Have a seat.

476
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,518
Coffee's ready.

477
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,153
I thought you both
might like some.

478
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,855
I have some pig-stew boiling
if you're hungry.

479
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,324
Mary-Anne, sweetheart,

480
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,226
find something else to do.

481
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,831
Do you want me to watch
Abbie for you? No.

482
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,066
Are you sure? I'll be real nice to her.
I promise.

483
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,201
Mary-Anne.
Yes, sir.

484
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,435
Move your feet.

485
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,339
Yes, sir.

486
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,174
Now, you don't wanna sit,
that's fine,

487
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,977
but all you're doing
is giving me a sore neck.

488
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,416
See I got to take the weight off
it once in a while.

489
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,254
I'm not proud of it.

490
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,293
That's a sweet doggy.

491
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,827
She do any tricks?

492
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,796
She bites.

493
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,270
All right, down to business,
I guess.

494
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,872
I am Clyde Martin.

495
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,874
I am the marshal here in Denton.

496
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,842
You got a badge?

497
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,049
Damn pin broke.

498
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,451
Satisfied?

499
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,223
You busted up my
deputy pretty good.

500
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,394
I had no idea
he was your deputy.

501
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,296
I...

502
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,733
I was just trying
to defend myself.

503
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:50,901
I know you were.

504
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,971
Nobody dare tell me that
'cause it's my son.

505
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,273
And I know how he is.

506
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,909
But defending or not,
he's still my son,

507
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,410
and he's my deputy too.

508
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,946
So all of this is
kind of lousy for me.

509
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:06,183
Well, I can't have people thinking this
kind of business goes on around here.

510
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,852
First the fight breaks out,
then another.

511
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,021
And all the sudden all hell
breaks loose

512
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,690
and everybody's got
something to say.

513
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,859
This town's fallen
on some hard times.

514
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,595
The last thing I need is
a stranger starting trouble.

515
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,931
Yeah, no, i... I'm not
gonna cause any troubles.

516
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,967
No. We're just, uh,
passin' through.

517
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,969
Well, that's what I hear.

518
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,939
Now, is that your horse
over there at bill's outfit?

519
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,041
That's a Mcclellan saddle.

520
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,443
And would I be right to suspect

521
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,313
that that is a Springfield
trapdoor rifle

522
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,215
that you got tied up there too?

523
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,820
I could throw you
in jail right now.

524
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,955
You want that?

525
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:47,557
I don't think so.

526
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,493
Only one reason I don't.

527
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,628
And that's the two items
on your horse

528
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,163
because what they tell me

529
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,298
is that you're just not
another vagabond or criminal

530
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,334
that I should be locking away.

531
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,403
It tells me that you're army,

532
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,571
but what it does not tell me

533
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:05,342
is why the hell are you
all the way out here?

534
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,977
Now, last I heard

535
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,046
the cavalry was
still busy killing Injuns

536
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,981
in Kansas and Oklahoma.

537
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,984
Now, we are a long way
from Kansas, soldier.

538
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:15,585
You mind filling me in?

539
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,755
We're leaving.

540
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,958
Now, just a minute.

541
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,064
If you're a deserter,

542
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,999
I have a duty
as a U.S. marshal

543
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:30,934
to turn you in.

544
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,135
I took an oath.

545
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:41,044
But that would cause extra
attention that I don't want.

546
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,246
You see, I have a way of doing

547
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,714
things around this town

548
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,283
that some think of
as non-traditional,

549
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,286
and I don't want to turn that
upside down.

550
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,554
And I have a feeling

551
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,255
neither of us want
the extra attention.

552
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,391
Am I right?

553
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:58,128
Frankly, I feel like
I've given the military enough.

554
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,964
And from the looks of it,
so have you.

555
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,132
Now, I have sympathy

556
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,234
for men who have fought in wars

557
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:07,437
and even those
who have abandoned them.

558
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,440
So you find yourself
another town

559
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,075
far away from here,

560
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:15,479
one with fancy whores
and fine Whisky

561
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,214
and a chink with a pot of opium

562
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:20,550
that's just begging for a man
like you to come into his life.

563
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,053
You do what you need to do.

564
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:24,621
I expect you earned it.

565
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,392
But don't you ever...

566
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,061
If I ever hear a whispering

567
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:34,564
of you or that dog being
even near these parts again,

568
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,834
you'll be begging
for the army to come get ya.

569
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,303
But they won't.
They won't ever find you.

570
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,605
Nobody will.

571
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:44,040
Are we clear on that, soldier?

572
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,579
All right, fellas.

573
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,182
Our visitors
have decided to leave

574
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,084
they are ready to move on.

575
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,319
So please see that they do so.

576
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,621
And, uh, Mary-Anne?

577
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,457
I believe I will have
some of that stew.

578
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:05,929
Oh, and my understanding is,
Harris, it was a fair fight.

579
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,097
Yeah.

580
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,099
So don't bring any aggravating
on this no more.

581
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:11,501
And tell Gilly that too.

582
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:16,806
His nose is gonna heal up
like a crooked boot,

583
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,909
but he's gonna
have to accept that.

584
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,378
Maybe he'll even learn something
from all this. I don't know.

585
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,349
All right, you're dismissed.

586
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,595
Well, all right.

587
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,014
I know you're not coming back,

588
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:03,086
but I just want to say
it was nice meeting you today.

589
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,155
I wanted to give you this.

590
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:07,224
You can fold it
or rip off Ellen's part

591
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,506
if you don't want
to look at her.

592
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,362
I just thought maybe
you could remember me sometimes

593
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,724
when you get
wherever you're going.

594
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,401
Mary-Anne!

595
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,443
Well, good-bye.

596
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,911
Heck, I don't even know
your name.

597
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,983
My name's Paul.

598
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,554
Well,

599
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,155
good-bye, Paul.

600
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,219
Good girl.

601
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,231
You know what Cathy used to say one of
the greatest things about Mexico was?

602
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,868
Nobody speaks any English.

603
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,539
Oh, shit.

604
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,874
I'll tell you what, though.

605
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,843
One thing I did realize today

606
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:44,147
is that words don't come
so easy anymore.

607
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,348
I'm so used to talking to you

608
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,349
that I barely know what to say

609
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,951
when somebody talks back.

610
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,954
You speak Spanish?

611
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,724
Oh...

612
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,327
Yeah. Come here.

613
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:58,561
Come here.

614
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:02,766
What did you think
of that girl today, huh?

615
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,667
I thought she was pretty funny.

616
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,372
No, she was nothing like Cathy.

617
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,007
When I first met Cathy,

618
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,842
I couldn't get three words
out of her.

619
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,110
You know, she only spoke

620
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:17,614
if she had something
meaningful to say.

621
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,350
But this one...

622
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,285
Shit.

623
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,821
She'd speak every time
she wasn't taking a breath.

624
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,462
No... she's young enough
to be my daughter.

625
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,335
She was funny, though.
Didn't you think?

626
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,611
I thought she was funny.

627
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,984
Not as funny
as you, don't worry.

628
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,491
All right.
Let's go to bed.

629
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,408
Don't you want your blanket?

630
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,781
Shh, be quiet.

631
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,286
Go around the other side
in case he wakes up.

632
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,789
Sure he's asleep?

633
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,031
Heck, tubby.
Just do what I say.

634
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,061
Cut him off.

635
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,698
Gilly, I don't know about this.

636
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,933
Harris, go! Now!

637
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:26,776
Abbie, quiet down!

638
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,814
Come here!

639
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:43,259
Where'd it go? Where is it?

640
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,484
Shh, I can't see
where you're hit.

641
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,833
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

642
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,535
Where are you hit? I can't
find where you're hit.

643
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:54,604
Bull's-eye!

644
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,758
All right.
Listen to me.

645
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,794
She needs some help.
Okay, just...

646
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,529
You can have whatever you want.

647
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:22,031
Please let me just
make sure that she's okay.

648
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,871
Now you shut up.

649
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,307
You are not in charge.

650
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,942
Look, I know I'm not
in charge. That's fine.

651
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,544
Just please, just let me
make sure that she's okay.

652
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:37,580
You back away from her,
or I will kill her!

653
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,549
It's...
Back up.

654
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:42,151
Okay.

655
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,987
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no!

656
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,922
The marshal told you
to leave me alone!

657
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,557
The marshal ain't here!
All right?

658
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,392
No! He told you!

659
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:52,128
You're makin' a mistake!
I am gonna murder you!

660
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,831
I am gonna murder all
of you, I swear to god!

661
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,333
Whoo, god!

662
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,903
There ain't no god here.

663
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,574
There ain't nobody
here... but us.

664
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,612
Shh!

665
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,182
It's okay. Huh?
It's okay.

666
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,287
My dad said that this...

667
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,589
Was probably an Injun's dog.

668
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,958
He most likely got her
off a pack of Cheyenne

669
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,593
out there in Kansas.

670
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:27,563
Cheyenne... who raped
and killed white folk.

671
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,200
Did you steal this dog?

672
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,105
Please. Please.

673
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,540
Don't do this.

674
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,609
Okay, please?
Please don't do this

675
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,177
'cause of what happened today.

676
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:45,048
I mean, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,483
You answer my questions...

678
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:50,019
And maybe I will
consider your request.

679
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,623
Now did you kill
her tribe or not?

680
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:56,459
I...
Come on, now!

681
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,028
There ain't nobody here
that's gonna snitch on you.

682
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,664
No! See, we all
heard the stories.

683
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:06,636
We just ain't never had a chance
to talk to somebody in the flesh.

684
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:08,638
Tell us about it!

685
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,041
You want us to believe
that you were the one man

686
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,044
in the cavalry
too good for all of it?

687
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,047
Shit, I hope that
you killed every last one

688
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,550
of those wagon burners
that you saw.

689
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,485
That's what I would have done.

690
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,688
Those goddamn savages
deserve nothing less.

691
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,825
Please leave us alone.
Please.

692
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:32,328
How many?
I don't know!

693
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:36,365
I don't remember!
I want to go to Mexico!

694
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,669
You'll never see me again!
I swear, please.

695
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:40,670
Take whatever you want!

696
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:43,906
Oh, no. No.

697
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,342
You see, we ain't here
to rob you.

698
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,445
You're the thief, not us.

699
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,616
What do you say, fellas?
Suppose we let this thief

700
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,885
and this traitor
run off to Mexico?

701
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,020
I don't think so!

702
00:45:58,022 --> 00:45:59,422
I don't think so neither.

703
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,659
You're awfully quiet, Harris.

704
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,431
But Gilly...
Yes or no, Harris?

705
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,710
Well, that's a shame.
Because I vote no, too.

706
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:21,711
So that's...

707
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,247
Four to one!

708
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:27,650
Please.
She needs me!

709
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:31,120
I'm begging you! I'm
begging you... oh, no.

710
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:35,057
Begging ain't gonna
do you no good.

711
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,894
See, it ain't a time
for begging.

712
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,596
It's time for praying.

713
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:44,734
You are a coward.

714
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:46,803
You left good men behind.

715
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:50,306
They trusted you,
and you ran out on them!

716
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,675
What if they needed you?

717
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:55,812
Just like this dog here...

718
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:57,046
needs you.

719
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,751
I think...
That it's time...

720
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:05,988
That someone let you know
what that feels like!

721
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,791
No!

722
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:12,829
Oh! Oh! Oh!

723
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,197
Get him up!
Get him on his feet!

724
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,098
Get up, you motherfucker!

725
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,716
No, no.
I ain't gonna cut you.

726
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:38,020
Looks like somebody
already did that.

727
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,291
But you...

728
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,127
Will remember me.

729
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:48,130
You will remember my name.

730
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:52,802
And the last thing
that you will remember...

731
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:56,873
Is that you should have never
come up against Gilly Martin.

732
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:01,377
You're a disgrace. Get this
coward out of my sight.

733
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,679
You're dead.
You're dead too.

734
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,481
All of you are dead.

735
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,083
I think you got that wrong!

736
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:11,487
I think it's you who's dead!

737
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,756
Oh, that's a long way down!

738
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,826
Now let him go, Harris.

739
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:20,429
Harris!
Let him go.

740
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,033
Adios, stranger!

741
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:26,168
Let go!

742
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:33,175
You see him bounce off
that rock, there?

743
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:34,877
I didn't see where he landed.

744
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,780
I did. On the bottom!

745
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,416
Tubby, you better go down
there make sure he's dead.

746
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,919
You crazy? I'm not
climbin' down there.

747
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:44,587
You hear that?

748
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:47,189
Tubby ain't climbin' down there!

749
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,792
Whoo-wee!
Damn!

750
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,698
Hey, you two. You take his horse
and you go through his bags.

751
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,767
And you hurry up.
I want to get back to town

752
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,036
before my dad knows we're gone.

753
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,641
Harris! Gonna stand
there all night, or what?

754
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,009
Get out of here!

755
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,653
I'm so sorry.

756
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,022
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

757
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,027
Oh, my god.

758
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:05,080
I'm not sure what
you'd want me to do.

759
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,354
I could just keep heading
down to Mexico like we planned.

760
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,632
I know I promised you
that I was done killin'.

761
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,705
But I think I'm gonna
have to break that promise.

762
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,645
I'm not done. Not yet.

763
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,818
And it's not done
with me, either.

764
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,125
Those men left me with nothing.

765
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,434
I'm gonna leave them with less.

766
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,185
Hey. Hold up.

767
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,631
Oh, god.

768
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,669
Don't come any closer!

769
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,254
I thought I took your bullets!

770
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:27,356
Huh?

771
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:28,957
I bought more.

772
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,260
What's a priest need
so many bullets for?

773
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,228
Sinners!

774
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:39,034
I'm gonna need your belt.
And I'm takin' your mule.

775
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,270
I thought you said
you weren't a thief!

776
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:43,172
Now you're stealin' me gun
and me mule.

777
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:46,442
Yeah, times have changed.
Give me that.

778
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,346
What happened to you?

779
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:51,880
Well, let's just say...

780
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:55,017
The marshal in Denton
wasn't keen to my cause.

781
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,019
Told me I'd need to pay
if I wanted to preach

782
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:57,986
and said he didn't see the need

783
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,521
for the word of god in his town

784
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,124
yeah, well, that...
I bet he didn't.

785
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,793
I'd say, if this country keeps
turning its back on faith,

786
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,795
there'll be nothing
worth left saving.

787
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,398
You're right about that, father.
You are right about that.

788
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,635
This country's all but lost.

789
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,304
You were right about
something else, too.

790
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:18,407
That town back there?
It's full of sinners.

791
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,112
But they don't need saving.

792
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,814
Oh!

793
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,950
Bless you, my son.

794
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:25,407
This is my father's house.

795
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,176
He's sick.

796
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,647
You got a family?

797
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,617
Not anymore.

798
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,454
They die?

799
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,522
No.

800
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,410
Are you gonna kill those men?

801
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:03,445
'Cause I could help.

802
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,781
They deserve to die for
what they done to you.

803
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,316
And for what they done
to this town.

804
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,484
I could tell you
where to find them.

805
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,686
I-I could do that for you.

806
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:13,422
The marshal and Gilly
got everybody scared.

807
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:15,791
They say if you ain't with
'em, you're against them.

808
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,426
And a lot of people here
took that to heart.

809
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:20,295
There's nobody brave enough
to stand up to them anymore.

810
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,731
You've killed before,
haven't you?

811
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,738
What I mean is, you was in wars.

812
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:36,345
I can tell by the way you don't
want to look me in the eye.

813
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,347
You don't want me to know
what you're capable of.

814
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,582
But I want to know. I want to
know that you'll get them.

815
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:48,457
After it's done, stay with me
until I bury my father.

816
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,826
Then I'll go with you
anywhere... please.

817
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:54,029
I know how to treat a man. I know...
I know what a husband likes.

818
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,964
Stop it.

819
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,133
Please take me with you.
I need to get out of here.

820
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,469
There are no good men
left in this town.

821
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:03,005
I'm not here to save you.

822
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,806
I'm not here to save anybody.

823
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:07,409
Don't say that. I mean...
You don't have to be alone.

824
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:09,545
Yes, I do.

825
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,313
You imagine that
you know who I am,

826
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,482
just because you think
everybody outside this town

827
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,350
has it better than you.

828
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,719
Other people somehow aren't
sufferin' the same way.

829
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,489
You're wrong about that.

830
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:24,092
It's a big old world.
Everybody's sufferin'.

831
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,461
I had a wife...

832
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,865
Named Cathy.

833
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,501
I had a daughter

834
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,236
named Abilene.

835
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:38,507
And she was real pretty,
and smart,

836
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,509
just like you.

837
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,277
What happened to them?

838
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,046
I left 'em.

839
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:46,088
Now I'm sorry for the hand
you've been dealt, truly.

840
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,517
I am.

841
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:50,786
But I can't stay here and
help you bury your father

842
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:53,021
and run you off
to someplace better.

843
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,360
I'm not the man
you see in your head.

844
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:01,263
I deserted my family
the day I enlisted,

845
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,533
and I have been nothing but a
coward for not going back.

846
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,435
I don't even want
to see their faces...

847
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,439
Not after what I've done.

848
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,785
Paul.

849
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,755
You seem like a good girl.

850
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,490
All right, you do.
I mean that.

851
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:33,795
A good man will be proud
to be with a woman like you.

852
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,431
All right, but
I'm not a good man.

853
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:39,701
Not anymore.
I'm takin' your horse.

854
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,575
You think just because
I'm young, I must be naive!

855
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:48,343
I've spent my whole life helpin'
people who can't help themselves.

856
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,979
And what is there
to show for it?

857
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,982
You're not a good man?
Well, I am good!

858
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,951
So why should I be
punished for that?

859
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,352
You act like everybody's
given up on you,

860
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:00,589
but you've just
given up on yourself!

861
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:03,592
You might be sufferin',
but you're not dead, not yet.

862
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:06,595
You're not even sick
like my father in there.

863
01:01:06,597 --> 01:01:08,797
You could still go back to them.

864
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,967
Your family...
They'd understand.

865
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:15,537
I'm sure your wife and daughter
would want to see you again.

866
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:19,241
Mary-Anne, how would you feel
about seeing your husband again?

867
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,345
We're not meant
to be alone, Paul!

868
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,014
People, we belong together,
just like animals in a herd,

869
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,350
just like you and Abbie.

870
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,020
Abbie's dead, Mary-Anne.

871
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,258
- I wish you well.
- Come on.

872
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,090
Goddamn it, you stink!

873
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,325
Oh! Oh, Jesus!
Ellen, sweetheart,

874
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,194
will you make sure that
Roy here gets a bath?

875
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:14,663
- I can't even be in the same room with him.
- I sure will.

876
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:19,501
See, now what he's not used to
is the smell of a real man.

877
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,404
And I can make babies
with this shit here.

878
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,073
Y'all just don't know.
Whoo! God, you are sour!

879
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,676
All right, I'm gonna go help tubby
collect the rest of the taxes.

880
01:02:27,678 --> 01:02:29,945
Maybe later I'll bring
you something nice.

881
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:31,680
Something nice?
I'd like that.

882
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:33,782
I thought you would.
Make sure he don't drown.

883
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,651
He's like a cat to water. I may need him.
I'll see to it.

884
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,164
Ellen!

885
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,482
Ellen? Where are you?

886
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:11,553
Stop shouting, I'm right here!
You're so loud.

887
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,822
What do you want? I thought
you was out with dad.

888
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,123
I need to talk with you.

889
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,893
He didn't die, did he?
No, not yet.

890
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:20,295
Oh.
Oh thank god.

891
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,464
Ugh, not like you'd care.
Mary-Anne!

892
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,432
How dare you say
something like that to me?

893
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:27,235
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
But please, it's important.

894
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:29,304
Roy's in 353,
and he needs hot water.

895
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,106
Go warm him up,
and then we can talk

896
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:33,575
about whatever nonsense
you got in your mind this time.

897
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,777
I'll be in our room.
Don't let that man get cold!

898
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:38,246
Ellen!

899
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,748
Nope.

900
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,250
Fine, I'll get him the damn water.
And a shave kit.

901
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,653
His chin is looking like
a nasty old Billy goat.

902
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,057
And don't you dare
tell him I said that.

903
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,426
Ahh!

904
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:57,766
Yeah? What is it?

905
01:03:57,768 --> 01:04:00,402
Have some more hot water?
And a kit for a shave?

906
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,738
Yeah, well bring it in.

907
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,926
Oh, I feel real good.

908
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:31,800
How old are you, now?
Sixteen.

909
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,568
Oh.

910
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,806
You know that husband of yours
never comin' back, right?

911
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:40,675
I mean, you're old enough
to know that by now.

912
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:42,177
Yes, sir.

913
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:46,348
You're real pretty,
like your sister.

914
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,416
You ought to find a new man.

915
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,687
One with connections.

916
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:57,726
And a home
outside of this hotel.

917
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:00,795
You know, you don't want to
wait till your looks grow out.

918
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,805
No shave today.
I think I'll keep the beard.

919
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,229
You back already?

920
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,533
Why don't you just

921
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:49,337
slip that little dress
of yours off and...

922
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,740
Climb right into
the tub here with me?

923
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,244
The water's real nice...

924
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,383
I don't want you to be shy.

925
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:06,955
Mm. Ah!

926
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:10,158
I said no shave today.

927
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,061
Don't move!
Don't make a sound!

928
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:16,064
Put your arms in the tub.
Put your arms in the water.

929
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,569
I told you I'd find you,
didn't I?

930
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,874
And before you start
asking for anything...

931
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,911
There's not gonna be
any sympathy today.

932
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,981
Now, get your arms back
in the water.

933
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:34,916
Put 'em in the water!

934
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,588
Now, listen to me.
I didn't come here today

935
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,991
with any compassion at all.

936
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:46,161
The four of you killed my dog,

937
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:48,696
and you tried to kill me.
Hmm?

938
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:52,667
Now, it was a mistake
to leave me alive.

939
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,669
I'm not gonna make that mistake.

940
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:57,906
I've killed more human beings
than I care to remember,

941
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,942
and I will not hesitate...

942
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:05,246
Or quit until the four
of you are in the dirt.

943
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:10,385
Now take a deep breath, hmm?

944
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:13,254
It's your last one!

945
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,609
Mary-Anne?
What's goin' on?

946
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,624
Mary-Anne? Mary-Anne.

947
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,161
Mary-Anne. What is it?

948
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:54,629
Oh, my god!

949
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,936
Oh, my god. Roy.

950
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:04,139
Ro...

951
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,102
Roy!

952
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:36,371
Oh, lord!

953
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:44,212
Tubby, catch your breath somewhere else,
and get away from the goddamn window!

954
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,116
Yes, sir.

955
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:52,220
Mm, oh. Mm...
What happened?

956
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:53,955
You went after
that man, didn't you?

957
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,124
I told you not to.
I made it perfectly clear

958
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,326
that you were not
to aggravate the situation,

959
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,795
but ya did, didn't ya?
All of ya did!

960
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,497
We couldn't let him
get away with what he did!

961
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:05,200
It would have made us look weak!
Weak?

962
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:06,834
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up!

963
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:10,572
You think I let him go
'cause I'm weak? No.

964
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,577
Look at this! That's not
done by an angry drunk,

965
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,579
or a miner that has
a sense of entitlement!

966
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,147
This was done by a military man,

967
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:22,650
a man trained to kill by one
of the most ruthless divisions

968
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,085
our country has ever seen,

969
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,920
something you would know
nothin' about!

970
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,522
And you think just because
you've got a prick

971
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,724
and a pistol,
you can kill somebody?

972
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:33,428
Well, look at death!
Take a look at it!

973
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,864
If you'd done what we said,

974
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,906
Roy wouldn't be breathing
out of his neck right now!

975
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:43,338
Give me that cane.

976
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,841
Stop! Just stop!

977
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,176
Stop!

978
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:50,245
Marshal! Marshal!
Stop it!

979
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,714
We thought he was dead.Honest.

980
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:54,182
I don't know how
he could have survived.

981
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,184
I told you we should have gone
down there and made sure.

982
01:10:56,186 --> 01:10:58,086
Aw, shut up, both of ya!

983
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:00,188
Y'all should have known better
than let him get away

984
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,256
with something like this!

985
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,057
Why the hell am I
even paying you?

986
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:05,193
Now, which one
of you girls seen him?

987
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:06,394
Well, we both did.

988
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:08,129
He have a gun?

989
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:10,565
I don't know. It happened
so fast, all I saw was blood.

990
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,200
Mary-Anne,
did you see if he had a gun?

991
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:13,701
Mary-Anne?

992
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,203
I-I don't...
I don't know.

993
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:19,040
Now, think hard. It's important
you say the right thing.

994
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,942
People's lives
are depending on it.

995
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,345
I don't know, marshal, honest.

996
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,815
All right. Harris.

997
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:30,451
Get over to the jailhouse,
lock up all the guns,

998
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,920
and get up on the roof
with a rifle.

999
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,922
Now, if we're lucky,
he's not armed.

1000
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:37,959
But if he is, it's gonna get
worse before it gets better.

1001
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,962
Now, Gilly, you make sure you
get them girls someplace safe.

1002
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,764
And, tubby, you come with me.

1003
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:46,267
Why do I have to stay
with the women?

1004
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,337
You almost got us
all killed today.

1005
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,105
Now, I would appreciate it

1006
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,241
if you didn't act
on every idiotic thought

1007
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:54,642
that comes into your mind

1008
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,678
and just do what I say
from now on.

1009
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,313
We don't know
if this man is deranged.

1010
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,914
We don't know what he's done.

1011
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:03,451
Anybody could be next, including
the women, so get them safe.

1012
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:06,020
Now! Get!

1013
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,693
Move!

1014
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,131
Marshal, what about Roy?

1015
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:20,268
We don't have time
to dig a hole.

1016
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,737
Let's just let him soak.

1017
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,553
Now, if he's out there
and he's got a gun,

1018
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,690
most likely one of us
is gonna take a bullet.

1019
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:18,359
And since I've already been
shot in this life,

1020
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,094
I think you oughta go first.

1021
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,731
Why do we have to go out there?

1022
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,334
Because you don't run from
battle with a man like this.

1023
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,936
Hesitation'll get you killed.

1024
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:30,872
It's the stick or the whip.

1025
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,340
Either way, I wanna a fightin'
chance

1026
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:35,343
and I got a shotgun
waiting for me in the jailhouse,

1027
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:36,411
and I intend to use it.

1028
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,079
So you go from door to door,

1029
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,415
and you make sure he
ain't hiding out with anybody.

1030
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:43,684
Now, we gotta move fast.

1031
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:45,787
We ain't gonna wait here to die.

1032
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,588
We're gonna take it to him.

1033
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,158
Do you understand what I mean?

1034
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,060
Yes, sir.

1035
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:55,963
Now, you be careful
'cause you're a big target.

1036
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,901
Gilly, why is this happening?

1037
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,203
God, that man,
he was covered in blood.

1038
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,704
Looked like he had
on red gloves.

1039
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:06,073
Why would he do that?
Poor Roy.

1040
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:07,475
Poor Roy. He didn't deserve this.
Ellen...

1041
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:10,278
Ellen.
He didn't...

1042
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,779
Be quiet.

1043
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,548
I need to think right now.

1044
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:16,951
And you are grinding down my
ears with all of your babbling.

1045
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:20,221
My babbling? My babbling?

1046
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:22,523
Gilly, he almost
took Roy's head off.

1047
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,462
I know, Ellen.
I saw.

1048
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,230
I looked down his throat.

1049
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,399
But you going on and on about it

1050
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:34,635
ain't helping me
sort any of this out.

1051
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,904
You're gonna kill him, right?
You and others?

1052
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,906
I mean, he can't get away
with this. He can't.

1053
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,908
Ellen, what did I just say?

1054
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,109
Or maybe he's gone.

1055
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,512
Maybe he killed Roy
and he just moved on.

1056
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:48,749
Yeah. Yeah. We don't know for
sure that he's even still here.

1057
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:51,152
He's not moving on.

1058
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:54,288
They killed his dog.
What?

1059
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,358
That's why he's back.
That's why Roy's dead.

1060
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,794
He's not going anywhere
until he gets even with all you.

1061
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,276
You shouldn't have
done what you done.

1062
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:04,365
How did you know about that?

1063
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,604
How did you know about his dog?

1064
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:12,340
You talked to him, didn't you?

1065
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,442
Are you helping him?

1066
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:17,445
Mary-Anne, is that what you
were trying to tell me earlier?

1067
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:19,347
You knew this man was coming?

1068
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,015
You knew this would happen,
and you didn't say nothin'?

1069
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,984
I did say something.
You didn't listen.

1070
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,452
Gilly, Gilly, don't!

1071
01:15:24,454 --> 01:15:25,453
Gilly!

1072
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:26,921
Shut up, Ellen!

1073
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:32,493
I'm talking to your sister.

1074
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:36,631
Now, are you helping him?

1075
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,636
You answer me.

1076
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:46,641
Are you helping him?

1077
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,479
No. He didn't want my help.

1078
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:53,281
But I would have, though.

1079
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,453
Gilly, Gilly! No!

1080
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,490
Ellen, get off of me.

1081
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:03,724
Enough!

1082
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:05,493
Enough.

1083
01:16:05,495 --> 01:16:08,930
I should shoot
the both of you right now,

1084
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:11,265
but I need all the
fucking bullets that I have

1085
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:13,501
in this gun
for that asshole out there.

1086
01:16:13,503 --> 01:16:15,870
So you lie there and you ache.

1087
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:18,439
And you lie there and you bleed.

1088
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:23,778
But the both of you,
please shut up.

1089
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:44,131
All clear now. And just move on
down the line like I said.

1090
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,667
And do it quick '&cause I'll be
right behind you.

1091
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,375
And you're sweatin' a lot.
You all right?

1092
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:58,145
You're not gonna pass out
on me or nothin', are you?

1093
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:00,548
No, sir.

1094
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:05,152
I just sweat sometimes
on account of my biology.

1095
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:28,209
Shoot '&em. Shoot '&em both.

1096
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,480
Mister...

1097
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,585
I'm real sorry for what we done.

1098
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,587
I told Gilly,
but he just wouldn't listen.

1099
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:42,923
He ain't reasonable
when he's like that.

1100
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:45,760
But you remember though, right?

1101
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,764
You remember I didn't wanna
do this to you.

1102
01:17:52,602 --> 01:17:56,537
Shoot 'em or I'll shoot you.

1103
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:58,873
Wha...

1104
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,947
On a count of three now.

1105
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:08,616
Yes, sir.

1106
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:10,418
You can do this.

1107
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:12,687
Yes, sir.

1108
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,255
Move straight out.

1109
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,627
Yes, sir.

1110
01:18:19,629 --> 01:18:21,762
All right. One...

1111
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,101
Two...

1112
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,404
Yes, sir.

1113
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:33,841
Three.

1114
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:36,043
Go. Go!

1115
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:45,853
No!
I don't wanna...

1116
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:49,657
No. What are you doin'?
That's tubby, goddamn it.

1117
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,625
Don't shoot! What the...

1118
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,031
Tubby, ya hit?

1119
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,866
Shoot them now.

1120
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:02,002
They're getting away.
Shoot them!

1121
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:03,838
Come on, get up!

1122
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,873
I can't.
I don't wanna die.

1123
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,075
Look I don't wanna die neither.

1124
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,578
J...

1125
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,679
Ow!

1126
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:13,781
Get up!

1127
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,189
I can't.

1128
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,925
I can't shoot them.

1129
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:04,732
I know there's not a
lot of dignity in this,

1130
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:09,103
but I have a daughter

1131
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:10,871
I'd like to see again.

1132
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:18,145
But I don't suppose that I will.

1133
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,700
Harris?

1134
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,610
Get away from the window.

1135
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:51,712
He's still on the roof.
We can trap him.

1136
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:53,614
You move in front
of the building.

1137
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:54,782
I'll cut him off in the back.

1138
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,950
But we gotta move fast.

1139
01:20:55,952 --> 01:20:57,885
This is our only chance.
We can't blow it.

1140
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:18,239
Sh...

1141
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,543
Did I get ya?

1142
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,379
No.

1143
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,318
I'm not here for you, marshal.

1144
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,821
I'm here for the men
who killed my dog.

1145
01:21:33,823 --> 01:21:39,260
Shit. Goddammit, Gilly.

1146
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:42,363
Well, I didn't know about that.

1147
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:44,832
But I can't allow this to go on.

1148
01:21:44,834 --> 01:21:46,834
Now, I wouldn't be
much of a father if i...

1149
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:48,836
If I let you kill my son.

1150
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:50,905
And I wouldn't be
much of a... a marshal if I

1151
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:54,141
let you kill anyone else.

1152
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,414
Well, if you get in my way,
I'm gonna take you down.

1153
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,451
Yeah, I suppose you will.

1154
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,589
Well, the feeling's mutual.

1155
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,900
Tubby, how long does it take you
to get your fat ass

1156
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,135
around that building?

1157
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,640
I'm coming to get ya.

1158
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,343
I'm coming to get ya.

1159
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,363
Shit.

1160
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,836
That's it.
I'm going out there.

1161
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,305
No. No. No, you
can't leave us here.

1162
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:01,275
The hell I can't. He's not
after you. He's after me.

1163
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,310
She said it.
You remember?

1164
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:04,945
He's crazy.

1165
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:07,247
And the marshal told you
to protect us.

1166
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:10,684
And I'm your fiancé. You don't
just up and leave your fiancé.

1167
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:16,824
Ellen, right now I wouldn't care
if you were the tip of my dick!

1168
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:17,992
I am going out there.

1169
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,927
You forget
about what my dad said

1170
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:21,962
because he doesn't
care about either of you.

1171
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:24,431
He just doesn't think that
I can handle it on my own.

1172
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,933
But I'm gonna end it,

1173
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:28,168
and I am gonna prove
to him what I am capable of.

1174
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,436
Now you get away from the door

1175
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:31,939
before I put
another hole in you.

1176
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:33,340
Move!

1177
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:35,743
Gilly...

1178
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,780
I'm pregnant.

1179
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:43,283
Please don't leave
me alone here.

1180
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,454
I can't lose you.

1181
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:49,923
I can't have this baby
all by myself.

1182
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,763
Um, I need you.

1183
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,566
Ellen...

1184
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:05,105
Do you honestly think...

1185
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,976
That now is the right time

1186
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:10,978
for this conversation?

1187
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:15,249
Are you seriously bringing
this up right now?

1188
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,217
Yes.

1189
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,986
There is a man outside

1190
01:24:18,988 --> 01:24:22,756
who is systematically trying
to kill everyone that I know,

1191
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:23,824
including my father,

1192
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,692
and you've decided that now

1193
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:29,963
is a good time to tell me
that you are pregnant?

1194
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,000
Gilly. Gilly.

1195
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:37,337
Ellen! Stop talking.

1196
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:40,007
The worst thing
that you could do right now

1197
01:24:40,009 --> 01:24:41,408
is to say another word.

1198
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,344
Let him go, Ellen.
He wants to die, let him.

1199
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:46,914
Know what? Maybe I can
spare one more bullet.

1200
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,949
No, no please.
Please, Gilly, don't.

1201
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:52,586
I love you, I love you, I'm just so scared.
I'm scared, please.

1202
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,987
Please.

1203
01:24:56,024 --> 01:25:00,027
There is no denying that
the two of you are related.

1204
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:02,763
You truly are pathetic.

1205
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,999
Both of you.

1206
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,559
What the hell's wrong with you?

1207
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,061
Couldn't you hear me
yellin' out there,

1208
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:36,103
waitin' for your fat ass
to get around the building?

1209
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,632
Get away from the window!

1210
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,801
How many times I gotta tell you?

1211
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,003
Tubby!

1212
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:46,073
It's Harris's face.
It's gone.

1213
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:47,074
What?

1214
01:25:47,076 --> 01:25:48,308
His whole face is gone.

1215
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,910
What are we gonna tell
his wife and kid?

1216
01:25:49,912 --> 01:25:52,246
How are we gonna tell '&em
he got no face no more?

1217
01:25:52,248 --> 01:25:54,081
And Roy, he's up there

1218
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:56,483
pruning in a tub
of his own blood.

1219
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,186
I can't do this, marshal.

1220
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:01,188
I'm sorry.

1221
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,023
I just can't.
Okay.

1222
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:07,027
It's a lot to take. I didn't
know it would be like this.

1223
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:08,462
All right, now, tubby...

1224
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:11,598
Stop calling me tubby! I don't
wanna be called that anymore.

1225
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,100
I'm not even that fat!

1226
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:15,669
Y'all act like all I do is
sit around eating all day.

1227
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,873
I don't! I work!
And I eat less than y'all.

1228
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,176
This is just the way
god made me.

1229
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:23,777
And I accept that.

1230
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,379
But if I'm gonna die here today,

1231
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:27,214
I am not gonna be called tubby.

1232
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:28,949
I mean it!

1233
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:32,319
Now look, I will call you
whatever you want

1234
01:26:32,321 --> 01:26:33,887
if we just get through this.

1235
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:34,988
But please.

1236
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,223
Lawrence.

1237
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:40,027
My name is Lawrence.

1238
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:46,800
All right, Lawrence. Larry,
please, for the love of god,

1239
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:49,570
get away from
the goddamn window!

1240
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,374
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

1241
01:26:56,144 --> 01:27:00,113
Marshal! This doesn't have
to concern you.

1242
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,254
You don't have to die today.

1243
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:11,158
But you're gonna have to
have a real good, long think

1244
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,660
about where you
stand from here on out.

1245
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:26,173
Come on, come on, come on,
you cocksucker.

1246
01:27:26,175 --> 01:27:28,575
Just let me see your face.

1247
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,450
All right. I'm beat.
Let's talk.

1248
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:43,490
But if I come out, are you gonna
talk, or are you gonna shoot?

1249
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,195
I'm prepared for both.

1250
01:27:48,197 --> 01:27:52,065
Well that doesn't make
me feel comfortable.

1251
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,201
Well, you got a gun, marshal?

1252
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:56,203
You know I do.

1253
01:27:56,205 --> 01:28:00,307
Better leave it behind.

1254
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:04,611
Well if I come out unarmed,
how do I know you won't shoot?

1255
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:10,183
Well, you don't.
What better option you got?

1256
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,722
Well, I can see your point.

1257
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,347
No gun.

1258
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,251
No gun.

1259
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:47,220
What the hell is he doing?

1260
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,759
Where's your son?

1261
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,262
I don't know.

1262
01:28:55,264 --> 01:28:57,898
But I just don't
want anyone else hurt.

1263
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,205
Now you gotta know

1264
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:09,276
that this is a deeply
embarrassing moment for me.

1265
01:29:09,278 --> 01:29:11,545
But I'm doing the right
thing by surrendering

1266
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:13,313
and I, and I hope that
you do the same.

1267
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:17,284
I wasn't planning on it.

1268
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:20,821
Now look, I know my son
and the others have...

1269
01:29:20,823 --> 01:29:22,856
Have done ya wrong.

1270
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:25,292
And I know you want my boy dead.

1271
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:27,894
But that... that ain't gonna
bring your dog back

1272
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:31,031
no more than
I could re-grow my leg.

1273
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:35,869
So let's stop the killing and,
and let's be reasonable.

1274
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,474
Reasonable?

1275
01:29:40,476 --> 01:29:42,309
That how you run this town?

1276
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:44,344
Well now, now you don't know
nothin' about that.

1277
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:46,313
This town needs me.

1278
01:29:46,315 --> 01:29:49,316
This town wouldn't be
standing here without me.

1279
01:29:49,318 --> 01:29:51,985
These people need a leader.

1280
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:53,520
Now, they don't always like it,

1281
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,989
but they can't
survive without it.

1282
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:58,191
Now you oughta remember that,
soldier.

1283
01:29:58,193 --> 01:29:59,059
Now, come on.

1284
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:01,528
Leaders are chosen, marshal.

1285
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:04,331
You ain't given nobody a choice.

1286
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:06,500
Your son...

1287
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,671
He killed my dog.

1288
01:30:11,673 --> 01:30:14,374
So now...
I ain't got no choice.

1289
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:17,010
All right, enough talking dad!
Whoa, whoa, now hey!

1290
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:20,013
No! I said I got it,
and you get out of the way!

1291
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:21,581
No, stand back, Gilly!

1292
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:24,050
Now, both of ya'll put
your guns down.

1293
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:25,952
Now that's enough is enough!

1294
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:29,356
You're just saying that
because he's got you beat.

1295
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:32,359
He thinks he won,
but he ain't won shit,

1296
01:30:32,361 --> 01:30:33,360
not while I'm still here.

1297
01:30:33,362 --> 01:30:36,396
Gilly! Put your guns down!

1298
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:37,531
No, he'll shoot me!

1299
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:38,899
He won't shoot you.

1300
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:40,367
Now look,
we can stop all of this.

1301
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:42,803
No, he killed Roy and
then he killed Harris,

1302
01:30:42,805 --> 01:30:45,605
then killed tubby and I'm not
gonna let him get away with it.

1303
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:46,940
He's gotta die for what he did!

1304
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,375
He does not have to die.

1305
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:51,278
Nobody's got to die.
Now look I'm beggin' ya,

1306
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,413
don't shoot my son.

1307
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:56,950
The time for beggin' is over.

1308
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,586
Now's the time for prayin'.

1309
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,621
Well, don't worry, dad.

1310
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:07,661
Everything is under control.
You just step away.

1311
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:12,165
Gilly, can i... just let me talk
to him. Just let me talk to him.

1312
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:16,503
No. We're done talkin'.

1313
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,267
Dad.

1314
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:52,839
Dad.

1315
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,621
You all saw what he did.

1316
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,392
He did this!

1317
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:47,460
He killed him!

1318
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,133
This is all his fault!

1319
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,336
And anyone

1320
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:59,639
who helps that man
is as good as dead!

1321
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:03,510
Now, where the fuck are you?

1322
01:33:03,512 --> 01:33:05,412
Where the fuck are you?

1323
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,500
Lady?

1324
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:36,476
What are you doing here?
Huh?

1325
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:38,478
What are you doing here?

1326
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,481
Oh. Shit.

1327
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:56,196
What do you say we get
out of here, huh?

1328
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,969
Give me a second.

1329
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:08,475
Move!

1330
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:21,521
Where are you?

1331
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,559
I know you're in here.

1332
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,944
Now, you show your
face you coward.

1333
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:54,721
No!

1334
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:02,829
Why did you kill my dog?

1335
01:35:02,831 --> 01:35:04,631
Why would you do that?

1336
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:06,599
Let me go!

1337
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:12,272
Why would you hurt
my dog? Huh? Huh?

1338
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:16,543
No! No! No!

1339
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,783
Stop, please,
I don't wanna be dead.

1340
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:26,553
Please, god!

1341
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:38,364
I don't want to die!
Please get off of me.

1342
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:09,222
I told you I could help you.

1343
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:17,991
Gilly! Gilly, where are you?

1344
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:31,738
Gilly!

1345
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:34,841
Through this holy anointing,
may the lord,

1346
01:38:34,843 --> 01:38:36,209
in his love and his mercy,

1347
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:37,911
help you with the grace
of the holy spirit.

1348
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:40,847
May the lord saves us free.

1349
01:38:43,451 --> 01:38:46,085
You ought to stick around
a while this time, father.

1350
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:49,155
We could all use
a little saving.

1351
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:03,870
It's okay. I got you.
Let's just get inside.
