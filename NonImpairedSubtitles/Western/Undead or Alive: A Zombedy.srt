1
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,984
Pie's ready.

2
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,079
Pa's drunk again.

3
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,131
If you've been drinking devil juice

4
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,332
instead of working the back fields again,
Ben Goodman,

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,299
you're getting no berry pie tonight.
No dessert, neither!

6
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,630
Ben?

7
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,635
No! No! No!

8
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,411
Go away, Ben!

9
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,920
- Make him stop, Mama!
- Hush, baby!

10
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,583
Mama's going to save you!

11
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,817
Rye.

12
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,365
Where's the piano player?

13
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,875
He got shot.

14
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,586
I do.

15
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,522
<i>She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes</i>

16
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:12,093
<i>She'll be coming around the mountain
when she comes</i>

17
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,298
<i>She'll be coming around the mountain</i>

18
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,602
<i>She'll be coming around the mountain</i>

19
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,110
<i>She'll be coming around the mountain
when she comes</i>

20
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,010
Show us your tittles!

21
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,345
<i>We'll all go out to meet her when she comes</i>

22
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,883
<i>When she comes</i>

23
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,419
<i>We'll all go out to meet her when she comes</i>

24
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,045
<i>When she comes</i>

25
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,454
<i>We'll all go out to meet her</i>

26
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,651
<i>We'll all go out to meet her</i>

27
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,219
<i>We'll all go out to meet her when she comes</i>

28
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,367
Get your filthy eyeballs
off my princess, mister!

29
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,063
I'm just playing the piano here, kid.

30
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,771
Get up, take your licking like a man.

31
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,708
Anybody ever tell you,
if you mind your own business,

32
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,615
you won't get kicked in the balls?

33
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,450
I'm not goanna just sit there
and watch your soil my princess.

34
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,556
I hate to be the one to break it to you, kid,
but she ain't your princess.

35
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:07,987
She's a whore.

36
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,359
Why, you potty-mouth son of a bitch.

37
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,993
No. No.

38
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,404
Yeah! Get him!

39
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,841
You little leg-humpers just made me
put a hole in my own ceiling.

40
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,078
Now, how you gonna pay for that?

41
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:39,215
It's awful loud when you shoot that gun off,
and it scares the shit out of everybody.

42
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
You say another word,

43
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,797
and I'm gonna shoot that jaw
clean off your face.

44
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,664
Then I'm gonna take a shit
in your chin hole.

45
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,408
Get up, Cletus, we got paying customers.

46
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,378
All right, Sheriff. Let me find the keys.

47
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,242
What did I tell you
about drinking on the job?

48
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,283
- Check their boots.
- You heard the man! Boots!

49
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,664
Oh, no!

50
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,396
- You had a knife on you?
- I didn't stick you with it.

51
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,201
You should have said something, though.

52
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,144
I'll be holding onto this for you.

53
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:40,446
Is there gonna be a trial?
Because I would like to have me a lawyer.

54
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,719
- Get them!
- Move!

55
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,020
Heck, can we at least have our boots back?

56
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,753
You ain't walking nowhere.

57
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,030
What the hell happened to him?

58
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,299
You wanna watch out for old Ben.

59
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,741
Killed his own wife and daughter last week.
Sucked their brains out.

60
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,836
Ate them like pudding.

61
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,214
Had holes right in the top of their heads,
about yay big.

62
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:21,688
And he must have still been hungry
'cause he ate his own tongue, right after.

63
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,724
We're fixing to hang old Ben in the morning.

64
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,792
Ain't that right, old Ben?
You're fixing to dangle.

65
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,169
I'll deal with you two after the hanging.

66
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,011
These here's some fancy boots, fancy man.

67
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,453
Yeah. I'm kindly fond of them.

68
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,375
Claypool gonna horsewhip you two
so bad tomorrow,

69
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,242
you're gonna wish
it was you that was being hanged.

70
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,612
Gonna leave you hanging on the rail.

71
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,651
You ain't even gonna know who it is

72
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:24,052
coming up in the dark
to take a dig at your dirt mine.

73
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,418
But don't worry.

74
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,551
When it's my turn,
I'll be sure to whisper something sweet.

75
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,030
This day is turning out terrible.

76
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,062
Dang it, Ben, amigo.

77
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,437
You've gotta knock that off,
it's starting to get on a feller's nerves!

78
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,230
You think old Cletus there is asleep yet?

79
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,596
Cletus!

80
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,267
Yeah, he was still sleeping.

81
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:23,076
Now we gotta wait some more to make sure.
Plus, you woke up old Ben there.

82
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,912
Yeah, Ben's all right for a brain eater.

83
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,648
Ain't you, Ben?

84
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,391
Oh, jeez, quiet, Ben!

85
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,054
I don't see why it matters, though.
We ain't got the key.

86
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,436
- What are you? Some kind of thief?
- I'm a retired soldier.

87
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,268
Well, how come you got
all those tools up your sleeves?

88
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,569
I'm training to be a dentist.

89
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,748
You coming, ponyboy?

90
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,457
Name's Luke. Luke Budd.
I owe you one, mister.

91
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,564
Elmer Winslow.
We'll do the meet-and-greet later.

92
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,056
Get your boots.

93
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,130
Hush, Ben, hush!

94
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,839
Yeah. Just shut up!

95
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,373
No, I want my boots.

96
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,122
- Put these on.
- I ain't wearing those!

97
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,789
Well, you're gonna wake him up
if you try to get yours off him.

98
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:33,950
Yep.

99
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,383
I'm gonna need my boots.

100
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,796
What are we gonna do with him?

101
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,631
You don't have to whisper anymore,
he's awake.

102
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,103
- We'll lock him up.
- He's gonna make a racket.

103
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,108
Yeah, well,
guess we'll have to cut his throat.

104
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,805
- We can't do that!
- I'm kidding. We'll gag him.

105
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,677
You got a gag handy?

106
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,821
Sorry we have to leave you here.

107
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:24,164
But it just ain't right to eat
your wife and daughter's brains.

108
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,635
Plus, you're really disgusting.

109
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,298
I don't want to spend
any more time with you.

110
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,808
You two stay out of trouble.

111
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,031
All I gotta do is get Frisky,
we can hightail it out of here.

112
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,533
- Your horse is named Frisky?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,904
Got a problem with that?

114
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,241
- Sounds like a girl's horse, that's all.
- It ain't.

115
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,980
- What's the name of your horse?
- I don't know. I haven't stole it yet.

116
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,986
I'm not leaving without my money.

117
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,168
I ain't gonna let you face
that mean sheriff alone.

118
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,886
- Why not?
- Heck, I figure we're partners now.

119
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,054
I mean, we are partners now, right?

120
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,602
Breaking out of jail and all.
We're practically an outlaw gang.

121
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,193
Yeah, I guess.

122
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,766
I always wanted to be in a gang.

123
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,712
What's going on in there?

124
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,355
Oh, man!

125
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,826
What is it?

126
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,165
Oh, man.

127
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,132
- Oh, man!
- What?

128
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,170
He's kissing on my princess
and she's kissing right back!

129
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,671
The hooker?

130
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,209
Dang it, Elmer, will you quit saying that?

131
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,336
We were gonna get married,
settle down, have some young'uns.

132
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,381
Heck, we already found a place
that we both fell in love with.

133
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,713
It's a fixer-upper, it's on the edge of town.

134
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,938
But the realtor, he said, "You ain't
even close to the top of the market. ' '

135
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,619
We were gonna put up a white picket fence.

136
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,788
And, you know, the value would go up,
that's what, the value would go up.

137
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,128
Do you need a minute?

138
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,261
No. No. No. I don't need a minute.

139
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,567
Yeah. Yeah, I need a minute.

140
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,139
I don't know. I can't take this pain.

141
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,980
You good?

142
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,782
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

143
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,522
- They didn't see you?
- No. No, they didn't see me at all.

144
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,225
All right then. When I say go...

145
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,608
Get your hands in the air,
you necking devils!

146
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,870
This here's a stickup!

147
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,843
Hi, there, cowboy!

148
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,971
You. You Jezebel, you.

149
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,518
Swinging your big, beautiful bosoms
around at every man in town!

150
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,815
Oh, honey.
I got enough bosoms for everybody.

151
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,191
I'm looking at dead men.

152
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,426
Give me my boot knife.

153
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,328
Hand over my $500
and you'll never see me again.

154
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,203
- Kid, what about you?
- No, I wanna keep hanging out.

155
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,674
As a gang!

156
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,745
I mean, does he owe you any money?

157
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,442
I gave it all to that harlot
for a down payment on our dream house.

158
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,711
Pay my partner here
whatever the lady owes him

159
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,481
and, say, another $100
for his pain and suffering.

160
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,218
Oh, you haven't even seen
the start of pain and suffering.

161
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,388
Where's the money?

162
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,830
Go ahead. Shoot her.

163
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,294
It's in his safe.

164
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,434
I bet now you're gonna say
you forgot the combination.

165
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,803
Well, guess what? It don't matter,
because my partner here is a dentist!

166
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,806
Open it.

167
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,190
If you promise not to follow us,
I won't shoot you right now.

168
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,564
Cross my heart and hope to die.

169
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,398
Shit!

170
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,271
Darn it, Frisky!
I'm trying to make a getaway!

171
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,715
Son of a bitch!

172
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,566
He bit me!

173
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,163
God damn it, Cletus!

174
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,903
Now you see why I don't give you a raise?

175
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,674
You let those pig fuckers loose
to steal my retirement fund!

176
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,649
I was $1,000 away
from that Mexican sugar plantation!

177
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,812
$1,000 away
from ever seeing your fat ass again!

178
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,820
Oh, fuck!

179
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,492
I think I ate some bad chili.

180
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,225
What did I tell you about eating off a cart?

181
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,804
I'd shoot your sick ass right now,

182
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,535
but everybody in town's
coming to see you shit your pants!

183
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,234
God damn!

184
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,852
Oh, man, he did
bite the shit out of you, didn't he?

185
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,721
What the fuck are you doing, Cletus?

186
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,624
Oh, I'm sorry, Sheriff!
I don't know what come over me!

187
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,460
- Oh, it hurts! It hurts!
- Cletus, get a hold of yourself!

188
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,734
We gotta hang this fool and raise a posse,
you fucking...

189
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,076
You're gonna wanna put something on that.

190
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,323
- How much of a lead you reckon we got?
- A few hours. They'll be coming, though.

191
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,627
Well, in case they catch up,

192
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,462
I got Sparkles and I got Sunshine.

193
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,442
You name everything you own
something girly?

194
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:19,989
A pistol's gotta have a girl's name.

195
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,611
You don't walk around calling your gun Ed
or Darrell or Jimbo, okay?

196
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,682
That don't sound right.

197
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,383
I feel pretty good about old Henry here.

198
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,651
Yeah, I bet I can shoot anything
with my two twins

199
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,585
that you can with your stupid Henry.

200
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,385
Go ahead, set up a tin can.

201
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:38,191
We're in the middle of the virgin wilderness.
Where am I gonna find a tin can?

202
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,297
There's one.

203
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,792
Oh.

204
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,760
Just try to hit the can.

205
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,008
I was so close! Let me go again!

206
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,744
- Wait a minute.
- What?

207
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,377
We're making an awful lot of racket.

208
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,520
Oh, this was my idea.

209
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,503
I hope you don't think
that I'm a bad partner.

210
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,374
I'm really trying hard to be a good partner.

211
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,387
No, it's my fault.
I ain't quite as dumb as you.

212
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,465
"As dumb as you, partner. ' '

213
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:02,038
Ebenezer, can you please
stop ringing that fucking bell?

214
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:30,631
Do you give yourself over
to the mercy of Christ?

215
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,029
The Lord is my shepherd,

216
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,135
I shall not want.

217
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,213
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

218
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,874
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

219
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,883
He restoreth my soul.

220
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,180
Move it along, padre.

221
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,847
Thou anointest my head with oil,

222
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,050
my cup runneth over.

223
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,959
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me...

224
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,861
Amen! I'm a man of the cloth.

225
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,034
The villains who robbed
my place of business

226
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,072
have been gone since right before dawn!

227
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,166
Any man who wants to come with me
to hunt them down

228
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,438
gets his share in the reward!

229
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,343
We leave in one hour!

230
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,412
I'm in.
Count me in, too.

231
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,526
How well do you know this area?

232
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,635
I know this country
like the back of my hand.

233
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,099
What's the Colorado River,
about two days' ride?

234
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,401
Um...

235
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,550
Yep.

236
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,314
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

237
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:01,381
We'll ride together as far as the Colorado,
then we'll split up.

238
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,326
They'll be looking for two people, not one.

239
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,092
- Split up for good?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

240
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:12,033
I mean, it's been a pleasure and everything,

241
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,538
but we can't spend
the rest of our lives together.

242
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,165
But I thought we were partners.

243
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,370
I mean, I went through
a real hard time back there.

244
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,810
Real hard.

245
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,644
I mean, you were there for me, Elmer.

246
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,315
I'm just learning how to trust again.

247
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,521
I thought cowboys
were supposed to like being alone.

248
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,095
We do. We do.

249
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,624
We like it out here on the open range,
under the stars.

250
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,745
- Must have been a deer.
- Hope so.

251
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:01,410
'Cause Indians, they don't make noise.
They creep up on you, cut your throat.

252
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:08,049
Or sometimes, I hear they sneak up on you
and jab a spear in your belly,

253
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,220
stick you in the ground,
watch you wiggle like a bug.

254
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,198
Or sometimes, I hear they slide up
next to you, real quiet like,

255
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:20,260
with a bag with a rattlesnake in it,
with the rattler broken off,

256
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,000
and they throw the bag over your head.

257
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,611
- Or sometimes...
- For Christ's sake, kid. Go to sleep.

258
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,450
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep
with all that terrible stuff in my head.

259
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,893
Hey, Elmer?

260
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:51,794
What?

261
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,705
You got any britches on?

262
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,170
No, I ain't got any britches on.

263
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,903
Yeah, me, neither.

264
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,311
I'm gonna try to talk to her.

265
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,548
- How!
- How.

266
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:15,092
- Oh, yeah. This is working.
- I think she knows English, Luke.

267
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,423
You speak White Man?

268
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,101
Speak White Man fluently.

269
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,194
Oh, darn, she's good.

270
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,206
I don't even know
what that last word means.

271
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,641
We friend.

272
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,704
Where'd you get the money?

273
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,186
We're US Marshals.
We're transporting it to Nevada City.

274
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,348
And if you let us go,
no harm will come to you.

275
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,493
Fine, we stole it.

276
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,856
Who'd you steal it from?

277
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:56,195
Sheriff from a town a ways back.
Fellow named Claypool, he's not a nice man.

278
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:00,704
In fact, I'd bet everything in those bags
he's on his way here now with a posse.

279
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,830
His deputy's a dirt miner.

280
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,007
How come you speak
such good English, anyway?

281
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:12,447
- I went to boarding school in New York.
- I've been to New York.

282
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,950
- I didn't like it.
- Terrible place.

283
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,886
- Good Chinese, though.
- Yeah, but crowded.

284
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,989
Well...

285
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,790
Wait, wait. Please, don't leave!
You can have the money, just cut us loose.

286
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,059
What's that say?

287
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,871
"US Army. ' '

288
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,310
That is our nation's armed forces.

289
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,139
- I'm a deserter!
- What do you want, a medal?

290
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,775
A deserter?

291
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,252
You stinking coward!
I never would have thought that!

292
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,845
My partner, a deserter!

293
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,119
It's not what you think, kid. It's no parade.

294
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,318
You know what it is.

295
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,692
I've seen nations driven off their land,
people killed in cold blood.

296
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,790
I've done some bad things, I have,
but I quit doing them.

297
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,165
And he's just a brokenhearted cowboy

298
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,171
that don't know his ass
from a bag of sweet potatoes.

299
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,438
What is that, the same as yams?

300
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,905
Don't leave us here to die.

301
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,892
There are three of them now.

302
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,464
- How can you tell?
- The smell!

303
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,070
Oh, what is that?

304
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,940
Pumpkin, cinnamon.

305
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,311
Yeah. Yeah, spicy.

306
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,852
- Yet, it's somehow meaty at the same time.
- Yeah.

307
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,013
Hey, Sheriff? Are you all okay?

308
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,417
It smells like

309
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,290
a happy childhood I never did have.

310
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,260
Oh, God, what is that?

311
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,723
It's a girl!

312
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,462
Oh, damn.

313
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,370
Never knew they smelled so delicious.

314
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:20,035
Yeah. Makes you kind of hungry, don't it?

315
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,544
I could eat a horse.

316
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,171
We gotta ride those, fuck-tard!

317
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,193
No! No! No!

318
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,837
No! No! Please! Please!

319
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,260
Oh, he's close to me.

320
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,662
The Rapture is coming.

321
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,796
Judgment day! Judgment day!

322
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,867
Well, then we'd better break out
the good stuff.

323
00:32:57,868 --> 00:32:59,970
You'd better pay heed, little sister.

324
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,707
The four horsemen ride.
The dead, they walk among us.

325
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,079
Oh, God, it was true!

326
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,613
See?

327
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,541
Bet you wish I would have left you
for that mean sheriff, huh?

328
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,944
I'll take a blistered ass
over a bullet any day.

329
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,415
Oh, well, it's the back of my balls
I'd be worried about.

330
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,952
Yeah, they're getting pretty raw.

331
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,921
Where are you taking us, anyway?

332
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,388
I haven't decided.

333
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,152
Where are your people?

334
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,961
I don't have any people.

335
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,863
What the hell are you doing out here, sister?

336
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,299
There are army units
that'll shoot you on sight.

337
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,163
I know.

338
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,829
Geronimo was my uncle.

339
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,168
- You're famous?
- Shut up, Luke.

340
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,171
Oh, man, my nose itches so bad.

341
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,611
When I was five years old,
missionaries killed my parents.

342
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,982
They brought me back East
as their pet savage to civilize me.

343
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,182
And I learned how their army
hunted my uncle like an animal.

344
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,522
Till a unit cornered him about a year ago
and he threw himself off a cliff.

345
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,926
- He made an Injun curse on all white people.
- Yeah. Well, you're not dead yet.

346
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,330
It's supposed to be
the worstest bad medicine ever.

347
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:08,297
- What, you guys don't believe in curses?
- Not really.

348
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,271
Sorry, kid.

349
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,807
That's ignorant.

350
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:16,642
I'm gonna kill every one of those soldiers
if it takes me the rest of my life.

351
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,145
What if I told you
I know where that unit's garrisoned?

352
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,220
How would you know that?

353
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,686
That's where we were headed
when I deserted.

354
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,555
I still can't believe you did that.

355
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,127
It's bullshit.

356
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,030
I can get you close.

357
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,533
Oh, God! My nose, it itches so much!

358
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,531
You fuck with me and I will kill you.

359
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,205
Oh! Thank you.

360
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,972
- Ow.
- Luke.

361
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,086
Look, I can't feel my hands!

362
00:35:56,187 --> 00:36:00,681
I have to apologize for my friend.
He's not too smart.

363
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,588
He's kind of cute, though.

364
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,287
Yeah, he does have that going for him.

365
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,193
I take it your name's Elmer?

366
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,596
- Yep. What's yours?
- Sue.

367
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,333
Like, Sioux Indian?

368
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,961
No. Like Susan.

369
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,935
Like Susan Indian?

370
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,175
Susan, meet Luke.

371
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,118
Elmer?

372
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,659
Yeah?

373
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,528
- You think we could trust her?
- Well, she just decided not to kill us.

374
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,752
All right. All right.
I was just asking your opinion

375
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:46,229
because I respect you as my partner and all.

376
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:50,535
She's awful pretty, though, ain't she?
For an Indian, I mean.

377
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,667
For an Indian. Plus, she thinks you're cute.

378
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,507
You think she really meant that?

379
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,708
Maybe she's just saying it.

380
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,547
I don't know, Luke.
You can't ever tell with an Indian.

381
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,417
Heck, I can't even tell with real people.

382
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,015
Hey!

383
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,421
They're behind us. We gotta get down.

384
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,105
Hey, I got an idea.

385
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,672
Spit it out, kid.

386
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,580
What if we all bushwhack them?

387
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,950
We ride up through that canyon.

388
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,219
You set up on one side with your rifle,
I'll set up on the other with my bow.

389
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,261
And I'll jump up from behind a bush
with my six-shooters and yell,

390
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,457
"Stick 'em up
or I'll blow you all to tarnation. ' '

391
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,884
Or, "I'll shoot you so full of holes,

392
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,765
"ain't nobody
gonna use your hide for nothing,

393
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,895
"especially not for toting water. ' '

394
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,305
- Or...
- All right, so you'll bore them to death.

395
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,309
I don't have to shoot them, do I?

396
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,811
Why not? They're coming to kill you.

397
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:07,145
All right, we'll shoot them if we have to.
I'd rather just send them home.

398
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,125
You know, I'm starting to think
that you two are a couple of ladybugs.

399
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:12,546
No, I'm a cowboy. He's a dentist.

400
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,893
I've seen enough killing.

401
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,191
I ain't seen none of it actually,
but I don't want to see it.

402
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,962
All right. Fine.
I'll save it for your nation's armed forces.

403
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,629
- We got a plan?
- We got a plan.

404
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,298
Nice work, kid.

405
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,608
- Hey, Sue?
- Yeah.

406
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,319
There's something I want to give you.
You know, in case we don't make it.

407
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,951
It's beautiful.

408
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,092
Open it.

409
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,542
Thank you.

410
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,432
I hope they know where they're going.

411
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,032
Something smells good out there.

412
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,480
Hey, where'd that come from?

413
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,682
Reach for the sky
or you'll be so peppered with lead,

414
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,683
I could serve you for dinner
with carrots and taters and no pie!

415
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,861
I said, reach for the sky...

416
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,094
Hey!

417
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,736
That's what you get
when you mess with me and my girls!

418
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,242
What the hell's going on?

419
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,527
- They all got the Geronimos!
- Shoot them in the head!

420
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,153
Fuck that! Run!

421
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,876
Ain't nobody here.

422
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:32,881
Good. We need supplies.
Get food, matches, blankets, bullets.

423
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,128
Are y'all gonna admit
I was right about the curse?

424
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,860
Yeah, they have it.

425
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,968
Great, they've got the Geronimos.
What I want to know is how we kill them.

426
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:56,154
You can't kill them,
that's the whole point, dummy!

427
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:57,670
No, maybe we can.

428
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,141
Undo the bad medicine
with a counter-curse?

429
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:04,647
Build a sweat lodge and purify our spirits
by hitting each other with sticks?

430
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,317
No, the medicine can't be undone,

431
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,918
but the carriers lose their power
if you shoot them in the head.

432
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,420
- How do you know?
- My uncle told me when I was little.

433
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,184
I thought it was just a story.

434
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,816
That is a heck of a story to tell a kid!

435
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,327
Wasn't there anything about a bunny

436
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,757
or a train with good self-esteem
or anything?

437
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,784
If they bite you
or wound you with their hands,

438
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,705
they give it to you
and you become one of them.

439
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:25,599
You do not want that.

440
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,171
I sure as heck don't.

441
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,036
I just feel really bad
about robbing these people.

442
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,042
You're not robbing them.
You're their new favorite customer.

443
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,780
Get away, dog! Get away!

444
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,454
Why are you poking me, Sue?

445
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,993
I ain't Sue. You were the one poking me.

446
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,561
Where's Sue?

447
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,865
Probably down at the spring.

448
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,958
I'm gonna get some water.

449
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,030
Sorry.

450
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,868
Here, fill that up.

451
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,127
Sorry!

452
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,561
You don't look that sorry.

453
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,394
I'm not that sorry.

454
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,233
Actually, I'm not sorry at all.

455
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,166
Well, are you just gonna stand there
staring at me?

456
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,244
Would that be all right?

457
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,811
It'd be better if you got in here with me.

458
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,329
Less than a day's ride that way, right, kid?

459
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:15,765
Uh...

460
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,861
Yeah, I think so.

461
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,697
What do you mean, you think so?

462
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:24,098
I thought you knew this country
like the back of your hand.

463
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,459
Well, that's an expression, Elmer.

464
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,926
I mean, how well do you really know
the back of your hand?

465
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:31,352
Not as well as you're gonna get to know it
if you don't give me a straight answer.

466
00:47:31,353 --> 00:47:33,343
Hey! Stop it, both of you.

467
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,214
The Colorado has to be that way
because that way is west.

468
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,255
You wait a minute.

469
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,814
You have at least been there, right, kid?
The Colorado?

470
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:46,953
Well, I haven't been there personally, no,
but, you know, I have seen it on a map.

471
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,032
You've seen it on a map?

472
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,459
What about you? You been there?
The Colorado?

473
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:58,940
Well, yeah, when I was little,
but at this point I'm from New York.

474
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,242
If you're from New York,
how come you can ride a horse

475
00:48:01,243 --> 00:48:03,840
and shoot a bow and arrow so good?

476
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,383
Because at boarding school
they had activities.

477
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,112
Riding, archery, fencing.

478
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,714
Listen, I still want to kill all those
soldiers, but I think I'll take a rain check.

479
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:18,488
Right now I want to get as far away
as possible from that posse of yours.

480
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,062
I heard that.

481
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,163
Let's ride. This way.

482
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,797
But that's the same way
I've been saying all along, Elmer.

483
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:24,545
Shit-fire. Ain't no bullets!

484
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,273
Why are we at the Grand Canyon?

485
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,073
The Colorado River
is at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

486
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,307
Is this news to both of you?

487
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,682
Geography wasn't my thing.

488
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,017
More of an arts and music guy.

489
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,082
I was remedial.

490
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,127
Yeah, but everybody knows
that the Colorado River

491
00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:07,826
is at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

492
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,764
I thought you were taking me
to a fort at a crossing.

493
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,061
Sue, please don't yell.

494
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,169
He's the one that told you about
the army and the fort and all that stuff.

495
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,074
That was the first time I ever heard of it.

496
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,758
- You were lying?
- No, I wasn't lying.

497
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:23,839
He's the one that's supposed to know
this country like the back of his hand.

498
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:27,025
I figured once we found the Colorado,
it's either left or right to the fort.

499
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:28,461
Personally, I was gonna go straight

500
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:31,546
and let you take it from there with
your suicide plot against the US Army.

501
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,590
I should have left you two for the cursed.

502
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,731
It's your crazy Uncle Geronimo
who set them loose.

503
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,872
So I don't see how either one of us
is to blame for our problems right now.

504
00:51:39,873 --> 00:51:42,054
You want to blame me for my uncle's curse?

505
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,032
I'm not the one
that drove him off a cliff, soldier.

506
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,003
And if I hadn't found you two idiots,
they would have.

507
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,438
I hope this plague
kills all of you white people.

508
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,305
I ain't that big a fan
of white people, either, sister.

509
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,311
At least we've got fucking wheels.

510
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,472
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

511
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:01,517
Wheels! The basic benchmark of civilization.

512
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,418
When you Indians are supposed to be
so great and wise and everything,

513
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:06,179
and I got sympathy for your situation, I do,

514
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,553
but you'd still be dragging
everything around on the ground

515
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:10,234
if we hadn't brung wheels to this country.

516
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:13,275
And horses! Fucking Spanish brought you
your fucking horses. You know that?

517
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,876
Before they got here,
you was just a bunch of savages in diapers

518
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:18,099
dragging your shit around
on sticks and blankets.

519
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,567
Well, that is so ignorant!

520
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,550
Seems like you like our guns
pretty well, too,

521
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:24,711
and I ain't even gonna start
with the firewater shit.

522
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:28,107
Did you invent the wheel, Elmer?
No, you didn't.

523
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,146
But you're going to take personal credit
for Western civilization.

524
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,842
Your monkey ancestors
happened to be born in an area

525
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,113
with abundant founder crops,
big slow ruminants,

526
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,053
and a lateral continental axis
that allowed the development

527
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,785
of agriculture, writing
and maritime technology.

528
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,020
Not to mention cross-species plagues,

529
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,460
which were the real weapons
of European conquest.

530
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,692
So you invented smallpox.
Nice going, dick!

531
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,999
- Monkey ancestors?
- Oh, Jesus Christ! Read a book!

532
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,308
What the hell kind of crazy book
is that shit in?

533
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,838
Elmer Winslow!
You put your hands in the air.

534
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,042
We got you covered from six positions,
you deserting son of a bitch!

535
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,016
We got him!
Nowhere to go now!

536
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,178
We got you dead to rights!

537
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,368
Keep them hands in the air!

538
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:46,346
Oh, God! Damn, that hurt!

539
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,519
Oh, shoot.

540
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:29,899
Oh!

541
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,697
Oh, shoo, shoo. Go away.

542
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,813
Meat!

543
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,919
Oh, God, they're everywhere.

544
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,463
Oh!

545
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,261
You people know me!

546
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,231
I want fingers!

547
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,734
You know me.

548
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,786
Go, jailbird.

549
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,082
Okay, people, keep your pace up.

550
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,395
I'm telling you, Kermit,

551
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:16,199
you got worse problems
than me running off.

552
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,106
There's some bad medicine
going around here.

553
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,235
You tell it to the captain, Winslow.

554
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:23,710
You know he always lets people have
a few last words before the firing squad.

555
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:27,874
He ain't lying, mister.
Them Geronimonsters are hot on our trail!

556
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,549
They track by scent, like wolves.

557
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,213
If you want to get away from them,
we have to cross the river.

558
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,656
- All right, now you're just making shit up.
- No, I'm not.

559
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,625
I just remembered that. They track by scent.

560
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,286
Winslow!

561
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,025
How do you do it?
First you steal our money...

562
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,399
I won your money fair and square.
You're just a bunch of shitty card players.

563
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,132
First you steal our money,

564
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,505
and then, three weeks later,
you already got $10,000 more,

565
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,271
a crazy squaw and a pet cowpoke.

566
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,312
"Squaw" is a really offensive term.

567
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,974
And I don't appreciate
being called nobody's pet.

568
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,244
Well, you're gonna get shot like a dog,
little bucko,

569
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,343
so you might as well get used to it.

570
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,014
See, the captain,
he don't like deserters or Indians.

571
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,591
You're keeping company with one of each.

572
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:10,920
Open up!

573
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,467
I see I've been missing out
on some good times.

574
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,810
No place like home.

575
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,054
Captain!

576
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,996
I found something I think you're gonna like.

577
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,270
Geronimonsters!

578
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,536
Hurry!

579
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,384
- Get my boot knife.
- Why didn't I think of that?

580
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,674
I need a gun.

581
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,276
There's one.

582
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,345
It has to be in the head.

583
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,387
Don't you dare shoot my partner!

584
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,895
No!

585
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,112
Cletus, you gotta start
keeping track of your gun.

586
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,046
Get out!

587
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,857
Grab Kermit's rifle!

588
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:36,965
Elmer!

589
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,406
God damn it!

590
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,837
I thought you said
we just had to shoot them in the head!

591
00:59:49,938 --> 00:59:51,898
How should I know?
Maybe you have to cut it off.

592
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:52,979
But you said...

593
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,454
God! Darn!

594
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,535
How we gonna get out of here?

595
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:18,169
Frisky? Frisky!

596
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,681
Frisky's gone to horsy heaven.
We'll say a few words later.

597
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:23,613
You monsters! I loved Frisky!

598
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,314
He was the best damn horse
in the whole world and you ate him!

599
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,342
Wait. We don't have to get out of here.
We have to get them out of here.

600
01:00:29,343 --> 01:00:32,343
- How we gonna get them to leave?
- She's right. This place is defensible.

601
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,455
We make them chase us.
Elmer, get the gate. Go!

602
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,812
Come on, let's go!

603
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,889
You'd better let us back in!

604
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,548
Come back here.

605
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,623
Just wanna give you a little licking.

606
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,892
God damn it! Please, put me down!

607
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,944
Pole on!

608
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,043
Pole!

609
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,604
Go! Go! Go away!

610
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,339
- Go over there!
- Oh, God.

611
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,671
Shoo! Skit! Skedaddle!

612
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,713
I don't believe that's gonna do the trick.

613
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,276
My uncle said nothing
will make them abandon their prey.

614
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,477
Well, he wasn't right
about shooting them in the head.

615
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,466
Yeah, I put enough lead in old Cletus' skull
to start a pencil factory,

616
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:08,227
and he was still giving out piggyback rides.

617
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,985
Oh, I said maybe you have to cut it off.

618
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,493
You can't just make up new rules
whenever you feel like it.

619
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,963
So I guess you guys don't wanna hear
how I also remembered

620
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,163
how you can cure yourself
if you get the curse.

621
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,166
Oh, that we wanna hear.

622
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,758
I'm listening.

623
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,838
You can cure yourself of the bad medicine

624
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,637
by eating the living flesh
of the medicine man who made it.

625
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,202
- Your uncle's dead.
- Yeah.

626
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,748
- So that doesn't help.
- No.

627
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,730
So what's the point of remembering
something if it doesn't do any good?

628
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:39,031
- I didn't say it would do any good.
- You implied it.

629
01:02:39,032 --> 01:02:40,979
All right! Let's not fight, y'all.

630
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,050
We're all gonna starve
or have our brains eaten,

631
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,186
we might as well be friends.

632
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,528
Are you crying?

633
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,158
No, I'm a cowboy. Cowboys don't cry.

634
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,339
Is he okay?

635
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,067
He's been through a hard time.

636
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,941
Look,

637
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,344
I wanted to tell you,

638
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,948
I'm sorry about the wheels and everything.

639
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,052
I know.

640
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,462
I'm gonna go.

641
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,793
Send down some sawbones.

642
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,197
What are you looking at?

643
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,738
Why don't y'all just eat each other?

644
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,055
Stop it. Stop it.

645
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:00,763
Go away!

646
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,466
- It's me.
- I know it's you.

647
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,875
Elmer wouldn't bother a feller
at a time like this.

648
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,778
I'm not trying to bother you.
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

649
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:17,182
I'm not okay, okay? I'm not!

650
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,516
I'm not okay, okay?

651
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:32,033
- You know, we're all scared.
- I'm not scared.

652
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,029
You think I'm crying because I'm scared?

653
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,764
That's embarrassing.

654
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,036
Well, then, what's the matter?

655
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,138
Frisky.

656
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:48,540
Frisky's what's the matter.
I just can't believe he's gone.

657
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,520
Do you still have my locket?

658
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,925
I mean your locket, the one I gave you?

659
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,657
Yeah, of course I still have the locket.

660
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,764
Could I see it?

661
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,768
Yeah, you can have it back if you want.

662
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:12,500
No, no, I don't want it back.
I just want to see it for a minute.

663
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:13,973
Okay, sure.

664
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:39,293
Sue, you are the sweetest Indian girl
I have ever met.

665
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,303
I suppose you've met a lot of Indian girls.

666
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,636
No, you're the first.

667
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,902
That didn't come out right.

668
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,105
What I'm trying to say...

669
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,977
Jump on the door!

670
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,578
Jump on the door! Jump on the door!

671
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,998
So, where were we?

672
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,172
Oh, my God! No way!

673
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,346
You need a light?

674
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,117
Yeah, I'd be much obliged.

675
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:40,059
Even though you're a cheater,
I propose we make one last deal.

676
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,652
What you got in mind?

677
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,789
You pay back what you owe

678
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:49,237
and I'll let you smoke that cigarette
while you watch me eat your eyeballs.

679
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:54,435
That's why you're lousy at cards, Kermit.

680
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,841
You don't think ahead.

681
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,971
How's that?

682
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,346
If you eat my eyeballs,
I can't watch you eat them.

683
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:21,027
We just smashed the head off one
in the cellar.

684
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,764
It was disgusting.

685
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,965
Hey, we haven't eaten in about, what?
A whole day?

686
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,133
How about we mix up some grub, you know?

687
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,212
Make us one of those
last tasty supper meal things

688
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,076
down at the pot-bellied stove in the yard?

689
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,747
I got a better idea.

690
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,982
Hey, Sue!

691
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,814
God damn it, Cletus!
What are you doing out there?

692
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,353
Making a 10-pound ass baby?

693
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,184
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

694
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,286
I was trying to pee.

695
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:20,089
How did that go, genius?
You figure it all out?

696
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:24,292
I think that thing we got
might be worse than what we thought.

697
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:28,936
Why the fuck are you handing me
a dead baby field mouse?

698
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,563
It ain't a dead baby field mouse!

699
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,676
You just made me touch your penis!
Men have died for less!

700
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,974
I know!

701
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,010
Fuck!

702
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,486
What the fuck are we gonna do
about my legs?

703
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,891
All right, Sue, go search the captain's
office for cutlery, small metal objects.

704
01:08:56,999 --> 01:09:00,162
- Knives, forks, nails, anything like that.
- Okay.

705
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,232
All right, so, what's the plan?

706
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,934
- You ever heard of a blunderbuss?
- No.

707
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:12,342
It's an early short-range weapon,
a primitive wide-mouth shotgun.

708
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:17,044
You pack your powder in there and dump in
a bunch of tacks or whatever and boom.

709
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,520
Doesn't go very far
but you got a target radius of about 10 feet.

710
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:25,082
Okay. What's that gotta do
with this here stove?

711
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,822
We're making a really big blunderbuss.

712
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,136
Luke! Elmer! There's still one in here!

713
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,239
You hear something?

714
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:48,078
I hear them dummies out there
hollering for brains.

715
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,844
I thought I heard something.

716
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,524
What's she doing in there, shoeing a horse?

717
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,975
- She found some silverware, at least.
- A little help!

718
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,545
There's still one in there.

719
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,189
Open the door!

720
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,412
You don't want to get serious with a girl
who can fight like that.

721
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:40,162
Why not?

722
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,897
- Thanks for the help.
- We were trying to get in.

723
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,060
- Looks like he's really dead.
- Yeah, sure does.

724
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,734
Okay, so... Swords.

725
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,242
I'm gonna need that.

726
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,625
I think it's full.

727
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,665
Is that Frisky's leg?

728
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,765
It was the right size.

729
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,340
How dare you?

730
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,709
I'm sorry if it was disrespectful.

731
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,839
I thought he'd want to help.

732
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,740
Yeah.

733
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,814
I guess he would have wanted that.

734
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,388
All right, I'm gonna get some more swords.

735
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:09,649
All right.

736
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:14,320
When they bust through that gate,
we'll have one shot with the blunderbuss.

737
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,762
That building back there
is our last line of defense.

738
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,891
- Can I fire the blunderbuss?
- Can you follow directions?

739
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,300
Yes, I can follow directions, Mr. Bossy.

740
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:25,396
All right, then you can fire the blunderbuss.

741
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,440
When that cross-beam breaks, light the fuse.

742
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,775
Not much longer.

743
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,438
Elmer?

744
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,016
Damn it, Luke!

745
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,757
Swords!

746
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:20,419
- My God.
- I'll see you in hell, Winslow.

747
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,297
At least they're still dead.

748
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,034
That's a comfort.

749
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,077
And you know what else?
We're all gonna die rich.

750
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,942
This isn't over yet.

751
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:40,741
It's over.

752
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,784
No, it ain't. It ain't over till we're dead.

753
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:45,948
We can go down the trap door.

754
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,648
Maybe there's a tunnel
that leads outside the fort.

755
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,591
That'll be great, kid.
You find the tunnel to freedom.

756
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,457
I'm gonna get drunk.

757
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,525
Come on, let's go!

758
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,661
Elmer, let's go!

759
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,297
Take the money!

760
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:06,840
Forget about the money!

761
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,467
- Elmer told me to take the money.
- Forget the money!

762
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,978
That's what I said! Come on, Elmer!

763
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:22,150
- You look like shit, Claypool.
- I'm still pretty on the inside.

764
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,350
We're gonna see about that.

765
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,660
Damn it, kid.

766
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,121
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

767
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,988
We're in a basement full of ordnance.

768
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,323
- So, this ain't a tunnel?
- Nope.

769
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,555
- Here they come.
- I guess you were right all along, Elmer.

770
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:08,500
If we're gonna die,
we might as well take them all with us.

771
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,764
Sue, I couldn't tell you before.

772
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,037
I love you.

773
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:20,308
I wish I could marry you.
I wish I could have your half-breed babies.

774
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,741
You, too, Elmer.

775
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,149
I don't want to marry you.

776
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,882
I just wish
we could keep on being partners forever.

777
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,981
Wait a minute.

778
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,390
Your matches kept going out.

779
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,614
Yeah. Well, I can't seem
to get a break around here,

780
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,063
even on my last day on earth.

781
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,190
He means your matches keep going out,
which means there's wind in here.

782
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,599
- I can feel it.
- We're in your tunnel.

783
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,023
Quick, feel along the walls.
There's gotta be an opening.

784
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,199
You guys are so darn smart.

785
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,643
I found it!

786
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,614
It's back there behind those sacks.

787
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,675
I smell freedom.

788
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,478
- Come on!
- You go.

789
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:02,682
- No, I am not leaving without you! Come on!
- Go!

790
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,990
You, too.

791
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,425
- Are you sure?
- Run.

792
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,291
Go!

793
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,372
Shit.

794
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:58,011
- They got him!
- Elmer?

795
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,433
We have to get out of here.
He's gonna blow the ordnance.

796
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,848
No, no, no. It can't be over.
They can't have gotten him.

797
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,512
If you don't want him to die for nothing,
we have to move.

798
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:34,143
She told me they got you.
I had to see for myself.

799
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,546
So, light the fuse, kid. Hurry!

800
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,249
I can't hold on.

801
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,502
Thanks, amigo.

802
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,654
How could you, Elmer?

803
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:20,652
I couldn't help myself, kid.

804
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:24,391
And besides,
you'll thank me in a few minutes.

805
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:27,195
Being dead feels better than you think.

806
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:39,713
- Oh, God, Elmer. I'm so scared.
- Don't be such a pussy.

807
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,315
Cletus!

808
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,448
We're on the same team now. The bad guys.

809
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,154
But I still think you're an asshole.

810
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,431
You starting to feel hungry, kid?

811
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,339
- Hungry for some brains?
- Yeah. Yeah.

812
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:10,638
All right.

813
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,648
Let's go find that sassy squaw
and eat her from the inside out.

814
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,089
Give me my money!

815
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,854
It's all right there.

816
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,862
I was gonna go to Mexico.

817
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:07,060
I was gonna drink rum
and have a house on the beach!

818
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:10,002
I was gonna own slaves, God damn it!

819
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:14,599
I'm sorry that's not gonna work out for you,
but all your money's right there.

820
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,475
Give it to me now!

821
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,532
I didn't think you made it.

822
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,734
You were right about Elmer.

823
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,279
They got him.

824
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,508
What?

825
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,183
Is there something on my face?

826
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,516
Uh-huh.

827
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,458
Did I get it?

828
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,527
Uh-uh.

829
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:25,005
How you doing, kid?
I still feel kind of funny.

830
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,331
Just don't cry anymore.

831
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,638
I can cry if I want to. I've been through...

832
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,305
I know you've been through a hard time,

833
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,644
but when you cry,
it makes me uncomfortable.

834
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:38,515
Well, maybe it's time you get in better touch
with your emotions, Elmer.

835
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,918
Maybe it is.

836
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,547
I've lost two women and a horse
in the last few days.

837
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:46,684
That is some pretty emotional stuff.

838
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,194
True.

839
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:51,493
Not to mention,
I thought it was over for the gang.

840
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,659
When did you figure it out?

841
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:57,863
"The living flesh of the medicine man
is the only cure. ' '

842
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,874
As soon as she said that,
I figured we got a chance.

843
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,773
Worse came to worse.

844
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,736
I still got that taste in my mouth.

845
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,119
Molasses?

846
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,711
Something like that. It's like a...

847
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,491
It's like a cinnamon.

848
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,426
- Gingerbread.
- Yeah. It's like gingerbread.

849
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,762
That's a good new name for her horse.

850
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,769
- Gingerbread?
- Yeah. Gingerbread.

851
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,966
- I like it.
- I like it, too.

852
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:42,780
Darn it, Gingerbread!
I'm trying to ride off into the sunset!

853
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,144
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

854
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,988
- We missed you, Daddy.
- I missed you, too.

855
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,669
Come on, Molly.

856
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:04,985
Marker.

857
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:09,989
Nose boogers?

858
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,395
And...

859
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,466
- Sorry.
- Cut!

860
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,529
- Sorry.
- Cut.

861
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,269
If you don't want him to die for nothing,
we have to move!

862
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,276
Cut!
Cut!

863
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,621
If you don't want him to die for nothing,
we have to...

864
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:30,245
Why are you laughing?

865
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,887
Put up your... Fuck! Shit.

866
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:34,955
What does that mean?

867
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,158
- Just pretend they're off.
- All right.

868
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,896
- Grab that rifle.
- Shoot yourself.

869
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,331
All right, cut.

870
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,272
- Sorry.
- Her top broke.

871
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,773
- My top broke.
- We got it from here.

872
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,036
These.

873
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,842
- Be careful.
- I'm okay. Don't ruin the moment.

874
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:04,162
You don't want to get serious with a girl
who can fight like that.

875
01:27:04,163 --> 01:27:06,149
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're gay.

876
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:10,383
- Classic.
- One more, one more.

877
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:12,186
Still rolling, guys, come on.

878
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,031
Ow!

879
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:18,524
I don't like this.

880
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:23,404
This is good 'cause I didn't eat much
last night, so my... I look good.

881
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:28,442
That feels better.

882
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,979
Coffee and man's sweat. Caffeine and balls.

883
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,308
- I hate you.
- Shut up.

884
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,309
We are partners now, right?

885
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,884
I mean, we just broke out of jail and all.

886
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:43,185
I mean, we're practically outlaw guys.

887
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,589
- Fuck. Sorry.
- Okay. Cut!

888
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,566
Okay, cut.

889
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,203
- Chris!
- What?

890
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,102
Cut!
Shut up!

891
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,887
You don't want to get serious with a girl
who can fight like that.

892
01:28:01,888 --> 01:28:02,704
Why not?

893
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:07,170
Cut. All right, that was cool.

894
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,476
Good job, Kattan!
