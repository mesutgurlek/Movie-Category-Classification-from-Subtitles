1
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:49,631
<i>Out West where men were brave and bold</i>

2
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,256
<i>The most exciting story told</i>

3
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,043
<i>Is all about a stranger
Who lived a life of danger</i>

4
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,804
<i>And he loved that shining gold</i>

5
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:00,927
<i>Jesse James was his name</i>

6
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,955
<i>Jesse James was his name</i>

7
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:08,275
<i>Let me tell you now Before
a guy could wink his eye</i>

8
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:12,122
<i>He'd rob the stage as it went by</i>

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,645
<i>And just as sure as Hades
He'd kiss the lovely ladies</i>

10
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:17,478
<i>And you ought to hear him sigh</i>

11
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,805
<i>Jesse James was his name</i>

12
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,362
<i>Jesse James was his name</i>

13
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:26,819
<i>Oh, yeah, well, a
trigger-happy guy was he</i>

14
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:30,642
<i>As fast as any guy could be</i>

15
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,994
<i>I'll lay you two to one, man</i>

16
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,653
<i>Not another gunman</i>

17
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,984
<i>Was half as fast as he</i>

18
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,909
<i>Jesse James was his name</i>

19
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,230
<i>He made a lot of friends
But there the story ends</i>

20
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:46,744
<i>'Cause all good gunmen die</i>

21
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:53,599
<i>Jesse James was his name Was his name</i>

22
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,565
<i>The wealth and might
that is America today</i>

23
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:05,358
<i>is reflected in its farms, its
factories, its banking institutions</i>

24
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,817
<i>and certainly in its various
mammoth insurance companies.</i>

25
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:13,927
<i>These gigantic corporations owned by
millions of stockholders and policy holders</i>

26
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,613
<i>have, since the beginning of our country,
been an integral part of our life.</i>

27
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:22,273
<i>Untold thousands of Americans
have received their educations</i>

28
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,933
<i>through the benefits
of insurance policies.</i>

29
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:29,113
<i>Millions of American families have
been raised partially, or entirely,</i>

30
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:31,771
<i>on a monthly check from
their insurance company,</i>

31
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:35,527
<i>and the history of the expansion of
these institutions could almost be</i>

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,681
<i>the history of the
expansion of America itself.</i>

33
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:43,368
<i>But, vast as the resources and holdings
of these mighty companies are today,</i>

34
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:46,789
<i>each is the result of
great pioneering courage</i>

35
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,683
<i>and perseverance of
these great founders.</i>

36
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:53,438
<i>And who deserves much of the credit
for the evolution of these companies</i>

37
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:56,489
<i>from their simple beginnings
into their present size?</i>

38
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:59,283
<i>It is no one but
that almost forgotten,</i>

39
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:01,975
<i>hardworking door-to-door
insurance salesman,</i>

40
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,867
<i>to whom we respectfully
dedicate this picture.</i>

41
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,451
<i>The time is the early 1880s.</i>

42
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,885
<i>The place is New York City.</i>

43
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,067
<i>The occasion is a sales
meeting of the employees</i>

44
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:16,296
<i>of the Plymouth Rock
Insurance Company.</i>

45
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,743
Yes. Now, may I have the
other charts, Miss Raskin?

46
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:25,695
Let's see how you other
gentlemen have done.

47
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:31,320
Crimshaw. Oh, yes, yes.

48
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:37,130
You've done an
admirable job, Crimshaw.

49
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:40,285
You dipped a little there in May,
but I see you bounced back up,

50
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,044
and you'll soon have a
leg on the gold watch.

51
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,042
Yes.

52
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,859
Now...

53
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,380
Well. Hastings! You're
right up there, aren't you?

54
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:58,924
You keep this up and you're well on your
way to that free weekend at Coney Island.

55
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,763
Why, this is amazing.

56
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,328
Oh.

57
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,502
Farnsworth.

58
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,273
Farnsworth, when are you
ever gonna sell a policy?

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,058
May I remind you, sir,
that just two weeks ago,

60
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:33,180
I turned in a signed policy
for a Miss Elfrida Bennett?

61
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,941
Which was rejected.

62
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,805
On a medical technicality.

63
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,668
Yes, a slight technicality.

64
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,496
When the doctor arrived to
examine her, she was dead.

65
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,580
Well, we've got to
get a faster doctor.

66
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:47,209
A 30-year endowment policy
on a woman 98 years old.

67
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,602
Well, she lied about her age.

68
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,526
And much as I dislike
tooting my own horn, sir,

69
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:56,481
I was solely responsible for the sale
of Plymouth Rock's first marine policy,

70
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,600
<i>issued on the new schooner Nantucket.</i>

71
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:01,462
Please, please, don't
remind me of that launching.

72
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,187
I can still see the bubbles.

73
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,118
How did I know the anchor
was heavier than the boat?

74
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,705
Milford, I've given
this a lot of thought,

75
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,661
and I think this company can
get along very well without you.

76
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:15,680
Turn in your key to the washroom.

77
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:18,276
Well, can't I even have
visiting privileges?

78
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:20,362
Farnsworth, I'm curious.

79
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:24,148
What do you expect to achieve
with such crass ineptitude,

80
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:29,673
such utter incompetence,
such colossal stupidity?

81
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,163
Well, I was hoping to
become your assistant.

82
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:58,184
Sorry you couldn't get in yesterday,
Milford. We all missed your nickel.

83
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,770
Charlie, have you thought
any more about that insurance?

84
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,233
Some other time.

85
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,348
Sullivan beat Gentleman
Jim? He hasn't a chance.

86
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:10,537
Yeah? That's what they said when they
matched him up against Paddy Ryan.

87
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,763
Well, you can see their legs
clear up to the knees, I tell you.

88
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,492
Yeah? What'd you say
they called themselves?

89
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,925
The Gibson Girls.

90
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:18,611
Clear up to the knees. I tell
you, it's enough to drive you mad.

91
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:23,364
If you're talking about the Kansas
City bank, he got away with $25,000.

92
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:27,688
Jesse James wouldn't pull a gun out of
his holster for 25,000. The bank said...

93
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:29,183
Pardon me, gentlemen,

94
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:33,567
the exact amount was $33,228.33.

95
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,759
That's Jesse James!

96
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:39,650
Whiskey.

97
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:44,732
Forget it. It's on the house.

98
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,178
Charlie, if you're going
to buy any insurance,

99
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:53,105
today is the day. I've
got to make a sale.

100
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,260
Later, Milford. Later.

101
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,023
Charlie, there is no
later with insurance.

102
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,109
You can't put off till tomorrow
what may strike you today.

103
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,908
Please, Milford, not now.

104
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,367
No, you're taking a lot of chances. You
got a lot of money laying around here.

105
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:06,455
Milford...

106
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:10,508
I mean, cash for your payroll, cash
for your customers, money in the till.

107
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:14,297
- This place is a gold mine.
- Have another sandwich. No charge.

108
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,365
Now what's to prevent
somebody from walking in here

109
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,651
and pressing the cold barrel
of a. 45 against your temple?

110
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,114
Very little.

111
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:25,501
Yeah, one shot and your wife is an orphan.
But not with Plymouth Rock Insurance.

112
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,458
You can leave her 5,000,
10,000, anything you want.

113
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,042
And when your time comes, you'll
find yourself slipping away

114
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,974
with a smile on your lips
and a song in your heart.

115
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:38,226
You got to think about that.
That's the way to go, you know.

116
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,382
You got to think.

117
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,981
Please. Watch out, kid.

118
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,770
- Charlie...
- I wanna talk to you.

119
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,633
You'll have to excuse us, sir.

120
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:49,660
This is a private conversation between
the two of us, if you don't mind.

121
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,585
You two may not finish.

122
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,736
I'm interested in slipping
away with a smile on my lips

123
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:58,391
and a song in my heart. I'll have
my drink over at the table here.

124
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,249
This may be a hot one.

125
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,765
You caught me just at the right
time. I think I have one policy left.

126
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:12,081
Pleased to be of service
to you, sir. My card.

127
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,096
What is a Milford Farnsworth?

128
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,680
Oh, that's me. That's my
name. I'm Milford Farnsworth.

129
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,535
All right.

130
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,395
Oh, no. Whiskey is
the weak man's crutch.

131
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:33,217
Now, we at Plymouth Rock are honored
to have been chosen by you, Mister...

132
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:35,406
- James. TJ James.
- Oh, yes.

133
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,200
I'd like to hear a little
more about this insurance.

134
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:42,351
As I understand it, your company is
willing to bet me on how long I'll live?

135
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:45,171
And they'll take the short end
by betting I'll live a long time?

136
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,833
Yeah. I guess you
could put it that way.

137
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,125
Well, if I'm dead, how do
I know I'll get paid off?

138
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,054
My good man, the Plymouth
Rock Insurance Company

139
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,945
wouldn't be in business two minutes if
they didn't make good on their policies.

140
00:08:56,646 --> 00:09:00,067
Just so long as we understand each
other. Now, who gets the money?

141
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,593
Well, your wife, your mother,
whatever loved one you designate.

142
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,175
Well, then you take out your
pencil and paper and start writing.

143
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,103
- The money goes to Miss Cora Lee Collins.
- Cora Lee Collins.

144
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,723
- Angel's Rest, Missouri.
- Angel's Rest, Missouri.

145
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,746
- And what is her relationship to you?
- Loved one.

146
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,149
I don't think the company
has that classification.

147
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,706
Well, make it wife. She will be.

148
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,333
Now, how much money is your
company prepared to put up?

149
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,130
Well, we're prepared to go
as high as you want to go.

150
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,058
That's 1,000, 5,000, 10,000...

151
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:37,207
- Well, let's say 100,000.
- Yeah, let's say that. Oh.

152
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,035
Well, how would you like
to make the payments?

153
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:43,154
Would that be quarterly,
or semi-annually?

154
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,985
- I'll pay it all now.
- You'll pay it all...

155
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,950
No, no, you don't understand.

156
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:50,568
See, that's about $33,000.

157
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,119
100,000. That's the premium and I...

158
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,052
Yeah, well, just keep the change.

159
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,928
Yeah.

160
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:14,289
You just wait here and I'll run
across the street to the doctor's

161
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,289
and arrange for your physical.

162
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:20,408
Don't you take any drinks or anything.
You look fine just as you are.

163
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,607
Good morning, Mr.
Quesely. You remember me?

164
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,140
With deep horror.

165
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,564
I hope you haven't had the
lock in the washroom changed,

166
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,684
because I'm gonna be around
here for quite a while.

167
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,203
You have 30 seconds to leave
before your beneficiaries cash in.

168
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,732
Mr. Quesely. I sold a policy.

169
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:55,696
Ten seconds. And get
that trash off my desk.

170
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,445
Mr. Quesely, do you
know what's in that bag?

171
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:02,039
It better be something you can
defend yourself with, Farnsworth.

172
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,500
There's $33,000 in that bag.

173
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,222
Farnsworth, do you feel all right?

174
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:12,007
It represents the premium paid in full
on an insurance policy of $100,000.

175
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,823
I suggest that this be counted and
turned over to the auditor at once.

176
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,345
Here's the policy, if you'd
like to look it over, sir.

177
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,200
Why certainly, sir. I mean, Milford.

178
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,223
Yeah, let's see now.

179
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:31,613
"Mr. TJ James, beneficiary
Miss Cora Lee Collins,

180
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,131
"in the amount of

181
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:36,398
"$100,000."

182
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,108
Well, who is this
Mr. TJ James, my boy?

183
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:43,643
Oh, he's quite an operator.

184
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:45,896
But what are his sources of income?

185
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,655
Well, naturally I didn't
pry into any details.

186
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,483
- Naturally.
- But I gathered from him

187
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,104
that he's well known in
railroad and banking circles.

188
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,689
Well, this is too big to fool with. Better
set up an appointment for his physical.

189
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:02,273
Oh, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Mr. James left last night on the train.

190
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:06,203
But I had Doc Bishop rush him through
right away. Here's the medical.

191
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:08,789
I promised you'd send
him a box of cigars.

192
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:12,013
Send them? I'll take them over myself.

193
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,299
Here's the morning paper, Mr. Quesely.

194
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:20,020
Miss Raskin, how many times have I told
you not to interrupt me in conference?

195
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:24,512
And never, never when I'm with
our star salesman, Mr. Farnsworth.

196
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:30,059
Just a minute, Miss Raskin.

197
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,646
How much have you been
drawing a week, Milford?

198
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,341
Oh, $7.50.

199
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:37,927
Raise that to $10. And
do you have the $25 bonus

200
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:41,322
that I told you to draw for
Milford this morning? Good.

201
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:43,375
See that he gets it right away.

202
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,510
Now, Farnsy, my boy,

203
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,358
I am going to carry the ball from here
on in. You take the rest of the day off.

204
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,945
- Oh, but it's a working day.
- It's a day to celebrate.

205
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:56,907
Go on to the beach. Take
a ride on the new elevated.

206
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:00,188
You've earned it. Go on.
Get out of here. Scat.

207
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:35,280
Farnsworth! Farnsworth!

208
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,668
Another bonus?

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,586
Farnsworth.

210
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,896
Funny, I have a feeling
I've seen that face before.

211
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:54,549
Farnsworth, is that or is that not

212
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,511
the man to whom you sold a
$100,000 life insurance policy?

213
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,958
I told you, I thought
his face was familiar.

214
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,814
Anything happens to that
man, this company is ruined.

215
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,771
Funny thing, not once
during the whole evening

216
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,269
did he mention that he
was a notorious killer.

217
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,026
Will you shut up?

218
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:16,382
Farnsworth, you're gonna
take the next train west.

219
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,336
What?

220
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,764
You're going to return this money to
James and make him give up that policy.

221
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:24,723
Me, make him?

222
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:28,237
And if James refuses
to return that policy,

223
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:33,289
you are to remain by his side
forever, to protect our interest.

224
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:37,252
You are to ride with him,
eat with him, sleep with him.

225
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:43,134
At the slightest sign of danger, you
are to lay down your life to protect his.

226
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,478
- Go.  - But, Mr. Quesely,
 I'm liable to get killed.

227
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,313
Stop trying to cheer me up.

228
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,933
And I knew the minute I saw you
that you were responsible gentlemen,

229
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,494
men who are keenly aware

230
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:16,528
of your financial obligations
to your family and estate.

231
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,639
Now, no other policy can give you
the protection that this one can.

232
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,641
And you don't have to
worry about the cost.

233
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,360
Your wampum can be
divided into 12 easy wamps.

234
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,317
Well, that's my story. Are you sold?

235
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,839
No? But I've explained everything.

236
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:44,636
Believe me, you can't go
wrong with Plymouth Rock.

237
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:46,688
Why won't you buy? Give me one reason.

238
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,593
Foreigners.

239
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:59,849
They're foreigners.

240
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,179
All right, everybody. Reach!
All right, let's get 'em up.

241
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:37,497
Come on, now. Get out the money
and the valuables. Come on.

242
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,752
All right, get 'em out.
You heard what he said.

243
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:49,755
You got anything?

244
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,548
You sure?

245
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:55,606
You wouldn't fool me?

246
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,841
What is that, a gold tongue?

247
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:10,694
Now, let's have the rest of it.
That's it. There's a good boy.

248
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,107
- Now, let's have the rest of it.
- That's all there is.

249
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,915
Oh.

250
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,644
- What's that?
- Oh, that's just my girdle.

251
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:27,867
- Oh, it's your girdle.
- I'm wearing it a little loose this...

252
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:30,122
Oh...

253
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,548
Say, that'll just fit me.

254
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:38,066
But I'm supposed to give
that money to somebody.

255
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,569
You just did.

256
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,193
Did you ever hear of a
man called Jesse James?

257
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,316
Who's he?

258
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:46,575
Well, he happens to be a very close
friend of mine that I'm gonna visit.

259
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,001
How do you think he's gonna feel
when he finds out how you treated me?

260
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,622
Heartbroken.

261
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:54,055
All right, boys,
let's get out of here.

262
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,834
Didn't I hand you $1
when we left New York?

263
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,165
Yes, sir. Right here.

264
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,319
Well, thanks for keeping
an eye on it for me.

265
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:32,135
Say, where can I find Jesse James?
I wanna talk to him about a robbery.

266
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,768
There's a guy here, wants
to see Jesse about a robbery.

267
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,444
Hey, open up. I want
to send a telegram.

268
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,844
I don't know what I've got, but
I hope there's a cure for it.

269
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:05,222
Jesse, a stranger in town wants
to see you about a robbery.

270
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,914
Thanks a lot.

271
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:11,301
Take care of that, Frank. Not too
rough. Just get him out of town.

272
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:23,764
That's New York. Send it collect.

273
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,253
Man could get a cheap nose job here.

274
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,141
Hey, where can I find Jesse James?

275
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,869
Never heard of him.

276
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,795
I'll find him.

277
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:39,147
I just got to figure out what a man like
Jesse'd be doing at this time of day.

278
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:46,857
It's for my new number.

279
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,348
You like it?

280
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:53,606
Yeah. Sure do like
it, Cora Lee, honey.

281
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:57,490
My, you're as pretty as a new bank.

282
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:01,076
Please, Jesse.

283
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,029
Don't ruin it before I've
had a chance to wear it.

284
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:07,257
Well, buy another one, if
that's all that's bothering you.

285
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,053
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,276
I guess all women feel
that way about a new dress.

287
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,527
Maybe so.

288
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,027
Oh, I forgot...

289
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,311
I got you something.

290
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,924
Looks mighty expensive.

291
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah, I'd have got it for you sooner,

292
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,573
but the train didn't come
through till this morning.

293
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,767
Thank you.

294
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:37,028
You got to keep it. We're
gonna get married, aren't we?

295
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,248
I'd like to think about it.

296
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:43,043
You thought about it long enough.
I'm getting tired of waiting.

297
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,797
Ma's coming in today. She's
gonna make the arrangements.

298
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,693
You always get what you
want, don't you, Jesse?

299
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:49,987
Always.

300
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,442
Cora Lee Collins.

301
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:10,418
Cora Lee Collins. I thought
that name sounded familiar.

302
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,583
Jesse's beneficiary.

303
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,504
Howdy.

304
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:31,990
Hi.

305
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:37,237
Hi, sir.

306
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,596
Nice day for drinking.

307
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,512
Wasn't it?

308
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:55,573
- What'll you have?
- Oh, I'd like some information.

309
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:57,177
We sell liquor here, boy.

310
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,563
Oh.

311
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,022
I'll take what he's having.

312
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,371
Do you know where I could
find a Miss Cora Lee Collins?

313
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:08,409
She works here at night.

314
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:11,731
If you're still here
by then, you'll see her.

315
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:19,837
You should have a wick in this.

316
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,556
What's the matter, don't you
like the liquor I'm drinking?

317
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,919
Yeah. It's okay.

318
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,437
Why don't you drink it?

319
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,133
That'll be 50 cents.

320
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,626
Here's your change.

321
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,711
Lucky I didn't have a bigger bill.

322
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:17,280
I hit it. Struck it rich.
The drinks are on me.

323
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:19,911
Hooray!

324
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:23,429
What'll it be?

325
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,447
Some of that.

326
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:45,656
- You drink that all the time?
- Ever since the goat went dry.

327
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:49,747
A man like you needs protection.
Now my company is willing to bet you

328
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:53,068
on how long you're gonna live, and
we'll take the short end by betting you

329
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,793
you'll live a long time.

330
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,724
- Really?
- That's the Plymouth Rock.

331
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:59,310
Fill them up again.
Where do I make the bet?

332
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:06,225
You just sign right there. And the bet's
on as soon as you pass the physical.

333
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,381
How are you fixed?

334
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,011
Hey, Grigsby!

335
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,160
You double-crossing
varmint! You jumped my claim!

336
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,585
He'll never pass the physical.

337
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:34,867
All right, drink up, everybody.

338
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,758
Anybody doesn't drink
with me is a dead man.

339
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,807
Well, what're you gonna do?

340
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:18,332
Oh, I can't play. I
don't have any money.

341
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,339
That's better than money.

342
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:31,853
Oh. Well, as long as
it's a friendly game.

343
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,594
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

344
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:51,324
- I pass.
- Me, too.

345
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:55,543
- How many?
- I'll stand pat.

346
00:25:57,342 --> 00:26:00,128
- I'll suffer through.
- Give me three.

347
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,659
Three.

348
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,565
- Give me three cards.
- I just gave you three.

349
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,757
I didn't like those.

350
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:15,139
Oh.

351
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:22,483
That's better. Now give me two.

352
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:32,127
Hope you find something you like
soon. I'm running out of deck.

353
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:34,983
That's fine. I got all I
need now. What do you do?

354
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:39,369
- Oh, I think I'll take one.
- You was pat.

355
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,522
Fair is fair.

356
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:55,383
Anything I can't stand,
it's cheating at cards.

357
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:59,733
Me, neither. Another thing
I can't stand is killing.

358
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:04,552
Well, now, killing in this town'll get
you 90 days. Cheating'll get you shot.

359
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,712
That's what I like. Law and order.

360
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,500
I bet two stacks.

361
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:15,119
Oh, I can't go any further.
I haven't got any more money.

362
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:17,209
Why, sure you have.

363
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,090
What're you fellas with, a laundry?

364
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,568
The pants.

365
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,957
I didn't think the
stakes were that low.

366
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,375
All right, there you are.

367
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:41,567
- I call you.
- Four queens.

368
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:46,192
Wait a minute. I didn't see 'em.

369
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,410
Mister, if you don't find four queens in
that deck, I'll give you your money back.

370
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:53,402
Hold it. I got you beat
anyway. I got four kings.

371
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,550
All right, let's see 'em.

372
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,182
I said, let's see 'em.

373
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,643
There.

374
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,489
If you don't find four kings in that
goat, I'll give you your money back.

375
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:16,992
Why, you cheating tinhorn.

376
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:20,776
Hold it. Don't anybody make a
move or I'll blow my brains out.

377
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:23,993
You've all had your little
joke. Now I'm giving the orders.

378
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:29,282
Okay. Give me my shirt. Here,
hold my coat. Give me my pants.

379
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,643
Here, hold my gun. You
don't know who you're...

380
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,389
Where have I failed?

381
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:42,644
One thing I know, a Westerner
never shot a man in the back.

382
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,654
Oh. Wait till I tell the
Chamber of Commerce about this.

383
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,875
I'll be right there, Ma.

384
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,480
What are you doing in here?

385
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,875
Oh, I'm with the fire
department, ma'am.

386
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:17,694
Just checking safety regulations.
Yep. Yeah, it'll burn.

387
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:21,681
Yeah. Oh, that'll burn.

388
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,239
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:27,761
It's very warm.

390
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:37,958
Get 'em up.

391
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:41,320
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- If I was you, I'd get out of this town.

392
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,611
Do you know whose room that
was you just come out of?

393
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,802
- No.
- Jesse James' gal.

394
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,859
Oh. Do you know who I am?

395
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,557
- No.
- Thanks. When's the next train leave?

396
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,867
That city fellow sent
this telegram a while ago.

397
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:59,033
Well, so he wired his
boss for more money.

398
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,322
Maybe we better be nice
to him till he gets here.

399
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:03,713
Where is this Farnsworth?

400
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,767
I just put him on the train, Jesse.

401
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:14,211
Don't worry, I'm used to
getting things off that train.

402
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,839
Why, it's Jesse James.

403
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:52,091
Put 'em down. Put 'em
down. This one's on me.

404
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:54,279
Hiya, Milford.

405
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:57,246
- Hiya, Jesse.
- I've been looking all over for you.

406
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,236
- I've been looking for you.
- Come on, we're going back.

407
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:03,320
- We're miles from town.
- Oh, I got a horse waiting.

408
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,412
Yeah?

409
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,143
He's my client.

410
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,581
Ma, I want you to
meet a friend of mine.

411
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,266
From New York. His name
is Milford Farnsworth.

412
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,490
- I'll go get your room ready.
- Howdy, son, and welcome.

413
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,778
Pleased to know you. Mighty
fine place you have here.

414
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,138
Well, I guess I'll be running along.

415
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:03,165
Oh, it's you.

416
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:06,124
I didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

417
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,879
Not so loud, please.

418
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:11,274
It's all right. The boys
told me all about it.

419
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,961
They was just joking with
you. They're kind of playful.

420
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:15,055
Yes.

421
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:19,017
You come on in with me. I'll
fix you a cup of raspberry tea.

422
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,703
Oh, don't let me
interrupt your housework.

423
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,031
Oh, don't fret. I already
done the big pieces.

424
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,913
I'm always cleaning up after the boys.

425
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,674
They're so careless.

426
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:36,456
It's important to keep
a gun clean, you know.

427
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:38,518
Oh, I know. A guy can
get blood poisoning

428
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,946
from getting killed
with a dirty bullet.

429
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:59,084
This here's our game room.

430
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,740
Who's playing here
tonight, Smith and Wesson?

431
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,823
Jesse got that for me
when he was just a boy.

432
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,647
I used to send him to the museum.

433
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:23,973
Imagine. A little kid like that, soaking
up culture, no matter what it weighed.

434
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,326
Sport model?

435
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,503
- What's this?
- That's one of Jesse's hobbies.

436
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,921
He collects gold watches. He's
got enough there to open a store.

437
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:44,344
Probably how he got most of them.

438
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:47,798
Milford, your room's ready for you.

439
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:52,109
Say, I sure appreciate your letting me
stay here where I can keep an eye on you.

440
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:56,504
I gotta make sure
nothing happens to you.

441
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,992
Hey! Here's a little present for you.

442
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:03,741
Really? For me? Gee, thanks, Jesse.

443
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,633
Hey, and you had it engraved, too.

444
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:07,896
I did?

445
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,051
Yeah. "To Milford Farnsworth
from his grandfather. "

446
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:53,353
- And Cora Lee. How nice.
- Hello, Ma.

447
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,540
What a pretty dress.

448
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,509
- You look mighty pretty yourself.
- Thank you, dear.

449
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:58,801
Come on in to the house.

450
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,981
- Evening, Miss Cora Lee.
- Evening, Cole.

451
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,732
- Hello, Hannah.
- Frank, here's Cora Lee.

452
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,288
- Good evening, Cora Lee.
- Good evening, Frank.

453
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,454
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

454
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,048
- Pardon me, will
you? - Mmm-hmm.

455
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:22,363
Oh, Mr. Farnsworth.
- How do you do?

456
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:25,943
- I believe you two have met.
- Oh, yes.

457
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:28,477
- How are things at the firehouse?
- Well, not too good.

458
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,520
- They found a sliver in the pole.
- I'll go get you two something to drink.

459
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:36,150
Say, I want to apologize for
breaking in on you like that.

460
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,972
Oh, that's all right. I
guess you lost your head.

461
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:40,698
That's not all I lost.

462
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:43,490
They do play a rough game
of poker in this town.

463
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:46,643
It's lucky I quit. My next
bet would've been skin.

464
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:48,809
Come in. Welcome to the party.

465
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,568
Come right on in and make
yourselves comfortable.

466
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,657
Oh, hiya, Milford. Some party, eh?

467
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,523
Oh, Cora Lee, honey.
Would you do the honors?

468
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:56,351
I'll fetch the cigars.

469
00:35:56,422 --> 00:36:00,070
Milford Farnsworth, this is Luke
Hutchins, our mayor of Angel's Rest.

470
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:02,658
- Hi, Mayor.
- Welcome to our town.

471
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:04,321
It's yours for the asking.

472
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:06,719
And this is Jeremiah Cole,
our village blacksmith.

473
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,108
Oh, well, who's watching
the chestnut tree?

474
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:13,029
- Mighty glad to know you.
- Thank you very much.

475
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:18,207
You can quit pumping. I think
we got a pretty good blaze going.

476
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:21,106
And over here we
have Mortimer Hobclaw.

477
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,426
Mr. Hobclaw's our undertaker.

478
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:26,016
- How do you do?
- How are you?

479
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,758
Oh, I'm sorry. I meet so
few people standing up.

480
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,046
You can take inventory later.

481
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:44,532
Say, you have some mighty
interesting people here in Missouri.

482
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,201
That's very good.
What is your name, son?

483
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:55,892
Harry Truman.

484
00:37:04,603 --> 00:37:06,789
Keep playing. You'll help the party.

485
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,108
- Shall we try the porch? It
might be cooler. - Mmm-hmm.

486
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:12,803
Is this your first trip
west, Mr. Farnsworth?

487
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:16,027
Yes, I've always wanted to open up
this territory for my insurance firm.

488
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,612
- Oh, you're in insurance.
- Deeper than you think.

489
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:28,153
- Is Mrs. Farnsworth here with you?
- No. She's too old to travel this far.

490
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:32,043
Besides, she wouldn't
want to leave Dad alone.

491
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh, I know what you mean.

492
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:37,624
No. I guess I'm what you'd
call an eligible bachelor.

493
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:38,683
Oh.

494
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:41,219
Well, I guess there's no
harm in a man taking his time

495
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:43,710
before embarking on
a sea of matrimony.

496
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:47,331
As long as he doesn't wait till
he's too old to make the trip.

497
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,919
Oh, Ahwahnee.

498
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:54,908
This is Princess Ahwahnee.
Mr. Farnsworth, dear.

499
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:58,589
An Indian Princess. Do I
curtsy or just tip my scalp?

500
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,756
How do you do?

501
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:07,264
If you don't see what
you want, just ask for it.

502
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:10,849
Your eyes, they should be on a woman.

503
00:38:10,924 --> 00:38:12,850
Yeah. They usually are.

504
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,953
Well, I see you've made a conquest.

505
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:24,672
Well, this is pretty
strange for me out here.

506
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:26,207
Different than New York?

507
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:29,628
Well, you could walk for days through
Central Park without seeing an Indian.

508
00:38:29,697 --> 00:38:31,453
Really?

509
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,185
I'll get you a drink.

510
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,468
- No, thanks.
- How about something to eat?

511
00:38:38,603 --> 00:38:41,186
- No, thank you.
- Would you care to dance?

512
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,246
Mmm-mmm.

513
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:43,782
Well, that doesn't leave very much.

514
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:47,301
- Hey, Cora Lee, how about it?
- All right.

515
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:53,845
<i>It's a mighty pretty
evening for a barbecue</i>

516
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,636
<i>Got the banjos out
to plunk a bar or two</i>

517
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,785
<i>Moon is shining bright
And there's a star or two</i>

518
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,976
<i>And I can smell the donuts and the pie</i>

519
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:10,023
<i>But I just ain't a-hankering
for banjo plunking</i>

520
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:14,775
<i>Ain't a-hankering for pumpkin pie</i>

521
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:18,274
<i>Ain't a-hankering for donut dunking</i>

522
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:21,660
<i>There's something else
entirely on my mind</i>

523
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:25,516
<i>Oh, there's something
else entirely on my mind</i>

524
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:29,698
<i>And it ain't cotton picking</i>

525
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:33,556
<i>And it ain't berry pie</i>

526
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:38,045
<i>And it ain't eating chicken</i>

527
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:41,589
<i>There's something else
entirely on my mind</i>

528
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:45,619
<i>Oh, there's something
else entirely on my mind</i>

529
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:53,893
<i>I'll bet that Broadway's all lit
up And Central Park's in bloom</i>

530
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:57,540
<i>Swell hotels with belles
a-smelling from perfume</i>

531
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:01,468
<i>Folks a-grabbing hansom
cabs to see Grant's Tomb</i>

532
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:05,978
<i>And the carousel is swell
at Coney Isle But I just</i>

533
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:10,032
<i>Ain't a-hankering
to see trees blooming</i>

534
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:13,756
<i>Ain't a-hankering to see swell styles</i>

535
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,307
<i>Ain't a-hankering
to go Grant's-Tombing</i>

536
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:20,638
<i>There's something else
entirely on my mind</i>

537
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,493
<i>Yeah, there's something
else entirely on my mind</i>

538
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,452
<i>And it ain't hansom cabbing</i>

539
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:32,435
<i>And it ain't Coney Isle</i>

540
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:36,481
<i>And it ain't brass ring-grabbing</i>

541
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:40,375
<i>Oh, there's something
else entirely on my mind</i>

542
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:44,421
<i>Oh, there's something else entirely</i>

543
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:49,381
<i>on my mind</i>

544
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,726
Everything all right, Frank?

545
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:59,716
Just like a church social. I told
the boys to lay off the rough stuff.

546
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:07,051
Him. Butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth.

547
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:12,131
- Maybe butter's not what he's after,
 Jesse.  - Forget it, Frank.

548
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:16,387
- Okay. She's not my gal.
- Relax. Milford's our friend.

549
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:18,483
Till the dough comes.

550
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,900
Till the dough comes, then we
won't need Mr. Farnsworth anymore.

551
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:26,754
- Okay, Jesse. Just let me know.
- Let you know?

552
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,005
Yeah, you have all the fun.
Let me have this one, huh?

553
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:36,788
Well, I'd better say
goodnight to Jesse.

554
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:39,049
- Jesse.
- You have to leave so soon?

555
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,477
- I must. I'm a working girl, you know.
- Yeah, but not for long.

556
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,801
Oh, Milford, I gotta take
care of my other guests.

557
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:47,160
Would you mind showing
Cora Lee back to town?

558
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:48,488
I'd be happy to, Jesse.

559
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,849
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Jesse.

560
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:56,824
You don't need to, Milford. Out here, you
know, women aren't quite that helpless.

561
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,647
Don't move.

562
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:09,255
There. Boy, the mice grow
pretty big out here, don't they?

563
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:12,771
- That was a Gila monster. They're deadly.
- Really?

564
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,138
You're a very brave man.

565
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:17,168
Why? For just killing a
little old Gila monster?

566
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,353
- I know. But with a rattlesnake?
- Yeah...

567
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,361
Come on, I'll take you home.

568
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:31,720
Later we'll toss to
see who takes me home.

569
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,067
I won't have it, Son. I
tell you, I won't have it.

570
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:39,154
I already told you, Ma. There's
nothing I can do about it.

571
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,021
I've got a position in this community,

572
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,109
and I'm gonna do the
best I can to uphold it.

573
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,901
I declare, Jesse, you're the most
stubborn son a mother ever had.

574
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:50,195
I'll leave it to anybody.
Oh, Mr. Farnsworth.

575
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:52,909
Oh, evening, ma'am. I was
just on my way up to my room.

576
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,737
I wish you'd help me talk some
sense into this fool son of mine.

577
00:42:56,808 --> 00:43:00,161
He's bent on having a
gunfight tomorrow at dawn.

578
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,985
- Oh, you shouldn't do that.
- 'Course not.

579
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:05,706
I won't have him leaving
without breakfast.

580
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,930
I wish you'd quit babying me,
Ma. Snake Brice is in town,

581
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,586
boasting he's gonna shoot me
down. What do you expect me to do?

582
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,281
Eat a good breakfast.

583
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:16,706
Your pa never went out shooting
folks on an empty stomach.

584
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,269
You remind me of my own mother.

585
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,763
Besides, it's damp at dawn,

586
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,720
and Jesse's liable to get
pneumonia before he gets killed.

587
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:26,541
"Killed"? Hey, we got
to talk about this.

588
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:29,434
- What about the policy?
- We'll talk about it after the shooting.

589
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:31,021
No, that may be too late.

590
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,919
Promise me you'll wear your
rubbers if it's damp, Son?

591
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:35,314
Sure, Ma.

592
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,934
And remember to take
a clean handkerchief.

593
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,322
Stop fretting, Ma. I won't
go without my breakfast.

594
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,142
Well, I better get to sleep. Man
says he's gonna gun you at dawn,

595
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,142
you want to be there.

596
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:54,117
Jesse's a good boy.

597
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:57,538
- You mean you're gonna let him go?
- It's his work.

598
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:01,996
It's like being a doctor. If
somebody wants you, you gotta go,

599
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:05,748
any time of the day or
night. Know what I mean?

600
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,714
<i>Anything happens to that
man, this company is ruined.</i>

601
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:20,736
<i>Anything happens to that
man, this company is ruined.</i>

602
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:26,451
<i>Anything happens to that
man, this company is ruined.</i>

603
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:11,538
All right, I'm getting
tired of your ugly face.

604
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,699
Go for your guns.

605
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:18,016
Don't move. I got the drop on you.

606
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:08,154
Come on, get going.

607
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:16,826
- Jesse, somebody turned the horses loose.
- What?

608
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,344
- Somebody turned the horses loose.
- Well, round 'em up.

609
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:31,346
I've been robbed.

610
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:12,585
Here's the chance you been waiting
for, Snake. Jesse's in town.

611
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:15,611
I'll be ready soon as
I finish my breakfast.

612
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,400
I'm ready.

613
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,325
You wait in the stable.
I'll take it from here.

614
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,324
Anything I hate, it's a brave horse.

615
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:03,189
You go rest. I may be
heavier on the trip home.

616
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:10,227
Okay, Jesse, I'm
gonna give you a break.

617
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,660
You draw first.

618
00:48:20,437 --> 00:48:25,717
I knew you was yellow, Jesse.
But it ain't gonna do you no good.

619
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:30,394
Draw.

620
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:44,260
Why, that's the fastest
draw Jesse ever made.

621
00:48:44,328 --> 00:48:46,412
I never even seen his
hands touch his guns.

622
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,609
- Neither did I.
- No.

623
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:51,003
Nice shooting, Jesse. Hey,
wait a minute, that's not Jesse.

624
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:53,123
- That's Milford. Milford?

625
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,989
I hope that teaches him a lesson.

626
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,812
If he's not out of town by
noon, I'll wing him again.

627
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,623
- What's all the shooting about?
- Snake Brice was looking for Jesse.

628
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:09,475
- Jesse get him?
- No, but Milford did.

629
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:13,725
- Milford?
- He's got the fastest hat alive.

630
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,810
- Tell him I want to see him.
- All right.

631
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:14,496
- Have you been hit?
- Calm yourself, missy. I feel fine.

632
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:17,718
- You're sure you're all right?
- Yup.

633
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:22,646
You put on Jesse's clothes?
And you faced Snake Brice?

634
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:27,528
- Yup. Yup.
- You outdrew him. You shot him down.

635
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:32,174
- You're a gun-slinger.
- Yup. Yup. Nope.

636
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:34,072
- Then why did you do it?
- Well, I had to.

637
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:37,757
- It was either him or me or Jesse.
- But what does Jesse mean to you?

638
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,184
Jesse means everything to me.

639
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,480
I got him insured for $100,000.

640
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:44,339
But I don't have to tell you that.
After all, you're his beneficiary.

641
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,959
- His what?
- You mean to say you didn't know

642
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:51,883
that if Jesse gets
killed, you get $100,000?

643
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,066
Why would Jesse arrange
a thing like that?

644
00:50:57,435 --> 00:51:01,048
You can answer that better than me.
After all, you're his girl, aren't you?

645
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,590
Well, aren't you?

646
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:11,112
Jesse doesn't ask questions. If he
wants something, he just takes it.

647
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:15,009
And who's gonna argue
with him? Are you?

648
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,226
Well, it hadn't occurred to me before,
but now that you mentioned it, nope.

649
00:51:19,298 --> 00:51:24,838
Milford. Milford, will you do something
for me? Something I want very much?

650
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,066
Well, I reckon that depends.

651
00:51:34,283 --> 00:51:38,894
- Now, what was it you wanted?
- Get out of town.

652
00:51:39,965 --> 00:51:43,080
You sure got a funny
way of saying goodbye.

653
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,239
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to you.

654
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:49,132
If you stay around here, you
haven't got a chance. Will you go?

655
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:54,408
I don't know, but I'd sure
like to say goodbye again.

656
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:04,213
You're a little late, Jesse.
Milford already took care of Snake.

657
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,508
Where's Milford now?

658
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:19,264
You see, I told you.
Somebody shot at you.

659
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,957
Let's have a little more
respect for heroes out there.

660
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,148
I reckon I better go down
and teach him a lesson.

661
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,345
- No, wait.
- Huh?

662
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,708
Please, don't start anything, Milford.

663
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:30,600
Oh, as long as I don't come
unstrung, I'm still in business.

664
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:39,696
Sorry, Milford. Thought
I saw a man in here.

665
00:52:45,987 --> 00:52:48,468
Oh, maybe it's because
I'm wearing your clothes.

666
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:51,264
Yeah, would you mind telling
me what this is all about?

667
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:54,293
Well, I want to talk to you about that
insurance policy, but you won't let me.

668
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,648
He was only trying
to protect you, Jesse.

669
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,837
Yeah, if anything
happens to you, I'm dead.

670
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:01,063
Well, let's not have any more of this.

671
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:04,417
And I don't like anybody
doing my shooting for me.

672
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:08,379
Or anything.

673
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,695
What's that?

674
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:16,389
Well, I shaved this morning,
and I'm a slow bleeder.

675
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,807
Better get out of here
before I become a faster one.

676
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,223
Got something for you, Jesse.
This just come for Farnsworth

677
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:29,146
from that insurance
company in New York.

678
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:36,521
"Milford Farnsworth,
Angel's Rest, Missouri.

679
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:39,015
"You are fired. Repeat, fired.

680
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:42,505
"You are the Benedict Arnold
of the insurance business.

681
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:45,789
"Am coming west with another $33,000

682
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,770
"to buy back policy.
Arriving 10:00 tonight.

683
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:55,489
"Kindly do not meet
me. Titus Quesely. "

684
00:53:56,295 --> 00:53:59,377
Oh, we ain't gonna meet him.

685
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:04,198
We're just gonna shake hands
with his money. Thanks, Elmo.

686
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:14,063
Wait a minute, what's all this
about my being your beneficiary?

687
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:15,723
Oh, didn't I tell you?

688
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:20,444
Well, one day soon, you and
me are gonna collect $100,000.

689
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:22,840
Then we can settle down.

690
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,960
To collect $100,000,
you've gotta be dead.

691
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:27,755
Oh, I won't be dead.

692
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,232
It'll be some fellow
who just looks like me.

693
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,907
- Milford.
- Yeah, Jess?

694
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:46,365
You wear that outfit.
Looks great on you.

695
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,017
- Can I keep it?
- As long as you live.

696
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:01,650
And don't tire yourself out down there.
We got a little business deal tonight.

697
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:32,446
Say, Jesse, I wonder what's
holding up that train?

698
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:34,536
In case you forgot, we are.

699
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:38,692
- Hey, nobody's gonna get hurt, are they?
- Not necessarily.

700
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:41,745
Whatever you do, don't get shot.
My company would never forgive me.

701
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,408
I don't plan to.

702
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:49,621
- Hey, here she comes now.
- Hey, Jesse, I've been thinking this over

703
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:52,950
and I'm gonna sit this one
out. I just don't like it.

704
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:54,845
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

705
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:59,957
All right, let's go. Come on.
Aw, it might be fun after all.

706
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,243
You know what to do?

707
00:56:05,315 --> 00:56:07,207
I ought to. I've been robbed myself.

708
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:09,733
Well, now's your chance to get even.

709
00:56:16,214 --> 00:56:19,499
I'm pretty fast on the trigger, too.

710
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:24,345
And there's the trigger, right there.

711
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:33,748
Just remember. These people try
to hide their jewels and money.

712
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,341
We have to search everybody.

713
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:38,636
Check. You take the men
and I'll take the women.

714
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:40,168
Come on.

715
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:52,390
Reach.

716
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,845
We'll cover you. Get busy.

717
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:59,064
All right, get your valuables out.

718
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:02,619
Don't any of you varmints reach for a
weapon or I'll let daylight through you.

719
00:57:02,698 --> 00:57:06,051
Put it in the poke. There
you are. Okay, all of it.

720
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,036
All right, shorty, get it up. Come
on, let's have it. Where did you go?

721
00:57:11,968 --> 00:57:13,951
Toss it down, redwood.

722
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:18,673
You got snow up there?
All right, get 'em up. Up.

723
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:27,048
What a bank. Drop that
turnip in here. Watch it.

724
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:31,431
Okay, let's have it. Okay, come on.

725
00:57:31,504 --> 00:57:35,686
Young man, I hope you realize what
you're doing's against the law.

726
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,104
Hide it. Hide it,
we're over our quota.

727
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:41,730
- What are you trying to do?
- Sorry, we don't take confederate money.

728
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:44,627
Here, let me see that. All right...

729
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:48,546
Nothing wrong with that stuff.

730
00:57:48,617 --> 00:57:51,098
What are you trying to do,
go in business for yourself?

731
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,230
What's wrong with that?

732
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:55,489
Nothing. I just wanted to
see if you're on your toes.

733
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,335
Boys, let's get out of here. Yeah.

734
00:58:03,403 --> 00:58:07,844
- You, guard the rear.
- Guard the rear?

735
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:13,758
Oh, but, Jesse, Jesse, wait for me.

736
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:21,501
Jesse, wait for me. Jesse,
Jesse, where are you?

737
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:23,537
Come on. What are we waiting
for? Let's get out of here.

738
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:25,688
One little chore we
ain't attended to yet.

739
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:36,759
- Oh! Oh, there you are.
- Let's get outta here.

740
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,243
Jesse!

741
00:58:47,462 --> 00:58:52,175
- Okay, Jesse, I covered the rear.
- You ride on ahead. We'll take over.

742
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,003
Well, that's that.

743
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,214
Get in touch with the insurance people
and tell them that Jesse James is dead.

744
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:50,182
I needed that.

745
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:53,942
You look like you had a
hard day at the office.

746
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:59,957
We're going to the ranch tonight.
Start packing your things.

747
01:00:01,524 --> 01:00:06,668
- What for? What is all this?
- We had an accident at the train tonight.

748
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:09,189
I got killed.

749
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:15,608
He's dead.

750
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,534
The tombstone on Boot Hill
will have my name on it.

751
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:21,854
As soon as the insurance
company pays off that $100,000,

752
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:24,543
we'll have enough for
the rest of our lives.

753
01:00:25,681 --> 01:00:28,196
We're getting married tomorrow.

754
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:32,856
Now, let's take this
a little slower, Jesse.

755
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:41,785
Now start packing.

756
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,609
- You the telegraph operator?
- That's right.

757
01:00:57,678 --> 01:01:01,791
Never figured she'd make it on
time after getting held up tonight.

758
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:06,974
- How did you know the train was held up?
- That train always gets held up.

759
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:09,903
Here.

760
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:15,653
I want this message delivered promptly to
the telegraph operator at the first stop.

761
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:29,899
We'll get ourselves a
fine spread somewhere.

762
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,757
A long ways from here, 1,000
miles. Maybe California.

763
01:01:33,363 --> 01:01:36,343
You and Frank can have this place.

764
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,207
Gonna be all right, Ma,
working out real great.

765
01:01:40,773 --> 01:01:42,665
What if they come around
here, looking for him?

766
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,287
- Looking for who?
- Milford.

767
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,251
Just tell 'em he went back east.

768
01:01:49,013 --> 01:01:51,030
Sounds reasonable.

769
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:54,720
Milford was a nice boy.

770
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:57,840
Yeah.

771
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,534
Too bad he didn't have
some of his own insurance.

772
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:03,826
So they'll be looking for him.

773
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:06,413
Leastways they won't be
looking for me no more.

774
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,505
There won't be any more
sheriffs riding up to my door.

775
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:26,650
It's Milford.

776
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:35,553
Whoa. Oh, boy. Whoa girl. Whoa.

777
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,243
Happy yogurt.

778
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:51,142
Oh, good. You made it. I
was worried about you, Jesse.

779
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:54,794
I would've gone back and looked for
you, but my horse got away from me.

780
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:57,621
Boy, I thought sure they got you.

781
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,085
Good boy.

782
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:02,604
Oh, boy.

783
01:03:03,143 --> 01:03:05,125
It's sure good to be home.

784
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:08,914
What a night.

785
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:16,660
What's the matter with you two? You
look as though you've seen a ghost.

786
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:21,274
Why, we heard you got killed
in the train holdup, Milford.

787
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:23,639
What happened? I can't
understand how we could've...

788
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:26,633
I mean, I thought you stopped
a lot of lead out there.

789
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:31,814
Oh, I did. I gained twelve pounds
in seven seconds. But I was okay.

790
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:42,379
Boy, it's a good thing
Jesse went to that museum.

791
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:45,008
I was wearing my heavies.

792
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,415
- Pretty good, eh, Ma?
- Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

793
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:53,674
- You were very lucky, Milford.
- Lucky? I could've been Swiss cheese.

794
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,861
<i>Those bullets were playing Goodbye
Forever up and down my spine.</i>

795
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,356
Oh, but I've had it. I'm gonna find
Mr. Quesely first thing in the morning

796
01:04:01,423 --> 01:04:05,342
and give myself up. It won't be
bad. You know, about 10 years.

797
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:09,386
- Give yourself up? What for?
- I robbed a train tonight.

798
01:04:09,995 --> 01:04:13,677
- Well, so what? I was there, too.
- Yeah, but that's different with you.

799
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,230
That's your business. Yeah.

800
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:18,732
Well, I'll see you in the
morning before I leave, Ma.

801
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,950
Good night, Ma.

802
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:22,544
- Good night, Jesse.
- Good night, Milford.

803
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:27,130
Boy, I'm glad you're okay.
That's the main thing. Good night.

804
01:04:34,018 --> 01:04:38,493
- How about that?
- Now, now, Son.

805
01:04:40,264 --> 01:04:44,807
Things went a little wrong
tonight. Don't let that bother you.

806
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:48,066
Remember what I
always taught you, Son.

807
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:51,685
What you can't do today
you can do tomorrow.

808
01:05:15,153 --> 01:05:16,637
Good morning.

809
01:05:18,509 --> 01:05:22,224
- Going someplace?
- Yes, it's back to the big town for me.

810
01:05:23,326 --> 01:05:26,940
Well, I'm kind of glad,
and I'm sorry, too, Milford.

811
01:05:27,114 --> 01:05:29,300
We'll miss you around here.

812
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:31,923
Yeah, well, I gotta get back
and report to the company.

813
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:34,083
I got a lot of big deals cooking.

814
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:39,633
I think you're one of the
nicest persons I've ever known.

815
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:41,633
I'm glad I'm here to hear it.

816
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:44,057
I'm sorry things didn't
work out better for you.

817
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:47,146
Oh, things worked out fine, just fine.

818
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:48,871
I got myself mixed up in a robbery.

819
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,369
Practically put my
company out of business.

820
01:05:51,437 --> 01:05:53,329
Double-crossed my friends.

821
01:05:53,397 --> 01:05:56,649
It's not easy to louse up a whole
town in three days, but I made it.

822
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,303
Compared to me, General
Custer was a big success.

823
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,049
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Milford.

824
01:06:07,385 --> 01:06:09,934
I'd kind of like to say
goodbye like we did before.

825
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,199
Yeah.

826
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:26,682
- Goodbye, Milford.
- Cora Lee.

827
01:06:26,756 --> 01:06:28,716
- Hi, Jess.
- Milford.

828
01:06:28,783 --> 01:06:31,966
Milford, I was thinking about
what you talked about last night.

829
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:33,591
You didn't do anything wrong.

830
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:36,250
Your boss was bringing that money
out to give to me and I got it.

831
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,048
Yeah, but you don't understand, Jesse.

832
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,476
The money was for the
return of the policy.

833
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:42,868
Return the policy.

834
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:46,123
- Well, I might just do that.
- You would?

835
01:06:46,195 --> 01:06:48,178
I always knew you were my friend.

836
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:52,106
You ride into town and tell Quesely
that I'll be in for a talk, huh?

837
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,102
Oh, great.

838
01:06:56,994 --> 01:06:58,545
- Oh, Milford.
- Yeah.

839
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:02,440
Be sure you take the shortcut, the
one over there through Stone Canyon.

840
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:03,766
- Stone Canyon?
- Yeah.

841
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:05,423
- Thanks, Jesse.
- Real pretty that way.

842
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,357
- Bye, Cora Lee.
- Bye, Milford.

843
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:15,192
I'll be back in a minute.

844
01:08:01,088 --> 01:08:03,806
He don't scare me, but if you're
chicken, we better get going. Come on.

845
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,083
Come on, baby.

846
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:29,889
All right, this is
it. Whip it into high.

847
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,064
If I was in shape, you wouldn't...

848
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:10,752
You...

849
01:09:14,053 --> 01:09:17,735
Oh. I wasn't trying.

850
01:09:18,473 --> 01:09:21,690
I know how you feel about me, Princess,
but try and control your emotions.

851
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,212
- Keep head down. Maybe come more rock.
- Yeah.

852
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:26,905
Yeah, it's a good thing
you bumped into me.

853
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,366
- That could have been a nasty accident.
- No accident.

854
01:09:30,435 --> 01:09:33,879
You might not be so lucky next
time. Now, this policy protects you

855
01:09:33,957 --> 01:09:37,967
against falling objects, buffalo
stampedes and termites in your wigwam.

856
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:40,004
Just sign right here.

857
01:09:40,868 --> 01:09:42,794
What do you mean it was no accident?

858
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:47,868
- If you die, Jesse collect insurance.
- Jesse? But I've got him insured.

859
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:49,530
How could he collect if...

860
01:09:50,404 --> 01:09:51,921
Oh, yeah.

861
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:55,952
Yeah, he could dress my
body up in his clothes,

862
01:09:56,019 --> 01:09:57,537
and there's plenty
of crooked witnesses.

863
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:00,101
Yeah.

864
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:05,554
Come on. Let's get outta here. They
may be loading that slingshot again.

865
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:21,595
I'm deeply honored by your
obvious affection for me, Princess,

866
01:10:21,671 --> 01:10:26,950
- but I'm not your type, honest Injun.
- Ahwahnee know that you love another.

867
01:10:27,785 --> 01:10:31,999
- Cora Lee?
- She send me to warn you of ambush.

868
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:34,993
- Really?
- She love you.

869
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:38,641
Love me? Oh, I couldn't be that lucky.

870
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:43,192
- It is sad that you let her marry another.
- A doll like her, loving...

871
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:45,353
What was that again?

872
01:10:45,428 --> 01:10:48,011
She does not wish it,
but Jesse marry her today.

873
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:51,702
Well, he can't do that to my girl.

874
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:54,754
- We got to figure out a way to stop that.
- How?

875
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:58,478
This is no time for Indian
talk. Let's get moving.

876
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,953
Whoa. Whoa there.
- Someone's coming.

877
01:11:07,025 --> 01:11:09,449
- Yeah?
- Maybe Jesse's men.

878
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:14,457
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, there. Whoa, there.

879
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:25,559
Hey, Indians. Indians.

880
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:29,812
Halt! Halt in the name of the law.

881
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:33,832
- Me, Justice of Peace.
- Me no savvy. Gotta scoot.

882
01:11:33,906 --> 01:11:36,953
- Me big hurry.
- I'm in a hurry, too.

883
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:40,110
This is one bridegroom I'd
better not keep waiting.

884
01:11:40,186 --> 01:11:41,840
Are you make marriage?

885
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:44,768
Come all the way from
Elderberry City for this one.

886
01:11:44,837 --> 01:11:46,627
Which way is the James Ranch?

887
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:53,874
Me show paleface. Me show how go fast.

888
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,162
Go fast like wind
through cheap teepee.

889
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:00,844
I'm in a hurry. I'm late now.

890
01:12:03,544 --> 01:12:06,195
Ah, come. Come.

891
01:12:06,269 --> 01:12:10,246
- Just tell me. Point.
- No. Come up hill. See James' wigwam.

892
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:12,906
Very good, from hill. Come.

893
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:30,782
Well, a man don't get
married every day, you know.

894
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:37,666
What a beautiful day for a wedding.

895
01:12:38,299 --> 01:12:43,544
Like they say, "Happy is the
bride the sun shines on. "

896
01:12:43,616 --> 01:12:46,765
Then I don't see why it doesn't rain.

897
01:12:46,838 --> 01:12:49,885
Oh... It would cool things off.

898
01:12:49,962 --> 01:12:53,677
Oh, you're just fretting,
dear. And you don't need to.

899
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:58,394
Jesse's going to treat you real
nice. Jesse respects womanhood.

900
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:01,289
He ain't never shot a one.

901
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:21,026
How do you like the foliage?

902
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,213
Oh, you fool me.

903
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:28,801
Thanks to you, old man. When we get
to town I'll buy you a flyswatter.

904
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:41,295
We can't ride horse. Horse
get sick. Been eating these.

905
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:45,045
- What are you talking about?
- You see.

906
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:49,502
He looks all right to me.

907
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:56,138
Whoops.

908
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:59,430
Looks like somebody
stole his merry-go-round.

909
01:14:02,796 --> 01:14:06,183
- Is he going to happy hunting ground?
- They no kill.

910
01:14:06,252 --> 01:14:08,540
<i>Just make loco for short time.</i>

911
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,658
Hey, they sound like
wonderful party favors.

912
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:15,846
Hey, get a rock, we can grate
some of these in the buckboard.

913
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:21,267
These may help our case. I hate to
go to a party empty-handed. Come on.

914
01:14:23,662 --> 01:14:25,519
Hey, Jesse, come here.

915
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:33,454
- The justice of the peace is here.
- Well, it's about time you got here.

916
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:37,144
I'm sorry about that. I got a
late start from Elderberry City.

917
01:14:37,218 --> 01:14:39,177
My wife forgot to wind the rooster.

918
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:43,230
Yeah. Well, let's get started.

919
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,737
Hey, you guys, pipe down.

920
01:14:55,261 --> 01:14:57,413
All right, we'll start the wedding.

921
01:14:57,487 --> 01:15:00,206
Oh, guns have no place in
the sanctity of marriage.

922
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:04,957
I will not share the room with
weapons of the devil. No, sir.

923
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:08,575
Well, all right, boys. Take off your
guns. We'll put 'em in the kitchen.

924
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:15,093
Put 'em on the table, boys.

925
01:15:48,523 --> 01:15:50,709
Well, a mighty fine
spread you got here.

926
01:15:50,783 --> 01:15:52,935
Oh, I'm sorry, Judge. I'm
not used to being a host.

927
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:57,053
- Have a drink.
- Well, just a little one.

928
01:15:57,129 --> 01:16:00,414
Oh, go on, have a real drink.

929
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:05,095
Well, it wouldn't be proper for me to
drink unless it was a toast to the groom.

930
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,062
That's it. A toast to the groom.

931
01:16:07,994 --> 01:16:10,917
To Jesse James, a good son,

932
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:14,927
- a good brother and a good...
- Down the hatch!

933
01:16:30,455 --> 01:16:31,644
Let's have another one.

934
01:16:32,781 --> 01:16:34,367
Everybody ready?

935
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:37,986
Here comes the bride.

936
01:17:20,328 --> 01:17:22,220
My friends, we are...

937
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:25,310
How you feeling?

938
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:27,893
Fine. Will you get on with it?

939
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:34,007
My friends, we are all gathered here
today to mourn for the dearly departed.

940
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,441
Oh, I'm sorry, that's
where I left off yesterday.

941
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:38,165
What about today?

942
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,716
Oh, you nervous bridegrooms
are all the same.

943
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,208
- What are you doing?
- Just checking.

944
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,327
A healthy marriage
is a happy marriage.

945
01:17:50,267 --> 01:17:53,914
Do you, Jesse James, take this
woman to be your lawful wedded wife?

946
01:17:53,988 --> 01:17:55,347
Yeah.

947
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:01,623
And do you, Cora Lee Collins, take this
man to be your lawful wedded husband?

948
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:05,042
She does.

949
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:10,799
- The ring, please.
- The ring?

950
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:14,014
Ring?

951
01:18:17,412 --> 01:18:20,992
Well, if there's no ring, you can
hardly expect to have a wedding.

952
01:18:43,629 --> 01:18:45,147
I knew this marriage wouldn't last.

953
01:19:00,143 --> 01:19:01,763
Pardon me.

954
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:08,847
Jesse, come and get some coffee, dear.

955
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:18,477
I told you you were making
that punch too strong.

956
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:38,253
Hey, you guys. Get in the
kitchen, coffee up. Fast!

957
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:43,200
There, they'll never
come through this door.

958
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:46,987
They sure won't. That's the
closet. The door's over there.

959
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:54,567
Hey, wait. I got an idea. I
want to look for something.

960
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:55,619
Hurry.

961
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:08,621
Let's go, men.

962
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:20,447
Here we go.

963
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:26,198
They're coming. Come on.

964
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:29,445
Here they are. Up
here in this room here.

965
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:31,839
It's locked.

966
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:34,938
All right, men. Let's
break this door down.

967
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:38,260
Put your shoulder
into it. Come on, move!

968
01:20:39,525 --> 01:20:42,175
I'll bet you this is the first time
the preacher ever eloped with the bride.

969
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,826
There they go! Come on, men!

970
01:21:06,272 --> 01:21:10,056
Missed. They're getting away.

971
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,776
Move, you nincompoops.

972
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:16,766
Head for the depot. We
gotta catch the train.

973
01:21:46,609 --> 01:21:50,359
- What's the matter, Milford? Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine now.

974
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:09,458
Thanks for the rest.

975
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,137
Darling.

976
01:22:39,972 --> 01:22:41,954
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over.

977
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:53,251
Hey, Cora Lee, come back!

978
01:22:53,328 --> 01:22:54,755
Bring a ladder.

979
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:06,215
I wonder what's par for this hole?

980
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:35,024
Find a river, quick.

981
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:15,155
I've had enough of that.

982
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:31,705
We've missed the train. Now what?

983
01:24:32,245 --> 01:24:34,964
- Head for town. The Sheriff will help us.
- Yeah.

984
01:24:49,722 --> 01:24:50,742
Whoa.

985
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,070
Come on.

986
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:01,282
- Sheriff, you gotta help us.
- He's gone.

987
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:04,502
Yeah. Wait. I'll get one of these.

988
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:12,275
Milford, be careful. I
know Jesse. He's dangerous.

989
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,242
Look for some ammunition.

990
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:52,517
- You fool. You might hit Jesse.
- Down, Mr. Quesely.

991
01:25:53,618 --> 01:25:55,136
What are you trying to do, ruin me?

992
01:25:55,212 --> 01:25:57,364
I got no time to talk to you.
I'm gonna get killed in a minute.

993
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:59,920
You'll get killed when I tell you to.

994
01:25:59,997 --> 01:26:03,215
I've sent for the proper
authorities. They'll handle this.

995
01:26:05,846 --> 01:26:08,802
Hey, you ruffians.
Put down those guns.

996
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:12,120
I'm making a citizen's
arrest. I say that...

997
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:20,194
Mr. Quesely! Mr. Quesely!

998
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,839
Mr. Quesely!

999
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:35,713
There you are, Mr.
Quesely. Have one on me.

1000
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,048
Milford, look. Look what I found.

1001
01:26:44,123 --> 01:26:45,584
Darling, are you all right?

1002
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:48,865
Yeah, you're all right.

1003
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,164
- Is he dead?
- No.

1004
01:26:51,234 --> 01:26:54,984
He's one of those sneak-drinkers.
Here, stop making a pig of yourself.

1005
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:57,276
- Look, Milford.
- Huh?

1006
01:26:58,377 --> 01:27:00,200
Oh, he's mine.

1007
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:08,140
- You got him.
- Of course. I had him surrounded.

1008
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:11,962
Here, notch that. Oh, I'll get him.

1009
01:27:25,755 --> 01:27:26,842
That got 'em.

1010
01:27:26,918 --> 01:27:29,874
That's one more. Notch it again.

1011
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,304
Well, back to the wagon.

1012
01:27:42,901 --> 01:27:47,082
- Wonderful, Milford.
- You want more, huh?

1013
01:27:54,563 --> 01:27:57,349
Well, another one for Boot Hill.

1014
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:01,798
I'll bet they're sorry
they ever tangled with me.

1015
01:28:09,515 --> 01:28:11,372
Happy trails to you.

1016
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,654
You hot little heater.

1017
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,710
You want a teddy bear, baby? Stand by.

1018
01:28:18,786 --> 01:28:20,337
Frank, give me a light.

1019
01:28:25,664 --> 01:28:27,849
Shoot at my friend, will you?

1020
01:28:29,085 --> 01:28:31,737
Make smaller notches.
I may run out of handle.

1021
01:28:32,409 --> 01:28:33,994
I never saw such shooting.

1022
01:28:41,347 --> 01:28:42,808
A little high.

1023
01:28:44,437 --> 01:28:46,294
I'm slicing again.

1024
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:57,888
Yep.

1025
01:28:59,821 --> 01:29:01,645
Man, do I handle this thing.

1026
01:29:03,808 --> 01:29:06,958
Milford, I think there's
a man behind that barrel.

1027
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:10,711
Give me that rifle.

1028
01:29:16,168 --> 01:29:17,958
Poor fool, he never had a chance.

1029
01:29:23,046 --> 01:29:25,403
Paleface bite dust.

1030
01:29:30,723 --> 01:29:34,042
Somebody's been smuggling
guns to the Indians.

1031
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:40,256
- Anybody left out there?
- This is the shot I've been waiting for.

1032
01:29:43,913 --> 01:29:46,065
All right, stick your
head up, I dare you.

1033
01:29:49,295 --> 01:29:52,081
This fellow needs all
the help he can get.

1034
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:56,505
Man, I didn't know he
could shoot like that.

1035
01:29:56,572 --> 01:29:57,694
Yeah.

1036
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:00,555
All right, drop those
guns or I'll show no mercy.

1037
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:05,270
Anything you say, Milford.
Throw down your guns, boys.

1038
01:30:06,474 --> 01:30:12,013
There they are. I didn't think they'd
give up that easily. How about that?

1039
01:30:26,577 --> 01:30:27,664
Wonderful job!

1040
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,223
Watch my trigger finger.

1041
01:30:29,334 --> 01:30:32,347
It was one of my shorter battles, but
I don't want to take all the credit.

1042
01:30:32,424 --> 01:30:34,610
Here's the gal, right here.

1043
01:30:34,683 --> 01:30:38,263
She helped load my guns.

1044
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:41,285
It was nothing. Nothing at all.

1045
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:43,911
If I've done anything to restore
law and order to this community,

1046
01:30:43,987 --> 01:30:48,496
I just want to tell you that I've
been amply rewarded. And I mean amply.

1047
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:51,153
- Milford.
- Oh, yes, Mayor.

1048
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,691
In gratitude for what you've done,

1049
01:30:53,058 --> 01:30:56,808
the citizens of Angel's Rest are
going to erect a statue of you

1050
01:30:56,879 --> 01:30:58,362
right on this very spot.

1051
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:05,378
Oh, Milford. Just think, a
statue of you, right here.

1052
01:31:10,867 --> 01:31:15,344
Not yet, you fools. Not
yet. Wait till they build.

1053
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:28,136
I tell you, insurance is a must for
everyone. I wouldn't be without it.

1054
01:31:28,212 --> 01:31:31,067
I carry protection against
every possible contingency.

1055
01:31:31,136 --> 01:31:36,778
I have life insurance, health insurance,
fire, accident, horseless carriage,

1056
01:31:36,851 --> 01:31:41,201
lightning, collision,
flood, personal liability...

1057
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:45,020
- Mrs. Farnsworth is here.
- Oh, good. Send her in.

1058
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:48,138
Will you excuse me? Think it over.

1059
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:51,961
- Hello, my darling.
- Cora Lee.

1060
01:31:54,295 --> 01:31:55,280
Milford.

1061
01:31:56,388 --> 01:32:01,793
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

1062
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:05,416
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.

1063
01:32:05,492 --> 01:32:08,347
Well, you can't get
insurance against everything.

1064
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:10,273
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
