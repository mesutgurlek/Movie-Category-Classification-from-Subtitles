1
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,200
Good a spot as any.

2
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:48,974
Well, now I don't know.

3
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,544
You oughta move it up the street.

4
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,645
No. Right here.

5
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,156
The folks from the casino can watch.

6
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,717
All right. Let's get unloaded, boys.

7
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,125
This is a waste of time and money.

8
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,086
In the old days, we didn't build
scaffolds for hanging.

9
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,961
These ain't the old days.

10
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:21,591
Since Bill Jorden's been sheriff,
everything's gotta be legal.

11
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,049
A tree was good enough for my pappy

12
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,200
and I say it's good enough for me.

13
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:26,851
Go on and help unload.

14
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:29,256
I'll get this thing started.

15
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:56,102
Hello, Orv al.

16
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,934
No, I ain't got no drink.

17
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:00,793
I wasn't asking.

18
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,474
No, but you was hoping.

19
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:10,009
You're sure putting out
a lot of sweat for nothin'.

20
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,633
Sheriff Jorden says he hangs,
he hangs.

21
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,122
Maybe yes, maybe no.

22
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,170
I think
I'll sit around a while and sing.

23
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,440
The hanging ain't till sundown.

24
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,650
Got nothin' but time, Orv al.

25
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:28,175
Nothin' but time.

26
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,783
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall

27
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:46,994
# It is Sam Hall

28
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,714
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall

29
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:51,925
# It is Sam Hall

30
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,108
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall

31
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,648
# And I hate you, one and all

32
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,470
# Yes, I hate you, one and all

33
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:03,436
# Blast your hides

34
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,361
# Oh, I killed three men, they say

35
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,551
# Yes, I killed three men, they say

36
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:14,849
# So they say

37
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:18,692
# I filled them full of lead

38
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,414
# And I left them there for dead

39
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,531
# Yes, I left them there for dead

40
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,001
# Bless their hides

41
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,180
Howdy, Bill.

42
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,322
Morning, Hank, Joe.
Today's the day, huh?

43
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,900
No different than any other day.

44
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,398
Except for Sam Hall.

45
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,032
If you ask me, Sheriff, it ain't
only Sam Hall you should be hanging.

46
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:54,700
I didn't ask you.

47
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:56,014
He's right, Bill.

48
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,598
If your father was sheriff,

49
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,892
we'd hang whoever brought
that gun-crazy killer to Gunlock.

50
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,181
Mornin', Tom.

51
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,229
Today's the day, isn't it?

52
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,849
Yeah, today's the day.

53
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:24,271
I was going to the casino
to lay a bet later.

54
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:27,542
They're giving five to three
Hall don't hang.

55
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:28,643
Eight to three.

56
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,648
How would you bet
if you were a betting man?

57
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,919
Judge Webb wants Hall hanged
at sundown today.

58
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:37,683
That's when he'll hang.

59
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,627
If you say so, Sheriff.

60
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,937
Up kinda early, Bill.

61
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:01,978
Yeah.

62
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,200
Well, today's -

63
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,280
Don't say itl

64
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,590
Or I'll heave you out the window.

65
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,091
Well, it is the day.

66
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,201
I'll be mighty glad when it's over.

67
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,651
Did he give you any trouble?

68
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:25,074
Nah.

69
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:33,462
Just wanted to bet me
he'd be outta here before sundown.

70
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:34,153
How much?

71
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,328
$1,000 dollars.

72
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,423
As if I had itl

73
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,451
Sure be glad when that guy's hanged,

74
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:44,972
so I can go home
and get some sleep in a real bed.

75
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,798
Go get your breakfast.

76
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,668
Bill, what do you figure they'll do?

77
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:57,787
I wish I knew.

78
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,003
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure

79
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,460
Hall, are you sleeping?

80
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:27,586
Who can sleep
with all that hammering?

81
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,870
What do you want for breakfast?

82
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:33,005
Ever heard of Del Monico's, Sheriff?

83
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,014
No, I can't say that I have.

84
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,985
I'll ask at the restaurant.

85
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,207
Maybe they know how to cook it.

86
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,971
Del Monico's
is an eating place in Yoko.

87
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,012
Oh? Back East?

88
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:48,058
Let's say it's in a different world.

89
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,359
A world of crystal chandeliers,
Champagne...

90
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,723
soft music,
elegant ladies and fine furs.

91
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,963
Silks. Beautiful ladies, sheriff,

92
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,090
with soft, round, white arms.

93
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,754
Who are you? Where are you from?

94
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,235
I'm a bad boy from a good family.

95
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,237
Your real name's not Sam Hall.

96
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,313
I'm a rose by any name.

97
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:23,073
Shakespeare, Sheriff, William
Shakespeare. He was a writer.

98
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:31,217
Look, Hall, you're hanging today
for killing that Smith boy.

99
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:34,814
Why don't you clear up
those other two killings?

100
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:40,612
You're the sheriff.
You clear 'em up.

101
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,588
Somebody sent for you to come here.
Who was it?

102
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:48,969
You two-bit gunslingers
don't work for nothing.

103
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:53,796
Who paid you?

104
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,409
You annoy me, Sheriff.

105
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,420
When I leave your hotel, I'm gonna

106
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,035
Who paid you for those killings?

107
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:11,768
Was it the cattlemen?
George Ballard?

108
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,000
George Ballard?

109
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,290
Sheriff, what are you gonna do
if it's George Ballard?

110
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,481
You plan to hang him before
you marry his sister or after?

111
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:44,000
Hello, Ballard.

112
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,656
Lew, what's so urgent?

113
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:46,785
We've gotta change our plans.

114
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,770
You mean, we let Hall hang?

115
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,897
No. We can't save him
at the last minute.

116
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:54,826
But we step in
when he goes to the gallows.

117
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,842
The farmers heard
and want to beat us to it.

118
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,600
A lynching? They haven't the guts.

119
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,320
That schoolmaster has the fellas
so riled up they'll try anything.

120
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,071
Nothing we can do,
unless we wage war.

121
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:08,742
But we owe it to Hall.

122
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,160
I agree with Hogan.
We should save Hall's neck.

123
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,804
What he did, he did for us.

124
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,500
The three fellas he killed
were all north of the creek.

125
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,928
Jorden won't let us bust Hall out.

126
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,549
He'll give us trouble.

127
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:30,846
We'd better get moving. It'll take
hours to round up the cattlemen.

128
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:36,016
OK. Get as many men as you can
before mid-afternoon to meet here.

129
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,765
Haven't seen one cattleman
all morning.

130
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:54,877
Or one farmer.

131
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:02,743
Sure is quiet.

132
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,035
More like Sunday.

133
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,747
I remember being in a cyclone once.

134
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,130
Before she hit,
there was feeling of emptiness,

135
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:17,294
like the air
had been sucked out of space.

136
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,794
Got that same feeling.

137
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,959
Why wait for trouble?
Let's hang Hall now.

138
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:31,216
Uh-uh. Until sundown,
there's always a chance of reprieve.

139
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,800
- A fat chancel
- Maybe.

140
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,931
But hanging him early
would be just like lynching him.

141
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:43,374
Tom Jorden wasn't so finicky
when he was wearing that star.

142
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:56,818
Look, I'm sick and tired of hearing
what my father would've done.

143
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,697
I'm sheriff now
and I'll do it my way.

144
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:02,904
I was only making talk.

145
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:07,219
Looks like Hall has a visitor.

146
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:14,593
Well, I'm in no mood for hysterics.

147
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,428
Do what you can for her.

148
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,776
Wait a minute,
what if she starts acting up?

149
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:26,267
A handsome fella like you oughta
know how to handle the ladies.

150
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,669
# I saw Nellie dressed in blue

151
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,204
# Dressed in blue

152
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:38,423
# I saw Nellie in the street

153
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:44,021
# In saw Nellie dressed in blue

154
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:44,772
# She said

155
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,049
# 'Sam, now you'll be true.'

156
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,996
# Cos triflin' days are through

157
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:52,255
# Blast your hide #

158
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,000
Is the sheriff in?

159
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,809
No. He had to go out.

160
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,599
I wonder, would it be all right -?

161
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,450
Sure, Nellie.
Stay as long as you like.

162
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:22,982
Thanks.

163
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:32,946
Why the solemn face?
Look like you're going to a funeral.

164
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,797
Don't joke about it, Sam.

165
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:37,477
Honey, nobody's got a rope my size.

166
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,858
You've been saying that for days.

167
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:42,353
Now it's only a matter of hours.

168
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,539
Yeah, I know.

169
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:46,424
Sam...

170
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,432
Take these two letters. Hide them.

171
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:00,264
Then go and see
Gunlock's leading citizen.

172
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,315
George Ballard?

173
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,034
The man who retained me.

174
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,478
You said it was
the Cattlemen's Association.

175
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:10,286
It was.
The farmers didn't scare out.

176
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:13,377
An anonymous gentleman
made a deal with me.

177
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,823
'Since your reputation
will not frighten the farmers,

178
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:26,521
you will earn $1,000 for removing
each farmer settling north of the creek.

179
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:32,590
'To show you earned the money,
leave his hat over his face
and lay a rock on the hat.'

180
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,481
There's no signature
and it's printed.

181
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,749
How do you know it was Ballard?

182
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,684
The wretches around here would
be lucky of they could sign X.

183
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:48,185
This is written by an educated man
- fancy words, neat printing.

184
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,746
Why didn't you do something before?

185
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,007
Read this.

186
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,788
Smuggled in after I was arrested.

187
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,932
"You won't hang unless
you try to implicate somebody else."

188
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:08,781
Same printing, no signature,
money in the envelope.

189
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,810
That's Ballard all right.
Figures money buys anything.

190
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,901
He might also figure with me
out of the way, he'll be safe.

191
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:23,742
Let him know you'll give Jorden
the letters, Ballard will act. Fast.

192
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:26,014
If you could get out of here...

193
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,240
we could go to some faraway place
and start over.

194
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:35,263
If you don't hurry,
I've got a real faraway place to go.

195
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,660
What do you reckon Hall weighs?

196
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,519
Oh, I'd say about... 200.

197
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,563
Just about right.

198
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,060
Howdy, Dan.

199
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,567
Any stockmen in your place today?

200
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,520
Not one.

201
00:17:58,636 --> 00:17:59,506
Any farmers?

202
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,470
No.

203
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,584
Real quiet, ain't it?

204
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,193
# Let 'em build my gallows high

205
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:18,294
# Build it high

206
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,342
# Let 'em build my gallows high

207
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,443
# Build it high

208
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,667
# Let 'em build it to the sky

209
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,858
# But it ain't my time to die

210
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,747
# No, it ain't my time to die

211
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,242
# Blast their hides

212
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,779
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too

213
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,760
# He came too

214
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,023
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too

215
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:43,004
# He came too

216
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,559
# Oh, the sheriff, he came too

217
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,563
# Just to check the trap for you

218
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,937
# When they drop your body through

219
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:54,336
# Poor Sam Hall #

220
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,635
# Poor Sam Hall #
She's all ready, sheriff.

221
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,539
She'll do all right.

222
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,475
I wish this hanging was over with.

223
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:25,172
I've had a funny feeling
all morning.

224
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:28,889
Usually when I build the gallows,
I have an audience.

225
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,510
Today, there ain't nobody,
except a few schoolkids.

226
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,385
Schoolkids?

227
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,400
What are you doing out of school?

228
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,766
Mr Rigdon told us we could go home.

229
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,037
Honest. We ain't playing rookie.

230
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,610
If you don't believe us, ask him.

231
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,262
I think maybe I'll do that.

232
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,058
Go and join Mack.
Tell him to give you a rifle.

233
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,000
Do I get a deputy's badge?

234
00:20:06,023 --> 00:20:06,893
Maybe later.

235
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,861
Tell him I'm going
to talk to Rigdon.

236
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,742
Teaching something besides school,
Mr Rigdon.

237
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:34,525
Care to take lessons?

238
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:43,128
Tell me why
you shut the school today.

239
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:46,469
That's no business of the sheriff's.

240
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:53,688
It's my business if the farmers
are coming to cause trouble.

241
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:57,088
You know where they're meeting
and when they're coming. Tell me.

242
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:00,300
How would I know? I'm not a farmer.

243
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,419
You've been steaming 'em up.

244
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:07,004
What I've told them is for
their own good. They look up to me.

245
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:12,102
You figure with my father dead,
the farmers can get control.

246
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,500
You'll wind up running the town.

247
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,257
That's not a bad idea.

248
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:18,756
I have the education
and the ability.

249
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,970
I wasn't cut out to be an underpaid
schoolteacher all my life.

250
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,230
Everyone can't wind up
marrying money.

251
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:30,722
Stop worrying about the farmers

252
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,561
and do something
about the cattlemen.

253
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,839
They brought Sam Hall out here.

254
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,526
I'll tell you
like I've told others -

255
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:42,367
I don't need rumours,
I need evidence to take action.

256
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,400
Even against George Ballard?

257
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,172
Why is he any different?

258
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,200
Everyone knows he's paid you off.

259
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:49,307
That's a lie.

260
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,117
Oh, not with money.

261
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,378
With his sister.

262
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,992
Brave man, with a gun in your belt.

263
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:30,275
Mr Rigdon's getting
the heck beat out of him!

264
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:31,100
Well, get the sheriff.

265
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,846
The sheriff is doing itl

266
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,919
Tell me where they are.

267
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:38,202
Bill!

268
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:40,703
Now listen you.

269
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:44,461
This won't exactly
make us any friends.

270
00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:48,195
I don't want to make friends,
I want to keep the peace.

271
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:50,686
You're sure doing it the hard way.

272
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,971
Five bucks? What's it for?

273
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:18,824
Fining myself
for disturbing the peacel

274
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,600
- I'm taking your horse.
- Where are you headed?

275
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:21,902
Gotta see Ballard.

276
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:31,615
I don't you kids will have
any school tomorrow either!

277
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:52,677
Bill!

278
00:24:58,184 --> 00:24:59,174
What happened?

279
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,116
I was fighting the teacher.

280
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,950
- Bill, I wish you...
- It's all right, darlin'. Shh.

281
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,271
Is your brother around?

282
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,470
No. George rode off
early this morning.

283
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:14,046
I haven't seen him since.

284
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:20,598
Jess Ryman and Jiggs Larribee
are with him.

285
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:24,752
Bill...

286
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:27,511
something bad's going on.

287
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,899
George won't tell me,
but I've heard talk.

288
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:38,538
Tell me one thing, Bill,
is my brother involved?

289
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,736
I don't know.

290
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,753
But if I find out he is involved,

291
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:47,996
if I have to arrest him,
how would you feel?

292
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,541
I mean, about us getting married?

293
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:56,206
What if I find out
George is mixed up in it?

294
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:59,859
If I have to help my brother,
take sides against you,

295
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,250
how would you feel?

296
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,240
I don't know, till it happens.

297
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:08,946
Let's hope it never will.

298
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,735
Let's talk about something else.

299
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:15,512
I'm going to Denver
to get fitted for my trousseau.

300
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:17,954
Nellie Mason"s handy with a needle.

301
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,385
I couldn't go to Nellie, not now.

302
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,241
Why not?
You used her before the trial.

303
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:28,432
It was different then.
We all thought she was a nice girl.

304
00:26:28,852 --> 00:26:31,112
Ellen, she's still a nice girl.

305
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:35,540
If anybody should be condemned,
it's her mother.

306
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,231
- Her mother?
- A hard, domineering woman.

307
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:41,076
She never let Nellie look at a man.

308
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,047
Then Sam Hall came to town.

309
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:49,048
She'll be more lonely than ever
after today.

310
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,190
I'll see her first thing next week.

311
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,644
I'd hate to be alone.

312
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,681
Are you sure Mr Ballard will be in?

313
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:10,452
He usually is.
But today's a special day, isn't it?

314
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:14,390
I'll see if he's at his home.

315
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,201
Suit yourself, Miss Mason.

316
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:38,305
Come in.

317
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:42,623
Nellie! This is a surprise.

318
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,633
I've got to see your brother
right away.

319
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:48,649
He's not home.
But I'm glad you dropped by.

320
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,617
I wanted to talk to you
about my trousseau.

321
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:53,348
You want me to make it?

322
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,394
Please, sit down, Nellie.

323
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,256
What's the matter, Miss Ballard?
Beginning to feel guilty?

324
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,713
I guess the women in town
have been pretty rude.

325
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:04,750
But Nellie, I don't feel that way.

326
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:06,903
I don't mean the women in town.

327
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:09,114
I'm talking about your brother.

328
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:11,884
You and the ranchers' wives.

329
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:14,675
Your men
are just as guilty as Sam Hall.

330
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,656
They brought him to Gunlock.

331
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,330
Nellie, Nellie, please.

332
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,264
Your brother offered to pay him
for killing farmers.

333
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,749
I don't believe it.

334
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,479
Try asking him when he comes in.

335
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,766
Ask me what, Nellie?

336
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:37,713
Good morning, Ellen.

337
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:40,485
Ask me what?

338
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:44,107
I have a message for you.

339
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,292
Those letters you sent Sam,

340
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,781
if he hangs,
I'll hand them to the sheriff.

341
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:54,442
Sorry, but I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

342
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:56,431
Not the faintest.

343
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,636
About your trousseau -

344
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:12,457
Poor girl.

345
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:16,568
Once a woman starts slipping -

346
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,120
What letters was she talking about?

347
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:21,500
I don't know. Maybe that gunslinger-

348
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:22,325
George.

349
00:29:27,313 --> 00:29:29,103
George, don't lie to me.

350
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,733
It isn't as simple as that.

351
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,450
You can't just clear it up
with a word.

352
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:42,616
Since Father died, it was always
just you and me. Remember?

353
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:43,300
I'm trying, George.

354
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,390
Rigdon brought
the first colony of farmers.

355
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:51,107
They settled south of the creek
because the irrigation was good.

356
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:53,285
They weren't bothering anyone.

357
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:57,743
No, but more poured in and fenced
off all the good range land.

358
00:29:57,744 --> 00:30:00,121
You were away. You didn't see it.

359
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:03,504
It would be OK
if they'd stay south of the creek.

360
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:08,354
When Tom Jorden died, Rigdon urged
them to move north, right up here.

361
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:09,700
And you brought in a killer.

362
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah. To frighten the farmers,
not to kill them.

363
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,900
- Nellie Mason was right!
- Now look, Ellen.

364
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,814
You're as guilty of murder
as Sam Hall.

365
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,265
We hang rustlers and horse thieves,

366
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:24,743
why shouldn't we shoot men
who steal our grass?

367
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:27,244
You're talking about the Smith boy.

368
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:29,398
Ben Smith's son, he's dead.

369
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:32,594
What are you going to do?

370
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,564
Side against your brother?

371
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,429
Those letters, did you send them?

372
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:40,125
No. Don't worry about who did.

373
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,814
Nellie won't show those letters
to Bill or anyone else.

374
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:45,545
Why not?

375
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:50,561
Because by tonight, she and Sam Hall
will be miles out of Gunlock.

376
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:53,832
The cattlemen will break Hall
out of jail soon.

377
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,403
That'll mean shooting.

378
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:57,964
George, what happens to Bill?

379
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:02,964
He won't get hurt
if he doesn't try to play sheriff.

380
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:10,269
Suppose I can get Sam Hall out of
jail before the cattlemen move in.

381
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,350
With how many dead?

382
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:12,185
None.

383
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:21,470
Provided you can get Bill
out of his office for a few minutes.

384
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,331
My brother's best advice -

385
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:26,481
cheat 'em first
and marry 'em afterwards.

386
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,518
You can't marry a dead man.

387
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:37,347
What time do you want him out?

388
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,399
Not all the way, Orv,
just loosen it.

389
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:41,724
That's it.

390
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:47,065
Now if we get any visitors,
this'll announce it.

391
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:55,374
Do I get my deputy's badge?

392
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:58,650
When they start pinning stars on
courthouse janitors, I turn mine in.

393
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,478
Easy, Mack.

394
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,013
Keep your eyes open -
I'm taking a look around.

395
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:08,784
If I had a deputy's badge, it'd
be better when the shootingstarts.

396
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:13,954
Orv al, you wouldn't know which end
of this to shoot through.

397
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:29,143
You'd better not figure me
for supper.

398
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,010
Lew, don't go.

399
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:36,086
Ballard and the men
are waiting for me.

400
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,609
This isn't our affair.
Our ranch isn't farm land.

401
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,741
But if the farmers come
our side of the creek,

402
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:45,182
they'll take over the whole range.

403
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:47,962
Sam Hall knew
the risk he was taking.

404
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,820
Oh, Lew, I love you.

405
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,798
If anything ever happened to you...

406
00:32:56,768 --> 00:33:00,538
I don't know how
I ever got along without you, Nan.

407
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,880
Lew...

408
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:12,817
there's something
I never told you about Sam Hall.

409
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:21,346
Remember the first time
you brought Hall to the ranch?

410
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:27,582
The next morning, he waited
till you'd gone out on the range,

411
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,599
then he came back here alone.

412
00:33:30,998 --> 00:33:31,988
What happened?

413
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:34,175
Nothing.

414
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,514
I had your Winchester.

415
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:52,603
I'm going out to save his neck.
I've given my word.

416
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:54,482
I'll kill him.

417
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:36,534
Lew isn't here.

418
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,389
It's you I want to see, Nan.

419
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,550
Go away, George.

420
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,169
Lew's heading for trouble.

421
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:48,947
The best thing you ever did was
to tell me you were tired of me.

422
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:50,388
I'm happy with Lew.

423
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,080
Lew's a fine man. And so
I don't want to see him hanged.

424
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:11,239
Sam Hall expects
to be broken out of jail today.

425
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,539
If he isn't,
he'll name the man who paid him.

426
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:17,519
All the cattlemen sent for him.

427
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:20,392
Lew personally
offered him blood money.

428
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,600
I don't believe you.

429
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:23,603
Unfortunately, he put it in writing.

430
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:30,522
Lew is scared about those letters.

431
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:34,445
I have a plan
to get Sam Hall out of Gunlock.

432
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:37,913
Nobody takes any risks
except Sam Hall.

433
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,429
I'm listening.

434
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:42,958
Sam Hall needs a gun.

435
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,153
Are you asking me to get it to him?

436
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:47,424
You'll have help.

437
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:52,297
You want him to shoot his way out,
kill Bill Jorden?

438
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:56,200
Hall may be killed.
Your husband would be in the clear.

439
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,470
Why did you come to me?

440
00:36:14,478 --> 00:36:16,918
I discovered that a long time ago.

441
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:19,103
When we were much closer.

442
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:24,657
Get this to Hall.

443
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,488
I can't visit him.
They'd want to know why.

444
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,424
Nellie Mason can.
She'll be there by 3:30.

445
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:36,010
You just do as I say. Get that gun
to Hall without any trouble.

446
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,335
What'll it be, Sheriff,
a beer or a bet?

447
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:50,450
How are the odds now?

448
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,865
Eight to three Hall doesn't hang.

449
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,878
I'll take three dollars worth.

450
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,257
You're friendly with the ranchers.

451
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:05,496
I'm friendly with everybody.

452
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,830
That include me?

453
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,009
Don't know a thing, Sheriff,
not a thing.

454
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,180
Oh, Bill?

455
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,111
Hello, Pastor, Doc.

456
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:27,163
MacNamara told us
we might find you here.

457
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,595
So what can I do for you?

458
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:33,642
You realise the ranchers
are gonna try to break Hall out?

459
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:35,383
I'm betting against him.

460
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,100
The farmers aim to string him up.

461
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,227
Hall is a symbol in this fight.

462
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:41,558
The farmers feel if Hall escapes,

463
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:44,939
the ranchers will run them
out of the country.

464
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,510
Well, make your point.

465
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:51,836
We want you to ask the governor
to send a company of national guard.

466
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,897
Look, if you didn't think
I could handle this job,

467
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,698
you never should've
elected me sheriff.

468
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:01,292
What are you trying to prove, Bill?

469
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,663
And how much bloodshed
will it take to prove it?

470
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:05,704
Think it over.

471
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:08,628
Don't think too long, Bill.

472
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:10,737
It's almost two o'clock.

473
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:21,700
Get this off right away.

474
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:23,154
Sure, Sheriff, sure.

475
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:26,344
"Gilbert Wilkes, State Capital."

476
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:30,312
National guard?
Expecting real trouble, eh, Sheriff?

477
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:31,900
I heard a rumour -

478
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:35,229
I want you to send a message,
not give me one.

479
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,186
Something's wrong.

480
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,801
The line's been cut.

481
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:20,015
We can't wait
any longer for Ballard.

482
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:22,965
Jess Ryman and me'll drop
in on Bill Jorden.

483
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,596
While we're upstairs...

484
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:32,738
Relax, men. I've arranged
for Sam Hall's escape.

485
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:35,350
- I don't believe you, Ballard.
- Are you calling me a liar?

486
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:38,184
You were always
against helping Hall.

487
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,750
I'm still head
of the Cattlemen's Association.

488
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:41,593
All right. I'm listening.

489
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:45,260
Hall will be
on his way out of town in an hour.

490
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:50,625
What do you think, Lew?

491
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:55,485
Well, if he's on the level, it'd be
the best way out for all of us.

492
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,916
I'll ride into town and find out.

493
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:14,455
I promised Sam
I'd bring him some food.

494
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,034
I told her it was all right.

495
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:18,681
All right.

496
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:23,583
Just a minute.

497
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,525
It's beef stew and pie.

498
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,789
There's no gun,
if that's what you're looking for.

499
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,880
Just making sure it's tender.

500
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:43,439
He'll have to manage with a spoon.

501
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:49,159
There's one more thing, Nellie.

502
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:54,171
I'll have to round up a woman
someplace to search you.

503
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,409
You won't find a woman in town
who'd care to touch me.

504
00:40:58,549 --> 00:40:59,829
Go ahead, Sheriff.

505
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:22,661
All right.

506
00:41:36,513 --> 00:41:38,473
From this side of the bars.

507
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:40,734
I was hoping we could be alone.

508
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,106
Get to see Ballard?

509
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,309
Get to see Ballard?
Everything's all arranged.

510
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,872
At three o'clock, Nan Hogan will
be below that window with a gun.

511
00:41:56,873 --> 00:41:58,153
So Ballard jumped?

512
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,705
Uh-huh. At three-thirty,

513
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:08,155
There'll be a horse
in the shed across the alley.

514
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,386
Head for Santa Fe.

515
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:12,908
- I'll join you there.
- Got enough money?

516
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:16,931
Before I leave, I'll have
enough money for both of us.

517
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:19,991
Nellie,
I haven't always been good to you.

518
00:42:19,992 --> 00:42:22,006
But I'll make it up to you.

519
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:26,077
I'll take you place back East
you never even dreamed of.

520
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:30,033
Ah, the prisoner's last meal.

521
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:42,772
There's cattlemen in town today.

522
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:50,587
I'll look around,
see if they brought company.

523
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:53,438
Then maybe I'll go
and welcome Mr Ryman.

524
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:56,027
You're leaving? It might be a trick.

525
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:57,708
I'll be within gunshot.

526
00:43:01,661 --> 00:43:03,638
Get out of the way, janitor.

527
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,619
You might get yourself hurt.

528
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,026
I know he's still in jail.

529
00:44:14,091 --> 00:44:18,161
If he'd escaped, there'd be
plenty of hollering and I...

530
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:23,360
I want a little talk with you, Jess.

531
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,870
I just rode into town for a drink.
No crime there.

532
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:27,751
No.

533
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:36,956
I can't account
for their drinking habits.

534
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:38,200
What time are you expecting them?

535
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:40,099
I ain't expecting nobody.

536
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:42,675
And that includes you.

537
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:45,039
Go on, reach for it, Ryman.

538
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:48,433
Only take it out gently
and put it on the bar.

539
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:50,781
Do like I say.

540
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:56,196
You're getting too big
for your breeches, sonny.

541
00:45:03,174 --> 00:45:04,064
What for?

542
00:45:05,298 --> 00:45:07,900
So I'll have one less hot-head
to handle when the shooting starts.

543
00:45:07,994 --> 00:45:09,974
You got nothing against him.

544
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:14,240
He pulled a gun on the law.
I can hold him until sundown.

545
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:15,849
Start moving, Jess.

546
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,572
Tell the boys what happened, Leo.

547
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:23,633
They'll tear that courthouse apart.
You're not as big as your old man.

548
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,499
Got another guest, Mack.
Where's Orv al?

549
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:06,779
I don't know what's worse -

550
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,280
man talking with his teeth flopping
around or without his teeth,

551
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,169
whistling like a tornado.

552
00:46:18,191 --> 00:46:20,291
Brought you some company, Sam.

553
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,260
Your visitor didn't stay long.

554
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:27,214
I sent her home. She was
interfering with my praying.

555
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,499
Fine deputy you are.
Half the town could've walked in.

556
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:45,350
What do you want, Tom?

557
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:47,111
I got a letter for you.

558
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,850
Miss Ballard gave it to me.

559
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:49,411
Thanks.

560
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:58,154
Ellen's over at the hotel,
wants to see me.

561
00:46:58,155 --> 00:47:00,185
Why didn't she come herself?

562
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:02,629
Good question, Mack. I'll ask her.

563
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:09,636
It's OK. When Leo tells the boys
what happened, they'll come.

564
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:10,847
What time is it?

565
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,513
Three twenty-five.

566
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:17,577
Getting worried about the farmers?

567
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:20,367
I'm not worried about anything now.

568
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,500
Where did you get the gun?

569
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:24,391
Fished it out of thin air
with a spoon.

570
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:30,702
"Jorden! MacNamara!
Come in here, quick!

571
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:32,475
"Jorden, MacNamara!

572
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:37,600
What's the matter with him?

573
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,294
He suddenly keeled over.

574
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:49,132
MacNamara, put the gun down.

575
00:47:50,311 --> 00:47:51,871
Come on, open her up!

576
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:55,248
The keys are still on this side.

577
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:57,074
I can only hang once.

578
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,502
Come on, inside.

579
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:11,114
Up, up.

580
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,415
Face the bars.

581
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:20,950
You didn't have to do that, Hall!

582
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,236
Stay out of this.

583
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:35,496
You're not going anywhere.

584
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:36,300
What do you mean?

585
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:38,548
I came alone, I'll leave alone.

586
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,400
How much money have you got?

587
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:42,491
You can't do this
after what we did for you.

588
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:46,783
Money, Ryman. All the ranchers did
for me was keep me in chips.

589
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:48,054
Come on, come on.

590
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:50,051
Now turn around.

591
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,911
None of those farmers were north of
the creek till I carried 'em there.

592
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:56,900
Then why did you kill 'em?

593
00:48:56,949 --> 00:48:58,799
$1,000 a hit on delivery.

594
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:01,837
Why, you dirty, rotten... Urgh!

595
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:29,546
What are you doing in town?

596
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:31,517
What are you doing in town?

597
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,801
Did he tell you how many there are?

598
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:36,900
He didn't say.

599
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:37,900
Or when they're coming in?

600
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:40,485
He just said he walked out on them.

601
00:49:40,784 --> 00:49:43,104
They'll be coming into town now.

602
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,117
Oh, don't go, Bill, please.

603
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:47,433
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

604
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,916
You had to make a choice
sooner than we expected.

605
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:53,697
I'm glad we're not
on opposite sides.

606
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:54,446
GUNSHOT

607
00:50:17,676 --> 00:50:20,483
I'm never so glad
to see anyone in my life!

608
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,116
I was afraid
you didn't hear my gunshot.

609
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:24,737
You can sure have him.

610
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:33,680
I thought that janitor
was gonna blow my head off.

611
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:35,531
Can I take my hands down?

612
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,945
What happened to MacNamara?

613
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:47,052
How did you get him, Orv al?

614
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:51,191
I was pretty sore, MacNamara
kicking me out of the office.

615
00:50:51,192 --> 00:50:53,172
So I kept watch downstairs -

616
00:50:53,214 --> 00:50:56,414
showed that smart deputy
he wasn't so smart.

617
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:57,000
Good thing you did.

618
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,262
I heard that loose step squeak,

619
00:50:59,277 --> 00:51:01,567
like somebody sneaking downstairs.

620
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,150
I figured it might be trouble.

621
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:08,542
Hall never knowed a thing till
my rifle jammed him in the back.

622
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,513
You did a fine job, Deputy.

623
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,997
I wanna see Mack's face.

624
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:21,102
I just wanna see his face.

625
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,210
Open the door.

626
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:28,545
Put him back in his cell, Deputy.

627
00:51:28,546 --> 00:51:29,586
Come on, Hall.

628
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:34,752
Face the wall.

629
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:36,350
Mack, are you all right?

630
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:37,879
Yeah, I'm all right.

631
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,338
What happened to Ryman?

632
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:44,076
Just Hall's way
of saying thanks to a friend.

633
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:50,786
Put him in his cell, Orv.
I'll look after Ryman.

634
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:51,767
Get in, Hall.

635
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:04,392
That's a bad bump
you've got on your head there.

636
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,658
Bill Jorden locked up Jess Ryman.

637
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,109
Let's go.

638
00:52:29,915 --> 00:52:32,055
Are you sure Sam got the gun?

639
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:37,129
I hope so.

640
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:42,072
Your train isn't due in
for a while yet.

641
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,211
I've got a stop to make first.

642
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:47,928
Sam and I need money.
George Ballard will provide it.

643
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:52,696
Don't count on it. He won't part
with a dollar without good reason.

644
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:55,423
I've got two good reasons
right here.

645
00:52:55,424 --> 00:53:00,454
Two letters George Ballard wrote Sam
offering him money to kill farmers.

646
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:03,538
Ballard?
He told me my husband sent them.

647
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:07,794
Ellie, give me those letters.

648
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,753
I will not.

649
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:09,900
I want those letters.

650
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,299
Oh, no, you don't!

651
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:00,513
I can't fight any more.

652
00:54:02,914 --> 00:54:04,414
Please, don't do it.

653
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:14,759
Lew and I will see
that you get to Santa Fe somehow.

654
00:54:14,777 --> 00:54:17,867
But these letters
are going to Bill Jorden.

655
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:23,909
No signature.
How do I know Ballard wrote these?

656
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:26,643
One man's printing
is like another's.

657
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:30,189
I'd know them anywhere.

658
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:37,559
This is a little hard to say, Bill.

659
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,370
I guess you know
that at one time,

660
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:45,821
I expected to marry George Ballard.

661
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:50,241
He used to send me notes.

662
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:52,183
They were always printed.

663
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:59,400
That printing was exactly like
those letters he sent to Sam Hall.

664
00:55:00,439 --> 00:55:03,317
I'm afraid
it won't stand up in court.

665
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:05,379
Bill...

666
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:09,506
if it wasn't George Ballard,

667
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:12,284
why would his sister get involved?

668
00:55:12,945 --> 00:55:15,035
Ellen? Where does she fit in?

669
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:17,932
Think it over.

670
00:55:19,572 --> 00:55:23,062
Why were you out of your office
at exactly 3i30?

671
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,820
MacNamara. Mack!

672
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:36,932
Ellen Ballard is at the hotel.
Bring her here.

673
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,729
Even if you have
to put her under arrest.

674
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,110
Well, what are you waiting for? I

675
00:55:57,375 --> 00:56:00,381
So we wound up
on opposite sides after all.

676
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:01,420
No, Bill, it's -

677
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:06,318
I was convinced you'd decided to go
along with me, not your brother.

678
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:11,278
That was my decision, Bill.

679
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:16,380
I only got you out of here because
I was afraid you'd be hurt...

680
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:17,123
killed.

681
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:17,952
Killed?

682
00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:23,273
You arranged to get a gun
into the hand of murderer!

683
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:23,614
Gun?

684
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,571
George never told me about a gun.

685
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:32,065
Did you think he would break out
with a sling shot?

686
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:34,272
He said if I got you out of here,

687
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:36,833
they"d handle Mack with no shooting.

688
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:37,900
And you believed it?

689
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:39,357
I was worried, Bill.

690
00:56:39,947 --> 00:56:42,097
I was just thinking about you.

691
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:44,696
About me? Or your brother?

692
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:53,048
They're coming into town, Sheriff.

693
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,650
Where are they?

694
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,973
Two miles out on the south road.

695
00:56:56,974 --> 00:57:00,676
The cattlemen would move in
from north of the creek.

696
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:03,587
The cattlemen?
It's Rigdon and his gang.

697
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:04,290
Thanks for letting me know.

698
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,580
Any time, Sheriff.

699
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:08,339
I don't hold with lynchings.

700
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:11,192
And if you don't hold
with jailbreaks,

701
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,984
watch the north road
for the cattlemen.

702
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:14,965
Mack! Orv al!

703
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:20,239
Rigdon and co are coming.
I'm off to meet 'em.

704
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,440
They won't be willing to talk.

705
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:26,100
Once they get into town, we'll never
get 'em out. Folks'll get hurt.

706
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,123
Don't go. You'll be killedl

707
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:30,784
What do we do with her? Lock her up?

708
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,016
You can let her go.
I'm through with her.

709
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,195
Don't try to stop us, Jorden.

710
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:16,876
We're going after Hall.

711
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,542
Let me remind you, Ben,
and the rest of you farmers,

712
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,823
the courthouse stairs are narrow.

713
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,481
Two men at the top
could kill you all.

714
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,682
I got two men there right now.

715
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:29,531
Only two?

716
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:35,279
Nobody takes Hall away without
killing me and my two deputies.

717
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,999
He's trying to keep us here
while the ranchers get Hall out.

718
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:40,651
Hold it.

719
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,685
We're not criminals.
All we want is justice.

720
00:58:48,564 --> 00:58:52,125
I know how I'd feel
if my boy had been murdered.

721
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,859
Hall was sentenced to hang
at sundown today. Let the law do it.

722
00:58:56,973 --> 00:59:00,523
Don't make yourselves murderers,
as bad as he is.

723
00:59:03,357 --> 00:59:06,208
All right, Sheriff,
I'll go along with you.

724
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,129
Are you forgetting
your son was murdered?

725
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:11,116
I ain't forgetting nothing.

726
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:13,512
As long as Ben Smith goes along,

727
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:15,735
that's good enough for me.

728
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:20,645
You'll need help,
if the ranchers try to get Hall out.

729
00:59:20,646 --> 00:59:21,850
How about deputising us?

730
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:22,897
I can't, Ben.

731
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:28,951
For years, my father walked a narrow
road between you and the cattlemen.

732
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:32,270
He headed off open warfare
by not taking sides.

733
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:33,421
I won't either.

734
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,790
One itchy trigger finger
could destroy everything.

735
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,365
So I'm asking you to stay out

736
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:43,500
All right, Bill.

737
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:45,946
Don't be in a hurry to break up.

738
00:59:50,162 --> 00:59:54,155
I suggest you men wait
at the stock yard, just in case.

739
00:59:56,228 --> 00:59:58,368
We'll wait at the stock yard.

740
00:59:59,399 --> 00:59:59,919
Thanks.

741
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,100
What about the farmers?

742
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:27,283
We've only got the cattlemen
to worry about.

743
01:00:27,284 --> 01:00:28,624
Only the cattlemen?

744
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,191
How's Ryman?

745
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,684
Dr Quinn said he'll be all right,

746
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:34,475
but he's still out cold.

747
01:00:35,325 --> 01:00:36,650
Where's Ellen Ballard?

748
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,648
Back at the hotel, I guess.

749
01:00:40,297 --> 01:00:41,627
Where will you be?

750
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:45,233
I have unfinished business
at the bank.

751
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:13,296
If you're listening for shooting,
don't.

752
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:14,797
Hall didn't make it.

753
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:18,615
Didn't make what?
What are you talking about?

754
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:24,602
The gun you gave Nan Hogan.

755
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,729
You're not making sense, Bill -

756
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,941
She showed me
the letters you sent to Hall.

757
01:01:30,945 --> 01:01:31,525
Letters?

758
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:35,361
Your personal invitation to Hall
to commit murder.

759
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:38,793
You're talking, Bill,
but can you prove it?

760
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:45,046
Folks say that Ballard blood had run
thin by the third generation.

761
01:01:45,624 --> 01:01:47,124
I didn't believe it.

762
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:48,747
Till today.

763
01:01:51,913 --> 01:01:54,123
Go ahead, George, reach for it.

764
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,622
No, that's not your way, is it?

765
01:01:57,761 --> 01:02:00,551
You hire others
to do your dirty work.

766
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:02,778
Go on, George, reach.

767
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,672
You've been wanting me dead.
Now's your chance.

768
01:02:06,673 --> 01:02:08,955
What kind of talk is that, Bill?

769
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:11,588
I wasn't keen
on you marrying Ellen -

770
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:16,439
After Hall hangs, I won't rest till
I get whoever sent those letters.

771
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,390
Then get him.
You can't prove I sent them.

772
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,471
I know.
That's why I want your confession.

773
01:02:28,072 --> 01:02:29,232
Now, in writing!

774
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:37,502
See if you can find
some paper down there.

775
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,113
Let's get on with it.

776
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:29,366
Bill?

777
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,710
Lew Hogan's coming in
with the ranchers.

778
01:03:36,162 --> 01:03:39,362
They're just outside town
on the north road.

779
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,112
Don't do that again, Boss.

780
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:02,083
Busting in on us like that.

781
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:06,846
When the trouble starts, we'll cover
the window. Mack, the stairs.

782
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,770
Lew, don't do it! Please, listen!

783
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:24,255
Get in off the street, Mrs Hogan.
You'll safe in the hotel.

784
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:31,341
Jorden, we don't want any trouble.

785
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:34,416
We're here to get Sam Hall.

786
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:44,245
You got five minutes
to take it over, sheriff.

787
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:47,256
If Hall don't come out,
we're coming in.

788
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:50,060
You men, fiind yourselves some cover.

789
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:25,883
# Sam Hall

790
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:32,153
# That's the name they will recall

791
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:33,224
# Sam Hall

792
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:38,252
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall

793
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:39,751
# It is Sam Hall

794
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,068
# My name, it is Sam Hall

795
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,279
# It is Sam Hall

796
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:48,111
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall...

797
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,972
Better stay by the stairs.

798
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:52,801
# Yes, I hate you, one and all

799
01:05:52,924 --> 01:05:54,204
# Blast your hides

800
01:05:56,187 --> 01:05:58,248
# Oh, I killed three men, they say

801
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,229
# So they say

802
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,458
# Yes, I killed three men, they say

803
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,627
# So they say

804
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,289
# I filled 'em full of lead

805
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:10,655
# And I left 'em there for dead

806
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,114
# Blast their hides #

807
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:25,679
Don't worry, Miss Ballard,
your brother won't get hurt.

808
01:06:26,953 --> 01:06:29,813
Whatever happens,
George won't get hurt.

809
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:36,576
I'm sorry.
I guess we all do what we have to.

810
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:42,255
Anyway, when you...

811
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:47,353
when you chose your brother's side
over Bill Jorden's,

812
01:06:47,476 --> 01:06:50,566
you sure saved yourself
a lot of heartache.

813
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:52,819
Why do you say that?

814
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,728
Bill Jorden's a dead man.

815
01:06:56,939 --> 01:07:01,609
Whoever wins, he's dead. He knows
your brother sent those letters.

816
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:02,518
My brother?

817
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:08,115
You don't know George very well,
do you?

818
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:13,097
Bill Jorden won't live long enough
to bring him to trial.

819
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:44,178
What's the matter, George?

820
01:07:44,345 --> 01:07:46,085
No more killers to hire?

821
01:07:46,308 --> 01:07:46,950
Go home, Ellen.

822
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:48,099
Gimme that gunl

823
01:08:02,656 --> 01:08:04,336
Jorden, your time's up!

824
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,430
I never shot a man before.

825
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:47,410
Mack!

826
01:08:49,856 --> 01:08:50,196
Orv?

827
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:54,018
I guess I didn't move fast enough.

828
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:01,243
Don't go doing anything foolish,
Orv.

829
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:04,792
I wouldn't know what to do
without you around.

830
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:06,293
Who would I talk to?

831
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:10,371
Always knowed you were soft inside.

832
01:09:13,306 --> 01:09:16,906
Sorry, Orv. I never should've
let you in on this.

833
01:09:20,648 --> 01:09:22,958
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

834
01:09:32,471 --> 01:09:33,681
He's passed out.

835
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,118
Mack, get Hall out here. Quick!

836
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,230
This man was sentenced
to hang at sundown.

837
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,675
I aim to carry out that sentence.

838
01:10:34,748 --> 01:10:38,648
If you cattlemen think
you can save him, you're wrong.

839
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,920
Keep me covered.

840
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,270
# Oh, the parson
He was there, he was there

841
01:11:20,407 --> 01:11:23,607
# Yes, the parson
He was there, he was there

842
01:11:24,635 --> 01:11:26,645
# Oh, the parson, he was there

843
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,736
# With the Bible and a prayer

844
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:32,495
# But he knew
I didn't dare blast his hide

845
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:38,598
# Oh, the sheriff
He came too, he came too

846
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:41,773
# Yes, the sheriff, he came... #

847
01:11:41,774 --> 01:11:45,094
Oh, sheriff,
we're both sticklers for the law.

848
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:45,468
So?

849
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:50,309
So the law says
a prisoner's hands must be tied.

850
01:11:52,065 --> 01:11:53,565
I'll do it, sheriff.

851
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:28,379
Tell him what you told me.

852
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,680
We owe Hall nothing. None of the men
he killed were north of the creek.

853
01:12:40,919 --> 01:12:42,250
He made a deal with the sheriff.

854
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:44,734
Does that nut look like I'm lying?

855
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:48,500
Hall did it, after he told me he
killed those men south of the creek.

856
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:48,818
No.

857
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:02,993
There's a lot of squaring to do,

858
01:13:04,993 --> 01:13:07,193
That'll be up to the governor.

859
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:25,044
# Now it's up the rope I go

860
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:26,683
# Up I go

861
01:13:29,142 --> 01:13:31,272
# Yes, it's up the rope I go

862
01:13:31,718 --> 01:13:32,458
# Up I go

863
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:37,121
# Oh, it's up the rope I go... #

864
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:40,131
Anything you care to say, Hall?

865
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,278
Saml Saml

866
01:13:52,973 --> 01:13:55,823
Tell the holier-than-thous
in this town

867
01:13:55,893 --> 01:13:58,913
not to blame Nellie Mason
for what I did.

868
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:02,786
Save it.

869
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:07,415
I thought you were
such a stickler for the law.

870
01:14:07,927 --> 01:14:08,667
Oh, I am.

871
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,460
But the sun's setting for me.

872
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:15,914
It'd be a shame
to miss a minute of it.

873
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,336
He's dead, Sheriff.

874
01:14:58,303 --> 01:14:59,873
Look after Hall, Mack.

875
01:15:14,914 --> 01:15:17,464
There's nothing you can do for him.

876
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:34,588
# Oh, my name, it is Sam Hall

877
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:35,799
# It is Sam Hall

878
01:15:37,509 --> 01:15:39,504
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall

879
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:40,715
# It is Sam Hall

880
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,991
# Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall

881
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:47,455
# And I hate you, one and all

882
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:50,246
# Yes, I hate you one and all

883
01:15:50,977 --> 01:15:52,437
# Blast your hides...

884
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,889
# To heaven, I won't go, I won't go

885
01:16:15,426 --> 01:16:17,156
# To heaven, I won't go

886
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,846
# But there's one thing that I know

887
01:16:21,528 --> 01:16:23,498
# I will meet you all below

888
01:16:25,269 --> 01:16:26,549
# Blast your hides

889
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,002
# Sam Hall

890
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:32,751
# Sam Hall

891
01:16:33,712 --> 01:16:36,152
# That's the name they will recall

892
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:38,579
# Sam Hall #
