Don't steal his wife, woman or whiskey.

Don't strike a bargain, then

Bobby, what's that?

461
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,487
We base our evaluation on
the price of gold when we checked last.

462
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,491
The price may have gone up.
The gold could be worth more.

463
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,452
The San Francisco mint will give us
a receipt.

464
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,998
The cash deposit
will be in the children's name.

465
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:09,627
I just wanted to be sure that
their interests are protected.

466
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,257
Don't worry. We'll see that the nugget
is well taken care of.

467
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,595
WOMAN: Can we touch it?
MAN: Sorry, that's as close as you get.

468
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,852
(SPITS)

469
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,370
It's a piece of cake.

470
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,958
- You mean it's not gold?
- 'Course it's gold, stupid.

471
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,837
Getting the gold out'll be easier
than falling off a log.

472
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,006
- Oh, boy!
- Act natural!

473
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,216
Don't do nothing to attract attention!

474
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:05,391
Hey, Theodore, how are we gonna...
Theodore?

475
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:13,483
- How will we get it out of the bank?
- First, we need a long ladder.

476
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:18,237
We'll go in through the skylight. Then
we have to get the gold out of town.

477
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:23,409
I figure that if it's worth $87,000,
it'll weigh close to...

478
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:28,581
Let's see, gold is $15 an ounce.
How many ounces in a pound?

479
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,585
- Are you listening to me, Amos?
- Yeah, but...

480
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,171
- But what?
- Your rear's on fire.

481
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,049
Oh, thank you. (WINCES IN PAIN)

482
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,014
Why didn't you tell me?

483
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,725
You told me not to do anything
to attract attention.

484
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,562
Got a match?

485
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,233
Excuse me.

486
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,946
(WINCES IN PAIN)

487
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,951
- Hello!
- Nice day!

488
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,920
- Maple, Stanley, Donavan.
- Hi, Sheriff.

489
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,464
This is what I call having a party!

490
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,302
Mr. Donavan said that we can have
all the apple dumplings we want.

491
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,765
Did he? Did he?
That's very generous of Mr. Donavan.

492
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,143
And he bought me a dress. See?

493
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,980
That's the most beautiful dress
I ever saw.

494
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,412
- Awful nice kids.
- Yes, they are.

495
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,166
You still bound for New Orleans?

496
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,461
Yes! Nothing's happened
to change that.

497
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:00,840
Of course, I have to clear up
a few things here in town.

498
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,760
And make arrangements for the kids.

499
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,682
A lot of people are anxious
to take them to their bosoms.

500
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:16,314
They want me to make them wards of
court and give them to a local family.

501
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,859
People of substance.
That'd fit right into your plans.

502
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,447
You'd be free to go on your way.
Unencumbered, unfettered.

503
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,616
Fine.

504
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,328
- Who wants them?
- No shortage of applicants.

505
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,831
- There's my darling!
- Let me have her!

506
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,959
- What do you know about kids?
- And you?

507
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:42,715
- Let go, you'll hurt her!
- Ladies! This is a private party.

508
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,134
He said I could have her.

509
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,679
You'll all be in trouble
if you don't leave.

510
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,224
It'll be decided later at the hearing.

511
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,642
Out! Out!

512
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,563
See what I mean?

513
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:04,487
- They ripped my beautiful dress.
- I know, but we'll fix it. We'll fix it.

514
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,866
There's got to be better people
in this town!

515
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:14,580
- There's always Miss Clydesdale.
- Who's Miss Clydesdale? Dusty?

516
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,748
Mm-hmm.

517
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,252
- But she's not married.
- That's easy to fix.

518
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,338
Well, who can you get?

519
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,093
- You're not suggesting...
- Only for the kids!

520
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,430
- I know, but Dusty?
- She's a fine specimen of womanhood.

521
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,434
I saw her get caught in a cloudburst
once, and I can tell you...

522
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,772
Mr. Donavan, please marry Dusty!

523
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,613
No two people ever got married for
a more honorable or worthy cause.

524
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,241
Think that over.

525
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,456
Hearing's not until the day
after tomorrow.

526
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,883
Marry Dusty?

527
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,139
If we go to Mrs. Stockley, will she hit us?

528
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,891
Why would she hit you?

529
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,809
She hits Mr. Stockley.

530
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,812
She might get mad
if we track mud in the house.

531
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,649
- Or forget to comb our hair.
- I'm sure she wouldn't do that.

532
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,488
When Mr. Stockley gets mad,
he uses words I never heard before.

533
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,324
Mr. Leach is meaner.

534
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,077
He'd put you in a sack and throw you
in the river for talking.

535
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,830
You won't be thrown in the river!

536
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,250
If Rowdy Joe got us,
we'd sleep in his shed.

537
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:45,004
Don't worry. If Celia gets pneumonia,
I'll take care of her.

538
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,261
- We picked these for you.
- So you won't forget us in New Orleans.

539
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,854
If you press them, they'll keep forever.

you'll remember us little kids.

and not bother him anymore.

All right!

544
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,682
I'll ask her.

545
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,569
Three little kids?
Three little swindlers, you mean!

546
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,241
- Bobby?
- What?

00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,077
- What's "swindlers"?
- I don't know.

is because you'll provide a good home.

of this arrangement?

A chance to get to New Orleans
before winter sets in.

- Exactly.
- Nothing's further from my mind!

- Don't thank him for hanging you!

- And bring your own rope.
- I'll get it.

- That's the only rope we've got.
- Get out of here!

- The hardware's closed.
- Dummy.

How can you be hung without a rope?

- Then they'll deserve it.

- With a down-home sheriff,

could be walking into a hornets' nest.

- As barber, sheriff or judge?

Judge.

01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,026
- Two bits.
- I only got half a shave!

693
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,529
A shave's four bits. Now get,
before I fine you for loitering.

- Get! See you next Tuesday.
- All right.

Yes!

- I do.

711
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,801
The ring. Give it to Mr. Donavan.

By the powers invested in me,
the State of California,

713
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:51,900
I pronounce you hitched.

714
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:57,822
You don't have to kiss,
but you ought to at least shake on it.

715
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:04,412
That's it. I generally get $2
about this point.

716
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,919
I'll pay you back.

717
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,717
Since you two don't seem to
have immediate plans, I'm buying.

718
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:23,056
Oh, good! Dusty, would you mind
keeping an eye on the kids for a while?

719
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,352
Might as well get used to it.

720

- How come he's going that way

- and we're going this way?
- It's hard to explain.

Is that all, Miss Cole?
$4.62. I'll put it on your bill.

723
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:49,874
You can each have a licorice whip
and a jelly bean. But just one.

724
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,089
If you're here for the grain bags,
they're not here yet.

725

- Did he really?

Are you coming out or not?

- Yes, and you're in it!

Unencumbered, unfettered!"

- Yeah!

No, Dusty. Back! Back!

750

- Stand still!

751
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,624

752
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,960
No! Wait!

753
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:03,925
This is ridiculous. When you
get rational, we'll discuss this!

754
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,553
We'll discuss it right now!

755
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,061
Sorry, Ralph!

756
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:18,606
You're hysterical.
We can't talk this way!

757
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,359
- What happened?
- They got married.

758
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,154
- Be reasonable!
- Shut up, liar!

759
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,240
Whatever's happened, I can explain!

760
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,831
You're not getting out of it that easy!

761
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,041
Pay you back, Homer.

(STAMMERING)

763
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,299
- What's bothering you?
- That bed!

764
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,592
That great big brass bed!

765
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:50,054
If you don't intend exercising
your prerogatives,

766
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,140

With the nights getting colder,
they need a warmer place to sleep.

they found in Breckenridge.

Still, that's a whole lot of gold
all in one piece.

doesn't want us, he wants the gold.
