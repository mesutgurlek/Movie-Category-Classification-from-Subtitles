You got no right

This is not open range anymore.

And more children to bear
for the glory of god

If you'd like to stay on

That, uh,

I'd be bound to accept
such an offer.

Grab the other side there
and help me, Benjo.

670
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,701
That was such fun!

671
01:18:27,701 --> 01:18:29,319
You got me all wet

672
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:30,954
Benjo: I did not.

673
01:18:31,488 --> 01:18:34,741
Now you're all wet.

674
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:36,376
But you're not..

675
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:38,545
Yet.

676
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:41,248
Ha ha!

677
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:45,051
[ both laughing ]

678
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:10,720
[ owl hoots ]

679
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:19,396
Johnny...

680
01:20:30,774 --> 01:20:32,942
When I was about Benjo's age,

681
01:20:32,942 --> 01:20:36,196
I lived in an orphanage
near Fort McKavett

682
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:38,915
Down in Texas.

683
01:20:38,915 --> 01:20:40,533
Every year, come spring,

684
01:20:40,533 --> 01:20:43,787
-
They'd get us all spruced up -

685
01:20:43,787 --> 01:20:47,590
A bath, clean clothes, 
a real haircut --

686
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:51,378
Take us down to the church

687
01:20:51,378 --> 01:20:53,546
We all thought it was
so somebody could adopt us

688
01:20:53,546 --> 01:20:58,435
So we're all thinking,
"pick me, pick me, pick me."

689
01:20:58,435 --> 01:21:01,688
Of course,

690
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:03,306
What those kind folks were really doing

691
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:07,110
Was just renting us out as cheap labor.

692
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:11,448
Then one year, a hog farmer named Cowper

693
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:13,616
Did pick me,

694
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:18,488
And he put me right to work.

695
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,376
If I did
the smallest thing wrong

696
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:27,163
He beat the living hell out of me.

697
01:21:27,163 --> 01:21:29,883
So the first chance I got, I ran away.

698
01:21:29,883 --> 01:21:32,052
But he got the dogs after me,

699
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:34,754
And he dragged me back

700
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:40,176
He chained me up
to a post in the barn

701
01:21:40,176 --> 01:21:42,345
Next to the scalding box

702
01:21:42,345 --> 01:21:45,598
Right underneath
the big carcass hook

703
01:21:45,598 --> 01:21:49,936
And then he hauled
up a live hog

704
01:21:49,936 --> 01:21:52,655
Right there over my head,

705
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:55,909
And he took out
his curved skinning knife

706
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:58,611
And he stuck that hog

707
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:02,949
And he left it there, 
squealing and bleeding

708
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:04,584
While he read to me
from the scriptures.

709
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:10,006
And it took that hog

710
01:22:10,006 --> 01:22:14,878
A considerable time to die.

711
01:22:14,878 --> 01:22:18,131
Well, then old Cowper, he gutted it,

712
01:22:18,131 --> 01:22:19,766
Told me he'd do the same thing to me

713
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:22,469
If I ever ran away again

714
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:25,722
After that, when I wasn't working

715
01:22:25,722 --> 01:22:30,610
He kept me shackled.

716
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:33,863
Took me...

717
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:38,201
Two years to weaken a link in that chain.

718
01:22:38,201 --> 01:22:43,623
But one night, I finally got loose,

719
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:51,214
And I snuck into his house

720
01:22:51,214 --> 01:22:53,917
And I stood over him
in his bed,

721
01:22:53,917 --> 01:23:02,058
And I said to him, nice as could be,

722
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:05,311
"Pardon me, Mr. Cowper,"

723
01:23:05,845 --> 01:23:07,480
And when he opened his eyes --

724
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,352
No. You let me finish

725
01:23:12,352 --> 01:23:14,521
Let me finish.

726
01:23:17,774 --> 01:23:21,578
When he opened his eyes,

727
01:23:21,578 --> 01:23:24,831
I ran a pitchfork
right through his neck

728
01:23:24,831 --> 01:23:29,702
And I’ve been running and 
killing ever since

729
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:32,422
And I am good at it.

730
01:23:35,675 --> 01:23:38,928
I got eyes
in the back of my head

731
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:45,435
I don't trust nobody.

732
01:23:45,435 --> 01:23:48,137
I don't belong anywhere.

733
01:23:48,137 --> 01:23:50,306
I don't deserve god's forgiveness.

734
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:54,110
And, uh...

735
01:23:58,982 --> 01:24:01,150
No.

736
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:03,870
I don't deserve you.

737
01:24:11,461 --> 01:24:14,714
Just let me go, Rebecca.

738
01:24:20,136 --> 01:24:21,754
Just let me leave.

739
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:34,767
Johnny.

740
01:24:35,318 --> 01:24:38,571
Mose and Benjo, they came up
to take the herd early.

741
01:24:39,105 --> 01:24:45,612
I know.
I asked them to.

742
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:47,780
Why'd you do that?

743
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:16,169
Rebecca.

744
01:26:16,703 --> 01:26:17,787
[ Rebecca gasps ]

745
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:03,332
Samuel,

746
01:27:03,332 --> 01:27:07,670
He has already brought your
sister down to his level.

747
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,923
Do you want
to sink that low?

748
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:59,188
Rebecca?

749
01:28:02,442 --> 01:28:05,144
I cannot give up my family and my god.

750
01:28:05,144 --> 01:28:10,032
It's too much to ask.

751
01:28:10,566 --> 01:28:12,201
What'll they do to you?

752
01:28:15,455 --> 01:28:17,073
They'll make me go on my knees

753
01:28:17,073 --> 01:28:19,792
Before the church and confess my sins.

754
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,410
I will beg to be absolved

755
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:24,664
And I will vow never to sin in 
that way again,

756
01:28:24,664 --> 01:28:27,917
And it will nevermore
be spoken of by any of us...

757
01:28:30,086 --> 01:28:34,423
And you will leave here,
never to return.

758
01:28:37,143 --> 01:28:39,846
Well, that's what they want.
What do you want?

759
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:42,014
It doesn't matter
what I want.

760
01:28:42,014 --> 01:28:44,183
Yes, it does, Rebecca.
That's all that matters.

761
01:28:44,183 --> 01:28:45,818
That's not true.

762
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:50,690
Marry me.

763
01:28:55,578 --> 01:28:58,281
A plain woman
must marry plain.

764
01:28:58,281 --> 01:28:59,365
Why?

765
01:28:59,365 --> 01:29:01,534
Why can't you do what you want?

766
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:03,169
I can't.

767
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:14,547
I had another brother, Johnny,

768
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:18,351
And he had strayed from the plain way

769
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:21,604
He was placed under the ban.

770
01:29:22,138 --> 01:29:24,307
He was shunned

771
01:29:24,307 --> 01:29:27,026
I couldn't speak to him

772
01:29:27,026 --> 01:29:30,279
Or acknowledge him.

773
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:34,617
It was supposed to make him 
turn back to us

774
01:29:34,617 --> 01:29:38,955
Because no one
can live without family.

775
01:29:38,955 --> 01:29:41,123
But he held out,

776
01:29:41,123 --> 01:29:45,995
And so did we,

777
01:29:45,995 --> 01:29:50,333
Until one night he came into 
my father's barn

778
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:55,221
And he threw a rope over a rafter...

779
01:30:02,812 --> 01:30:04,430
It killed him.

780
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,403
It killed him.

781
01:30:10,403 --> 01:30:13,656
[ sobbing ]

782
01:30:17,994 --> 01:30:20,696
Stay with me, Johnny.

783
01:30:20,696 --> 01:30:25,034
Stay with me until
tey do what they will do.

784
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,586
Rebecca Yoder,

785
01:32:40,586 --> 01:32:42,221
If you can face
Almighty god

786
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:44,390
With a penitent heart

787
01:32:44,924 --> 01:32:47,093
And confess
to your sins now,

788
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:49,812
Then ye shall be forgiven
of them.

789
01:32:59,021 --> 01:33:03,909
I confess that I failed
to keep myself separate,

790
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:09,331
That I took the outsider
Johnny Gault

791
01:33:09,331 --> 01:33:12,034
Into my house,

792
01:33:12,034 --> 01:33:14,754
Allowing myself and my son

793
01:33:14,754 --> 01:33:18,007
To be touched
by his worldly ways

794
01:33:18,007 --> 01:33:20,709
And corrupting influences.

795
01:33:26,132 --> 01:33:31,554
I confess to having fallen
into the sin of fornication

796
01:33:31,554 --> 01:33:34,807
With the outsider
Johnny Gault.

797
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:44,033
I confess to having
fallen in love

798
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:48,904
With the outsider
Johnny Gault.

799
01:33:49,455 --> 01:33:54,326
The love I have for him

800
01:33:54,326 --> 01:33:59,215
That comes over me

801
01:33:59,215 --> 01:34:04,086
And over me

802
01:34:04,086 --> 01:34:07,339
Is like the music,

803
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:10,059
Only it doesn't stop.

804
01:34:10,059 --> 01:34:16,015
It just goes on and on.

805
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:36,085
And I think to myself...

806
01:34:40,956 --> 01:34:45,294
If god loves all his creatures, 
even the unbelievers...

807
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:50,716
Would he demand

808
01:34:50,716 --> 01:34:55,054
That I deny the love I bear 
for this one man?

809
01:34:55,054 --> 01:34:56,138
Rebecca.

810
01:34:59,942 --> 01:35:04,813
I looked into my heart

811
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:09,702
For the shame I must feel
for what I’ve done,

812
01:35:09,702 --> 01:35:13,489
But it isn't there.

813
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:18,377
I cannot lie to you

814
01:35:18,377 --> 01:35:21,080
Or to god

815
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,417
Or to myself.

816
01:35:25,968 --> 01:35:29,221
I cannot pretend
to believe what I do not,

817
01:35:29,221 --> 01:35:37,897
And I do not believe
that my love for Johnny

818
01:35:37,897 --> 01:35:39,515
Is wrong.

819
01:35:41,684 --> 01:35:45,487
I am so sorry...

820
01:35:47,656 --> 01:35:51,443
My brothers and my sisters

821
01:35:51,443 --> 01:35:56,332
I am so sorry.

822
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:20,139
Johnny!

823
01:37:31,176 --> 01:37:32,795
Rebecca Yoder...

824
01:37:34,963 --> 01:37:37,683
Rebecca Gault,

825
01:37:37,683 --> 01:37:39,301
You have been placed
under the ban

826
01:37:39,301 --> 01:37:40,936
By all members of the church.

827
01:37:40,936 --> 01:37:44,139
We will not share
a table with you

828
01:37:44,139 --> 01:37:46,291
Or have discourse
of any kind with you.

829
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:48,977
Never will we speak
your name.

830
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:52,231
From this day forth,
until such time as you repent,

831
01:37:52,231 --> 01:37:54,950
To us you are dead.

832
01:37:59,288 --> 01:38:03,625
I don't know
why you've done this --

833
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:08,497
To seduce a plain woman
from her family and her church.

Why have you chosen
to become her damnation?

Noah...

836
01:38:15,003 --> 01:38:16,638
You know this woman.

837
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:20,426
She isn't damned

01:38:43,165 --> 01:38:45,334
What is it?

Tell me.

My music.

01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,543
Yeah?

843
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:57,246
It's gone.

844
01:38:57,246 --> 01:39:04,770
It'll come back.
Don't worry.

845
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:08,557
It was the voice of God.

846
01:39:08,557 --> 01:39:10,726
It won't come back

847
01:39:52,484 --> 01:39:55,187
You two be careful
up there.

Got your sling, little David?

851
01:40:09,835 --> 01:40:13,622
How -- how come you can 
t-talk to me

852
01:40:13,622 --> 01:40:15,791
But not her?

853
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:19,595
You're not being shunned.

854
01:40:19,595 --> 01:40:22,297
I'm not even supposed to
talk about her.

855
01:40:25,017 --> 01:40:27,186
I'm sorry, Benjo.

856
01:40:30,973 --> 01:40:34,226
There was a bear up here
two nights ago --

01:40:34,776 --> 01:40:38,564
A nice big one.
killed a couple of sheep.

858
01:40:42,367 --> 01:40:45,070
I figure it'll be back.

859
01:40:49,408 --> 01:40:52,661
Bears like their meat
kind of spoiled.

860
01:40:53,212 --> 01:40:54,830
I'll be ready.

861

Aah!

Man: goddamn sheep.

01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,713
Fergus: put it down.

870
01:41:46,882 --> 01:41:50,686
You tell Mr. Gault
what happened here

871
01:41:50,686 --> 01:41:52,304
And who did it.

872
01:41:52,304 --> 01:41:54,473
You tell him
if he doesn't like it,

873
01:41:54,473 --> 01:41:56,642
He knows
Where to find me.

874
01:41:56,642 --> 01:41:59,361
Uh, I --

875
01:41:59,361 --> 01:42:02,064
I'll take that to mean
that you'll do as I say.

876

Yaah! Yaah!

877
01:43:19,608 --> 01:43:23,945
I had to take
the Weaver boy's arm off

878
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:38,577
I've come for my boy.

879
01:43:38,577 --> 01:43:40,212
He shouldn't be moved.

880
01:43:40,746 --> 01:43:43,465
He's lost a lot of blood.

881
01:43:43,465 --> 01:43:44,549
Oh, god!

Johnny.

01:44:24,122 --> 01:44:26,842
What are you going to do?

884
01:44:26,842 --> 01:44:30,629
I'll tell you
what I will not do

885
01:44:30,629 --> 01:44:32,798
I will not
turn the other cheek again

886
01:44:33,882 --> 01:44:36,601
And watch
one of my family get killed.

887
01:45:39,498 --> 01:45:41,666
Johnny: is this the only one
who'd stand up with you?

888
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,369
Ray wanted
to have a shot at you...

889
01:45:46,538 --> 01:45:48,173
But that brat
gave him a headache.

[ woman screams ]

Stay right there

893
01:46:41,843 --> 01:46:44,563
Mr. Gault,

894
01:46:44,563 --> 01:46:48,350
What you don't seem
to understand

895
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:51,069
Is that I always win.

896
01:47:47,959 --> 01:47:49,044
Look out!

897
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:34,589
Hear guns --

898
01:48:34,589 --> 01:48:37,842
I hear guns.

899
01:48:37,842 --> 01:48:38,927
No.

900
01:48:48,687 --> 01:48:49,771
Ma'am!

901
01:49:00,615 --> 01:49:02,784
Why aren't you doing anything?

902
01:49:02,784 --> 01:49:05,487
Because she has a .44 caliber bullet

903
01:49:05,487 --> 01:49:07,655
Lodged next to her pulmonary artery.

904
01:49:07,655 --> 01:49:12,544
You get that bullet out.

905
01:49:12,544 --> 01:49:15,246
Boy, either way, she's going to die

906
