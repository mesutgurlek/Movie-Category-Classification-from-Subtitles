1
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,675
The pudd ng's not to their taste.

2
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,378
A lot of things are not to their taste.

3
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,491
You don't understand me, l think.

4
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,564
l want them to like everything
we do for them.

5
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,259
They're waitng.

6
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,959
You shou dn't sing songs ke that.

7
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,090
What songs?

8
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,097
Black songs.

9
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,254
Whity!

10
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,690
We should have him put to sleep.

11
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,693
There are so many ways today.

12
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,292
lnjectons. . .

13
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,506
Just a pr ck of the needle. . .

14
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,308
He wouldn't feel a th ng. . .

15
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,714
and he'd fal asleep. . .

16
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:22,981

17
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,538
Look.

18
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,815
He's fond of you, Kate.

19
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,660
Dead, . . .

20

21
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,801
Alive, . . .

22
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,635
you're just a nu sance, a useless creature.

23
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,641
He's a N cholson.

24
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,648
Yes, you're rght.

25
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,522
Forgive me.

26

30
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,062
What's that nigger doing here?

31
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,005
Who is he?

32
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,250
He's the Nicholson's butler.

33
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,111
What does that mean?

34
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,988
He's the wealth est
rancher round here.

35
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,005
That's enough.

36
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,877
Come on, boys.

37
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,750

Do not kiss me Senora

41
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,270
Someone might come.

42
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,289
Then Garcia won't be happy anymore.

43
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,950
No one can disturb us.

44
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,654
you foolish Mexican.

45
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,986

That wouldn't bef t me.

62
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,283
Kill my father, hmm?

Oh, yes.

64
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,499

71
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,807
You must think
of my future. Ben, hmm?

72
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,906
One can get used
to so many things.

73
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,456
Have you been working, Frank?

74

81
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,113
We need the blacks to do the work.

82
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,121
And if there were trouble. . .

83
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,256

Of course, Pa.

91
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,393
Come here.

92
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,065
To hell with you, baby!

No. . .Why?

97
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,762

l'm content here.

101
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,509
Davie spied on us last night.

102
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,246
Ben couldn't get it up.

103
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,849
That's why he's so mad.

104
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,845
Whip me instead of him, Massa.

105
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,540

That was pretty good, Whity.

111
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,709
Yes, that's it.

112
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,744
Here you are.

Then she pull me onto bed
and scream should beat her.

He hasn't much onger to live.

134
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,266
Then there'll be no one in charge
of the Nicholson estate.

135
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,340
Or do you th nk Frank,

But you mustn't hurt me.

177
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:09,164
Don't l have soft hands?

178
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:16,171
Why haven't you ki ed my father?

179

You must be crazy.

182
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:55,096
Letting a N choson pee potatoes.

183
00:58:55,805 --> 00:58:56,772
He likes doing it.

184
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:01,770
Don't forget ...

185
00:59:02,311 --> 00:59:04,438

Frank was just here.

189
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,017
You insulted him.

190
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:23,021
Since when may a black ...

191
01:00:23,392 --> 01:00:25,189
nsult a white man?

192
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:34,203
You're the curse of this family.

193
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:41,035
You know you have to be punished.

194

01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:54,218
He's really crying.

197
01:00:55,424 --> 01:00:57,221
A human emotion.

198
01:00:59,262 --> 01:01:02,891
And always thought
you backs weren't human beings.

199
01:01:03,266 --> 01:01:05,234
You're right.
We're not human be ngs.

200
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:15,569
Why haven't you ki ed Frank?

202

Didn't mpore you?

203
01:01:25,288 --> 01:01:28,416
We wanted to share the property.

204
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:31,426
Just think it over.

205
01:01:33,296 --> 01:01:36,925
Who else wou d g ve

206
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:40,268

208
01:01:44,073 --> 01:01:45,267
She'll be down at once. m ster.

209
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:35,481
Hello, Ben.

210
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:38,660

218
01:03:11,394 --> 01:03:12,520
That woman's a she-devil.

219
01:03:49,932 --> 01:03:51,229
You can go now.

220

Tell me all about it.

221
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,584

She's just waitng
to inherit the estate.

224
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:31,435
We'l keep her n suspense
a bit longer.

225
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:33,942
Then wham.

226
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:37,108
She'll be out on her ear.

227
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:42,610
No one cheats a N choson
and gets away with it.

228
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:48,616
You want to keep her n suspense?

229
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:52,025

The pay's good.

01:15:20,288 --> 01:15:22,756
lt'd be enough for the two of us ...

281

You've no idea
what that family's real y l ke!

286
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:03,297
You realize why your father
killed that Mexican?

287
01:16:04,332 --> 01:16:05,959
Because he pestered Katherine.

288
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:08,302
Oh no.

289
01:16:13,175 --> 01:16:16,144
He had to pretend to be a doctor ...

290
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:20,307
and k d Kather ne
that Ben was about to d e.

He gave me money.

295
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,337
A handsome sum.

Here.

297
01:16:57,219 --> 01:16:58,516
To hell with it.

298
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:17,034
Kill them! Do them all n!

299
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,207
Free yourself of them.

300
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:28,610
You're a human being, too.

301
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:34,888

Why are you aughing?

308
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:08,138
She laughed at me, Pa.

309
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,073
You're the only one of my sons ...

310
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,247

Oh, no!

317
01:27:44,599 --> 01:27:45,657
Please don't shoot!

318
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:48,893
You can have the whoe estate.

319
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,063
