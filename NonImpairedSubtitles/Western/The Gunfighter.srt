1
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,298
- Hiya, Jimmie.
- Hi, old-timer.

2
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,531
- Give me a drink.
- Say!

3
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,408
- Just give me the drink, will you?
- You bet your life, Jimmie.

4
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,731
Do you know who that is? Jimmie Ringo.

5
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,051
Well, what do you know?

6
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,133
- Nice to see you again, Jimmie.
- Thanks.

7
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,098
Do you remember the old Buckhorn in Paso?

8
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,377
- You worked there?
- Five years ago, when Tim O'Leary had it.

9
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,974
He don't look so tough to me.

10
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,497
If he ain't so tough, there's been an awful lot
of sudden natural deaths in his vicinity.

11
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,971
- How many do you figure?
- 10, 12, 15. Depends upon who's telling it.

12
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,736
- I bet he ain't as fast as Wyatt Earp.
- In Dodge City they say he is.

13
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,458
Just two hands.

14
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,532
Yeah, the same number, it looks like, but...

15
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,090
Wait a minute, Eddie.
You ain't thinking of doing nothing foolish?

16
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,413
- You mean he's so tough I can't talk to him?
- I mean this ain't no joke. That's a mean man.

17
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,449
I just want to see how an important fella like
that handles himself. What's wrong with that?

18
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,772
I'm telling you, Eddie,
I wouldn't do it if I was you.

19
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,579
Chuck, how about a little service down here?
That's if Mr Frazzlebottom don't object.

20
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,653
- Eddie, don't you know who this is?
- You mean it ain't Mr Frazzlebottom?

21
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,860
- He's Jimmie Ringo, Eddie.
- It looks like Mr Frazzlebottom to me.

22
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,295
You ever heard anybody kid like him?

23
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,452
How about a drink, Mr Frazzlebottom?

24
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,890
- No, thanks.
- How's that, Mr Frazzlebottom?

25
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,130
- Eddie, please...
- Please what?

26
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,132
I asked the man to have a drink.
What's wrong with that?

27
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,212
How about it, Mr Frazzlebottom?

28
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,332
OK, partner.

29
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,378
I knew Mr Frazzlebottom
wasn't gonna pass up a free one.

30
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,850
Don't you understand, Eddie?
This is Jimmie Ringo.

31
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,615
So it's Jimmie Ringo.
Is everybody supposed to fall on their knees?

32
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,089
Well, you can be a little polite at least.

33
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,573
Mr Ringo, Chuck figures you've got extra
consideration coming to you. Is that right?

34
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,332
Nope.

35
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,733
How's that, Mr Ringo? You'll have
to speak up if you want me to hear you.

36
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,528
Why don't you button up
your britches and go home?

37
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,408
How'd you like to try to make me, Mr Ringo?

38
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,491
Now listen, partner.

39
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,813
I come in here minding my own business.
How about letting me go out the same way?

40
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,893
I want to know first what you meant
by that remark you just passed.

41
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,416
I tell you what, you just bought me a drink.

42
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,049
Now I'll buy you one and then we'll drop it.
Give him a drink from me.

43
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,450
Never mind a drink. I want to know
what you meant by that remark.

44
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,249
- Listen, Eddie.
- I ain't talking to you! I'm talking to Mr Ringo.

45
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,412
I want to know what he meant
by that remark he passed.

46
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,893
How come I gotta run into a squirt like
you nearly every place I go these days?

47
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,574
What are you trying to do?
Show off for your friends?

48
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,814
- Are you ready to back up that remark?
- Ain't some of you in charge of this donkey?

49
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,176
- I'm telling you, Mr Ringo!
- Eddie don't mean no real harm.

50
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,969
Then let Eddie keep his big, ugly nose
out of my business.

51
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,616
- Did you see that?
- Yes, sir. He drew first.

52
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,089
- Did you see it?
- Yeah. I saw it.

53
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,776
Yes, sir, I saw it. Except I'd get on
out of town anyway if I was you.

54
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,179
Why?

55
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,130
Because he's got three brothers
that ain't gonna care who drew first.

56
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,371
All right.

57
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,248
Everybody stay where you are.

58
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,172
- He's an hour ahead.
- Must be killing his horse.

59
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,411
Ain't doing our ones any good, either.

60
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,699
He can't keep it up at this rate.
That horse won't last half a day.

61
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,658
All right, put up your hands.

62
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,730
Now drop your guns,
right out there where I can see them.

63
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,178
Now get off your horses
and stay away from them guns.

64
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,169
Back up. Right back there.

65
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,254
Go on, boy, get out.
Get out, get out, get out.

66
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,615
Come on, get out.
Go on, boy, get out. Get out.

67
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,656
Get out, get out, get out.

68
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,289
- Can you walk?
- Never mind about me, bud.

69
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,257
You worry about yourself.

70
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,218
You've got three hours' walk
to Santa Fe. Get going.

71
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,939
I'm warning you, Ringo.
We're gonna get you yet.

72
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,059
- I know, I heard that before too.
- You had no right to throw down on a boy.

73
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,136
What was I supposed to do? Let that little boy
shoot me full of holes? Get out of here.

74
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,292
He was no more than a kid.

75
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,410
He's heading straight for Cayenne.

76
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,778
Well, you think you can make it?

77
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,694
Cayenne ain't no further than Santa Fe.

78
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,771
Come on.

79
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,492
- Give me a drink.
- Are you up early or out late?

80
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,256
Either way you want it, partner,
just so I get a drink.

81
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,651
Jimmie Ringo.

82
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,533
Where was it with you?

83
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,819
The Mint Saloon in Dodge City. You and
Bucky Harris came in nearly every night.

84
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,937
- Did we ever get a drink?
- Sure.

85
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,169
Oh.

86
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,057
Sure. Sorry, Jimmie.

87
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,971
Here. Remember now?

88
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,019
Yeah. I remember now. What about
something to eat? You got a cook here?

89
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,489
- My old woman is back there.
- You got a steak?

90
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,539
- I got a steak.
- A steak, eggs and a pot of black coffee.

91
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,690
What about a place to wash up first?

92
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,533
Right out on the back porch here.
I'll show you.

93
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,851
Never mind, I can find it.

94
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,296
You got a livery stable here, boy?

95
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,496
He's a little astonished, Jimmie.

96
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,890
When you get him unastonished,
tell him to take care of my horse.

97
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,529
Don't ride him, lead him. He's all wore out.

98
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,133
Archie, you heard what Mr Ringo said.

99
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,133
- You gonna be around?
- Hurry up, Archie. Sure, I'm here all day.

100
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,213
- I want to have a little talk with you.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,969
Never mind the horse. Run over yonder and
tell the marshal that Jimmie Ringo is here.

102
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,530
- Was it really him?
- Go on, I tell you. Run.

103
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,375
Will you please leave that blamed mop here?

104
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,931
Marshal! Jimmie Ringo is here, Marshal.

105
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,615
- Where?
- In the Palace Bar. You gonna shoot him?

106
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,010
- Who told you it was Jimmie Ringo?
- Mac. Mac knows him.

107
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,457
Mac called him Jimmie.
He's on the back porch, washing himself.

108
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,179
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

109
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,649
Get hold of Bud and Skeeter.

110
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,739
- Where is he?
- On the back porch, getting cleaned up.

111
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,735
I ain't after any trouble, Mark. I just thought
you'd want to know he was here.

112
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,699
Sit over there, Charlie. Stand down there,
Skeeter. Take the door, Bud.

113
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,134
Just take it easy and don't try to jump him.

114
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,453
Hiya, Jimmie.

115
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,054
Mark.

116
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,815
I'll be a son of a gun. How are you, partner?

117
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,891
I'm fine, Jimmie.

118
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,493
- Are you joking?
- Nope. I'm the marshal here now.

119
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,299
Well, I'll be darned.

120
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,098
- These barroom loafers, your deputies?
- Mm-hm.

121
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,818
- For me?
- Mm-hm.

122
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,051
You won't be needing them.
I ain't starting anything.

123
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,812
Are you sure?

124
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,939
Mark, that's the last thing I want, trouble.

125
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,011
All right, boys.

126
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,013
- What are you doing here, Jimmie?
- Just about to have a drink. How about it?

127
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,536
- No, thanks.
- Marshal Mark Strett.

128
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,411
Well, if that ain't a good one.
But I'm glad for you, Mark. Mighty glad.

129
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,652
Thanks. But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to move on.

130
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,016
Why? I ain't wanted for anything
around here, am I?

131
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,536
No. I just want you out of town anyway.
And pronto.

132
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,929
- Coffee's ready.
- Thank you, lady.

133
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,979
You don't mind my having something to eat
while we discuss this, do you?

134
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,894
Matter of fact, I don't know anybody
I'd rather talk to than you.

135
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,178
- Lady, bring another cup for the marshal.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,251
How about it, Mark?

137
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,860
I've something I want to talk to you about.

138
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,651
It looks to me like you've
got a gossip on your staff.

139
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,812
That's your public, Jimmie.

140
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,697
Yeah, I'm a big man now.

141
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,376
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Top gun of the West.

142
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,178
Yep.

143
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,651
I got more people wondering when I'm gonna
get killed than any man in the country.

144
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,733
You don't sound as happy about it
as you did the last time I saw you.

145
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,731
How many is it now? 11?

146
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,176
12. There's one you ain't heard about yet.

147
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,569
You really keep count?

148
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,174
Don't ask dumb questions, Mark.

149
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,129
What's the trouble now, Jimmie?
Somebody after you?

150
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,609
- Three somebodies.
- The law?

151
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,611
No. This is personal.

152
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,658
I don't want them to catch up with you here.

153
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,856
I don't want them to do that anywhere.

154
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,489
That's why you gotta move on right away.

155
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,816
You know why I come here, don't you?

156
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,733
I guess I do.

157
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,695
- How is she?
- Fine.

158
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,413
- And the boy?
- Getting on fine.

159
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,172
- I want to see her, Mark.
- Do you think she wants to see you?

160
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,530
I got something important to see her about,
and then I'll clear out. Where can I find her?

161
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,815
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

162
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,817
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
- All right, then. Won't tell you.

163
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,256
- You want a steak, Marshal?
- No, thanks.

164
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,932
- Why won't you?
- Because nobody here knows who she is.

165
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,969
She never even told the boy about you.
They've got another name and another life.

166
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,655
It looks to me like
that's the way she wants it to stay.

167
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,129
Will you tell me what name
she's going under? So as I can write to her.

168
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,609
Nope. I won't tell you that either.

169
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,730
Looks to me like you're taking quite a lot
on your own responsibility, ain't you, Mark?

170
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:53,055
I'm doing what I think is right, Jimmie. And
I'm hoping I can make you see it that way too.

171
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,575
How'd you like to see that street
out there full of gunplay?

172
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,651
I'd rather not.

173
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,896
That's probably what you're gonna have
in a couple of hours.

174
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,770
Cos I ain't leaving here
till you get ahold of Peggy for me.

175
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,376
- What if she don't want to talk to you?
- Let her do the deciding about that.

176
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,578
- Will you go then, if I tell her?
- I told you I would.

177
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,656
- Just tell her, not make her do anything.
- Just leave it to her. That's all I ask.

178
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,052
You'd better wait in here, not move around
much. I'll see what I can do about it.

179
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,168
If you got any squirts around here that
want to make a big name for themselves,

180
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,728
cool them off before we run into any trouble.

181
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,811
I will.

182
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,338
Boys, get on away.

183
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,857
Go about your business and leave Ringo
alone. He ain't bothering anybody, is he?

184
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,738
- Faster than Wyatt Earp?
- Pa says he's the fastest.

185
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,369
Jimmie Ringo could kill Wyatt Earp.
I bet you a million dollars.

186
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,816
- You seen Hunt Bromley around?
- No. What's he done now?

187
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,449
Nothing. I just want to see him.
Pass the word around, will you?

188
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,896
- Morning, Marshal.
- Morning, Miss Helen.

189
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,217
- He don't look so tough to me.
- Yeah, yeah.

190
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,532
That's the way it always starts -
he don't look so tough to somebody.

191
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,578
Except with this somebody,
it's gonna stop there.

192
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,733
It better. With a man like that,
you can't come off much better than second.

193
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,175
If he don't bother me, I don't bother him.

194
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,855
The only somebody that's bothering me
right now is Mr Hunt Bromley.

195
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,489
Yeah. I forgot about that squirt.
Have you seen him already?

196
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,413
No. Maybe you'd better take
a look around for him.

197
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,652
- Want me to bring him in?
- Just tell him I want to see him.

198
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,937
- But make sure he comes.
- I'll get him.

199
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,852
- And Charlie.
- Yeah?

200
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,977
Watch yourself.
Don't take any chances with that boy.

201
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,528
I don't aim to, Marshal.

202
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,175
- Morning, Charlie.
- Have you seen Hunt Bromley this morning?

203
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,299
- No. Not this morning.
- Tell him I'm looking for him if you see him.

204
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,211
Sure will, if we see him.

205
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,329
Huh.

206
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,208
Looks like it might be
a right interesting day.

207
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,251
- Carrie Lou.
- Hello, Mr Mark.

208
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,537
- Where are all you giris going?
- We got a holiday.

209
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,772
None of the boys came to school this
morning, so Miss Walsh said we could go.

210
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,294
- All the boys played hooky?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,168
Went downtown to see that bad man,
that Jimmie Ringo, that's down there.

212
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,091
Come on, Carrie Lou!

213
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,172
Mark.

214
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,775
- You already heard, huh?
- Yes. The children told me.

215
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,296
The giris, that is.
None of the boys came this morning.

216
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,814
I guess they're all around the Palace Bar.

217
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,937
- Little Jimmie too?
- I suppose so.

218
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,092
He's about as wild as the rest of them.

219
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,138
What's Jim doing here, Mark? Do you know?

220
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,337
- He says he wants to see you.
- What about?

221
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,811
- He didn't say. I thought you might know.
- No.

222
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,698
I didn't tell him anything,
your name or anything.

223
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,252
I just said I'd tell you he wants to see you
and leave the rest to you.

224
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,176
What do you think?

225
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,251
I ain't thinking.

226
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,099
I got nothing to say either way.

227
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,091
Well...

228
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,217
I won't do it.

229
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,736
I can fix it for you on the quiet
if you want to see him.

230
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,894
No. I think it's better the way it is.
Tell him I'm sorry.

231
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,971
Whatever you say, Peg.

232
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,775
Mark.

233
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,615
How does he look?

234
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,728
Just about the same, I guess.
A little older, a little tireder.

235
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,936
Not as cocky as he used to be.

236
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,375
Tell him I'm very sorry.

237
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,694
I'll tell him.

238
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,976
- Want some more coffee, Mr Ringo?
- No, thank you, lady.

239
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,090
- Tell him to bring that bottle over here.
- Coming right up, Jimmie.

240
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,096
Best stuff in the West, Old Puma Rye. Lot of
fellas around here won't drink anything else.

241
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,537
Why don't somebody chase them kids
out of there? Ain't you got a school here?

242
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,929
Sure, Jimmie, we got a school.

243
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,375
I'll get them away from there.

244
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,256
Get away from here and stay away.
Come on, now, get off there.

245
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,810
... broke his back,
jumping over a railroad track.

246
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,609
Stay away, please. Don't come back.

247
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,417
Jimmie Walsh! Now, just you wait
till your mother hears about this.

248
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,735
- But we're not hurting anybody, Mrs Devlin.
- You wait till I tell her you're at the saloon.

249
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,095
- Morning, Mrs Devlin.
- Morning. It's simply an outrage.

250
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,809
That murderer is sitting over in that saloon
like an honoured guest,

251
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,050
and the children are running wild.

252
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,018
I completely agree with you.
And five pounds of sugar.

253
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,375
And did you see all those loafers?

254
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,373
- You'd think it was Deadwood.
- Mark Strett'll get him out soon.

255
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,011
Soon? How long is a murderer supposed to
be entertained? How much are the potatoes?

256
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,897
Eight cents a peck. Two for 15.

257
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,494
- Half a peck.
- You know who'll do something?

258
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,255
- Mrs Pennyfeather.
- Exactly. Will you go with me to talk to her?

259
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,173
I will. Soon as I get
some of these lovely onions.

260
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,297
- What about you, Mrs Cooper?
- I'd like to meet her.

261
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,339
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Mr Marlowe.

262
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,298
Twist of tobacco, George.
What's all the excitement?

263
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,133
- It's that murderer, of course.
- What murderer?

264
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,499
- That Jimmie Ringo. Haven't you heard?
- Where's Jimmie Ringo?

265
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,619
Sitting right over there in the Palace Bar,
just as big as you please.

266
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,249
We're going straight
to Mrs Pennyfeather right now.

267
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,611
Hiya, Jerry.

268
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,491
What'd you forget?

269
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,369
What are you going to do?

270
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,289
Jerry!

271
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,931
Jimmie Ringo's in the Palace Bar. When he
comes out, he's going to get this in the face.

272
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,614
- Have you gone crazy?
- Get your hand off that door.

273
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,930
- That's murder.
- And when he killed Roy?

274
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,330
- You're not even sure that was Ringo.
- He was in the bunch.

275
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,457
But you don't know that.
That's just what people said.

276
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,772
Please don't get us in any more trouble.
We've got all straightened out now.

277
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,980
You're wasting your breath, Alice. All I know
is, Ringo killed my boy and I will kill Ringo.

278
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,257
Just as soon as he walks out that door.

279
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,976
- Did that boy take care of my horse?
- Getting cleaned up right now, Jimmie.

280
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,611
Here he comes!

281
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,457
Never do that again, Alice. Never!

282
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,008
I know what I'm doing
and I'm gonna do it.

283
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,731
Confound that boy.

284
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,778
Archie? Say, any of you fellas seen Archie?

285
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,533
Yeah, Mac. He just went
to the store a minute ago.

286
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,770
Archie. Archie!

287
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,091
- Here I am, Mac.
- See when Mr Ringo's horse will be ready.

288
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,729
- And hurry up, Archie.
- All right, Mac.

289
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,258
- Mac, Ringo don't look so tough to me.
- Then go in there and take a punch at him.

290
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,900
For what? I ain't got nothing against the man.

291
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,289
Here's the marshal. He'll shoot Ringo.

292
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,816
He can't. He don't even carry a gun.

293
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,289
Why aren't you kids in school?

294
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,538
Nothing doing, Jimmie. She says
she's sorry but that's all there is to it.

295
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,578
- Did you say it was important?
- I told her what I told you,

296
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,938
and offered to fix it up for her on the quiet
if she wanted to see you.

297
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,012
- What else?
- What else what?

298
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,295
Are you sure you didn't talk against me?

299
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,656
Who's asking the dumb questions now?

300
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,208
Didn't she give no explanation at all?

301
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,374
What explanation could she give
that you don't already know?

302
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,493
If I could only talk to her
forjust a few minutes.

303
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,970
How does she look, Mark?

304
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,214
Just about the same, I guess.
A little older butjust as pretty.

305
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,099
- Did you see my boy?
- No. He's on the loose today.

306
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,172
- What do you mean?
- Do you hear those boys on the street?

307
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,488
Yeah.

308
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,571
He's one of them.

309
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,451
Which one, Mark?

310
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,172
Well, I...

311
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,330
I don't see him right now.

312
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,219
If that ain't a fine way to bring up a kid,
hanging around a saloon!

313
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,213
- Ain't you got a school in this town?
- Yep.

314
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,010
We've got a school here.
You broke it up, partner.

315
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,572
They all come down to see Jimmie Ringo.
The big gun. The great hero.

316
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,970
Does my... Does my kid
think I'm kind of a hero?

317
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,655
Nope. As a matter of fact,
I understand he's a Wyatt Earp man.

318
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,097
- Earp? You ought to have taught him better.
- Me? Where was you all this time?

319
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,729
I beg your pardon, both of you gentlemen,
for interrupting you,

320
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,812
but this is a serious situation for me, Marshal.

321
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,219
What is it?

322
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,170
The truth of the matter, sir,
is that Wes Fuller is burning my house down.

323
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,933
- What's he doing that for?
- Well...

324
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,538
he just felt like it, Marshal. That's the only
excuse in the worid he's got. Just felt like it.

325
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,774
- Drunk?
- He certainly don't act altogether cold sober.

326
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,533
We'll go and see what we can do.
Wait outside.

327
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,814
Yes, sir.

328
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,530
And thank you too, sir, Mr Ringo. It ain't
like me to interrupt two gentlemen like you.

329
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,373
- Go on out, I said.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,248
- Are you moving on now?
- I guess so.

331
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,935
- Sorry it had to be like this, Jimmie.
- It's not your fault.

332
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,614
Watch yourself, partner.

333
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,054
If I write to you, will you give her a message?

334
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,529
- You bet.
- Thanks, Mark.

335
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,898
- I'll be seeing you, Jimmie.
- I hope so. But don't lay no money on it.

336
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,448
I'll be seeing you, all right.

337
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,295
- How much, Mac?
- No charge. It's an honour to have you.

338
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,779
Thanks.

339
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,208
Here he comes!

340
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,530
Don't grab this from your wife.

341
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,215
It's an honour and a pleasure,
Jimmie. Yes, sir.

342
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,098
We're old-timers, you know, you and me.

343
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,851
Jimmie!

344
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,248
Molly.

345
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,697
- I didn't know you were here.
- You must be about the only one in town.

346
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,578
- I work late so I sleep late.
- Work where?

347
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,732
- Here.
- What do you mean?

348
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,778
I'm a singer.
You've heard of singers, haven't you?

349
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,579
Want to buy me a little drink?

350
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,255
Sure, kid. Sure. But why?

351
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,808
Gotta live, haven't you?

352
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,691
But where's Bucky?

353
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,380
- Didn't you hear?
- Hear what?

354
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,930
Buck was killed six months ago in Abilene.

355
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,179
No, I didn't hear.

356
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,377
I'm sorry, Molly. Who did it?

357
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,659
I don't know. He was found in an alley,
shot through the back of the head.

358
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,131
Didn't he...
Didn't he leave you anything?

359
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,338
A horse and a saddle,
two guns and fifteen dollars.

360
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,895
I never heard a word about it, Molly.

361
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,448
Have you seen Peg?

362
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,451
Nope.

363
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,418
- Do you?
- Whenever I can.

364
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,973
Doesn't do a schoolteacher any good
to be seen with a barroom singer, you know.

365
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,733
Come on over here for a minute.

366
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,812
There's something I want to ask you.

367
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,535
Peggy wouldn't see me. Is it somebody else?

368
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,249
- You ought to know better than that.
- I don't. It's been a long time.

369
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,299
- There'll never be anybody else for Peg.
- Anybody else tried?

370
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,372
Of course. Pretty girl like that.

371
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,850
Young squirt named
Hunt Bromley got after her.

372
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,329
Boy, you should have heard her tell him off.

373
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,615
- What did he do to her?
- Nothing.

374
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,138
Nothing, really. Just a barroom loafer trying
to move in on a woman without a husband.

375
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,211
You know the kind.

376
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,971
- Do you see Jimmie too?
- Whenever I see her.

377
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,417
- What kind of a boy is he?
- He's a good kid. Peg takes good care of him.

378
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,095
- What is he? Big or little?
- Big. About right for eight.

379
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,171
Eight and a half.

380
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,571
- Look, do you want me to talk to Peg?
- Mark already talked to her. She said no.

381
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,254
Let me talk to her.

382
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,570
Are you in some kind of a hurry?

383
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,370
- If there's a chance, I'll stick around.
- You stay right here. I'll get her for you.

384
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,295
- Don't take too long. I'm behind schedule.
- I won't be long.

385
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,971
Hiya, Hunt.

386
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,131
Deal me out.

387
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,969
Deal me back in again.

388
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,856
- I'll bet two bits.
- That finishes me.

389
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,532
I don't want no more of it.

390
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,896
- Your deal, Joe.
- Sit in for a couple of hands, Johnny?

391
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,574
With cards I made?
I wouldn't want to do that.

392
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,618
What do they mean,
playing cards on a day like this?

393
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,897
- Looks like any other day to me.
- You mean you ain't heard?

394
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,813
- Heard what?
- You ain't heard who's in town?

395
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,655
Do you have to put your foot on my chair?
We ain't been out of here since Tuesday.

396
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,208
- Who is it?
- Jimmie Ringo.

397
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,858
- Jimmie Ringo?
- Uh-huh.

398
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,170
What is Jimmie Ringo doing in Cayenne?

399
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,172
- Sitting right up there at the Palace Bar.
- Now?

400
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,696
- Yeah. We just left him there.
- What does he look like?

401
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,977
He don't look much different
from a lot of other fellas.

402
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,211
He looks mighty average
to be such a big man.

403
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,532
- About as big as they come, I guess.
- How many hands has he got?

404
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,531
I never counted them.

405
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,009
He's got two hands, just like anybody else.

406
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,094
And somebody's gonna make a big name
for himself by proving that's all he's got.

407
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,535
A big name, right on his tombstone.

408
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,659
It's gotta come sooner or later.
You don't expect him to go on forever.

409
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,208
So far as I'm concerned, he can.

410
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,131
Do you reckon he's still up there?

411
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,098
Wait. You're good,
but maybe you ain't that good.

412
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,855
- How do you know I ain't?
- If you ain't, can I have your saddle?

413
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,419
Very funny.

414
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,698
What I mean, Hunt, you ain't ever
really killed anybody like he has.

415
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,296
What do you know? You don't know
everything I've done or every place I've been.

416
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,498
But you ain't ever been
any place but Abilene, have you?

417
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,209
Come on, let's go up and take a look
at this big, important man.

418
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,770
- I ain't finished cutting your hair yet.
- I'll come back.

419
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,977
He ain't too sociable.
Might not like people looking at him.

420
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,418
- He can get used to it. What about it, lke?
- I got a wife and a couple of kids, Hunt.

421
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,890
I'd better not either.
I got a mother who's my sole support.

422
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,972
Suit yourself, yellow-bellies.

423
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,294
He never was much fun
to have around, anyway.

424
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,299
Rye.

425
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,575
- Jimmie!
- You're Jimmie Walsh, ain't you?

426
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,699
- Ain't that your ma calling you?
- Jimmie, come here right this minute.

427
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,376
- Just a minute, Ma.
- If you don't come here, I'll skin you alive.

428
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,614
Aw, shucks! Tell me which one gets killed,
will you? But, Ma, the other fellas will see it.

429
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,249
I don't care what the other boys do.
You're coming home with me.

430
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,255
Jimmie Ringo's there and so is Hunt.
Somebody's gonna get shot. I want to see it.

431
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,097
Since when do I have to drink
second-grade whisky here, Mac?

432
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:36,334
- That's the brand you always drink, Hunt.
- This whisky has been watered.

433
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,696
No, it ain't, Hunt.
You know I don't water my whisky.

434
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,375
If I say it's watered, it's watered.
I'll prove it to you.

435
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,214
Give everybody a drink out of that bottle
and let's see what they say.

436
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,249
- There ain't a thing the matter with it.
- Did you hear what I said, or not?

437
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,251
I heard.

438
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,334
And don't forget the gentleman at the table.
I'd like to have his opinion too.

439
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,898
Please, let's don't have no trouble here now.

440
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,971
I'll ask him myself.

441
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,850
I want you to settle a little argument.

442
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,815
Why should I?

443
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,212
- You've a reputation for settling arguments.
- Only my own.

444
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,258
You could say this one included you in a way.

445
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,377
I say Mac waters his whisky.

446
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,930
Then you're kind of dumb
to be drinking here, ain't you?

447
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,298
- Taste this and tell me what you think.
- Don't trouble yourself.

448
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,453
You ain't very sociable, are you?
Maybe if you got to know me a little better.

449
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,417
I don't have to know you any better.

450
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,335
Looks to me like there's a squirt like you in
every town in the West. Get away from here.

451
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,935
That's kind of strong talk, ain't it, Mr Ringo?

452
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,172
- You're Hunt Bromley, ain't you?
- Yeah. You heard of me already?

453
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,050
Yeah, I heard about you. I heard
you're a cheap, no-good barroom loafer.

454
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,816
If I didn't have something on my mind, I'd
take those guns and slap you cross-eyed.

455
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,176
You're asking for trouble, Mr Ringo.

456
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,013
You already got it, partner.

457
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,857
Cos I got a gun on you under this table
and it's pointing smack at your belly.

458
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,091
Now, you gonna get out of here, or not?

459
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,098
I'm kind of disappointed in you, Mr Ringo.

460
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,208
We heard a lot about you, but I guess they
forgot to tell us about the gun under the table.

461
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,897
The older you grow, the more you learn, son.
Now turn around and head for the door.

462
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,774
Keep moving and don't do
anything sudden with your hands.

463
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,214
- I'll be seeing you, Mr Ringo.
- All the way outside, sonny.

464
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,372
What on earth?

465
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,612
We need three horses quick, Mr Barlow.
Can you let us have them?

466
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,009
I don't see any reason why not.

467
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,571
Marty, saddle up Prince, Fanny and Dan
for these men right away.

468
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,688
- You got some guns too?
- I guess I have, but what are you fellas up to?

469
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,739
- How far is it to Cayenne?
- It's about an hour's ride.

470
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,130
If you start now,
you could make it by ten o'clock easy.

471
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,688
But ain't you gonna tell me what's going on?

472
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,135
We're after Jimmie Ringo.

473
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,211
Jimmie Ringo?

474
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,492
I was the only fella in town
that didn't see him.

475
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,137
- What's the matter?
- Ma won't let me see Jimmie Ringo.

476
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,896
You bet I won't. You're going straight up
to your room until that man's left this town.

477
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,859
- I don't want to go to my room.
- I don't care what you want to do.

478
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,214
Please, Mom.

479
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,535
Now you stay in there. And don't let me hear
another word out of you about it.

480
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,058
Did you ever hear of anything so terrible?
It's like the town's gone crazy.

481
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,530
- He's here just to see you.
- Have you talked to him?

482
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,011
I just left him. Why don't you see him,
if only for a few minutes?

483
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,092
Molly, what good would it do?

484
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,049
- It's all over now, you know that.
- Not for him. He's still crazy about you.

485
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,656
He was crazy about me before, but that didn't
stop him from being the person he was.

486
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,300
He scares me, Molly. He really does.

487
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,293
He might have scared you then but not now.
He's different.

488
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,132
How different?

489
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,859
The way Bucky was different that last year.

490
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,297
You know, not wild any more. Just sorry.

491
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,610
And what good did it do Bucky?

492
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,170
None, I guess. But I liked it.

493
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,058
If only he'd have stayed away.

494
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,334
Is it somebody else, Peggy?

495
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,253
Of course not. You know it's not.

496
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,012
Not Mark?

497
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,250
Mark?

498
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,808
- Why do ask that?
- Is it?

499
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,734
I've never even thought of Mark like that.
Of course not.

500
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,892
- You think he never thought of you like that?
- I doubt it.

501
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,732
Mark's just...

502
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,813
Well, Mark's just Mark. He's Jim's friend.

503
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,209
You must be out of your mind.

504
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,098
Then it's still Jim, isn't it?

505
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,371
I guess so.

506
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,417
I guess it always will be.

507
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,377
How would you like to see
Ringo and Wyatt Earp square off?

508
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,372
I wouldn't want to be
in the same town when that happened.

509
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,250
I still say he's yellow. I gave him the chance
to show how good he was, didn't I?

510
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,457
You reckon he didn't have
a gun under the table after all?

511
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,250
I heard that. But both his hands were out of
sight, he could have been holding anything.

512
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,138
It took lots of nerve, though, to bluff like that.

513
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,691
- What would you have done? Looked?
- I wouldn't even have been there.

514
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,658
He was the one that ducked out
of a showdown not me.

515
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,494
- You ain't going back?
- I ain't leaving town, if that's what you mean.

516
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,617
Marshal wants to see you.
Didn't you get the message?

517
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,895
Yeah, I got it. I'll see him.

518
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,971
When I get the time.

519
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,373
He says now.

520
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,179
Looks like everybody's
drawing behind your back.

521
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,890
All the smart ones.
Come on down the marshal's office.

522
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,050
I'll be right behind you.

523
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,652
Just you wait until Mrs Pennyfeather
hears about this situation.

524
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,650
There he is. Charlie's got him!

525
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,892
Aw, shucks! That's just Hunt Bromley.
Ringo wouldn't spit on Hunt Bromley.

526
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,971
Come on.

527
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,697
What do you want with me?

528
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,817
Sit down. Didn't you get my message?

529
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,697
I'm here, ain't I?

530
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,738
How come you tried
to pick a fight with Ringo?

531
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,176
You don't have to worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

532
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,809
I wish I had $100 for every blabbermouth
I've heard say that.

533
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,539
He's yellow. I learned that much anyway.

534
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:02,298
All right, then, Buffalo Bill. I see it ain't no use
to warn you, so I'm gonna tell you.

535
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,817
Either I lock you up in a cell until he's gone,
or you get out of town for the rest of day.

536
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,779
- Which is it gonna be?
- Me get out of town? What about him?

537
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,012
When you're the marshal you can do
the deciding, meanwhile let me handle it.

538
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,614
Now, what do you like? The cell or the road?

539
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,498
Looks like you're being
careful about that killer.

540
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,290
I just don't want any great, big, terrible men
like you scaring him to death.

541
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,258
- How long you known Ringo?
- You want to be locked up?

542
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,059
- No.
- Then get going. South.

543
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,974
I don't want to see you back around here
before sundown. Understand?

544
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,130
You didn't say how long you knew Ringo.

545
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,577
If you ain't out of town in five minutes,
I'll have to take them guns away from you.

546
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,131
- Don't ever try that, Mark.
- I won't try it, I'll do it.

547
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,609
I got my mind made up now.

548
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,455
I'm gonna keep peace here today if I have
to lock up every gunny in town to do it.

549
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,929
Where's your badge?

550
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,048
Put it on. This is official. I want you to take
this scatter-gun and sit in the Palace with it.

551
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,177
If Hunt or any other troublemaker comes,
let him have it.

552
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,774
What's Ringo gonna think,
me with a shotgun?

553
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,249
Tell him I sent you.

554
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,929
How long have you known Ringo, Mark?

555
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,615
I'm gonna keep Hunt company
for a mile or so.

556
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,770
- I'll be back in a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,376
Mr Ringo, I...

558
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,532
I'm Charlie Norris, Mr Ringo.
Mark Strett's deputy.

559
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,898
- Mark wants me to sit shotgun at the door.
- With what?

560
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,974
I didn't bring it in with me because
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

561
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,972
- Who is he?
- He's the deputy, like he says.

562
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,369
- Where's Mark?
- He had to go out.

563
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,974
He'll be along in a few minutes.

564
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,450
All right, get your gun.
We'll have a drink at the bar.

565
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,531
Thank you, Mr Ringo.

566
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,898
Is that clock right?

567
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,972
Not more than five or
ten minutes out either way.

568
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,369
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- Not if you don't mind if I don't answer it.

569
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,930
Who would you say
was the toughest man you ever saw?

570
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,488
I'll tell you the second toughest.
Bucky Harris.

571
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,289
- You ever tangle with him?
- Of course not. Bucky was my friend.

572
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,658
Take it you don't want me
to ask you again who was the first toughest.

573
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,129
Looks like your business is on the outside.

574
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,337
That don't worry me none. Wait till tomorrow.

575
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,299
- After I'm gone, huh?
- This place'll be famous. It'll be like a shrine.

576
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,178
I'll probably have to put on
two more bartenders.

577
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,490
Maybe I ought to charge you a fee.

578
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,129
You name it, Jimmie, and it's yours.

579
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,259
- Are you serious?
- Why not? You done it.

580
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,652
- All right, I'll take it.
- It's a deal. Who's gonna collect for you?

581
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,413
I'll let you know before I leave.

582
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,410
- Where you going?
- I can't stand waiting. I'll take a look around.

583
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,695
All right, but I gotta stay with you.

584
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,098
- How much do you get paid for this job?
- 60 a month. Why?

585
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,013
- It ain't enough.
- What happened?

586
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,378
There's a fella with a gun
in one of them windows across the street.

587
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,293
If I hadn't seen the sun flash on it,
you might've got it.

588
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,690
- Which window?
- Stay away from the door.

589
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,136
- You wait here.
- But you ain't supposed to leave here.

590
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,452
I gotta get the gun away from that fella.
He'll mess up this whole business.

591
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,658
- Who do you reckon it is?
- I don't know. But I ought to go after him.

592
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,300
- Why don't you?
- Mark said stay here.

593
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,055
I ain't got orders
covering a situation like this.

594
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,656
Anyway, he's still in there.

595
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,369
Jerry, please. Won't you give it up, please?

596
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,578
Nothing is going to bring Roy back
and that's all we're thinking about.

597
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,848
Go outside and take a look.

598
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,016
If you want to find out who's getting ready
to shoot through that door, look yourself.

599
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,491
- You're the man in charge of peace.
- Peace, the man says.

600
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,731
- You better get out of here.
- It's my life too, Jerry.

601
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:06,848
Go over to Ella Mae's and stay there.
Keep your mouth shut.

602
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,931
All right.

603
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,614
Don't move. Drop that gun.

604
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,292
Drop it.

605
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,213
Put your hands up.
Kick it away from you.

606
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,097
Further away.

607
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,171
Now stand up.

608
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,379
Now, turn around.
Let's see what you look like.

609
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,652
I ought to blow your head off,
laying for me like that.

610
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,530
- Can I put my hands down?
- Sure. Just don't try anything funny.

611
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,930
- What's the idea?
- My name is Marlowe. You don't remember?

612
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,090
- No.
- You don't remember Roy Marlowe?

613
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,252
Come on, keep talking.
What are you getting at?

614
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,900
Roy Marlowe was my son. You killed him.

615
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,255
I never killed any Roy Marlowe.
I never even heard of him.

616
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,935
You killed him all right,
but you don't even remember it.

617
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,978
You're crazy to think I wouldn't remember it.

618
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,732
Are you sure?

619
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:42,056
You're not safe running around loose.
You've gotta be locked up. Come on.

620
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,811
Open it.

621
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,128
Now, move ahead of me.

622
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,851
Back stairs.

623
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,015
To the marshal's office.

624
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,689
You think I ought to go across there?

625
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,773
- Mark told you to stay here, didn't he?
- Thank you.

626
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,936
It looks like we've gotta
serve ourselves today. Come on.

627
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,418
- Where is he?
- He ought to be here.

628
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,208
I am Mrs August Pennyfeather.

629
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,536
- How do you do, Mrs Pennyfeather?
- We are here to see Marshal Mark Strett.

630
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,851
He ain't here now, ma'am.
I don't know just where he is.

631
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,931
We will wait.

632
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,771
Yes, ma'am, do.

633
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,295
Won't you have a chair?

634
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,258
Who are you? A deputy?

635
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,900
No. Just a friend.

636
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,417
He wouldn't be over there
arresting that murderer, would he?

637
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,175
- No, ma'am, I don't think he is.
- Doesn't he intend to?

638
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,334
That I couldn't say, ma'am.
I ain't sure just what he's gonna do about it.

639
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,298
He'd better be making up
his mind pretty soon.

640
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,373
This is not Deadwood or Tombstone.
This is a law-abiding community.

641
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,170
We want no murderers running through our
streets, shooting our women and children.

642
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,728
He ain't exactly running through the streets.

643
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,856
- He's a murderer, isn't he?
- Is he?

644
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,458
- What else, pray tell, after all those killings?
- I mean, maybe he don't think he is.

645
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,259
- Then he must be a fool too.
- I'm just guessing,

646
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:11,697
but maybe he figures
it was either him or them.

647
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,372
What do you mean?

648
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,135
I mean, maybe there was
some misunderstandings,

649
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,132
and it was either him or them
that was gonna get killed.

650
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,256
50 misunderstandings in a row?

651
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,457
Not 50, ma'am. Nowheres near it.

652
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,294
It was a lot nearer 15 than 50,
and I can tell you that for a fact.

653
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,894
What are you trying to do? Take up for him?

654
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,096
No, ma'am. No indeed, not me.

655
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,013
Don't you think something
should be done about him?

656
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,615
Absolutely. He ought to be arrested
or run out of town, or something.

657
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,691
He ought to be hung.

658
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,331
Yes, ma'am. There's a lot to be said
for that point of view too.

659
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,016
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Marshal.

660
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,050
- You're late.
- Late?

661
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,214
Yes, ma'am. I figured
you'd be around long before now.

662
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,498
- What do you intend to do about the man?
- Nothing, ma'am.

663
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,973
You're going to allow him to sit in that saloon
as he pleases, demoralising the whole town?

664
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,929
The trouble ain't been him demoralising
the town. It's the town demoralising him.

665
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:22,411
Some fellajust tried to demoralise him
with a Winchester. Is that what you mean?

666
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:28,211
We are here simply to remind you that it is
your sworn duty to keep peace in Cayenne.

667
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,213
That's right. And that's what I am aiming
to do to the best of my ability.

668
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,133
Moreover, we, the ladies of Cayenne,

669
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,498
regard it an outrage that this man Ringo,
a notorious murderer,

670
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,174
should be received practically with honour

671
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,014
and allowed to sit in state
in our finest saloon.

672
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,220
So now we demand, Mr Marshal,
that you do something about it immediately.

673
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,211
Such as what, ma'am?

674
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,770
Either arrest him or chase him out of town.

675
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,331
- What do you think?
- He's planning to leave anyway, ain't he?

676
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,217
That's the way I understand it.

677
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,497
What do you figure would happen
if I tried to chase him out?

678
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,893
I don't think you could do it
and keep the peace at the same time.

679
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,972
- That's what I thought.
- Can't you arrest him?

680
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,416
- He's done nothing here to be arrested for.
- Isn't he wanted?

681
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,856
- Not by me, ma'am.
- I'm just a stranger here myself, ma'am.

682
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,977
If you was to ask me,
I'd say hold off for another hour.

683
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,178
Don't do anything that might make trouble
until, say, half past ten.

684
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,411
If he ain't gone by then,
let the marshal go to work on him.

685
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,412
- Shoot him down like a dog.
- Exactly, ma'am.

686
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,298
That sounds very sensible.
What do you say, ladies?

687
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,977
Then that's the way we'll have it.
Thank you very much.

688
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,292
- That's a very reasonable, intelligent idea.
- Don't thank me. Thank Mr Ringo.

689
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,214
But of course.
Thank you very much, Mr Ringo.

690
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,575
Mr Ringo?!

691
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,651
Ladies! Ladies, please!

692
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,579
- I saw Molly. She said she'd talk to Peggy.
- I know. She's down there now.

693
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,379
- I'd better get back to the Palace.
- Where's Marlowe?

694
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,451
- Who?
- The fella in the window.

695
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,328
I arrested him for you. He's back there.
Are you gonna let him out?

696
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:23,210
Not until you leave town.
Wait a minute. I'm going with you.

697
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,328
I forgot something, Mark.

698
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,615
- Where was your boy killed?
- You don't know?

699
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,056
What would I be asking you for if I knew?

700
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,256
Tulsa.

701
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,731
Wasn't me, partner. I've never
even been in the territory in my life.

702
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,730
- When will them brothers be here?
- I've got plenty of time.

703
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,175
I hope so. I hope you ain't miscalculated.

704
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:55,539
They're on foot. I chased off their horses.
They'll do good if they're here by eleven.

705
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:05,217
- I've seen better fights at a prayer meeting.
- They ain't got as much spirit.

706
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,291
Go for his eyes.

707
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:18,338
Jake, is that horse in any shape
to go again today?

708
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,856
No, I don't think so, Mark.
He's near worn down to a nubbin.

709
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,534
- You got a fresh one here?
- I guess so. Why?

710
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,977
Have him at the back door of the Palace
in 15 minutes, saddled with Ringo's stuff.

711
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,097
Give him some grub and water
and charge it to the county.

712
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,171
All right, Mark.

713
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,571
Anybody working here today?

714
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,651
Too busy to work today.

715
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,977
- Hiya, Mac.
- Tommy. Glad to see you.

716
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,255
- Looks like Saturday.
- How's Ellen?

717
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,296
Fine, thanks. Give me a rye.

718
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,373
- What'll Ellen say?
- She said I could have one if it was dusty.

719
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,418
- Wife don't like him to drink.
- Don't blame her.

720
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,254
She knows I'm all over that sort of thing.
Too much work to do these days.

721
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,572
- Join me?
- Thanks. I'll have the same thing.

722
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,888
- What you got, a ranch?
- We got it the first year we was married.

723
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,130
It ain't very big but it's coming along.

724
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:35,852
Married the cutest little girl you ever saw.
But did she settle this rounder down?

725
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,853
That's her, all right.
Little, but oh my!

726
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,252
- How many head of cattle you got?
- About 400. Started at 50.

727
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,808
- Got horses too?
- We ain't got many.

728
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,496
You need more outside help than we can
afford for horses, but I guess we got about 30.

729
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,334
- Sounds like a right nice start.
- That's the way her and I figured it.

730
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,538
Takes hard work to make anything out of
a place that little, but we don't mind.

731
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,852
Grazing land's good, there's plenty of water,
so we're better off than many.

732
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,737
We broke even last year.

733
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,256
Sounds mighty good.
Have one with me.

734
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,970
No, thanks. One is what she said.
Much obliged to you, though. So long, Mac.

735
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:18,531
- So long, Tommy. Tell Ellen hello for me.
- Yeah, I'll tell her.

736
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,611
Nice fella, Tommy.

737
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,130
Kinda getting on towards time, ain't it?

738
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,819
- I'll give her till the last minute.
- You don't wanna draw it too close.

739
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,573
I gotta hear something,
no matter how close I draw it.

740
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:38,096
If Molly ain't back pretty soon...

741
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,571
She told me about Bucky.
Never heard it before.

742
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,652
I guess he never knew what hit him.

743
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,329
It's a fine life, ain't it?
Just trying to stay alive.

744
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,572
Not really living, not enjoying anything,
not getting anywhere.

745
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,619
- Just trying to keep from getting killed.
- That's what Bucky used to say.

746
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,136
Just waiting to get knocked off
by some tough kid.

747
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,415
Like the kind of kid I was.

748
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,574
And the truth of the matter is,
it don't pay much either.

749
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,938
Here I am: 35 years old,
I ain't even got a good watch.

750
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,334
- How'd you get out of it, Mark?
- I just quit.

751
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:30,015
It ain't that easy. How'd you do it, really?

752
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,260
Remember when the gang
split up after that bank?

753
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,776
- We didn't split up. They scattered us.
- Well, anyway.

754
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,613
Some of us put into
Prairie City to get supplies.

755
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,851
But the word was out.
You should have seen what we walked into.

756
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,578
Yeah, I heard.

757
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,413
- Did you hear about the little girl?
- No.

758
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,139
I got sick when I saw her.

759
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,577
- Who did it?
- It could have been me as well as anybody.

760
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,652
- You don't know that.
- It don't matter. I was there.

761
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,493
So when we got back to the hills,
I kept a-going.

762
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,617
I kept on a-going until I got here
and I asked a man for ajob.

763
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,329
Didn't anybody ever say anything?

764
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,218
I wasn't as prominent as you are.

765
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,094
- It's funny, ain't it?
- What?

766
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,053
That was the time
I could've kept on a-going too.

767
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,616
I could've rode right on back to Peggy.

768
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,290
I used to wonder about going back
and giving myself up.

769
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,452
I finally argued myself
out of that one, thank goodness.

770
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,337
- Mark?
- Yeah?

771
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,255
- I've got that horse out here.
- Be there in a minute, Jake.

772
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,257
Well...

773
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,491
I guess it ain't much use
my waiting around here any longer.

774
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,538
You can write to me
and I'll give it to her if you want.

775
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,259
It won't do any good.
She's got her mind made up.

776
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,412
No place she could reach you, I reckon.

777
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,138
No.

778
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,212
I don't know where I am gonna be.

779
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,212
- So long, Mac.
- Do you have to be going already?

780
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,495
Yes. I gotta see a fella up the line.

781
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,778
What about your cut of the business?
Who do you want me to give it to?

782
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,215
Who's the prettiest girl in town?

783
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,932
I used to admire the banker's daughter, but
I might have been influenced by her money.

784
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,693
There's Frankie Mae. And the schoolteacher.

785
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:38,457
Give it to the schoolteacher. I've always
had a weakness for schoolteachers.

786
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,977
Put it in an envelope without any note
or anything, and drop it on her desk.

787
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:47,292
Schoolteacher. Consider it done.
It's been a real pleasure to see you again.

788
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:51,976
I often think of the good old days in Dodge
City, with you and Bucky and the others.

789
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,698
Them was the good old days.

790
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,578
Come on, Jimmie.

791
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,811
I don't think people have fun
like they used to. Do you?

792
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,299
No.

793
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,848
Jim, got a minute or two?

794
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,410
You look fine, honey.

795
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,775
I'm doing all right.

796
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,377
I... come here just to see you, you know.

797
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,693
I know. Mark told me.

798
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,613
But I just didn't know what to do, Jim.

799
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,011
It's all right now.

800
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,299
- How's Jimmie?
- He's a lot like you, I'm afraid.

801
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,656
Don't you think you'd better do
something about that quick?

802
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,651
I was justjoking.

803
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,858
He's a little wild, like all kids,
but he's a good boy.

804
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,896
D'you know he's out in front now?

805
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,973
I took him away once, but it looks like
the whole town's crazy today.

806
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,938
- I never saw anything like it.
- I looked out there.

807
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,580
I couldn't see no kid that looked like me.

808
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,220
He's still there, I'm afraid.

809
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,734
- Mark and Molly tell you what I want?
- No.

810
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,893
I wanna get away from here.
I wanna get out of this part of the country.

811
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:23,418
See if we can't find us a little ranch, maybe.
You and me and Jimmie.

812
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,731
- If only you'd thought of this before.
- We can still do it.

813
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:31,052
I could go to California or the Northwest,
where they ain't never heard of me.

814
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:36,009
See if I couldn't find us a little place. Then
you and Jimmie could come on out later.

815
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:41,174
They would never know who we were. We
could be safe out there the rest of our lives.

816
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,410
When did you get this idea, Jim?

817
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,016
I didn't get it. Itjust kinda come over me.
The way getting older comes over you.

818
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:52,491
All of a sudden, you look at things different
than the way you did five years ago.

819
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:56,414
All of a sudden, I knew this was
the only thing in the worid I wanted.

820
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,494
You and me and Jimmie,
together on a little place somewhere.

821
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,535
It's a wonderful idea, Jim.

822
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,171
It's wonderful, but it's no use.

823
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,615
- Why not?
- It's too late.

824
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,419
- Why? Mark done it.
- Eight years ago.

825
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,970
But you couldn't. Not now.
You're too well known.

826
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:22,372
The only reason Mark doesn't arrest you
is that he's Mark and you're his friend.

827
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,179
But you can't depend
on things like that forever.

828
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,651
One of these days, the federal officers'll
pick up your trail. That'll be the end of it.

829
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,255
They'll never give up, not as long as you live.

830
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,529
What about South America? We can meet
in New Orleans, get on a boat and...

831
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,815
What's the matter, Peggy?

832
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,053
Don't you love me?

833
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,337
- You didn't have to ask that.
- I've changed, you know.

834
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:57,575
I'm different now, Peg. I just want
to be somewhere. Don't you understand?

835
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,810
Look, darling.

836
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,619
If it were just you and me, I'd do it.

837
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,774
I'd go with you this very minute
anywhere in the worid you wanted to go.

838
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,658
But it's notjust you and me.
There's Jimmie too.

839
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,971
- We can take him with us.
- No, Jim.

840
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:19,009
We could run and hide
and dodge the law the rest of our lives.

841
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,739
Not a little boy like him.

842
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,335
He wouldn't understand. Don't you see?

843
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,775
Jimmie.

844
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:31,648
- Give me another minute, will you?
- It's quarter past ten, Jimmie.

845
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,334
It's all right. I've got time, they're walking.

846
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,729
They could have run some too, you know.

847
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,049
All right. Just one more minute.

848
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,099
- Somebody's after you.
- Never mind that. Listen.

849
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,410
A year from now, if I come back,

850
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,049
if I've been all right the whole year,
will you talk to me about it?

851
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,179
- No, it's no use. It's too late.
- Just talk to me, that's all.

852
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,457
Maybe you'll feel different.
Something might have happened.

853
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,100
Nobody knows what can happen in a year.

854
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,809
But you gotta say
you'll talk to me about it again.

855
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,697
I will.

856
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,249
We can make it, honey. We can make it.

857
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,771
You just wait and see.

858
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,938
- Where are you, Grandma?
- Look...

859
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,490
Listen to me, Mark.
I got to have five minutes more.

860
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,218
You ain't got the time.

861
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:26,169
I know what I'm doing. Those guys don't have
any horses. What are they gonna do? Fly?

862
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:29,252
- What do you want five minutes for?
- I want to see my kid.

863
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,296
- No, you can't.
- Now look...

864
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,611
I'm sorry but my mind is made up.
So get him, honey.

865
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,453
I don't care how you do it
but get him in this room.

866
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,170
- Are you trying to mess everything up?
- I just want to see my kid.

867
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:46,253
- How can I fix it so he won't know?
- You can do it. You'll think of something.

868
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:51,972
But I ain't leaving until I see him.
Alone, me and him, right here in this room.

869
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,132
I don't care if there's 300 brothers.

870
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,971
Can you hurry it up?

871
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,051
I'll try.

872
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,972
It's been eight years
since I've seen my own kid.

873
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,656
And it ain't gonna be another eight years
before I see him again.

874
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:13,449
You wait here. I'm surely glad
you don't drop in every morning.

875
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,210
- Where's Charlie?
- Stepped outside.

876
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,768
- Tell him to come in here right away.
- Sure.

877
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,330
Jimmie. Jimmie Walsh. Jimmie!

878
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,570
- Ain't that your ma calling?
- Yes, sir.

879
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,220
Come here. Hurry, Jimmie.

880
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,211
But, Ma! All the other fellas...

881
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:41,897
Never mind the other fellas. Molly wants
to tell you something. Come on with me.

882
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,778
- Do you know his horse?
- I know it.

883
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,490
- Who learned you to bust into a room?
- Nobody.

884
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:28,529
Don't ever do it again. You knock first and
wait till somebody answers. Understand?

885
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,770
Yes, sir.

886
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,250
Now, shut the door.

887
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,375
Miss Molly Harris said you wanted to see me.

888
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,580
- Yeah. That's right.
- What about?

889
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,379
I'll tell you in a minute.

890
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:03,090
- How old are you?
- Nine.

891
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:07,173
- You're eight and a half.
- How'd you know?

892
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,649
I've got my ways.

893
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:15,253
- What grade are you in?
- Third. Honest.

894
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,854
You know what grade I was in
when I was your age?

895
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,771
- What?
- The seventh.

896
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:24,729
- At eight and a half?
- Well... I was in the sixth, anyway.

897
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:28,495
You was in the sixth grade
at eight and a half?

898
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,289
I wasn't far from it.

899
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,529
Are you really Jimmie Ringo?

900
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,453
Sure I am. What do you mean?

901
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,338
How come you didn't draw
when I kicked in that door?

902
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,379
Draw on an unarmed man?
I never did that in my life.

903
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,418
You gotta give everybody
a fair chance, don't you?

904
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,968
Did you ever meet Wyatt Earp?

905
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,728
Yeah. I seen him once or twice.

906
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,051
Was he the toughest man you ever saw?

907
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:03,930
In the bunch I ran with, we'd have spanked
Wyatt Earp's britches with his own pistol.

908
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,092
- Really?
- The real tough ones would laugh at Earp.

909
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,696
- Who is the toughest one you ever saw?
- You mean the real toughest?

910
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:14,738
Yes, sir. Besides you.

911
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,735
I guess I've never seen anybody any tougher
than a fella you've got here in your own town.

912
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:22,857
- Fella by the name of Mark Strett.
- Marshal Mark Strett?

913
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,899
- He's the toughest man I ever met.
- But he don't even carry a gun.

914
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:31,053
He don't have to, son.
He can handle them barehanded.

915
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,371
And we've been calling him a softy.

916
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:38,738
All I can say is,
don't you ever tangle with that softy.

917
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,811
No, sir.

918
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,697
What's the matter?

919
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,771
Nothing.

920
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:59,929
- I thought Jimmie Ringo was in here.
- He was. Had a drink where you're standing.

921
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:03,330
- Ain't left town, has he?
- Not yet. He got held up back there.

922
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,411
Well.

923
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,651
You watch here.

924
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,688
Now I'll tell you what I wanted with you.
You see them kids out front?

925
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,771
- Yes.
- Why ain't they in school?

926
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,579
We come down to see what's going on.

927
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:42,370
They got no business hanging around by
a saloon. I want you to get them out of there.

928
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:47,011
- But I don't know if I can or not.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

929
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,935
When I asked for somebody to handle this,
Miss Harris said you're the smartest kid here.

930
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,535
- That's why I've sent for you.
- I'll try.

931
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:01,695
Don't try. You do it. You get them boys out of
there the way Mark Strett would. Understand?

932
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,691
- Yes, sir.
- That's a good boy.

933
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,975
Guess we picked out the right fella.

934
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,131
He's all right.
You got a good boy, Mrs Walsh.

935
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,609
Take a look outside, Molly.

936
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,809
Get ready.

937
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,970
All clear.

938
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,051
Goodbye, ma'am.

939
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,734
You take good care of yourself.

940
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,811
Goodbye.

941
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,259
Goodbye, son.

942
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,808
Goodbye. I hope I see you again sometime.

943
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,050
- What about next year?
- Will you really?

944
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,496
You be watching for me, a year from today.

945
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,972
- Sorry, Jimmie.
- Sorry?

946
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,689
A year ain't nothing.
I can hide out that long. Look out for her.

947
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,977
- You bet.
- I'm much obliged to you, Mark.

948
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:03,532
That's all right, partner.
Looks like you're gonna make it after all.

949
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,138
Here he comes.

950
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:13,610
- I got Charlie out to head them off.
- Keep an eye on the kid for me.

951
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,089
- I'll watch him.
- I'll see you a year from now.

952
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,411
What you fellas doing up there?

953
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,173
Drop them guns. Drop them!

954
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,771
Is that you, Charlie?

955
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,168
Come on down here.

956
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:33,334
These the fellas you meant?

957
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,290
Come on out, you fellas.

958
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,420
These them?

959
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,536
Yeah. That's two of them.

960
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:48,529
I told you you was wasting your time.
Much obliged, Charlie.

961
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,339
If I was you, I'd hit Mark for a raise. So long.

962
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,698
How about it, Ringo?

963
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,736
Get his foot out of the stirrup.

964
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,813
I ought to give you this
square in the belly, both barrels.

965
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,969
- Hunt Bromley got Ringo.
- Hunt Bromley got Ringo.

966
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,449
- No! No, Jimmie.
- Please, Ma.

967
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,974
Hear that? Hunt Bromley shot Ringo.

968
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,530
Please, Ma, please!
We gotta go back, please!

969
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,771
No, Jimmie, no. Come on.
We've got to go home.

970
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,656
Come on, get away. Don't gawk at him.

971
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,415
We got the doctor coming.
Just lay still and you'll be all right.

972
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,417
That boy... Hunt.

973
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,979
- We got him. He ain't getting away with it.
- No.

974
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,132
I drew first. I was ahead of him.

975
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,417
I seen it. You don't have to say that.
I seen who drew first.

976
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,776
You heard what I said, Mark. I drew first.

977
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:55,012
Now don't argue with me.
I know what I'm doing.

978
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,330
You don't have to do me no favours, pappy.

979
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,331
Keep your mouth shut.

980
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,969
If I was doing you a favour...

981
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:09,331
I'd let them hang you right now
and get it all over with.

982
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,976
But I don't want you to get off that light.

983
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:19,690
I want you to go on being a big, tough gunny.

984
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:26,571
I want you to... see what it means

985
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:31,654
to have to live like a big, tough gunny.

986
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,098
So don't thank me yet, partner.

987
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,569
You'll see what I mean.

988
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,691
Just...

989
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,491
wait.

990
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,897
Now, you look h...

991
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,768
- Don't say anything, Hunt. Don't talk to me.
- You can't...

992
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:31,854
Don't talk to me, I tell you.
Or I'll kill you if you do. You understand?

993
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,490
Now, listen to me, yellow-belly.

994
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:44,415
Ringo's fixed you good. You're gonna get it
exactly like you gave it to him.

995
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,334
Because there's a thousand
cheap squirts like you waiting right now

996
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,332
for the chance to kill
the man that killed Jimmie Ringo.

997
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:57,336
But it ain't gonna be here, sonny.
Not in my territory. So get going now.

998
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,451
Get killed somewhere else.

999
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,170
And that's just the beginning, tough boy.

1000
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:31,095
I'm awful sorry but there ain't no more room.
Ain't another seat left in the place.

1001
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,614
- Is Mark inside?
- Yes, ma'am. He's inside.

1002
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:37,693
Would you tell him
Mrs Ringo would like to see him?

1003
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,214
- Mrs Jimmie Ringo?
- Mrs Jimmie Ringo.

1004
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,416
And his boy.

1005
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,491
Yes, ma'am, Mrs Ringo.

1006
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,531
Come on in, Peggy.

1007
