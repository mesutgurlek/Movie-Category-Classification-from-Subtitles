1
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,843
I've killed
for the first time in my life.

2
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,810
On 22 March, 1862.

3
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,484
As from today, the martial law is declared
throughout all the Territory of New Mexico.

4
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,860
Looters, Confederate sympathizers,
persons violating the curfew...

5
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:45,733
or illegally possessing arms or any other
people believed inimical to the Union,

6
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,102
shall upon capture,
be summarily executed,

7
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:55,476
by order of the Officer Commanding,
Maj. Charles Ballard, United States Army.

8
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:47,020
Can you recommend
a good restaurant here, mister?

9
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,445
I got a couple of dollars.

10
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,983
A man with a nose for grub,
usually finds it.

11
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,780
- Did you read that?
- I can read.

12
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:14,791
You will be shown hanged if
behold much as nails an apple.

13
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:21,563
- And would they? - I doubt it.
Many loud noise scared of looters.

14
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,726
As well as a solid citizen.

15
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:37,077
I would sell my soul for a
a roast turkey with chestnut.

16
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,518
Shut up, will you? I'm feeling
faint just thinking by it.

17
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:50,390
And a hand of chicken, and on
the side, a golden corn...

18
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:55,124
...all soaked in butter
with a touch of cloves.

19
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,895
Cloves ain't to my taste.

20
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,133
All without a clove is
a playful buttered corn.

21
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,939
If they stick cloves in my corn,
I'll sender it back.

22
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,882
A whole ham...
I can't stand the look at it.

23
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:27,030
The proprietor always closes at noon,
goes home to dinner...

24
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,628
and comes back an hour later. I
watched that grocery for a week.

25
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,307
I reckon there's a lock on the door.

26
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:46,143
But what I really need is a partner to
keep an eye open outside while I'm inside.

27
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,747
- Right in front of you. We split even.
- A third and all you can eat. - I'm in.

28
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,794
If someone comes along...

29
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,262
Times are wasted.

30
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,689
And Will be summarily executed...

31
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:40,730
Hello there, friend. Could you spare a bite
for a poor veteran who hasn't eaten long?

32
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,858
He sacrificed his right leg fighting...

33
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:47,802
...to free the slaves like Abe Lincoln
said was the only thing humane to do.

34
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:52,570
- And so I gave my legs for my country.
- Which leg?

35
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:57,705
This here. They made it out of rotten wood,
it swells up like a sponge in wet weather.

36
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,374
- So, I'll....
- Have you gone loco. You'll smash it!

37
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,853
And show a little respect for
a war hero, you cracker.

38
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:10,758
I lose a leg fighting and you just sitting
around and eating. To hell with you!

39
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:16,561
It's got to be treason. The war's
supposed only 30 miles from here.

40
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,069
It's all the fault of that traitor,
who surrendered at Fort Holman.

41
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,972
He opened the gates and the
rebels just strolled right in.

42
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,679
The great dictator,
the biggest in the world.

43
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,718
That shells are bigger as wash tubs.

44
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,016
Those Reds keep firing those guns
to break up the Union's ranks.

45
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,115
To keep our men hold up
like frogs in a pond.

46
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:49,132
Fort Holman was the best stronghold we had until
that Pembroke just turned it over to the enemy.

47
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,499
Do you think that guns
will be on top of us?

48
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,370
No, they're out of range of us.

49
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:03,873
- Well, almost probably.
- I wish they get this war over with.

50
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,249
I lost a son at Fort Sumter, and for what,
just to see these Reds ride inside my house.

51
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,221
Yeah, I was at Fort Sumter too.

52
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:16,919
I shot off so many bullets my rifle
lightly melted in my hand.

53
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:23,956
I had to spit on it to cool if off.
Maybe your son was fighting right beside me!

54
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,902
- 13th Brigade?
- Sure it was, 13th Brigade.

55
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,237
A real tough brigade!

56
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,303
Say, you wouldn't have a little grub
you could spare to an old soldier

57
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,679
that lost a leg?
Fighting alongside your own son?

58
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:44,551
I hardly got the corn
like he does.

59
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,870
Sorry. I have never could do.

60
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:18,720
Help! Help! Please, help!

61
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,588
I've been broke!
Sheriff, come quick!

62
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,754
There are thieves in my store!
Clean them all out!

63
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,698
Do your duty!

64
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,566
Open up there!

65
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:42,101
Didn't your ma ever tell you that your
eyes were bigger than your stomach?

66
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:48,217
And now everything goes right back
were it was.

67
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,811
Well, what are you waiting for?

68
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,982
The whistle.

69
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,452
Hey, you was not at sleep.

70
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,886
It's better you don't shoot. Otherwise
all the soldiers in town are down on us.

71
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,028
If I was you, I'd get rid of
that gun in a big hurry.

72
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:24,438
If they find it on you, you are dead.
Did you read that post on main street?

73
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,706
Ballard don't play games.

74
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,588
You sure had me scared, man.

75
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,431
You took the front lines too, huh.

76
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,705
There are more lucrative here.

77
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,687
Better pick in these rounds here.
And it's safer, too.

78
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:18,957
Hey look, we could join up. All I need is
a friend behind to see nobody's watching...

79
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,328
What about that cross?

80
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:28,133
Just maybe you're making a
collection for your private chapel.

81
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,573
You got it off the altar, huh?
Sure tell me you got there first.

82
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:38,707
I know, it's yours.
I didn't say it wasn't.

83
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:44,610
I have got a bag full.
And good stuff too...

84
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:51,657
What about that?
Nice, huh?

85
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,249
Oh God, my God, how could I?

86
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,757
How could I even think
of stealing the church?

87
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,760
When I think what a saint my mother was.

88
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,732
She has been dead a long time.
She'd turn into her grave.

89
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:36,933
She wanted me to put on a cloth in
her church, but look what I turned in.

90
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:42,479
Well, I've had enough of this kind
of life! I will be an honest man.

91
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:49,213
and be in peace with the Lord.
I'll give up all my belongings!

92
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,721
The results of my sins!

93
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:58,853
And thank you, Lord, for
making me see the light.

94
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:20,607
Repent, my brother, repent with me.

95
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:26,088
You can't imagine
how relieved I feel now.

96
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,859
Give up all the fruits of your evil ways,
turn them over to the Lord...

97
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:38,332
and he will rescue you!

98
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:49,876
You'll see the Lord will forgive you
if you ask him. Give up your bad ways!

99
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:54,849
- Repent, brother.
- Move.

100
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,650
Please, let me pass.

101
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,470
Lord has guided me to you!

102
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,603
Wait!

103
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,147
Wait for me!

104
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,811
Hey, stop a thief!
Help, I have been robbed!

105
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:35,085
- Hurry up, Sergeant!
- Then who the hell are you?

106
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,720
- What did they steal of you?
- I am the sacrist.

107
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:45,131
A gold cross was stolen from the church.
If we don't we won't catch the thief.

108
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:50,401
- What kind of cross is it?
- It's a gold cross, that big.

109
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,639
Covered with precious stones.
Come on sergeant, he'll get away.

110
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,443
Are you looking for me?

111
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,041
And for this?

112
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,147
- Is that him?
- Yeah. And that's the cross.

113
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,241
- It belongs to me.
- To hell, it belongs to the church.

114
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:35,915
- And that gun, too?
- That is right, sergeant.

115
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,682
Take it off.

116
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,794
God bless you, Sergeant.

117
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:49,559
- If you can give me the cross...
- I'll give it to the priest myself.

118
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:54,400
It is my responsibility.
I am church caretaker.

119
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:59,943
- Put the other in the car.
- Aren't you gonna search him too?

120
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:07,242
You can't do that.

121
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,445
I am the sacr...

122
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,024
- A couple of looters, sir.
- Very well, to the major.

123
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,348
Major Ballard, we caught them
to loot the church in Buckstown.

124
00:21:55,447 --> 00:22:00,192
- Send the one with the hat on over
to my quarters, sergeant. - Yes, sir.

125
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:13,741
The court martial says you handed Fort Holman
over  to the enemy without a shot being fired.

126
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:18,804
For God sake, why?
I remember at West Point

127
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,978
what you thought of Benedict Arnold,
and what he tried to do.

128
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,254
It's not important.

129
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,227
Not important? Our campaign in the
southwest depended on that stronghold.

130
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:36,561
With your best friend I wish you'd rotten
in that southern prison camp instead of...

131
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,864
coming back here to the gallows,
ordered by the Court Martial.

132
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,428
Don't let the thought of executing me
ruin your appetite, Charlie.

133
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:49,206
- They will probably make you a Colonel
for it. - It could be right.

134
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,282
It's good wine.

135
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,417
And what if I took Fort Holman back?

136
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,152
- They'll make you a general for that.
- You are impossible.

137
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,594
Why do you want to retake it?
It was you who gave it away.

138
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,099
- It's a personal matter.
- Also military.

139
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:16,867
Once I've done it I'd disappear.
You never see me again.

140
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:21,069
You have my word on it, Charlie.
You know me.

141
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:26,980
I can't risk it. I have already
lost a third of my men.

142
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,814
Not with a frontal attack...

143
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:34,948
...but from within.
Surprise them from within.

144
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:40,394
From the defense platform, called the
Pulpit, and across the suspension bridge...

145
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:46,163
- ...through the gallery and into the fort.
- You must be completely out of your mind.

146
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,603
- It's impossible to reach the Pulpit!
- It's not for me.

147
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,766
With a few men.

148
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,504
The orders are crystal clear.

149
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,345
- I'm not allowed to spend one more soldier.
- If the Fort's fallen, the route is to the north is open.

150
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,180
You can get reinforcements from Gen. Canbie,
you can take Santa Fe in one day.

151
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,191
Sibley is in Arizona with his forces
left the city practically defenseless.

152
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:15,288
If you're wondering how I know,
I just escaped from there.

153
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:19,130
If we capture Santa Fe, Sibley will be
cut off from his troops south of there.

154
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:23,900
You'll cut him to pieces and
chase him down to Rio Grande

155
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:30,378
right through Texas, all the way to New Orleans.
The whole southwest is yours again.

156
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,913
It could decide the outcome of the war.

157
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:40,854
I need twelve men... General.

158
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:58,437
- When does that take place?
- Tomorrow morning.

159
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:48,375
- What are you waiting for? Get it over with!
- Shut up, private pighead!

160
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,953
The Major has an announcement to make.

161
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:57,015
There is only... one hope that you still
have lo let you escape the gallows.

162
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:02,565
Volunteers are needed for a mission
which is as dangerous as it's important.

163
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:07,194
And if any of you are prepared to
volunteer, I'll release you...

164
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,570
in his custody...

165
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,004
Gentlemen, I can't promise you nothing.

166
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:22,381
Except a chance to die honorably,
and possibly live.

167
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,923
In any case, freedom at the end.

168
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,357
Donald MacIvers, mule skinner.
He fraud the army for $ 4,000

169
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:39,959
with a false requisition for a
live stock he never delivered.

170
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:44,666
- What about it, MacIvers?
- All right.

171
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:53,748
- Private Samuel Piggott. - Yeah, I'll accept.
- Murdered his commander at Sandy Creek.

172
00:27:53,838 --> 00:28:00,278
Then raped that officer's wife when she
discovered him trying to hide the body.

173
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,365
Ted Wendel, caught stealing food supplies.

174
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:16,735
- What do you say, Wendel?
- You bet your ass!

175
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:29,818
- This sir, we can't identify him.
- Well, I know this one.

176
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,481
The Lord set you on my trail?

177
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:38,254
It's better I come with you then.
But lead me not into temptation.

178
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,193
I thought you'd gonna whistle, you rat!

179
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,029
Will Culder. Stole vital medicines

180
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:49,594
and sold them to a Confederate agent.
30 Union soldiers died as a result.

181
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,506
What do you say, Culder?

182
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,306
Yeah, I'll ride.

183
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:05,616
Jeremy, half-Cheyenne. Killed a white
man for selling alcohol to the tribes.

184
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,750
You wanna come?

185
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,594
This is the worst, a religious fanatic.
Arrested in front of an army recruiting center

186
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,435
for urging men not to enlist
and assigning them rebellion.

187
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,805
Eternal doom awaits you!

188
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,505
Renounce war, repent!

189
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:35,950
- Are you in or out?
- The Lord is my shepherd...

190
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:46,493
- "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.
- Saith the Lord.

191
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:28,599
- That's the cross your wife always wore.
- Yes.

192
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:39,306
- And Sergeant Brent wishes to volunteer.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:52,426
Corporal, free all these men.
Except the last one.

194
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:58,092
What would your life be worth
out there with those cut-throats?

195
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:02,501
What's it worth now?

196
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,170
Thank  you, Charlie.

197
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,822
- Sergeant Brent!
- Sir.

198
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:09,730
- Organize  the men in some
kind of ranks. - Yes, sir.

199
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:17,939
Here is your authority.
Assume your responsibility.

200
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,413
Excuse me, but just out of curiosity
what direction are we going?

201
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,145
East.

202
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:03,089
According to the Colonel, we are heading east.
You've got anything to do back east?

203
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:07,891
- No, I don't think so.
- And what about you, Will?

204
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:14,631
East, west, north, south...
it's all the same to me.

205
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,538
What I don't like we're getting
told where I got to go.

206
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,974
Just you wait, you fat son-of-a-bitch.

207
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:27,072
I'm gonna see you're gonna learn to
whistle when I give you the finger.

208
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,311
Pig stinking fat pig!

209
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,495
If I ain't mistaken,
this is the Rio Puerco.

210
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,664
You are right. This running water
has the name Rio Puerco.

211
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:57,577
- MacIvers! - Yeah?
- What's "Puerco" mean?

212
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:01,047
All I  know that it's Spanish.

213
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:06,612
Ask the Colonel. He knows everything,
that's why he is a colonel.

214
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:12,184
He knows that it means dirty. But
he's too fine to use words like that.

215
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:17,062
- You should not have called him that, he'll
be offended. - He ain't no Colonel no more.

216
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,193
That's right, I had plumb forgotten.

217
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:25,969
They adjusted the gentleman out.
Because of treason.

218
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:32,447
No, I can't believe that.
An officer and a gentleman...

219
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:37,714
- He was discharged dishonorably.
- Tell me the reason why is not a Colonel anymore?

220
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:43,987
- Because he is a traitor.
- And we'll be judged by the company we keep!

221
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:49,030
It's time we separate the men from
the boys. Let's choose up sides.

222
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,034
Well? What do you say?

223
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:57,698
- Any of your guys want to
stay with the Colonel? - No.

224
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:01,766
I think it's a good idea to
stick with the Colonel for a while.

225
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:07,043
As long as he's heading for Santa Fe.
I got me some unfinished business there.

226
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:12,053
The Colonel is taking his assurances we'd
be to leave and he'd be there alone.

227
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,181
This is blackmail.
He has got our guns!

228
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,886
Piggott, I'll quote you an old maxim.

229
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,863
"The innocent will inherit the earth."

230
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,128
It's a long way to the sierra,
anything can happen.

231
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:31,537
- The first time he got of his horse, he's
dead as a doornail! - Calm down, Willie.

232
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,941
- Yeah, it's easy for you to talk.
- He sounds like a big man.

233
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:40,345
Sure, that's what makes an officer.
Without a gun, they are no better than us.

234
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:46,719
Something worse than an officer,
is one who suck up to an officer!

235
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:23,016
- He's letting all the horses!
- What the hell is gong on?

236
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,919
He let the horses go!

237
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:45,971
The horses are free,
but we're still prisoners.

238
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:54,583
You... dirty, rotten
double-crossing traitor!

239
00:37:54,672 --> 00:38:00,418
- Looks like you gonna walk to Santa Fe, Piggott.
- He's gonna carry me on his shoulders!

240
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:06,860
We're moving over to Confederate territory. 
So we can't do it on U.S. branded horses.

241
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:12,060
- Bravo, Piggott!
- Stop, that's enough.

242
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,704
I said, hold it!

243
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,978
- Just nerves. Why don't you guys relax.
- Just a goddamn minute!

244
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:30,178
Let's find out what this 
chicken Colonel has in mind.

245
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:34,745
We are on to Fort Holman, gentlemen. 
To enter it, and retake it.

246
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:41,561
- Let's go. We've got a train to catch.
- What makes you think we're going with you?

247
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:48,729
- Eight of us on foot are gonna storm that fort?
- You must be crazier than we thought.

248
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:55,835
- It's the job you men volunteered for.
- Yeah, but that was with a rope around our neck.

249
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:02,182
Well, Colonel Pembroke, it looks
like your mission ends here.

250
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:08,588
Speak for yourself. I want to know why the 
Colonel is in such a hurry to get back there.

251
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:14,652
He wants to risk our ass to save 
his face - isn't that right?

252
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,201
No, gentlemen, for gold.

253
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,104
- Gold?
- That's what he said.

254
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,110
- Gold?
- What gold?

255
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,616
Captured Confederate gold that's 
buried down near a sundial at the fort.

256
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,152
- That's what we're gonna get.
- How much gold is it, Colonel?

257
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:43,851
I would say, roughly there's
around $ 500,000 worth it.

258
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:48,363
- How much?
- 500,000.

259
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:54,164
One, two, three, four,
five hundred thousand.

260
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:59,867
- You can sure save a lot of face
for 500,000. - Would you repeat that?

261
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,173
Roughly there's around
half a million dollars.

262
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,909
- How much is Ballard's cut?
- No. Ballard knows nothing about the gold.

263
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:13,114
He send me out here to clear my name,
and win him a promotion doing it

264
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,420
He hinds us getting in there.

265
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,620
It's not gonna be easy,
but I can do it.

266
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:24,791
And if the eight of us can work together,
we'll makes Ballard a General...

267
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:32,000
and we'll be living high in good 
old Mexico, rich and free.

268
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,236
I almost forgot...

269
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,910
Gentlemen... your weapons.

270
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,977
- I think you're lying.
- There's only one way to find out.

271
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:52,584
- Yeah, by telling us where the gold is.
- I already told you. Near the sundial.

272
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,688
You better start paying attention to me.
If you pull that thing on me one more time,

273
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:01,964
you better be prepared to use it or
I'm gonna shove it up to your ass!

274
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:10,034
Just bring what you can carry easily.

275
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:17,986
You won't get anymore out of him,
even if you shoot his balls off.

276
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:37,604
There she is, gentlemen.
Our ride through the lines.

277
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:42,508
It takes us about a half
day's march of Fort Holman.

278
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,572
This will be a high grade,
but I know we can capture it.

279
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,675
Let's move.

280
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,458
This way.

281
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,866
Colonel, you made a mistake
sending that idiot, MacIvers.

282
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:25,277
- He's a mule skinner, Brent.
- The Colonel is right.

283
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,818
How much longer are 
we gonna wait here?

284
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:34,617
- We're going down now. Get your gear.
- Come on, redskin.

285
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:52,267
- Hey, Hog...
- What is it, pa?

286
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,446
- We've got company. - Good afternoon.
- Well, stranger?

287
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:06,954
We're just on our way to army headquarters and 
we stopped by to see if you had anything to eat.

288
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:12,153
Sorry, mister. 
I don't mean to act unfriendly

289
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,093
But you can't be too careful.

290
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:21,295
- I imagine you got a lot of funny people 
walking by. - Yeah, they come and they go.

291
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,863
Now you all come inside, behold, 
my daughter will make some dishes.

292
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:31,572
April! Put more plates on the table,
we've got guests for dinner.

293
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:36,584
The land is not too generous these days. 
Who comes from afar, comes from God.

294
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,415
Come in, friends.

295
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,051
A real pleasure to have you.

296
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:52,590
Go on, sit.

297
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:03,438
- Where is the nearest Confederate base?
- Up north. Fort Holman.

298
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:09,815
- Fort Holman? How far is that?
- 8 miles north, and a bit west.

299
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:13,116
Say, you wouldn't have a horse for sale?

300
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,852
A horse? The soldiers took everything
when they passed through.

301
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:34,135
You must be tired. If you want to 
stay the night I won't charge you.

302
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,542
Thanks, but we're over due already.

303
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:41,172
I ain't said Grace yet!

304
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:51,686
Leave us our sins, Lord, and 
bless this food we're about to eat.

305
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,632
The Dynamite! 
Get it from the stove!

306
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:03,831
We damn near blew up ourselves,
instead of Fort Holman.

307
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,204
There is no fire in it!

308
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,621
You just stay right where you are.

309
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:29,896
- Fred, line them up against the fireplace.
- I took you into my house, gave you food...

310
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:34,493
- Sorry old-timer, you heard too much.
- I didn't hear nothing!

311
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:39,062
- Did you hear anything? - No.
- They ain't done nothing to us.

312
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,303
All we need is a few hours.
We can tire and gag them.

313
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:47,940
It's a half million dollars
and our hides against theirs.

314
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:52,714
- I beg you, we wouldn't say nothing!
- We're not to blame if you talked too much.

315
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,791
God knows, nobody asked you!

316
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,536
You all look in the barn.

317
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,598
MacIvers!

318
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:53,544
- Why? - This is why...
To steal everything he had!

319
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,152
God knows how many they've murdered.

320
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,598
- Try this on. We need a uniform
- Who, me?

321
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,726
Yes, you.

322
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,344
Now we are only seven to share.

323
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:41,528
Let me see it! Come on.
How does it fit?

324
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,732
How's that?

325
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,319
What is that?

326
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,193
"Colonel William A. Morrow
from the security services of Georgia" -

327
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:24,500
"is authorized to travel freely in all
territories of the states, occupied areas"

328
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,768
"and military zones."

329
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,845
It could come in pretty handy.

330
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:47,761
- Come on, Brent, you and I buy a horse.
- Isn't that risky? - Yeah.

331
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:56,897
Take it. Gonna do any shooting with it.
You do as we end at Fort Holman.

332
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,407
And all that gold too?

333
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,279
Yeah, the gold too.

334
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,834
What's this? You make it yourself?

335
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,768
- Thank you.
- Well, let's see...

336
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:38,939
Malts, a sacks of beans, lard...

337
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:44,543
coffee, bacon, cheese, salt, sugar,

338
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:51,354
bread, whiskey... You'll buying
supplies if there was a war going on!

339
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:59,724
Whisky... what else?
Oil fuse...

340
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:03,737
- Gunpowder and rope.
- Gunpowder, that's right.

341
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:09,402
- That's about it. How much is it?
- I know I forgot something.

342
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,117
Corn meal, coffee

343
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:29,823
bacon, cheese, whiskey, salt,

344
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,199
sugar, lard, bread, rope, gunpowder,
fuse... There's something missing.

345
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:40,901
- That's got to be it. How much is it?
- I'm trying to think! Don't rush me!

346
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:46,743
Sugar... corn meal, whiskey.

347
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,853
Pay the man, let's get out of here.

348
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:59,326
I forgot to put down the mule!

349
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:05,094
- That's a hundred dollars.
- Are you gone out of your mind?

350
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:15,276
Bon voyage and happy hunting down south.

351
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,505
- How are you, Scully?
- Not bad.

352
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:22,948
Strangers here abouts?

353
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,988
Yeah, two hunters bought the whole store.
They didn't mention what they was hunting for.

354
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:32,652
They bought gunpowder, fuse and rope
and paid without bargaining.

355
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:37,755
- A hundred dollars in cash.
- Is that so? Which way did they go?

356
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,892
- Out that way.
- Thanks, Scully.

357
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:46,168
Hey, you got to live up to our
agreement as long as Scully do!

358
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,617
They was caught. Come on, let's go.

359
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:04,418
Let's see what you got there, boys.

360
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,128
Why? Nothing special. Take a look.

361
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:16,136
We won! We won!

362
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:23,269
The war is over! Hooray!

363
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:29,412
The war is over!
Long live the Confederacy!

364
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:33,079
The war is over!

365
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:42,725
- What's happening?
- The war is over!

366
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:48,792
- Who told you the war is over?
- A trapper up in the hills!

367
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,669
This guy he just rode in from Santa Fe.
He said:

368
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:57,643
"The only sober man in town was a
preacher." And he won't be for long!

369
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:05,443
What are we waiting?
He's no better than us!

370
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,285
Let's get drunk!
Let's all get drunk!

371
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:13,953
Victory is ours!
Long live the Confederacy!

372
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,827
Free drinks now, it's on the house!

373
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:56,331
Dance, buddy!

374
00:55:56,422 --> 00:55:59,835
- What's your name?
- Robinson.

375
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:03,861
Got any more, Brent?

376
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:07,028
Yeah, sure.

377
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:18,412
This is the first decent time
we've had on this stinking mission.

378
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:24,919
Don't give them anymore,
they have had enough.

379
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:34,389
- Give me that, Brent.
- Oh, come on.

380
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:38,663
- The Colonel don't want us to drink.
- To hell with him.

381
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:43,366
- He's an idiot.
- Give me the bottle, Piggott.

382
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:46,876
Piggott! Give me the bottle.

383
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:56,151
Go to hell!

384
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:04,924
Look what you've done, you bastard!
It's your fault we all go hungry tonight!

385
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:11,559
Colonel Pembroke, you gonna pick up
those beans, one at a time.

386
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:15,366
What did I tell you about 
that gun, sergeant?

387
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:21,605
- I said, pick them up!
- I want to see you on your knees.

388
00:58:59,238 --> 00:59:02,947
Now eat them beans.

389
00:59:10,983 --> 00:59:15,432
- Beans don't agree with me.
- I'll shoot them out of your hand...

390
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:19,970
...and into your mouth.
One at a time.

391
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:27,042
How's that for a digestion, Colonel.

392
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:48,661
That's enough. The party is over.

393
00:59:56,128 --> 01:00:00,736
- Always on his side.
- I'm on my own side.

394
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:04,872
He's the one who is gonna get 
me to Fort Holman. That's all.

395
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:16,259
Too bad. They was real good.

396
01:00:22,588 --> 01:00:27,867
- Thanks, Eli. - I didn't like 
seeing you down on your knees.

397
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,271
Worse things have happened to me.

398
01:00:31,364 --> 01:00:37,804
Why did you do it? They wouldn't have 
killed you. They need you too bad.

399
01:00:37,903 --> 01:00:40,782
I blame Brent for that.

400
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:47,483
Piggott was just drunk enough to start 
shooting after the Confederates landed on us.

401
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:53,758
- Is it that important?
- Yeah, it's that important.

402
01:00:56,055 --> 01:01:00,094
Half a million dollars will buy 
us a lot of tortillas in Mexico.

403
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:05,005
Oh shit, I wouldn't get on my knees 
for that. And neither would you.

404
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:10,547
I got a feeling there's 
something else behind all this.

405
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:20,412
The uniforms fits pretty good.
Now let's say this is the Pulpit.

406
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:26,623
And that's the bridge that leads to 
the gallery connecting with the fort.

407
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,668
Now, there's an alarm system, and it's
your job to see that it never goes off.

408
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:35,227
The fort with its gallery and 
suspension bridge

409
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:41,869
were all built to command the trail
that passes through a mountain tunnel.

410
01:03:30,009 --> 01:03:33,513
Well, Colonel?

411
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:38,955
If our little plan worked
Eli is inside by now.

412
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:51,598
- The Password?
- Confederacy and liberty.

413
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:55,076
- Take me to Major Ward.
- Yes, sir.

414
01:05:03,002 --> 01:05:10,045
Sir, Santa Fe prison camp has 
confirmed that Pembroke has escaped.

415
01:05:14,346 --> 01:05:18,886
- When?
- About ten days ago, sir.

416
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:29,834
I want you to send two 
platoons from B-company.

417
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:35,345
- I want a 24 hour patrol for 
50 miles perimeter. - Yes, sir.

418
01:05:37,036 --> 01:05:42,645
- And you? What else do you want? - I request 
permission to remain overnight at the Fort, sir.

419
01:05:42,741 --> 01:05:47,918
- Report back to your unit.
- My buttocks is awful sour, sir.

420
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:52,553
Don't get smart with me, soldier!

421
01:05:53,786 --> 01:05:58,860
Major, I respectfully request permission
to show the cheeks of my ass.

422
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:04,203
Show him the quarters, but 
make sure he's out by morning.

423
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:10,008
- I want Lieutenant Babbitt and Ryan report 
in this office immediately. - Yes, sir.

424
01:06:11,937 --> 01:06:17,546
There's no danger.
He's only one man.

425
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:21,284
- Can I make you a drink?
- No, thank you.

426
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,918
I would prefer to be alone.

427
01:06:39,698 --> 01:06:45,740
- Is there a sundial anywhere around?
- A sundial? - Yeah.

428
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,809
All the Confederate forts have a sundial.

429
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:54,857
Well... maybe up there by that cannon.

430
01:06:54,947 --> 01:07:01,387
There's never been a sundial 
here when I've been around.

431
01:07:02,388 --> 01:07:05,426
That damn horse. 
After one week in the saddle

432
01:07:05,524 --> 01:07:09,301
I just got about the most 
sensitive buttocks in the world.

433
01:07:09,395 --> 01:07:14,936
You're real lucky. Robinson and 
Hutton are out on patrol.

434
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:18,311
There's a couple of free beds.

435
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:23,513
Otherwise you got to 
ride out of here tonight.

436
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,600
You remind me of someone.

437
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:46,099
IS that so?
I've never seen you before.

438
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:08,595
What we got to do now is wait for 
dawn and the changing of the guards.

439
01:08:25,337 --> 01:08:28,375
Eli, good luck.

440
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:33,285
EMERGENCY

441
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:33,072
Halt! What are you doing here?

442
01:09:36,942 --> 01:09:41,550
I didn't know where latrine was,
and there were no signs, so I...

443
01:09:41,647 --> 01:09:44,719
Stop pointing at me.

444
01:09:44,816 --> 01:09:49,663
It is forbidden to come 
near the emergency panel.

445
01:09:51,123 --> 01:09:56,266
All right. Be quick about it.

446
01:09:58,997 --> 01:10:02,843
I can't stay here all night.

447
01:10:08,173 --> 01:10:11,643
- See you in the morning.
- Right, Sergeant.

448
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:20,623
Well, what the hell was 
taken you so long?!

449
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:33,839
- What is going on here?
- I was gonna pee.

450
01:10:33,932 --> 01:10:37,607
You picked the wrong place.

451
01:10:37,703 --> 01:10:40,843
Well, go on.

452
01:10:44,243 --> 01:10:49,488
- Well? - I can't do it when 
someone is around me.

453
01:10:51,016 --> 01:10:56,193
Please, mind moving 
a little out of sight.

454
01:10:57,456 --> 01:11:00,494
Come on!

455
01:11:20,545 --> 01:11:25,494
- You haven't done it yet?
- Almost.

456
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,896
That feels better.
Now I can go to sleep.

457
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:13,006
- Keep a sharp watch.
- Yes, sir.

458
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:21,645
It's almost dawn. What do we do?

459
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:26,450
We wait.

460
01:12:26,545 --> 01:12:30,186
- Piggott, load off the dynamite.
- Yeah.

461
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:55,077
I'm so tired.

462
01:12:58,043 --> 01:13:03,254
- You had a long nab. How was your rest?
- So, so.

463
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:07,922
I got to go.
Duty watch on Pulpit tonight.

464
01:13:09,855 --> 01:13:15,362
Hey, I'm afraid I can't sleep You mind if I 
come and get a breath of fresh air with you?

465
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:39,186
- Uh...
- Uh, what?

466
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:42,493
Uh, nothing.

467
01:13:53,165 --> 01:13:55,975
He must have been caught.

468
01:13:56,067 --> 01:14:02,040
I bet the son-of-a-bitch
is caught.

469
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:18,624
You got enough ammunition here to 
fight off the whole Union Army.

470
01:14:18,723 --> 01:14:23,331
- How did you manage to bring it all in?
- Oh hell, that was all here when we came.

471
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:28,468
You got to say about the Yankees...
they are really organized.

472
01:14:48,086 --> 01:14:54,401
- Hey, I get dizzy.
- Come on! Just don't look down.

473
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:29,271
- Lieutenant Wilkins!
- Are you ready to relieve me, sergeant?

474
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:37,405
- The great mountain air.
- There is usually too much of it.

475
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:43,077
- It blows you right off the bridge.
- Them tents must be kind of precarious.

476
01:15:43,174 --> 01:15:49,887
- They're replaced twice a week.
- And the men inside of them?

477
01:15:57,489 --> 01:16:02,165
- You like a cigar?
- I prefer my pipe.

478
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:26,487
- If you can spare a couple for the 
lads over there... - Oh, sure.

479
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,760
Thanks.

480
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:55,615
Thank you, Sergeant.
Mighty fine these things are.

481
01:17:50,869 --> 01:17:53,907
Pull it down a bit.

482
01:17:56,007 --> 01:17:59,011
I said, let go!

483
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,852
There, it's free.

484
01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:06,686
It's caught again.

485
01:18:06,785 --> 01:18:11,632
Hey, not too hard!
It's gonna break.

486
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:34,221
Easy... and pull!
I told you it's gonna break.!

487
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:38,590
If it breaks we start all over again.
We're not getting anywhere this way. Pull!

488
01:18:43,288 --> 01:18:46,701
Easy. He has got it. Let go!

489
01:19:10,849 --> 01:19:13,728
What is it?

490
01:19:13,818 --> 01:19:18,995
I thought I was going to be sick.
I'm waving out.

491
01:19:20,692 --> 01:19:25,471
I get me an attack, now I'm 
feeling better. Thank you.

492
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:09,579
It is best that you turn in,  you
got a long ride this morning.

493
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:14,479
It will be dawn in just 
a few more minutes.

494
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:21,362
I know, there's something familiar about you. 
I just can't put my finger on it.

495
01:20:21,452 --> 01:20:24,524
Yeah? Well let me know 
when you figure it out.

496
01:20:24,622 --> 01:20:28,468
- Say, were you here when the fort was taken?
- Hell, yes.

497
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,703
- And I tell you it was a true miracle.
- How's that?

498
01:20:33,798 --> 01:20:38,008
Well, we had half of Sibleys force
massed down in the valley...

499
01:20:38,102 --> 01:20:41,481
with orders to take the fort at any cost.
You know, what that would mean?

500
01:20:41,573 --> 01:20:45,316
- It would mean we'd been all 
wiped out. That's why. - Go on.

501
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:48,948
There we was, all set to go,
and then a miracle happened.

502
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:55,430
Pembroke hold up the white flag
and we just walked in here..

503
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,798
They're all the same them Yankees.
They're turning in like a flash.

504
01:20:59,891 --> 01:21:05,842
Not Pembroke.
He's tough as nails.

505
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:11,812
The truth is that Ward got 
his hands on Pembroke's son.

506
01:21:36,995 --> 01:21:40,966
- Then what happened?
- They send Pembroke word to surrender the fort.

507
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:45,741
Or he would hang the boy.
And Pembroke surrendered.

508
01:21:45,837 --> 01:21:51,253
- Smart trick. But he didn't hang the kid?
- Oh no, Ward is a man of his word.

509
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:55,848
He doesn't hang him,
he shoots him.

510
01:21:55,947 --> 01:21:59,986
With Pembroke free, I sure
wouldn't be in Wards shoes.

511
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:03,622
Why? What chance has one man
against a fort full of soldiers.

512
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:07,726
I wouldn't change places with Ward
for anything in the world.

513
01:22:07,825 --> 01:22:13,138
Being inside this Fort is safer than in a 
bank vault. Have you seen the alarm system?

514
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:16,940
Ward connected it to that suspension 
bridge to blow it to hell.

515
01:22:17,035 --> 01:22:23,111
He's smart as hell, that Ward is. They say 
he invented the alarm-system out of own head.

516
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:27,155
Kind of electrical thing but 
I don't know how it works.

517
01:22:27,245 --> 01:22:31,716
There's probably nobody that 
does but Major Ward.

518
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:34,660
Anyway, every time I cross that 
bridge it scares the pants of me.

519
01:22:34,752 --> 01:22:38,962
You mean that if the alarm is set of,
the bridge is gonna blow up?

520
01:22:39,057 --> 01:22:44,871
It's mined. If someone manages to storm the 
Pulpit and the emergency alarm goes off...

521
01:22:44,963 --> 01:22:49,810
the major, and only him,
pulls a handle or something.

522
01:22:49,901 --> 01:22:54,748
And bang, the bridge blows sky high.

523
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:59,744
- What's so funny?
- That alarm system.

524
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:03,189
I was taking a leak
right at the alarm box.

525
01:23:03,281 --> 01:23:06,626
If I had peed on it would
never have worked again!

526
01:23:06,718 --> 01:23:11,258
Just think, as for a call of nature, it's
gonna could have cost the South the whole fort.

527
01:23:11,356 --> 01:23:16,704
A good thing I didn't ground it out. 

528
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:22,342
- Do you feel all right?
- Sure.

529
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:32,814
- What are you doing?
- I've something in my jacket.

530
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:36,684
A dice.

531
01:23:41,853 --> 01:23:46,427
How much do you wanna bet,
you can't roll a six?

532
01:23:51,162 --> 01:23:55,406
- How did you do that?
- Now you try it.

533
01:24:17,655 --> 01:24:20,397
Hands up!

534
01:24:22,093 --> 01:24:25,563
- What's the matter?  - This one is one of 
loaded dice that belonged to private Robin.

535
01:24:25,663 --> 01:24:30,043
He took me more than $100
before I got wise to him.

536
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:33,911
- This uniform must be his.
- I found it.

537
01:24:34,005 --> 01:24:39,751
- Lieutenant Wilkins! - Who's that? 
- The sergeant at the watch!

538
01:24:43,314 --> 01:24:48,024
- Over here, lieutenant!
- What is it, Sergeant?

539
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:54,230
Look inside the jacket. I bet that's Robins 
too. This dice was in his pocket.

540
01:24:54,325 --> 01:25:00,401
I swear that I found it.
Mine was completely worn out.

541
01:25:00,498 --> 01:25:07,177
- Lieutenant, give me a break.
- All right, take him to Major Ward.

542
01:25:11,008 --> 01:25:16,151
Listen, we've had it here.
Let's retreat before we are spotted.

543
01:25:18,816 --> 01:25:21,956
Give me the knife.

544
01:27:38,956 --> 01:27:43,928
I suggest your men to relax
while you read this.

545
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,048
Sir!

546
01:28:02,146 --> 01:28:05,684
I am Colonel Morrow, Secret Service
of the Confederate Army...

547
01:28:05,783 --> 01:28:09,959
under the direct order of General Sibley.

548
01:28:10,054 --> 01:28:13,331
You are in trouble, Ward.

549
01:28:13,424 --> 01:28:18,305
- Well, what do you mean, sir?
- What do I mean?

550
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:23,435
I was sent here to check 
on your security.

551
01:28:23,534 --> 01:28:29,314
It is not existent! First I was able 
to pass with an elementary trick.

552
01:28:29,407 --> 01:28:34,117
Second: I was shown at your present,
without checking on my identity.

553
01:28:34,211 --> 01:28:37,658
I could have assassinated you.
Third:

554
01:28:37,748 --> 01:28:41,628
I had access to the powder magazine
and could have blown up the fort.

555
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:46,691
Fourth,... But why go on?
In all my 20 years of service...

556
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:52,036
I've never witnessed more flagrant
bleaches of elementary security.

557
01:28:52,129 --> 01:28:56,077
- But Colonel Morrow...
- There is no excuse!

558
01:28:56,167 --> 01:29:01,480
Sorry. I'll report detail
to General Sibley.

559
01:29:01,572 --> 01:29:07,250
I'm tired and sour.
I'm gonna need a few hours sleep

560
01:29:07,345 --> 01:29:10,758
before I leave to Santa Fe.

561
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:18,126
Sergeant!
You see the Colonel to my quarters.

562
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:22,534
Then you make sure that he has 
everything he wants. Sir!

563
01:29:22,626 --> 01:29:25,573
Thank you.

564
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:35,383
What are we gonna do now?

565
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:41,417
- We could...
- Yes?

566
01:29:41,512 --> 01:29:47,190
Morrow can only damage you if
he reports what he has seen.

567
01:29:47,284 --> 01:29:52,996
- That's right. Go on!
- But if he never returns to Santa Fe...

568
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:57,061
And then he'd never would be able 
to make the report. And then?

569
01:29:57,161 --> 01:30:00,631
- An accident?
- Oh no, no, no accident!

570
01:30:00,731 --> 01:30:04,907
Accidents are too risky. Accidents 
have a way to be investigated.

571
01:30:05,002 --> 01:30:09,451
Now he came here to check
on our security measures.

572
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:15,855
- And we showed him how tight it is.
- That's right.

573
01:30:15,946 --> 01:30:19,553
Now he claims to be Colonel Morrow
of the Secret Service.

574
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:24,998
Sir, I can assure you I have never seen
a Colonel Morrow at Fort Holman.

575
01:30:25,089 --> 01:30:28,332
He is a Yankee saboteur.

576
01:30:28,426 --> 01:30:32,101
That's right out of the nose.

577
01:30:32,196 --> 01:30:39,080
- What do we do with a Yankee saboteur?
- We execute them.

578
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:43,277
And all they can do is commend us
for being so...

579
01:30:43,374 --> 01:30:47,015
For being so... efficient.

580
01:30:47,111 --> 01:30:54,051
And now, Lieutenant, I want you 
to keep him under guard

581
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:59,692
and then when morning comes you show
him all the southern hospitality.

582
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:06,105
Let him show you the
cheeks of his ass...

583
01:31:06,197 --> 01:31:08,871
And then you shoot his ass off.

584
01:31:37,027 --> 01:31:40,236
Halt! Who goes there?
Halt, or I will shoot!

585
01:31:43,033 --> 01:31:45,639
Halt!

586
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:50,378
Emergency alarm! The fort is under attack!

587
01:32:01,285 --> 01:32:03,925
On the double!

588
01:32:04,021 --> 01:32:07,332
Man, at battlement!

589
01:32:09,727 --> 01:32:13,539
- What the hell is going on?
- They're attacking the Pulpit.

590
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:17,477
- Pembroke. How many are there?
- I don't know, sir.

591
01:32:17,568 --> 01:32:23,109
- But it must be serious. They sounded
the emergency alarm. - The bridge.

592
01:32:37,388 --> 01:32:42,804
Second platoon, follow me!

593
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:51,002
Piggott, you and the Indian guard
the other end of this gallery.

594
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:14,490
- Get some men and cover the tunnel!
- You men!

595
01:34:15,452 --> 01:34:19,366
- Bring a machine gun, on the double!
- You must take cover, please sir.

596
01:34:55,959 --> 01:35:00,840
We'll never get out of this
trap by ourselves.

597
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:09,117
- What are you looking for?
- There is a ventilation shaft behind us.

598
01:35:09,206 --> 01:35:13,677
If we can break through then we can 
get right to the top. Find me a pick.

599
01:35:23,353 --> 01:35:25,890
Soldier!

600
01:35:25,989 --> 01:35:29,732
Back to your post!

601
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:36,142
There's no time for court martial
Execution on the spot!

602
01:35:37,234 --> 01:35:40,738
I've been looking for you, Colonel.
We're almost out of ammunition.

603
01:35:40,838 --> 01:35:44,843
- There is a powder magazine. Take everything 
you need. Give him a hand. - Right.

604
01:36:16,573 --> 01:36:19,349
He is dead.

605
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:32,400
- Are you finished?
- Just about. What are they doing out there?

606
01:36:32,489 --> 01:36:35,265
They are waiting.

607
01:36:41,799 --> 01:36:45,645
They are blocked in the magazine.
Get all guns...

608
01:36:45,736 --> 01:36:49,445
and keep them faced towards the tunnel.

609
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:52,851
What can we do now, sir?

610
01:36:52,943 --> 01:36:56,322
Well, Napoleon said there is a time
to fight and a time to wait.

611
01:36:56,413 --> 01:36:59,553
So that's what we're gonna do, 
sergeant. We're gonna wait.

612
01:37:01,185 --> 01:37:04,029
Call the others.

613
01:37:26,009 --> 01:37:28,785
Against the wall. Stand still!

614
01:37:49,132 --> 01:37:54,104
- Why don't you try thinking of us!
- What's the matter, Brent?

615
01:37:55,706 --> 01:37:57,947
Are you scared?

616
01:38:21,431 --> 01:38:23,570
Go on.

617
01:38:23,667 --> 01:38:26,910
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

618
01:38:27,004 --> 01:38:33,046
- You say you saw that man in the alarm box.
- Yes sir, and he was acting suspicious.

619
01:38:33,143 --> 01:38:38,593
You better take four men and surround
my quarters. He may escape.

620
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:48,032
You know the prisoner Colonel Morrow...
He's a real spy.

621
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:52,699
A saboteur. He came in here
in order to make way for the others.

622
01:38:59,569 --> 01:39:01,947
Hey! Down there!

623
01:39:07,377 --> 01:39:10,290
Get on down that machine gun!
Come on!

624
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:15,955
Ward! It's me, Ward.

625
01:39:16,053 --> 01:39:20,229
I've come to get you!

626
01:40:19,316 --> 01:40:23,731
Get that machine gun over there.
Go on! Help him.

627
01:41:18,909 --> 01:41:21,583
Sergeant!

628
01:41:21,678 --> 01:41:25,922
- Place your men on the wall!
- Let's go up! Come on, men.

629
01:42:16,967 --> 01:42:19,641
Here.

630
01:43:52,996 --> 01:43:56,671
Hold your fire, we surrender!

631
01:44:20,657 --> 01:44:23,297
Hey Brent, are you crazy?

632
01:44:23,393 --> 01:44:27,933
- Stop shooting, they're surrendering!
- Go fuck yourselves!

633
01:45:02,465 --> 01:45:04,809
Good man!

634
01:45:10,206 --> 01:45:14,177
- Somebody has got to stop him.
- Wait!

635
01:45:26,189 --> 01:45:30,865
- He's after Eli!
- Better get there quick, Piggott.

636
01:46:07,764 --> 01:46:10,802
Ward!

637
01:46:11,668 --> 01:46:15,206
It's all over!

638
01:46:15,305 --> 01:46:18,752
Come on out!

639
01:46:20,443 --> 01:46:24,949
You're finished!

640
01:47:15,231 --> 01:47:19,805
Hold it, Pembroke! Now you're gonna
tell me where the gold is hidden!

641
01:47:21,538 --> 01:47:26,544
I didn't risk my hide...
just to make a hero out of you.

642
01:47:26,643 --> 01:47:30,955
You got to pay off, right now!

643
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,890
Fucking...!

644
01:47:46,296 --> 01:47:50,938
Eli... you son-of-a...

645
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:10,390
Let me remind you, Colonel. There is
a military procedure for surrender.

646
01:48:10,487 --> 01:48:13,593
Congratulations!

647
01:48:59,235 --> 01:49:02,580
He was innocent.

648
01:50:52,115 --> 01:50:56,723
Today I have killed
for the first time.

649
01:51:03,292 --> 01:51:07,297
And it's the last for me.
