doesn't have the same nutrients.

01:14:07,963 --> 01:14:10,454
Please, I need you.

1076
01:15:34,016 --> 01:15:35,950
Thank you.

1077
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:45,985
Her fever broke just after dawn.

1078
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:48,962
I'm glad, Mrs. Pine.
She's not out of the woods yet.

1079
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:51,659
She'll need to continue treatment
for at least two weeks.

1080
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:53,167
Anything you say.

1081
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:56,227
And I want you eating solid food
as soon as you feel up to it.

1082
01:15:56,305 --> 01:15:58,398
Thank you so much, Dr. Simpson.

1083
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:09,947
[Belinda ]
I've gotten to all the townspeople.

1084
01:16:10,018 --> 01:16:14,751
Not everyone has responded, but the worst off
will probably come around in a few days.

1085
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:19,419
Good. I'll take that batch up to the kids
and bottle the rest for the town.

1086
01:16:22,898 --> 01:16:24,991
Belinda.

1087
01:16:30,606 --> 01:16:32,631
[ Chuckles ]

1088
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:40,715
[ Snaps Fingers ]

1089
01:16:40,883 --> 01:16:43,647
[ Clucking ]

1090
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:50,458
Looks like he got away from you.

1091
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:53,495
Uh, I know.

1092
01:16:53,562 --> 01:16:57,191
I should be helping inside.
But it gets so stuffy in there.

1093
01:16:57,266 --> 01:17:00,030
Well, no girl should be
cooped up inside all day.

1094
01:17:03,672 --> 01:17:07,233
Miss Clarence says that thing
ain't run well since Buchanan was in office.

1095
01:17:07,309 --> 01:17:09,402
And if it’s rusted through again...

1096
01:17:09,478 --> 01:17:11,412
might need Mr. Owens to fix it.

1097
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,883
Lillian, a woman is just as capable
at fixing a water pump as a man.

1098
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:19,387
Sure, if you had a wrench.

1099
01:17:19,454 --> 01:17:22,981
- Do you got a wrench?
- No.

1100
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:26,391
I better go in and tell
Mr. Owens about the pump.

1101
01:17:26,461 --> 01:17:30,693
But if you need water now,
the well is right through those trees.

1102
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:32,893
Come on.
I'll show you.

1103
01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:46,480
It's just right back there.

1104
01:17:47,516 --> 01:17:49,450
Thank you.

1105
01:18:17,942 --> 01:18:19,876
Lillian told me about the water pump.

1106
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:23,141
I'll get it fixed right away. You wanna
stay away from the water in this well.

1107
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:26,547
- You knew it looked like this.
- The town hasn't used it in a few years.

1108
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,608
Ever since we got
the water pumps up and running.

1109
01:18:28,686 --> 01:18:31,746
How long have people
been dumping into the well?

1110
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:34,724
I'm not sure.
Mayor tried to board it up a few years ago...

1111
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:38,091
but people would just rip the planks off
and use it anyway.

1112
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:41,757
I've known about it for a while,
but I'm not sure when it started.

1113
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:45,234
- Thank you.
- Where you headed?

1114
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:48,966
I need to tell the mayor to stop
the town from using the water pumps.

1115
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,067
- Why?
- You want me to tell the people in town...

1116
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:55,078
to stop using water.

1117
01:18:55,146 --> 01:18:58,775
Yes. Or at least
boil the water for two minutes.

1118
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,045
Because the well is just not safe.

1119
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,087
I know the well isn't safe.

1120
01:19:03,154 --> 01:19:05,179
That's why we use the pumps.

1121
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:07,656
Except all of the water
comes from the same place.

1122
01:19:07,725 --> 01:19:11,456
People have been dumping rotted wood
and rusted metal in it for months now...

1123
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:13,997
both of which are a breeding ground
for bacteria.

1124
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:18,434
The germs spread through the water, and
you accidentally contaminated the entire system.

1125
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,028
Which is why none of the farmers
got sick.

1126
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:23,767
See, they're too far away
from the well to be affected.

1127
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:26,935
It started at the orphanage
and moved toward the town.

1128
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:29,673
But the well is separate from the pumps.

1129
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:31,977
Not really.

1130
01:19:32,049 --> 01:19:36,110
All of the town's water runs together
underground. It's just like a pond.

1131
01:19:36,187 --> 01:19:38,052
You only have
three pumps in town, Mayor...

1132
01:19:38,122 --> 01:19:40,955
all of which are only
a quarter of a mile away.

1133
01:19:41,025 --> 01:19:43,425
Once the well was contaminated,
it was just a matter of time...

1134
01:19:43,494 --> 01:19:45,121
before it spread to the groundwater.

1135
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:48,063
Mayor, if people continue
to drink this water...

1136
01:19:48,132 --> 01:19:50,066
people will continue to get sick.

1137
01:19:50,134 --> 01:19:53,570
- But the sickness came from the orphans.
- No.

1138
01:19:53,638 --> 01:19:56,163
It came from the water
under the orphanage.

1139
01:19:57,175 --> 01:20:00,076
It's just like Miss Clarence said-

1140
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:03,307
We left that place to rot,
and now we're paying for it.

1141
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:07,715
I had no idea this was going on.
Y- You have to understand that.

1142
01:20:07,785 --> 01:20:09,912
There's no need to place blame.

1143
01:20:09,987 --> 01:20:13,548
Doesn't matter how it happened, just as long
as we fix it and it never happens again.

1144
01:20:15,092 --> 01:20:16,423
[ Sighs ]

1145
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:26,265
I will be here
for as long as you need me...

1146
01:20:26,337 --> 01:20:29,204
so there are no excuses
getting out of bed.

1147
01:20:29,273 --> 01:20:33,801
I'm not sure- Lillian-
what she'll do with herself...

1148
01:20:33,878 --> 01:20:36,711
when you're not around here so much.

1149
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:39,443
She's become so attached to you.

1150
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:42,884
Oh, we'll see each other.
It's an orphanage.

1151
01:20:42,954 --> 01:20:46,355
The splinters and hay fever alone
will keep me busy for years.

1152
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,360
You get some rest.

1153
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:55,396
Ah- Ow.

1154
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,627
Oh.

1155
01:20:57,702 --> 01:21:01,069
Oh, thank you, dear. Oh.

1156
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:10,975
- I'm gonna catch you!
- You can't catch me! Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1157
01:21:15,686 --> 01:21:18,621
You know, I was never very good at those.

1158
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:21,715
- They always fell apart.
- I can teach you.

1159
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,817
I'd like that.

1160
01:21:23,895 --> 01:21:26,386
[ Chuckles ]

1161
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,659
I guess you gotta get back to...

1162
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,792
helping the rest of the town.

1163
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:34,363
You make it sound
like I'm going somewhere.

1164
01:21:34,438 --> 01:21:36,804
My office is right down the street.

1165
01:21:36,874 --> 01:21:41,038
I know.
But we're only allowed out of the yard...

1166
01:21:41,112 --> 01:21:44,172
when Miss Clarence takes us
to the general store...

1167
01:21:44,248 --> 01:21:46,876
to get a penny candy
for somebody's birthday.

1168
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:50,887
- Then I'll just have to come visit you.
- Yeah.

1169
01:21:50,955 --> 01:21:54,288
And I'll get permission for you
to come work with me at the clinic.

1170
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:56,292
I need my best assistant after all.

1171
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:59,989
You don't need to do that to make me
feel better, Doc Belinda.

1172
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,259
I know you don't need
a kid getting in your way.

1173
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,824
Lillian, you're never in my way.

1174
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:06,836
That's what everybody says...

1175
01:22:06,904 --> 01:22:08,997
but they don't mean it.

1176
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:11,064
You don't have to feel bad about it.

1177
01:22:11,142 --> 01:22:14,509
Really. I'm just fine here
on my own.

1178
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:24,020
Well, there's another option.

1179
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:27,257
What's that?

1180
01:22:28,259 --> 01:22:30,284
You could come live with me.

1181
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:35,697
- You mean it?
- I don't say things I don't mean.

1182
01:22:35,766 --> 01:22:39,327
But you would have to
focus on your schoolwork.

1183
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,803
Education is very important to me.

1184
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:43,806
I could do it if you help me.

1185
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:46,206
And this wouldn't be
a temporary arrangement.

1186
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:51,180
I want you to be a part of my family
if you want me to be a part of yours.

I love you, Doc Belinda.

1188
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:58,016
I'll be the best daughter
you could ever hope for.

1189
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:05,887

[ Sighs ]

1191
01:23:20,277 --> 01:23:22,609
It's so funny.
When I was adopted by my mama...

1192
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,410
she had my room set up
almost the exact same way.

1193
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:27,576
Yeah. It's nice of you
to give Lillian her privacy.

1194
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:30,120
Every girl needs privacy.

1195
01:23:30,187 --> 01:23:33,247
Especially when she's
never had any before.

1196
01:23:33,324 --> 01:23:36,452
Besides, this is only temporary
until I can afford a larger home.

care how long I have to wait.
