1
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,801
Good morning, mister.

2
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:59,608
- What do you want?
- You haven't struck oil yet, senor.

3
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,405
What's it to you?

4
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,759
I only wish to tell you
it's dangerous.

5
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:11,382
- Why?
- They blow up many wells.

6
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,477
Oh, I see.

7
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:17,939
Perhaps the mister wants to prevent
bandits from blowing up this well?

8
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,414
That'd be pretty hard to do.
We have no guns.

9
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,417
- You don't need a gun.
- We also have no money.

10
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:29,751
Not even some money?
Some little kind of money?

11
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:34,454
Can't you get some?
You got no friends?

12
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,560
- Who told you to dig here?
- I bought a lease.

13
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,056
Then you have money and I want it!

14
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:50,248
Every cent we got's in this well.

15
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,536
We'll find out.

16
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,618
Next time, be sure to have money.

17
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,460
- I don't get it.
- Well, they didn't shoot us, anyway.

18
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:47,958
Dynamite!

19
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,554
Why'd they have to do it to us?

20
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,803
We scrape every nickel to sink
this well and now look at it!

21
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,760
Ain't nothing left.
Just nothing.

22
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:25,097
There's still oil here and
we're going to dig it out!

23
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,919
How? What with? Where
are we gonna get drill pipe,

24
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:29,804
...tools and new rig?
Where? Where?

25
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,015
We'll get us a job,
save up and try again.

26
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:35,079
I'm sick and tired of trying.

27
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,819
If it ain't floods or tornadoes,
it's salt water or bandits.

28
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,895
I'm just plain tired!

29
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,606
- It's a long walk back to town.
Let's go. - I ain't going!

30
00:05:56,446 --> 00:06:01,427
# Once we lived in a shack

31
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,317
# Drilled for oil

32
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:08,188
# Precious black gold

33
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,984
Nothing seems to have changed much.

34
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,673
Boy, Jeff, I'm really starving.

35
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,766
You'll get used to it.

36
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,868
Well, I might,
but my ulcer won't.

37
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:17,200
That doctor in Arabia told me to
always keep something on my stomach.

38
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:21,817
- That was five years ago.
- I feel like I ain't ate since.

39
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,525
Got an opening for a driller
and derrick man?

40
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,592
Can't you read?

41
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:18,032
NO HELP WANTED

42
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:24,698
Oh. We'll take anything -
roustabout, ditch digger - anything.

43
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:29,549
Production's been cut.
Too much trouble from bandits.

44
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,528
Come on, Dutch.

45
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,309
Where were they when we needed 'em?

46
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:51,415
You heard the man. We're not the
only oil company out of business.

47
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,712
Let's go back to the States, Dutch.
It'll be easier to raise a bankroll.

48
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:04,388
Great! How do we get there?

49
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:08,300
I'll see what I can do.

50
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:41,401
Psst!

51
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:49,336
I beg your pardon,
but you're British, aren't you?

52
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:50,479
No.

53
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:54,033
Oh, brother, am I glad!
Come here, I want to talk to you.

54
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:58,369
- I've got a problem.
- Yeah?

55
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:00,448
- Where are you going?
- New Orleans.

56
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,241
What a break!

57
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,852
- For you or me?
- For both of us if you'd be a sport.

58
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,933
- I'm listening.
- They let wives travel half fare.

59
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:16,196
You tell 'em I'm your wife
and buy my ticket for me.

60
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:19,790
- OK.
- Thanks, you're a pal.

61
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,767
- What are you waiting for?
- The money.

62
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,576
Oh. Well, you see,
that's my problem.

63
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,649
Nice to make your acquaintance.

64
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:37,326
I'll pay you back as soon as
we get there. That's a promise.

65
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:41,060
You've got to help me.
I'm in a spot.

66
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:47,446
Well, all right, just try to act
like a wife. But keep quiet, huh?

67
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,076
Tomorrow, ten o'clock.

68
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,030
- What's the fare to New Orleans?
- $150.

69
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,855
Sounds fair enough.

70
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,366
I have a lease on some oil land.

71
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:03,664
I'll leave it as security
on two tickets and a half fare.

72
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,179
See this?

73
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:27,585
- Oil leases.
- But mine's legitimate.

74
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:31,787
These are all legitimate
and worthless. Sorry.

75
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:38,345
But my wife is sick. You wouldn't
leave a woman stranded here?

76
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,269
I said sorry.

77
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:47,327
I sure can pick 'em.

78
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:51,633
Stick around. You might
run into an Englishman.

79
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:04,590
Hey, mister. You got the price
of a meal for a fellow American?

80
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:18,706
Hey, mister. You got the price
of a meal for a fellow American?

81
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:31,232
- Give it back.
- Aw, Jeff...!

82
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,758
Wait. You guys looking for work?

83
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:41,311
- Why didn't I think of that?
- What you're offering?

84
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,777
- You know how to handle explosives?
- Sure, what kind?

85
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,955
- Nitro.
- Let's go.

86
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,245
- What's the pay?
- 200 bucks for the trip.

87
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,631
$200 for carrying soup?
Not interested.

88
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,992
200 bucks a man.

89
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,533
Jeff, we don't want
to haul no soup.

90
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:01,911
- How far is the run?
- Four hours.

91
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,815
- What kind of road?
- Smooth as glass.

92
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:09,637
Yeah, I know. Where there IS a road.
Refrigerated truck?

93
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:15,648
The guy I'm contracting for is
a small operator. No refrigerators.

94
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,068
All right. 500 dollars a man.

95
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:24,030
- Aw, come on, that's too much.
- OK, drive it out yourself.

96
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:28,017
Wait a minute. 400 bucks a man.

97
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,289
- It's a deal.
- Jeff, wait.

98
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:41,103
That stuff blows at 160 degrees,
we don't know the road..

99
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,004
- When are we leaving?
- Five o'clock tomorrow morning,

100
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,996
before the sun gets high.
Meet me here.

101
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,876
- What about a little advance?
- Yeah, a little eating money.

102
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:59,697
Sure, I'll give you an advance...
then I'll never see you again.

103
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:04,871
If you don't lose your nerve,
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

104
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,879
Oh, boy!

105
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:17,691
Listen to those ulcers growl.

106
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:21,060
Sounds like I got
a Great Dane in there.

107
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,150
Wish one'd come by.
I could eat it.

108
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:28,824
- Shut up and go to sleep.
- I can't sleep on an empty stomach.

109
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:33,327
I'm going to walk around.
Feels better when I'm moving.

110
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,580
Don't get into trouble.

111
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:07,383
Hold real still, mister.
All I want is the price of a meal.

112
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:10,144
All right, all right, let go!

113
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:21,751
Jeff! Help!

114
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:23,906
Jeff!

115
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,045
Help! Jeff! Jeff!

116
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:50,157
- Paco!
- Jeffrey, boy!

117
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:53,824
Paco?! Am I glad to see you!

118
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:58,387
- I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.
- Pick on somebody your own size!

119
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,927
- What are you doing, tearing into
Paco? - I was hungry!

120
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,260
You need money?
Why didn't you come to me?

121
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:08,690
- Here.
- Brother, are you loaded!

122
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:12,028
Dutch got an instinct
for that stuff.

123
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:16,986
I wouldn't be too sure. Lucky
for you I didn't have to use this.

124
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:19,586
I didn't know you were
in these parts!

125
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:21,337
We just got in.

126
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,927
- Where are you staying?
- Well...

127
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:27,255
- Come to the hotel,
I'll get you a room. - No, thanks...

128
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:30,958
You're not going to make me
use this? Come on!

129
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,094
Come on.

130
00:16:56,274 --> 00:17:00,168
Excuse me, fellas,
I see an old pal over here.

131
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,130
Hey! Come on upstairs to my suite.

132
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:09,658
We'll get a drink
and you can say hello to Marina.

133
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,307
Your wife here?

134
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:14,743
Just for the day.
She gets restless at home.

135
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:17,067
She sure will be surprised
to see you.

136
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,104
It's getting late.
Maybe she's asleep.

137
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:22,961
No, no. She can't go to sleep,
till I kiss her goodnight. Come on.

138
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,069
Marina!

139
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,786
Where are you, honey?

140
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:33,195
I bet she's taking a bath.
She loves sitting in the tub.

141
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:37,498
Marina? Oh! Hiya, sweetheart.

142
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,039
- Brawling again?
- A friendly scrap.

143
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,494
Hand me my negligee.

144
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,469
Hey, this is new.
Must've cost plenty.

145
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:52,105
I'm not complaining, angel.
You're entitled.

146
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,160
- You smell like a gutter.
- That's where I been.

147
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,713
Hey, guess who I brought up here.

148
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:04,183
Jeff Dawson! I sure missed that guy.
It was great to see him again.

149
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,155
Come on out and say hello, huh?

150
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:13,026
She'll be out in a second.

151
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:17,689
I used to think married guys
were suckers. I still think so.

152
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,193
But there's only one Marina
and I got her...

153
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:24,338
I never can find anything!

154
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:28,290
Is that stuff or is that stuff?

155
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:32,260
Nice to see you again.
Been a long time.

156
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:37,423
- Hello, Marina.
- Honey, I can't find the tequila!

157
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:48,271
What would I do without you?
Come on, Jeff, pull up a chair.

158
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,274
We'll kill the bottle
and have some laughs.

159
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,540
Stick around and laugh, Jeff!

160
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,203
Where'd you go when you
left here?

161
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,104
All over. Guatemala, Venezuela...

162
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,378
What happened in Venezuela?

163
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,430
Everything went sky-high, including
the equipment and four creditors.

164
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:08,077
I was out of the country
before it came down.

165
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,525
Then I spotted in a new rig
near here.

166
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,621
I was on top of the prettiest
anticline you ever saw.

167
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:17,142
- Anticline but no showings, eh?
- Plenty.

168
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,570
But banditos showed up
before the pay sand.

169
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:22,047
Bourbon neat, as I remember.

170
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:25,820
You'll never get smart -
always wildcatting.

171
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:28,351
Quit and settle down!

172
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:32,631
I like finding oil,
not watching it pump.

173
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,434
You used to be that way. Remember
Texas? We sold out in six months.

174
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:42,593
That was before Marina.
She keeps it interesting here.

175
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:47,581
You were a sucker to walk out.
You had half.

176
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:52,119
Now I've got three sections,
money rolling in.

177
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,302
I'm opening a new section.
Throw in with me.

178
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:59,146
- If we bring it in, you get a piece.
- Sorry, Paco, I can't.

179
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,949
- Why not?
- Yes, why not?

180
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,046
Same reason as before.

181
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:08,284
Why'd you run out on me?
What'd I do?

182
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,050
Nothing. I just had another lease
I thought looked pretty good.

183
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,216
There must have been
some other reason.

184
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,445
- He's back now.
- Just when I need him the most.

185
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:20,774
I'm worried about those
banditos, too. Jeff...

186
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:24,763
Forget it. I better find Dutch.
We got a job to do tomorrow.

187
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:27,394
Don't go, Jeff!
Just when I find you again!

188
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:31,515
- He really needs you.
- Good night, Marina.

189
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,645
Good night.

190
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:39,446
That well the bandits blew up -
you still got the lease?

191
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:42,020
- Yeah, why?
- Just asking.

192
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,725
Don't disappear again.
Let's keep in touch.

193
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,110
Ah, he's a great guy!

194
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:53,359
Funny how all the dames
used to go for him!

195
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,681
What's funny about it?

196
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,944
The dames I mean...
they were nothing like you!

197
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:02,612
You smell like an animal.

198
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,730
- And you act like one.
- And you love it.

199
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:24,230
Like I always say, it's always
darkest just before the dawn.

200
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,494
You got to have faith.

201
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:32,436
We was both starving. I bump into
an old pal and you bump into me.

202
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:34,736
Eat something, honey.

203
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,290
You been pampering
that ulcer long enough.

204
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,114
- That's my first dr...
- Go to bed.

205
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,157
I need you sober tomorrow.

206
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,753
OK.

207
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,991
Can I finish my dinner,
or do I have to go to bed, too?

208
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:51,729
Jeff, meet this nice little girl.
I bought her dinner.

209
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:55,415
- She's from my home town.
- Mmm-hmm?

210
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,675
We've met. For a few seconds once,
we were even married.

211
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,410
Huh? I don't get it.
I'd better finish my drink.

212
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:07,768
When that hot sun hits you tomorrow,
you'll explode before the nitro.

213
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:11,181
Nitro? Ain't Paco
going to give us a job?

214
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:13,895
- Don't ask questions.
- OK.

215
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,327
When you get back to Tulsa,
look up my Aunt Martha.

216
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,992
Tell her what a big oil man I am.

217
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,807
Hey, mister...

218
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:25,253
If you ever get to Tulsa,
look up my parents.

219
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:28,398
If you think I'm lying,
I'll give you their address.

220
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:30,331
I hope you get there
before I do.

221
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:33,354
If you don't mind,
I'll finish my dinner.

222
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:42,264
Easy, now.

223
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:54,472
Easy, boys, easy.

224
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:58,261
Just easy. That's it.

225
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:01,677
Make sure all them lines
are good and tight.

226
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:09,074
You wouldn't like to buy a fella
a nice cold bottle of beer?

227
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,621
No, I guess you wouldn't.

228
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,609
- How's it look?
- It's got some springs, anyhow.

229
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,929
Are those containers full to the brim?
I don't want it slopping around.

230
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:24,717
- Right to the brim.
- Double-check everything, Dutch.

231
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:27,015
I don't like to get near
to that stuff, but I'll do it.

232
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,467
Here's your permit
to transport explosives.

233
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,496
It'll get you by the police.

234
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:36,604
- And the bandits?
- For them...you got this.

235
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:42,080
You know what one bullet in that
box of nitro will do to your truck?

236
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:45,596
- I just rent it.
- You're renting me, too.

237
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,858
- When do I get paid?
- After you make the run.

238
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,757
Look, you can understand.

239
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,342
Supposing you get blown up
with the money on you.

240
00:23:54,477 --> 00:23:57,094
It'll be a loss
to everybody - you, me.

241
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:00,821
Besides, you got no place
to spend it till you get back.

242
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,034
We're all set,
I'm sorry to say.

243
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,410
- I'll be seeing you.
- Sure.

244
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,782
Better get in, Dutch. I'll drive.

245
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,330
OK.

246
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:28,011
Jeff, start out real easy.

247
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:33,418
Take your fingers out of your ears.
If it goes, you won't hear it.

248
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:34,999
Huh?

249
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:14,077
Take it easy, Jeff, will you?

250
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,822
Oh, boy, it's sure hot!

251
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:33,507
Jeff, that stuff's ready
to boil over.

252
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:36,109
It'll be over in an hour,
one way or the other.

253
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,071
Don't say that!

254
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,983
It's my duty to tell you that
there are bandits around here.

255
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:48,679
That settles it.
We go back to town.

256
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:53,762
- You're stopping us from going on?
- No, but I advise you against it.

257
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:56,677
Thanks for the warning.

258
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,270
- How much further?
- We ought to be about on top of it.

259
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:26,932
- I don't see no rig.
- Just watch the road for bumps.

260
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:06,577
Stop the truck!
Let's get outta here! Stop!

261
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:14,136
Sit down! The only chance we've got
is to keep moving.

262
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:37,819
Hey! They got us blocked!

263
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:57,056
You drive!

264
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,806
Vamonos!

265
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,353
This joint's dull.

266
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,453
I know a place down the street
where we can have a lot of fun.

267
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,103
Hello.

268
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:02,254
Well! Where'd you come from?
I heard you got shot.

269
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,826
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Pay me.

270
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:07,353
Oh, yes. $800, wasn't it?

271
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:11,179
I don't have it on me,
but I'll go to the bank first thing.

272
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:13,418
- Emilio?
- Yes, Mr Jackson?

273
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:17,578
Fix up my friend with anything
he wants. Put it on my bill.

274
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:19,142
- OK?
- But...

275
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:24,092
- Now, where were we?
- What was it he did for you?

276
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:29,630
- He ran a load of nitro. Why?
- That's pretty dangerous, isn't it?

277
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:33,231
- A man can get killed.
- Then he ought to get paid.

278
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,714
He will. What's the matter
with you?

279
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,775
You might ask him why
he has those boat tickets.

280
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,955
- What boat?
- Oh, I...

281
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,070
And you might also enquire
about the $2,500 in his wallet.

282
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:49,626
- You little...!
- Let's see the wallet.

283
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,813
- I don't have $2,500.
- Let's see the wallet.

284
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,871
She's lying! I'll show you.

285
00:30:57,715 --> 00:31:00,022
There's nothing in that wallet.

286
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,640
When your boyfriend wakes up,
he can pay the check.

287
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Women! All they give me
is trouble.

288
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,174
He's my pal. He can lick
anybody, except me.

289
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,995
Come on. Up!

290
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,328
Hey, Mr Jackson!

291
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:36,743
What do you know! 2,500 bucks!
"Haven't got a cent on me" he says.

292
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,463
"Have to go to the bank tomorrow."

293
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:43,437
One ticket on the boat that leaves
tomorrow at nine.

294
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:46,868
- One ticket?
- That's all there is.

295
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:51,646
That no good so-and-so!
Hit him again for me.

296
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,144
Hold this under his nose.
That'll bring him to.

297
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:18,699
- What'll you have?
- A polite thank you.

298
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,787
You've got it.
Why did you do it?

299
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:26,039
I've been made a chump of myself.
I hate to see it happen to anybody else.

300
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,191
- How'd you get stuck in this place?
- You wouldn't believe it.

301
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:35,938
A couple of days ago, I was on
a big yacht. Twelve in the crew.

302
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,751
- Just you and the crew?
- There was an owner.

303
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:43,267
- Let's hear about him.
- And his older sister.

304
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,261
When we docked here,

305
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:49,257
he wanted to send his sister home,
but I couldn't break up the family.

306
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:53,251
- So, I came ashore.
- You expect me to swallow that?

307
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:56,619
- You don't believe anything!
- Here.

308
00:32:56,858 --> 00:33:01,076
You've got the wrong idea.
That won't buy you anything.

309
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:05,695
I don't have to buy anything.
But you need a ticket out of here.

310
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:08,471
I usually get there,
one way or another.

311
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:11,194
Try it with a ticket this time.

312
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:14,375
Excuse me.
I'm Inspector Ramirez.

313
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,930
I believe you took some money
from this man.

314
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:19,413
He owed it to me.

315
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:23,497
These gentlemen
are creditors of Mr Jackson.

316
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:29,634
Excuse the trouble,
but you have to give me back $800.

317
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:33,358
I almost got killed earning
that 800 bucks.

318
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:36,094
My partner's in the hospital
with a bullet wound.

319
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:39,559
I am very sorry.
The money, please.

320
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:47,200
- Can't we split the difference?
- There is no difference to split.

321
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:55,665
You are $200 short. Why?

322
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,460
- I spent it.
- Oh!

323
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,949
I am sure it was spent well, senor.

324
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,653
I guess you want it back now, huh?

325
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:16,354
I think it was spent well, too.

326
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,170
I like you. What's your name?

327
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:23,971
- Jeff Dawson. What's yours?
- Sal Donley, but you won't remember.

328
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:28,283
I won't have to.
That ship leaves at nine tomorrow.

329
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,920
- Night.
- Night.

330
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:35,307
Waiter.

331
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:38,182
You'd better pour this
back in the bottle.

332
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:44,668
Hey! You still throw
a nice left hook.

333
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:49,274
You can't live
on left hooks, though.

334
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,712
My offer's still open.

335
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:56,174
You really got no choice,
Jeffrey boy. Hmm?

336
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,841
It'll be just like old times, huh?

337
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:31,650
If I could get my south field
into shape, I'd triple production.

338
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:36,241
- What's the trouble? Bandits?
- No, I'm too close to town.

339
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:40,767
My big trouble is Henderson,
the field boss. He's a stiff.

340
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:42,913
- Lazy?
- No, stupid.

341
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,980
This well - I call it
Marina number seven -

342
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,024
he snapped off three sections
of drill pipe. I had to bypass.

343
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,428
That's him.

344
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:58,539
- Come on, pick up those couplings!
- You want to roll 'em home?

345
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:00,995
- Hey, Henderson!
- Yes, Mr Conway.

346
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,571
That's no way to talk to those boys.

347
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,505
Was I hired to be polite
or to be a field boss?

348
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,954
Sometimes I wonder.
This is Mr Dawson.

349
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:13,466
I'm going to take a look at the rig.

350
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:34,451
Hey, Jeff! Come here a second.

351
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:41,149
- How does it look?
- You had a showing about 1,200.

352
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,991
How do you know that?

353
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,057
- This core shows a fine formation.
- No kidding?

354
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:49,897
Let's see.

355
00:36:50,092 --> 00:36:56,883
"Red shale, quartzite, limestone."
You ought to hit a well about 3,200.

356
00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:02,196
- What do you use, a crystal ball?
- No, he just uses his head!

357
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:03,851
What do you think?

358
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:06,659
I don't like popping off
about another man's rig.

359
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:09,659
Go ahead. I think I can stand it!

360
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:13,758
Too much weight on your bit -
the hole's crooked.

361
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:15,828
That picture compass is off.

362
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:19,797
Not the picture compass,
the feel of the rig!

363
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:22,162
I've said the same thing
a dozen times!

364
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:27,228
You're hitting hard rock
and shearing off! You're fired!

365
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,649
You can't fire me,
I got a contract.

366
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:33,389
I got news for you - I broke it.

367
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,744
- We're pulling pipe!
- Just a minute, Conway!

368
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:40,457
- Get your dirty paws off of me.
- Sure.

369
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:47,634
I've been waiting to do that
a long time.

370
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:55,501
She likes to see me fight -
when I win.

371
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:59,785
Throw water on him, pack him
to town and give him his fare.

372
00:38:00,213 --> 00:38:03,281
I'll be back
by the time you get it pulled.

373
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:08,070
We'll be at the house, baby!

374
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:17,560
- I'll race you to the house!
- 500 bucks says we'll beat you there.

375
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:20,335
- You got a bet!
- Get in, Jeff!

376
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,770
Hold on, Jeff!

377
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,951
You'd break your neck
for 500 bucks!

378
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:13,119
How do you like it? Not bad, huh?

379
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:15,941
- Lot of changes since your day.
- Pay me.

380
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:18,412
- I'm good for it!
- The money's better.

381
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:22,459
She's tough!
Recognise this?

382
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,638
Marina number one. This is
the baby that started it all.

383
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:30,880
He built the house near it, so he
could hear it pumping at night.

384
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:35,381
- Helps him sleep.
- And keeps her awake!

385
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:39,150
Let me know how YOU sleep.
Your house is over there.

386
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,272
- Get some drinks, baby.
- I better get settled.

387
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:47,576
Wait. Henderson ain't out yet.
You don't have to flatten him, too!

388
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,310
Lot of changes, huh, Jeff?

389
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:06,947
How do you like it, huh?
Everything made by hand.

390
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,446
- You got Jeff's drink ready?
- Uh-huh.

391
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:12,774
- A little early for me to drink.
- That's not very neighbourly.

392
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,339
- I just work here.
- Let's drink!

393
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,454
It's not like drinking with the boss.
You're friends.

394
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,439
We're brothers!

395
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:25,428
- That makes me a big sister.
- So I have to drink?

396
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:28,268
While you're living so close,
why be formal?

397
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:32,414
Marina's only trying
to make you feel at home. Relax!

398
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:37,383
- Looks like Jeff has forgotten how.
- Show him how nice you can be.

399
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:42,750
- Shall I dance for the gentleman?
- Don't she slaughter you?

400
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,545
Marina was always
quite the comedienne.

401
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:51,637
On our honeymoon, the door
to our train compartment got jammed.

402
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:54,540
We couldn't open it
for 500 miles!

403
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,414
- Shut up!
- Don't interrupt.

404
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,369
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Maybe Jeff does!

405
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:00,276
I can imagine the rest.

406
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:03,614
Go on, you tell the rest.
I want to hear it.

407
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:08,917
All right. I'll tell him
how the trip ended.

408
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,640
He gave me these.

409
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:25,309
Hey! That cost me
600 barrels of crude!

410
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:33,735
I told you she was tough!
Never argue with her, you can't win.

411
00:42:34,545 --> 00:42:36,835
Where you going, honey?

412
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,994
I like fighting with you!

413
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:42,297
What's the matter, honey?

414
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,589
Did I do something? What'd I do?

415
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,367
Marina!

416
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:56,500
Come on, open up, honey!
Marina! Aw, Marina!

417
00:42:57,856 --> 00:43:01,489
What's the matter, honey.
Why'd you get mad, honey?

418
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:04,650
Marina! Marina!
HE BURSTS DOOR OPEN

419
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:33,599
- Go right in. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks. No hard feelings?

420
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:39,404
I should say not. You did me
a favour. This was no job for a man.

421
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:42,373
Doesn't look like you're going to do
much work either.

422
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:44,219
Say what you mean.

423
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:47,852
- Find out for yourself.
- I still don't get you.

424
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:51,850
If Mrs Conway comes to say goodbye,
tell her she could've saved the walk.

425
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:55,134
Why would she say goodbye to you?

426
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:06,285
# Once we lived

427
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,775
# In a shack

428
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,079
# Drilled for oil

429
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:17,082
# Precious black

430
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,895
# Gold

431
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:29,476
It's open!

432
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:51,849
Find what you're looking for?

433
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:59,139
Take a good look.

434
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,283
Get on your feet.

435
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:16,572
- I just want to make your bed.
- Is that what you do? Make beds?

436
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:18,561
Too bad you had to came back.

437
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:22,439
We might have gone on without ever
seeing each other again.

438
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,042
But I'm not sorry.

439
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,340
Let me see,
why did you leave here?

440
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:30,487
You have a good memory,
why was it? Oh, yes, yes...

441
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:34,870
You thought you found oil
someplace else, that's why.

442
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:39,188
You were running away
from something. Me.

443
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:44,468
You thought you were falling in love
with me so you pulled up stakes.

444
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:47,883
That's not the reason
and you know it.

445
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:50,348
Were you surprised
I married Paco?

446
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:54,693
Why not? He's rich and
he isn't ashamed of loving me.

447
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,634
He gives me everything I want.

448
00:45:58,308 --> 00:46:01,106
Look at me when I talk to you!

449
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:07,010
I ought to be ashamed of loving you.
You're nothing!

450
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:12,064
Oh, yes, you always had some
crummy oil lease in your hip pocket!

451
00:46:16,675 --> 00:46:19,675
I ask myself,
what do I see in you?

452
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,026
Maybe it's time for me
to take a good look.

453
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:40,804
You've tried to wipe me off before.
You never could.

454
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:43,118
Maybe I never tried hard enough.

455
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,920
- Why do you always fight me?
- You have a husband.

456
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:50,355
You could've been my husband.
Why aren't you?

457
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:54,289
Because you're no good, Marina.

458
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,627
- You're just no good.
- I know. I wasn't always this way.

459
00:46:58,747 --> 00:47:00,383
With you it was different.

460
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:03,727
You brought out everything decent
in me. I wanted to be decent.

461
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:06,695
When you walked out,
you stole my chance.

462
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,430
Now that you're back,
it's as though you'd never left.

463
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:14,599
I'm not staying
one day longer than I have to.

464
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:18,295
I wouldn't be here now
if Dutch weren't in the hospital.

465
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:21,318
I made a deal with Paco.

466
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:23,954
As soon as I bring in
the south field, I'm pulling out.

467
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,634
No, you're not!
Not this time.

468
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:28,064
We've said goodbye
for the last time.

469
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:32,295
- Why do you hound me?
- You're hounding yourself.

470
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:36,659
- I don't want to talk about it.
- All right.

471
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,132
Don't make the bed.
I'm not staying tonight.

472
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,413
- Where are you going?
- To town.

473
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:52,072
- What's in town?
- I'll find out.

474
00:48:12,997 --> 00:48:17,979
# Marina, mine

475
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,951
# Set me free

476
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:30,887
# Free from black gold

477
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:35,894
# Our love never can be

478
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:59,069
Must be quite a view
out that window.

479
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:02,650
Quit stalling. Tell me about it
if you want to.

480
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:05,152
- About what?
- About her.

481
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:08,163
What you're going to do
about Marina.

482
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:11,441
- I knew it the minute you came in.
- Knew what?

483
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:17,250
That you was thinking of running out.
Just give me a hand with this leg.

484
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:20,542
- Lay down!
- Then go on without me.

485
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:24,658
The look that's on your face,
I say get out while you can.

486
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:26,398
You talk too much.

487
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:29,429
I'm not saying half
what I'm thinking.

488
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:34,374
- What does that mean?
- I thought it was all over.

489
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:38,046
You know an awful lot
for somebody lying here!

490
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:42,185
This is Dutch, remember?
I was around long before Marina...

491
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:44,541
when there was just
you and me and Paco.

492
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:47,710
Are you reminding me
that Paco's my friend?

493
00:49:49,063 --> 00:49:51,808
I don't have to tell you that, Jeff.

494
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:53,808
Good night.

495
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:10,732
- You got a room?
- Yeah, just register.

496
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:16,293
I'm glad you came in, Mr Dawson,

497
00:50:16,403 --> 00:50:18,737
A young lady just gave me
your name as a reference.

498
00:50:18,904 --> 00:50:21,785
- As what? Which young lady?
- That one.

499
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,950
She said you'd vouch
for her honesty.

500
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,619
Nice of you to have come
to my debut.

501
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:39,187
I hear I'm responsible for it. Didn't
know you could deal blackjack.

502
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:43,236
I can't. Manager's only interested
in how I look.

503
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:45,894
Why weren't you on that boat?

504
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:48,967
I didn't know there was a law
I had to get out of town.

505
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,890
There's no law
I had to give you $200, either.

506
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,570
Here's your money!

507
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:18,486
- Save it for the next boat.
- I'm not ready to leave.

508
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:22,226
- You've got a great future here!
- Don't tell me how to live.

509
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:26,770
- I've got an investment in you.
- Take it back!

510
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,045
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I'm busy.

511
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,150
You're always busy, all month!

512
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:30,239
- You can't wait to get out of here.
- That's right.

513
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:33,641
- Why do you hate me?
- I don't.

514
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,257
Then why don't I ever see you?
Answer me!

515
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,677
- The men are looking at you.
- I don't care! I don't care!

516
00:52:58,298 --> 00:53:03,295
# Can this girl love me back?

517
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,793
# Love me more, more than black

518
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:12,042
# Gold?

519
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:18,900
# I was cought in her web

520
00:53:19,235 --> 00:53:24,591
# Just like the spider
captures the fly

521
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:30,065
# And I knew, what is more

522
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,922
# I must leave, leave her or die

523
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:43,116
# Marina, mine

524
00:53:45,503 --> 00:53:48,889
# Set me free

525
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:54,202
# Free from black gold

526
00:53:56,646 --> 00:53:59,533
# Blowing wild

527
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:04,397
# Blowing wild! #

528
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,418
How're you doing?

529
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:33,554
Still in cap rock
but we'll get through.

530
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:39,003
- You said that three bits ago.
- It's not exactly custard pudding.

531
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,996
- All right, pick her up.
- Hold it!

532
00:54:42,255 --> 00:54:45,504
- What's the trouble?
- You promised me oil at 3,200.

533
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:48,190
- So wait till I get there.
- Gonna speed it up for you.

534
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:51,629
Peter, Miguel, get a torpedo out.

535
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:56,452
Nitro? This well doesn't need that.
I'll bring it in for you.

536
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:59,027
Let's do it my way this time.

537
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,078
- It's your party.
- I got my reasons.

538
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,854
Bring it in here! Easy, boys.

539
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:10,562
Pack it down good.
Plenty of mud on top.

540
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:13,507
Set it for 6am tomorrow.

541
00:55:20,887 --> 00:55:23,522
How do you know
it'll stay put that long?

542
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:26,156
Jeff, let me worry...

543
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:43,587
Paco! They're over there!

544
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:57,683
I don't get it.
They could've blown up the well.

545
00:56:57,801 --> 00:57:03,050
They didn't come for that. They're
reminding me to keep an appointment.

546
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:05,216
I didn't know you heard from 'em.

547
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:09,381
I didn't figure they'd come
this close to town.

548
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,406
This is why I'm using nitro.

549
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:16,336
I've got to find out quick if
there's anything worth fighting for.

550
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:18,242
You coming to the house?

551
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,138
I better take a look
at the men they shot.

552
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:26,250
Next time, they'll mean business.

553
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:30,640
It's not possible to expect
troops from the north.

554
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:33,007
- You must hold on.
- With what?

555
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:37,806
Do as the other companies -
close down, give rifles to every man.

556
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:42,172
They'll blow me up.
I've got a right to protection!

557
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:44,838
I will do everything possible.

558
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:49,999
- Mrs Conway should stay in town.
- Yeah, maybe you should.

559
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,179
I'm staying here.

560
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:57,805
- Jeff, how bad was that man hurt?
- He's dead.

561
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,290
- Maybe you should go into town.
- I'm not running away!

562
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:11,698
Pedro! Saddle up
a couple of fresh horses.

563
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:18,671
What are you going to do?

564
00:58:18,806 --> 00:58:22,052
We're going to keep
that appointment.

565
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,321
- I see your face before.
- You killed one of my men.

566
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:16,438
- Are you Mr Conway?
- I'm Conway.

567
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:18,548
You shut up.

568
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,529
I need money.

569
01:01:24,964 --> 01:01:28,518
Plenty of money
to buy guns and dynamite.

570
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:34,370
But I still got plans to blow up
your wells. All 18 wells.

571
01:01:34,601 --> 01:01:37,886
You have 18 wells, huh?
Is not true?

572
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:42,489
I know everything.
I look through big glasses.

573
01:01:42,624 --> 01:01:44,595
How much do you want?

574
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,721
You're a wise man.
You love your oil wells very much.

575
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:57,702
What will you pay to conserve them?

576
01:01:57,857 --> 01:02:02,625
- Tell him you'll think it over.
- Tell him what I'll do to you.

577
01:02:02,826 --> 01:02:06,060
How much it worth for you if I have
not blow up your well?

578
01:02:06,248 --> 01:02:08,319
Not a peso.

579
01:02:11,054 --> 01:02:13,722
I don't like that answer.

580
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:17,582
Be careful and not answer
the same way.

581
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:22,457
You have 18 wells.
I want $1,000 for each well.

582
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:28,157
Total - $50,000.
I don't know how to add.

583
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:36,038
$50,000 tonight.
You will bring it here in gold.

584
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:39,066
Remember, I want gold.

585
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,022
Take your guns with you.

586
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:46,828
I don't want you to be robbed
when you bring my money.

587
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,136
When are you going to speak?

588
01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:22,238
I'm hungry. Come on,
let's get something.

589
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:30,062
Marina!

590
01:03:30,697 --> 01:03:32,400
MARINA!

591
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:38,973
She's never around when you
want her! Come on out the kitchen.

592
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:53,713
Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

593
01:03:57,193 --> 01:04:00,419
Where's the bottle opener?
I can't find nothing!

594
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:04,507
I got 100 grand in this house.
I can't even open a bottle!

595
01:04:04,764 --> 01:04:08,547
- Where is everybody?
- They ran away. They're scared.

596
01:04:08,756 --> 01:04:11,131
What are you shaking about?

597
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:15,518
That stinking bandit
wants 50,000 bucks!

598
01:04:16,204 --> 01:04:19,816
- What do you say, Jeff?
- What are you asking him for?

599
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:24,164
- Ask me, not him!
- I'd like to hear his opinion!

600
01:04:31,574 --> 01:04:33,802
- What do you say, Jeff?
- I know what he'll say.

601
01:04:33,918 --> 01:04:36,818
"Don't pay. Fight!
Get the wells blown up."

602
01:04:36,946 --> 01:04:39,471
- Maybe get killed.
- That's right.

603
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:42,075
It's easy for him.
He's got nothing to lose.

604
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:47,209
My whole life is wrapped up here!
I don't want it shot from under me.

605
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:52,154
It wasn't shot from under you
in Nicaragua, and you know why.

606
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:54,766
Once you start paying,
you can't stop.

607
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:57,703
He'll let you alone
for 50,000, but for how long?

608
01:04:57,868 --> 01:04:59,748
That he didn't say.

609
01:04:59,883 --> 01:05:03,192
Pay him once,
next time he'll want double.

610
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:08,610
Can't live with a snake by feeding
him honey. You got to kill him.

611
01:05:08,745 --> 01:05:13,195
We load up a truck with nitro,
drive it into their hide-out.

612
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,856
Blast them off the earth.
Kill them all.

613
01:05:17,191 --> 01:05:19,853
Us, too. Some idea! It stinks.

614
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:22,269
You're yellow!

615
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:29,368
You want to fight 'em? You know
where the gun room is! Go ahead!

616
01:05:29,557 --> 01:05:32,842
Why not?
We need a little excitement.

617
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,400
You're going soft,
sitting round pumping oil.

618
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,821
And those pumps drive me nuts!

619
01:05:38,023 --> 01:05:40,862
If we had a shooting,
maybe I'd get some sleep.

620
01:05:41,031 --> 01:05:44,009
I got a bandit on my back
and what am I surrounded with?

621
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:47,270
A lousy hero and a crazy wife!

622
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:52,454
- Where are you going?
- To town.

623
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:55,564
You don't need me
to make up your mind.

624
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:02,079
- Where does he go in town?
- Who cares? Dutch, somebody.

625
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:04,876
- Who else does he see?
- Some dame.

626
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:09,570
Blackjack dealer at the hotel.
What's it to you?

627
01:06:34,364 --> 01:06:36,637
Marina No7 she's blowing wild.

628
01:06:36,787 --> 01:06:39,108
- She's ready to pour the nitro.
- Jeff, where 're you going?

629
01:06:39,243 --> 01:06:41,845
I'll grab the ice truck.
See you there.

630
01:06:54,832 --> 01:06:58,376
- You made your well, like you said.
- Did you get the torpedo out?

631
01:06:58,486 --> 01:07:00,335
It's too late.

632
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,882
Clear the rig! Hurry up!

633
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:07,580
The nitro catches this gas,
this whole formation will go!

634
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:09,562
There's nothing
we can do about it.

635
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:14,319
- We might catch the torpedo.
- Are you kidding? Hurry up!

636
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:16,438
Come on, Jeff!

637
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,746
Come on, Jeff!

638
01:07:24,013 --> 01:07:26,485
JEFF, ARE YOU CRAZY?!

639
01:07:29,234 --> 01:07:31,891
- What are you doing?
- If you think you can catch it,

640
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:35,788
...I'll help. Bueno?
- Bueno!

641
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:41,729
Cool it off and then pull the fuse!

642
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:46,287
Peter, come on!

643
01:08:55,693 --> 01:08:59,500
Jeff! Jeff!
D'you burn yourself badly?

644
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,360
Peter! Miguel!

645
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:03,525
Crazy thing to do!

646
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:06,694
Give me a hand,
let's get him in the car.

647
01:09:14,924 --> 01:09:17,854
You're crazy, Jeff! Plum crazy!

648
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:20,409
You must like fooling with nitro!

649
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:24,077
Lucky for me I was here. I've been
pressing my luck too far with you.

650
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,747
All right, Dutchy, all right.

651
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:28,008
This guy's gonna get himself killed
one of these days!

652
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:30,739
And when he does, he won't be
enough for a decent burial.

653
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:33,098
OK, Dutch, OK!

654
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:37,372
- When are you getting out of here?
- I'm scared to get out of here!

655
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,370
Hanging around with you
is dangerous.

656
01:09:39,505 --> 01:09:43,413
- What'd you have to do it for?
- Because I couldn't.

657
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:47,991
Now I got no guts.

658
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:53,404
You're the guy who first pulled
that hot nitro stunt in California.

659
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:56,049
That was a long time ago.

660
01:09:57,731 --> 01:09:59,946
I'll be seeing you.

661
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,486
What's the matter with Paco?
What's happened to him?

662
01:10:06,598 --> 01:10:10,553
Go on back to bed.
I got to go after him.

663
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:20,138
Paco! Paco!

664
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,996
Paco!

665
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:27,467
Jeff!
Jeff, you're all right?

666
01:10:27,594 --> 01:10:29,062
- You're not hurt?
- I'm fine.

667
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:31,699
When I heard you're in the hospital,
I didn't know what I'd do.

668
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:33,928
- You shouldn't have come here.
- I was worrying sick.

669
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:37,130
Start worrying about your husband.
Go home, Marina.

670
01:10:37,257 --> 01:10:39,847
Don't you understand?
I can't! I love you!

671
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:45,080
- You're the only man I ever loved.
- I've heard those words before.

672
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:50,262
And from you, years ago, on another
street in another country.

673
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:52,421
- Only the music was different.
- I was different, too.

674
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:54,573
I didn't realise what
you meant to me!

675
01:10:54,735 --> 01:10:56,665
You said that, too.
That time I believed you.

676
01:10:56,765 --> 01:10:59,145
It was true - and it was true
when I married Paco!

677
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:01,561
I only did it because
you wouldn't have me!

678
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:05,633
There was a time when I would've,
but you left me waiting.

679
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:08,973
- Then you DID wait! - Too long
and through too many others.

680
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:13,536
- This time I've waited for you.
- You've got Paco.

681
01:11:13,671 --> 01:11:18,459
Paco! He looks strong,
but I know what he is!

682
01:11:18,638 --> 01:11:21,822
When I knew him, he was strong.
I don't want to see him fall apart.

683
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:23,433
Let him fall apart!

684
01:11:23,565 --> 01:11:29,254
Jeff, take me away with you!
I can't stand it here another minute.

685
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:33,585
Take me away with you.
Now, tonight!

686
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:53,115
Good evening, Mrs Conway.
Mrs Conway's key.

687
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:56,543
I'm going back to the field.
Have my car sent around.

688
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:23,196
Good evening.

689
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:33,791
Cut.

690
01:12:40,286 --> 01:12:42,826
That's a pretty big bet.

691
01:12:55,614 --> 01:12:58,266
I'm Marina Conway.

692
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:00,899
I'd like to ask you a question,
Miss...?

693
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,176
Donley.

694
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:06,491
- I'd appreciate a frank answer.
- Certainly, Mrs Conway.

695
01:13:06,984 --> 01:13:09,980
Is Jeff Dawson in love with you?

696
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:13,928
- I'm in love with him.
- That's not what I asked.

697
01:13:14,078 --> 01:13:17,993
- I can't answer for him.
- You could if he loved you.

698
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:20,624
You've told me
what I want to know.

699
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:25,390
Mrs Conway...
he's not in love with you.

700
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:28,817
Not any more.

701
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:32,205
- He tell you that?
- He didn't have to.

702
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,265
You're a liar, a cheap little liar.
What can he see in you?

703
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:40,716
I'll ask him next time.

704
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:45,784
There won't be many more
next times. Remember that.

705
01:13:46,197 --> 01:13:48,833
Your car is here, Mrs Conway.

706
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:38,878
Ol-e!

707
01:14:57,138 --> 01:14:59,836
Shut up, everybody! Quiet!

708
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:02,253
We have a visitor.

709
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:08,082
A distinguished visitor,
Mr Jeff Dawson. A real hero!

710
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,482
He catches hot nitro
with his bare hands.

711
01:15:11,617 --> 01:15:15,641
Jeffrey, I love you like a brother.
Come on, have a drink.

712
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:18,116
Rosalito! Paco!
Hmm?

713
01:15:18,256 --> 01:15:20,456
It's late.
You haven't got much time.

714
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,893
What are you going to do
about the banditos?

715
01:15:22,994 --> 01:15:26,431
Wouldn't you like to know!
I'm not going to tell you.

716
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:28,883
First, I'm going to tell you
something else.

717
01:15:29,018 --> 01:15:33,024
Listen, everybody!
This man works for me.

718
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:37,512
But he's the boss. You know
why he's the boss? I'll tell you.

719
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:39,226
Paco, let's go.

720
01:15:39,383 --> 01:15:43,651
He's the boss because my wife
is in love with him.

721
01:15:45,468 --> 01:15:47,724
She thought I didn't know.

722
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:50,364
I always knew
there was some other guy,

723
01:15:50,535 --> 01:15:53,451
but I didn't know who
till you come back.

724
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:56,590
She's in love with you.

725
01:15:56,725 --> 01:15:59,511
But I married her and I got her.

726
01:15:59,646 --> 01:16:01,767
It's a joke.

727
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:06,883
It's a joke!
I want everybody to laugh!

728
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:09,012
Laugh!

729
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,206
Paco...

730
01:16:12,412 --> 01:16:16,072
I know what you thought
about the bandit.

731
01:16:16,213 --> 01:16:21,086
You thought I was going to pay him.
I'm not. I'm going to fight him.

732
01:16:21,322 --> 01:16:23,414
You sure that's not
whiskey talking?

733
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:28,904
No. It's me.
Me, Paco Conway talking!

734
01:16:29,309 --> 01:16:33,572
I'm going to fight him!
I'm going to fight him!

735
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,708
You're not coming.
I don't need you.

736
01:16:43,843 --> 01:16:47,785
- Let me drive you.
- Get away! And stay away!

737
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,867
Stay away!

738
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:30,948
Come here.

739
01:17:33,678 --> 01:17:36,479
I SAID COME HERE!

740
01:17:44,014 --> 01:17:48,997
I just left Jeff. He's not coming
back and there's nothing you can do.

741
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:50,927
He's gone.

742
01:17:53,994 --> 01:17:58,498
So that leaves just you and me
and this here pump.

743
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:07,076
I can't stop you from loving him.

744
01:18:09,513 --> 01:18:13,199
And you can't stop me
from loving you.

745
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:16,784
This is what started it all.

746
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:21,488
Marina number one. I wanted oil.

747
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:25,562
When it started pumping,
you wanted me.

748
01:18:26,218 --> 01:18:28,778
Now I want it to stop pumping.

749
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:32,636
Stop pumping!

750
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:44,008
It's no use - I can't stop it.

751
01:18:45,364 --> 01:18:48,535
I guess that's the way
it's got to be, Marina.

752
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:52,345
Just you and me and the pump, baby.

753
01:18:52,481 --> 01:18:54,697
Come here.

754
01:18:56,845 --> 01:19:00,146
When I tell you
to come here, come here.

755
01:19:52,702 --> 01:19:54,972
TYRES SQUEAL

756
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:09,307
- What's the matter?
- It's Paco, over there.

757
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:16,642
I was watching from the veranda...

758
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:19,234
He drove up and started
to shoot at the beam.

759
01:20:19,377 --> 01:20:23,075
He stumbled and fell
and before I could do anything...

760
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:28,876
Oh, Jeff, I...!
I think I'm going to be sick.

761
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:50,843
Give each man
50 rounds of ammunition.

762
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,493
Post lookouts for banditos.

763
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:03,653
A sad accident. A pity.

764
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,817
I am very sorry
I could not bring more men.

765
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:12,889
When he attacks, we have guns.

766
01:21:13,092 --> 01:21:15,723
Please, tell Mrs Conway to hurry.

767
01:21:21,554 --> 01:21:23,117
Mount that machine gun.

768
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:30,663
Car's ready to take you to town.

769
01:21:40,264 --> 01:21:43,279
You'd better get started.
You may not be safe here soon.

770
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:47,303
You've been very kind.
Much kinder than I deserve.

771
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,713
This may not be the time, Jeff...

772
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:58,631
but now that I'm alone,
you know what I want to say.

773
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:01,616
Yes, I do, and don't say it.

774
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:07,424
- I have a right to now. So have you.
- I'm leaving here as soon as I can.

775
01:22:07,559 --> 01:22:10,035
Leaving here?! Why?!

776
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,611
Oh, I don't believe it!

777
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,729
You actually mean it!

778
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:21,145
No, Jeff! Don't go! I'm desperate!

779
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,865
I need you! Help me! Help me!

780
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:27,790
I'm sorry for you,
but I can't help you.

781
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:30,864
You mean you won't!
You don't want to! Why?

782
01:22:30,999 --> 01:22:35,944
- This time I'm helping myself.
- That's not the reason, you know it.

783
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:39,954
Is it that girl?
No, you're not in love with her!

784
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,027
Now that I hear you say it,
I think I am.

785
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:47,231
You belong with me
and you're going to stay with me.

786
01:22:47,366 --> 01:22:48,745
You're wrong.

787
01:22:48,893 --> 01:22:51,587
I'm not going to let you
walk out on me!

788
01:22:51,794 --> 01:22:53,794
We've got everything
we ever wanted.

789
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:57,457
Money, this and each other!
What more do you want?

790
01:22:57,592 --> 01:23:00,535
Something you can never give.

791
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,779
It's not your fault
but you never had it to give.

792
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:09,386
- What can she do for you? What?!
- Nothing. But I can trust her.

793
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:15,033
I'm not going to let you go.
I can't, not after what I've done!

794
01:23:19,149 --> 01:23:21,194
What have you done, Marina?

795
01:23:30,855 --> 01:23:33,496
What have you done, Marina?

796
01:23:33,631 --> 01:23:37,269
I committed murder
to get you! Murder!

797
01:23:37,404 --> 01:23:39,613
You killed Paco?!

798
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:42,951
I did it for you!
Don't you understand?

799
01:23:43,578 --> 01:23:47,679
- I did it for you!
- You killed Paco! You killed him!

800
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:03,296
Makes me sick to even look at you.

801
01:24:03,969 --> 01:24:06,641
You'll never get away from me!
I'll never let you go!

802
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:11,408
I'll say I killed him
and you helped me!

803
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:15,915
I don't care if they hang me
just so they hang you, too!

804
01:24:47,142 --> 01:24:49,645
No! No!
