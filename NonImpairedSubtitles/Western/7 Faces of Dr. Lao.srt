1
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,124
Pipe down, Thunder.

2
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,948
Did you ever see a catfish
riding on a yellow jackass before?

3
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,700
Not that I can remember.

4
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,951
No touch.

5
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,787
Him Golden Ass of Apuleius.
Him very mean.

6
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,664
No touch.

7
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,586
Excuse, please.

8
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,339
Excuse, please.

9
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,465
Hello.

10
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,467
Who's that, anyway?

11
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,512
I don't know.
Looked like a Jap to me.

12
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,639
He's Chinese.

13
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,642
-How do you know?
-Because I ain't stupid.

14
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,937
Well, whoever he is,
he sure come to the wrong town.

15
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,981
Hello.

16
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,201
You miserable piece of junk!
I ought to--

17
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,995
Excuse, please. Excuse.

18
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,332
Excuse.

19
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,167
Who're you?

20
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,960
Name Lao.

21
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,712
Doctor Lao.

22
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,133
Ain't nobody sick here, unless you
know how to remedy this machine.

23
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,427
Do printing here?

24
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,721
No. We sell ladies' underwear.

25
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,557
What's the matter with you,
big wise guy?

26
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,061
All the time make jokes.
Make fun of old Chinese fellow.

27
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,189
Take it easy. It's too late
in the afternoon for tantrums.

28
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,941
Who you? Who you?

29
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,025
You boss?

30
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,694
No. Boss, he over there.

31
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,115
Busy?

32
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,117
Well, you might say.

33
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,078
Okay. I wait.

34
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,070
Hi, Tim.

35
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,321
Ed.

36
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,200
-What can I for you, Mr. Stark?
-Nothing.

37
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,829
Not a thing. Just passing by.
Thought I'd drop in to say hello.

38
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,582
Of course, if you have
some business to do.

39
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,418
That's okay. I wait. I wait.

40
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,966
I read your editorial this morning.
That was a fine piece of writing.

41
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,553
Real fine. You certainly know
how to put words together.

42
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,930
I'll just bet you liked it.

43
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,682
Of course I liked it.

44
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,810
I always like it when a man
speaks his mind.

45
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,147
That part where you told
all the people not to sell out.

46
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,982
Boy, that was brave.

47
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:01,320
And where you talked about fear.
Now, what was that again?

48
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,030
Here, you read it.

49
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,410
''The prices paid
by Mr. Clint Stark

50
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,412
for real estates and labor

51
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,082
are so patently unfair
as to be ludi-cross.''

52
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,626
Ludicrous!

53
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,419
Down about three paragraphs.

54
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,921
Three what?

55
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,636
''All dictators past and present
have thrived in a climate of fear.

56
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,347
Without fear, they perish.

57
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,516
People are afraid of Clint Stark

58
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,101
and so long as this
situation exists

59
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,521
he will continue to rule Abalone.''

60
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,022
That's great stuff.

61
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,982
Then I take it you agree with me.

62
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,276
Of course I agree with you.

63
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,570
But the thing is,
the people are afraid of me

64
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,865
because I own them
lock, stock and barrel.

65
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,827
-They sold out a long time ago.
-Then what are you so worried about?

66
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,870
You.

67
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,081
I'm worried about you.

68
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,792
See, you're a smart boy

69
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,421
and I just hate to see you wasting
your time. Now, don't get me wrong.

70
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,006
I appreciate a fighter.

71
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,802
I especially appreciate a fighter
who has the odds against him.

72
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,347
But there aren't any odds here.
And there isn't any fight.

73
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,015
Maybe I can stir one up.

74
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,725
Not a chance.

75
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,436
You'll just make the people feel bad.

76
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,857
Believe me, this town isn't
worth the trouble.

77
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,527
Then why are you so interested
in buying every square inch of it?

78
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,407
Because I'm a philanthropist, boy.
I like to help people.

79
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,663
Now let me ask you one.

80
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,207
What's your stake in this?

81
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,918
How come you're so concerned
about Abalone?

82
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,005
-Abalone is my home.
-That won't wash.

83
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,340
A year ago you hadn't heard
of the place.

84
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,593
You're a city boy, Ed.

85
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,179
You have some other reason.

86
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,559
Well, now, Mr. Stark, I guess I just
can't keep any secrets from you.

87
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,395
The real reason is,
''I'm a philanthropist, boy.''

88
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,231
You wanna know something?
I think you are.

89
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,692
I really think you are.

90
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,402
Good luck, Ed.

91
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,740
You're on the wrong side,
but I like your style.

92
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,576
I wish I could return the compliment.

93
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,744
Let's go.

94
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,809
What can we do for you, mister?

95
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,103
Very small matter.

96
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,398
I like to run advertisement.

97
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,441
Excuse.

98
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,984
In newspaper.

99
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,614
Something wrong?
You sick maybe?

100
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:57,829
It's just it's kind of a shock.
We don't get much new business here.

101
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:58,956
How much?

102
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,876
Well, that depends.
You want a full column or a--

103
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,002
Big, big, big!

104
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,255
Full page. Run two days.

105
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,340
Start right away, chop-chop.

106
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,551
A full page for two days?

107
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,054
How about

108
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,722
$50?

109
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,974
Good, good, good.

110
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,107
American money?

111
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,068
Yes, we'd prefer it
if you don't mind.

112
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,695
No, no. Don't mind.

113
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,198
Fifty dollars.

114
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,828
You fix?

115
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,454
I fix.

116
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,664
Mr?

117
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,624
Lao.

118
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,877
Doctor Lao.

119
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,005
What part of China are you from?

120
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,592
Last residence Panohai.

121
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,096
Pee-a-en-oh-ha-a-ai.

122
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,472
Panohai.

123
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,725
Hello. Goodbye.

124
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,311
Thank you. Thank you.

125
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,529
What in Tom thunder?

126
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,327
You gonna print that stuff?

127
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,121
Why not? He paid for it, didn't he?

128
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,457
Besides, I smell a story.

129
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,313
Howdy! Have you
got anything to read--?

130
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,691
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benedict.
I said, ''Have you got anything--?''

131
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,151
-I heard you.
-Where?

132
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,904
The section on manners
is right over there.

133
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,949
I've read those.
I'm looking for something on China.

134
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,451
When do you leave?

135
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,372
As soon as you marry me. I thought
it'd be a nice place to honeymoon.

136
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,082
Edward Cunningham!
lf you--

137
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,587
Seriously, I want to check
on a city called Panohai.

138
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,007
Section on Asia, third shelf
from the top.

139
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,010
-You wouldn't want to help me?
-You can find it.

140
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,680
It’s called The History of China
by D. Boulger.

141
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,432
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

142
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,726
lt should be clear by now
that I do not

143
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,146
wish to go out with you,
Mr. Cunningham. Ever.

144
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,815
Why not?

145
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,109
All those stories about me,
they're lies!

146
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,319
I’m not a bank robber
or a cattle rustler.

147
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,990
And I’ve never kicked a woman
in the stomach even once. Really!

148
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,616
It’s quite impossible.

149
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,870
I’ve a little boy and a mother-in-law
to take care of.

150
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,957
And you've only been in town a short
while. I don't even know you.

151
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,209
-So please, stop asking.
-Never.

152
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,129
lt isn't Mike or your mother-in-law.
It’s because you're afraid.

153
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,964
-Of you?
-Of falling in love.

154
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,132
Of being a woman.

155
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,635
That's what you are, Angela,
underneath all those widow's weeds.

156
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,557
Isn't that right, Luther?

157
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,942
You got any more of that pie, Gram?

158
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,195
-Certainly.
-He can get it himself.

159
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,654
All right.

160
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,325
Thank you.

161
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,662
Ed likes apple pie too.
When are we gonna invite him over?

162
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,957
Don't be disrespectful.
His name is Mr. Cunningham.

163
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,669
Come on, Mom.
He said I could call him Ed.

164
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,671
And I say you can't.

165
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,341
Now you get the pie
and go finish your homework.

166
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,009
All right.

167
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,723
Don't bother with the dishes.
I’ll do them when I get back.

168
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,891
All right.

169
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,645
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Michael.

170
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,146
Good night, Grandma.

171
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,856
Good night, Mike.

172
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,197
You're being a little hard on him.

173
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,409
It’s not easy for a boy to grow up
without his father.

174
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,328
I know.

175
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,039
You could change that, Angela.

176
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,876
Did you hear me?

177
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,545
Yes.

178
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,047
He is such a fine man.

179
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,590
Who is?

180
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,592
Ed Cunningham.

181
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,973
Oh, Sarah, I do wish you'd stop
going on about that drifter.

182
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,641
He is not a drifter!

183
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,810
He's been here almost a year.

184
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,895
Whatever else you may
think of him

185
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:35,941
you have to admit he is the only
man in town with spirit enough

186
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,652
to stand up to that devil, Stark!

187
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,406
Well, it takes more than spirit
to make a fine man.

188
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,910
I loved your son, and no other man
will ever take his place.

189
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,957
No, Sarah.

190
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,459
We'll manage, just you and l.

191
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,087
After all, Mike has two mothers

192
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,756
and that makes up for quite a lot.

193
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,929
I won't be late.

194
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,434
Good night, dear.

195
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,073
I don't think Cunningham's
going to show up.

196
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,200
Why not?

197
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,951
He doesn't want to lose.

198
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,286
Who does?

199
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,579
I do.

200
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,250
Mayor, every time I bet on weakness,
corruption and fallibility

201
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,002
I want to lose.

202
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,587
But I always win.

203
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,963
Hey, boss.

204
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:56,188
Meeting will come to order.
Now, folks, may I have your attention?

205
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,859
Now a few words from someone
who don't need any introduction.

206
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:05,322
The man who's done more
for Abalone than any other man

207
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,990
Mr. Clinton Stark.

208
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,501
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

209
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,378
fellow citizens of Abalone.

210
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,882
I know you're all tired of waiting,
so I’ll cut the fancy talk

211
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,843
and come right to the point.

212
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,303
Abalone is dying of thirst.

213
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,015
Now, you all know we get our water

214
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:36,353
from a point 16 miles from here
through an underground pipe.

215
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,898
That pipe is worn out.
It’s crumbling.

216
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,485
According to the top engineers
of this state, it has

217
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,571
maybe another six months left.

218
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,989
Then it's finished.

219
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,993
So looking at it realistically

220
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,580
it seems you all have two choices:

221
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,000
Either you repair the pipe,
or you let it rot.

222
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,837
Now, if you repair the pipe

223
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,799
it'll cost you $237,000!

224
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,220
And what do you get for your money?

225
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,514
I’ll tell you that too.

226
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,060
Nothing. Because that's
what Abalone is. Nothing.

227
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,729
Zero.

228
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,981
Is that what you want?

229
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,942
To spend the rest
of your lives here

230
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,111
as bored as you've always been?

231
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,863
Of course not.

232
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,949
But you don't want
to die of thirst either.

233
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,121
Now, you can't afford to leave
your homes, lose your possessions.

234
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,541
Folks, I have an alternate
choice for you.

235
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,879
Sell.

236
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,132
Sell what you've got and move away.

237
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,717
Leave Abalone

238
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:49,885
to the buzzards.

239
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,764
Folks, I’ll buy this town from you.

240
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,057
Every house.

241
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,560
Every building.
Every single nail.

242
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,438
And pay you a fair price to boot.

243
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,317
So you don't have to go
head over heels into debt

244
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,904
to raise $237,000.

245
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,198
You don't have to lose
everything you've got.

246
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,908
That makes sense!

247
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:21,250
Well, I think we all agree

248
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,586
that Mr. Stark has been
more than generous with us.

249
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:27,297
I suggest, therefore,
that we take a vote--

250
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,966
Just a minute!

251
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,347
I’d like to say a few words
if Mr. Stark doesn't mind.

252
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,183
Not in the least, Mr. Cunningham.

253
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,436
After all, this is a free country.

254
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,189
It’s good someone remembers that.

255
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,985
You know, folks,
I haven't been here long.

256
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,695
But it's home to me.

257
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,282
And I believe in fighting for
your home when it's threatened.

258
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,493
Now, Mr. Stark wants us
to sell our home.

259
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,329
Because it's gonna be
an effort to keep it.

260
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:04,168
Even if we make the effort, he says
that Abalone is nothing. It’s zero.

261
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,004
I say he's wrong.

262
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:11,008
I say any place where people live
and work together

263
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,342
is something.

264
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,344
Something very important.

265
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,680
Now, one more thing.

266
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,684
Just outside of our town,
there's another

267
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,813
with even less of Mr. Stark's
kind of future.

268
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,734
There's one of its citizens.
Stand up, please, George.

269
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,029
This is George G. George.

270
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,448
He's a Navajo Indian.
Most of you know him.

271
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,660
His forefathers were here before
the white man even heard of America.

272
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,455
What will happen to his family,
his friends

273
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,624
without our town to help him?

274
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,417
I’d like to say something.

275
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,879
All right, Mrs. Benedict.

276
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,257
lf Abalone is as worthless
as Mr. Stark says

277
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,927
why is he so anxious to buy it?

278
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,555
That's a fair question.
I’m glad you asked it.

279
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,267
Mrs. Benedict, you're a teacher,
a librarian.

280
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,605
And as such, you can take a dull boy
and make him into a smart boy.

281
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,608
ln a manner of speaking,
you can turn a profit.

282
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,068
It’s the same with me.

283
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,529
I’m a businessman, and as such

284
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,783
I feel I can do this,
well, without taking a loss.

285
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,244
-It’s as simple as that.
-But just exactly--?

286
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,623
You should be ashamed of yourself
for doubting Mr. Stark's integrity.

287
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,085
Mr. Stark, when do we
have to give our answer?

288
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,295
Well

289
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,172
frankly

290
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,466
I’d hoped to settle this
this evening.

291
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,969
But if you want some time
to think it over

292
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,847
well, let's say
within a couple of days.

293
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,101
Thank you.

294
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,228
Thank you very much, Mr. Stark.

295
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,232
We owe you a vote of gratitude
for being so fair with us.

296
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,067
Don't you agree, folks?

297
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,865
Meeting adjourned
until 9:30 Friday night.

298
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,664
Oh, George.

299
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,792
We didn't accomplish very much

300
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,003
but thanks for coming down.

301
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,214
Not a chance, Ed.

302
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,801
They're sentimental, but that
doesn't make them stronger.

303
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,970
That's what you want to think.

304
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,806
You'll find this
hard to believe

305
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,559
but I was like you once,
a long time ago.

306
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,895
I believed in the dignity of man.

307
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,230
Decency. Humanity.

308
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,356
But I was lucky.

309
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,984
I found out the truth early, boy.

310
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,445
And what is the truth, Stark?

311
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,863
It’s all very simple.

312
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,325
There is no such thing
as the dignity of man.

313
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,287
Man is a base, pathetic,
vulgar animal.

314
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,166
Good night, Ed.

315
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,344
Halt, you miserable redskin!

316
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,223
You're keeping the wrong kind
of company, boy.

317
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,351
Ain't good to be seen
with a man like Cunningham.

318
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,896
Bad medicine. Savvy?

319
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,234
Cat got your tongue?

320
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,028
I believe that's what's happened.
Cat got his tongue.

321
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,951
Who told you you could go?

322
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,245
He's a sassy one, ain't he?

323
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,081
You know what my old man used to say?

324
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,876
He said the only good
Injun's a dead Injun.

325
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,005
What do you think of that, boy?

326
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,261
Talk, you miserable redskin!

327
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,929
Talk!

328
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,266
Talk!

329
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,324
Excuse, please.

330
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,788
This town ain't big enough
for you and me, partner.

331
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,590
Smile when you say that,
you miserable horny-toad hombre.

332
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,316
What happened?

333
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,322
Read all about it!

334
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,282
Circus coming to town!

335
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,619
Read all about it!
Read all about it!

336
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,163
Circus coming to town!

337
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,625
-Good morning, Mr. Ramsey.
-Why don't you aim, boy?

338
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,669
I do, Mr. Ramsey! I do!

339
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,383
Hey, Bunny, look it here!

340
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,679
I can't come out like this.

341
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,057
Says here a circus
is coming to town.

342
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,475
To Abalone?

343
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,312
That's what it says.

344
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,315
I can't believe it.
Hasn't ever been a circus here.

345
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,529
Read all about it! Read all about it!
Circus coming to town!

346
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,954
That darn kid.
He threw the paper under the car.

347
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,624
Mr. Frisco, good morning.

348
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,085
Good morning, Mrs. Cassin.

349
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:45,050
And how is our esteemed mayor
this morning?

350
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,719
Oh, fine, thank you.
Just fine!

351
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,146
Read all about it!
Circus coming to town!

352
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,773
That young hoodlum!

353
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,817
It’s just the Daily Star, dear.

354
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,987
Don't mess me up, stupid.
Go get the paper.

355
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,029
Yes, dear.

356
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,699
Somebody ought to arrest
that rapscallion!

357
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:13,203
He's just like that no-good
Cunningham. A troublemaker!

358
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,080
Give it here.

359
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,208
And sit down.
You give me the jitters.

360
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:22,254
I’m sorry, dear. I don't mean
to give you the yitters.

361
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,881
Say ''jitters.''

362
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,845
What in the world is a Medusa?

363
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,432
A Medusa, dear heart, is a.

364
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,768
Well, it's a mythological creature

365
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,353
with snakes on her head

366
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,272
instead of hair.

367
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,565
And

368
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,071
if you look at her face

369
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,365
you turn to stone.

370
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,994
Shut up, Luther!
And don't be ridiculous!

371
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,245
Yes, dear.

372
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,178
Wait! I wanna talk to you!

373
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,014
Edward Cunningham, Esquire.

374
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:19,269
Editor in chief of the
Abalone Daily Star. How do you do?

375
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,230
Who's talking? Where are you?

376
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,356
Here.

377
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,398
There.

378
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,275
Everywhere.

379
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,907
Are you going to write about me
in your newspaper?

380
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,701
lf you give me something
worth writing about.

381
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,373
As a rule, Dr. Lao does not approve
of our speaking for publication.

382
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,125
But I see no harm in telling you

383
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:46,588
that I was born in the year 1 204.

384
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,759
Or is it 41 2?

385
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,929
I can't seem to remember.

386
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,806
But at any rate

387
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,435
I am the greatest magician
the world has ever known.

388
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,147
It’s funny.
I’ve never heard of you.

389
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,484
But you have heard of me. Indeed.

390
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,278
The name is Merlin.

391
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,363
-Merlin?
-Merlin.

392
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,700
The magician from His Majesty

393
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,494
-King Arthur's court.
-Of course!

394
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,248
And that big ape I saw hammering the
stakes, he was from the Himalayas?

395
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,209
Precisely. Abominable, isn't he?

396
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,503
About this Dr. Lao

397
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,589
where's he from?

398
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,675
China. But you needn't
bother about him.

399
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,468
No talent there.

400
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,305
Strictly an executive type.

401
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,557
Pray, do not quote me.

402
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,684
I wouldn't dream of it.

403
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,187
But tell me, what does he do?

404
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,105
Oh, dear.
I’m frightfully sorry.

405
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,566
I’ve said much too much already.

406
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:52,029
Oh, but do, do let me show you
some small sample of my craft.

407
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,074
May I have the notebook
which is in your pocket?

408
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,413
Now tell me, Mr. Edward Cunningham

409
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,373
what you most desire.

410
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,918
Oh, no. That's terribly
stupid of me.

411
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:09,087
Mortals have but one basic desire.

412
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,632
Now hold this in your hand.

413
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,801
Now close your eyes

414
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,555
and say the magic word.

415
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:23,227
-What is the magic word?
-''Money,'' of course. Say it.

416
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:24,770
Money.

417
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,731
Open your eyes.

418
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:29,900
It worked!

419
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,610
It worked!

420
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:36,406
A small sum, of course.
But then, I tire easily.

421
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:40,410
-Magic is extremely exhausting.
-No, thank you.

422
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,079
-Beg your pardon?
-No, thanks.

423
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,164
I came here for a story,
not a bribe.

424
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,791
Merlin! Merlin!

425
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,584
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

426
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,420
Now I really am in trouble.

427
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:57,010
Welcome to the Circus of Dr. Lao.

428
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,429
How may we serve you?

429
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,307
By giving this money
back to the old boy--

430
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,726
What money, Mr. Cunningham?

431
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:09,106
Come on, doc. What kind of Oriental
hocus-pocus is going on around here?

432
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,109
A circus with no wagons,
no animals, no cages

433
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,820
a crazy old magician?
What's it all about?

434
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,489
Our circus is different.
That's what I promised.

435
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:21,952
I’m not interested in promises.
I’m interested in the real story.

436
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,788
And don't tell me about Panohai.
I looked it up.

437
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,666
Panohai went out of existence
thousands of years ago.

438
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,753
Forgive me, but you worry too much.

439
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:37,050
You worry about how I brought
my circus to Abalone without wagons.

440
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,845
You worry about the future
of your town

441
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:43,140
or if the sun will rise
a year from today.

442
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:47,311
The answers to such matters
remain posed behind a curtain.

443
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,648
Then time says, ''Presto!''
And out they come.

444
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,484
Tomorrow night
I promise you ''presto.''

445
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,196
The strangest story you've ever known.

446
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,780
Now, Mr. Cunningham

447
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:02,743
do you suppose this garrulous
intruder may be

448
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,078
a swindler perhaps?
An assassin?

449
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:09,500
A charlatan plotting some curious
disaster for your town?

450
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:14,713
Such characters exist, but they are
secretive rather than mysterious.

451
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,050
l, sir, am a major mystery.

452
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,012
You're a convincing talker
about very unconvincing things.

453
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:26,099
Whatever men do not understand,
they find unconvincing.

454
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,686
But please don't suppose I’m
dangerous, because I’m unfamiliar.

455
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,021
I ask

456
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,607
that you believe in me.

457
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:35,192
As what?

458
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,694
As a friend of yours,
of your town

459
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,738
of all human beings.

460
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,406
That's quite a spiel.

461
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,242
Thank you.

462
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:48,372
Well, I’m leaving in a cloud
of befuddlement.

463
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,541
And with nothing to go on
except a hunch

464
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,335
that you're a nice guy.

465
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,380
Good afternoon, Mr. Cunningham.

466
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,802
Hey! How come you speak
perfect English all of a sudden?

467
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,973
Oh, it comes and goes.
Whatever dialect the mood requires.

468
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,182
Comes and goes?

469
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,476
What's the matter?
Always asking questions.

470
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,937
Wise guy!
Get on your motorcycle!

471
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,427
Hey, mister, how'd you do that?

472
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,138
So sorry.
Don't speak English.

473
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,724
You do too. Ed said so.

474
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,852
And I know who you are.
You're Dr. Lao.

475
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,981
Astute observation.

476
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,941
Goom-bye.

477
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:03,280
I’ll carry your posters.
Even help you put them up!

478
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,407
-lf you'll show me how.
-What name?

479
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:09,244
-Mike Benedict, sir.
-Okay, Mike. You come.

480
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:12,831
-Are you an acrobat?
-Only philosophically.

481
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,043
-What?
-Only philosophically!

482
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,003
Really? Can you walk a tightrope?

483
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,463
lf required.

484
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,800
My specialty, however, is wisdom.
Do you know what wisdom is?

485
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:24,801
No, sir.

486
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,303
Wise answer.

487
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,388
I can walk on my hands.
Wanna see?

488
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,516
Not now, please.

489
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,817
How do you do that?

490
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,987
You come circus.

491
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,990
Bring Mama and Papa also.
All my guests.

492
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,909
You mean free?

493
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,786
Gosh! Thanks!

494
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:54,164
But I can't bring my father,
because he's dead.

495
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,585
Oh, that's very sad, Mike.

496
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,754
But I never knew him.

497
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:04,007
He got killed when I was little.
I’m the man of the house.

498
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,176
You're a very fine young man.

499
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,262
I’m not so young.

500
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,180
I’m 8 going on 9.

501
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,725
Eight going on 9 is young,
believe me.

502
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,228
Eight going on 9
is remarkably young.

503
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:17,855
How old are you?

504
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,274
I believe I shall tell you.

505
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,192
I am seven thousand

506
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:25,404
three hundred and twenty-two
years old

507
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:26,905
this October.

508
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:28,740
That is old!

509
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,868
It is, rather.

510
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,473
lf you ask me,
that's quite a stunt!

511
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,434
I guess he's got a gramophone
hid somewheres.

512
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,394
That's it. lt must be.

513
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,107
This is the Circus of Dr. Lao

514
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,944
We show you things
That you don't know

515
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,655
We've spared no pains
And we've spared no dough

516
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,658
For we wanted to give you
One hell of a show!

517
00:33:56,662 --> 00:34:00,499
And youth may come
And age may go

518
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:04,294
But no more circuses
Like this show

519
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,171
Fifteen cents.

520
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,464
You free.

521
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,634
Step up! Step up!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

522
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:11,802
Thank you, sir.

523
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,846
Isn't it exciting?

524
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,932
I haven't been to a circus
in, well.

525
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,935
In a long time! I hope
they have a fortuneteller.

526
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:24,022
Not that I believe in them, of course.
But they are fascinating.

527
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,738
Go in and wait about 45 minutes.

528
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:32,781
Thank you, boss.

529
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,991
See Apollonius!

530
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,617
See the Snowman!

531
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:36,785
Hurry! Hurry!

532
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,704
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

533
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:42,416
See the Medusa turns
men of granite to stone!

534
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:46,545
And see the Great Serpent. See him
rise, see him coil, hear him hiss!

535
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,506
See wonders never before beheld
by the eyes of mortal man.

536
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:53,468
See the Great Pan,
the incarnation of the carnal!

537
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,930
See Apollonius of Tyana.
He sees all, tells all!

538
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,807
Nothing but the truth.

539
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:03,562
It's the chance of a lifetime.
The dark mysteries unfolded.

540
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,565
Step right up!
Only 1 5 cents!

541
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,902
Now please keep in line.
Step right up! Fifteen cents.

542
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,404
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

543
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:17,910
You frightened me.

544
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,580
You wish your future told?

545
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,045
You look like Howard

546
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,507
my poor, dear departed husband.

547
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,051
You know he did not die.

548
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,887
He simply walked out of your life

549
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,388
years ago.

550
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,808
Yes. Well, you know everything,
don't you?

551
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:47,231
lf you know my past so well, let's see
if you can really tell my future.

552
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,649
Be seated.

553
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,443
Five cents, please.

554
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,079
Shall I ask questions?

555
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,163
If you wish.

556
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,249
This is so exciting.

557
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,291
Let me see now.

558
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,543
I know.

559
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:11,588
How soon will I strike oil
on that 20 acres of mine?

560
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,925
-Never.
-But I paid a fortune for that land.

561
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,927
You wasted your money.

562
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,929
Next question.

563
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,764
I can't hear you.

564
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,100
You must listen.

565
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,769
You needn't be so brusque.

566
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,313
It's just a game, after all.

567
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,027
All right, you naughty man.

568
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:37,281
You see, what I really
want to know is

569
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,075
when shall I be married again?

570
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:41,577
Never.

571
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,664
Well, what sort of man
will come into my life?

572
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,749
Let's put it that way.

573
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,627
There will be no more men
in your life.

574
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,130
Really! Really!

575
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,800
What's the use of my living
if I’m not going to be rich

576
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,635
no more men, for heaven's sake?

577
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,971
I only read futures.

578
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:04,266
-I don't evaluate them.
-That's utter nonsense!

579
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,813
The future is always nonsense

580
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,191
until it becomes the past.

581
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,985
Well, go on. Do your job.
I paid you.

582
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,695
Read my future!

583
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:20,240
Tomorrow will be like today

584
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,454
and the day after tomorrow will be
like the day before yesterday.

585
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,874
I see your remaining days

586
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,502
as a tedious collection of hours

587
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,837
full of useless vanities.

588
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,466
You will think no new thoughts

589
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,552
and you will forget what little
you have known.

590
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:45,015
Older you will become, but not wiser.

591
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:49,311
Stiffer, but not more dignified.

592
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,733
Childless you are

593
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,195
and childless you will remain.

594
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,366
Of that suppleness you once commanded
in your youth

595
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:06,578
of that strange simplicity
which once attracted men to you

596
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,705
neither endures

597
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,708
nor shall you recapture them.

598
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,878
You're a mean, ugly man!

599
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,422
Mirrors are often ugly

600
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,049
and mean.

601
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,511
When you die

602
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,596
you will be buried and forgotten.

603
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,391
And that is all.

604
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,977
And for all the good or evil

605
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:34,439
creation or destruction your
living might have accomplished

606
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,944
you might just as well
never have lived at all.

607
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,618
I am sorry, but you see, it is
my curse to tell the absolute truth.

608
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,023
Oh, Mrs. Cassin.

609
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,487
Angela, whatever you do,
stay out of there.

610
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,988
Why? Isn't he any good?

611
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,823
Oh, no. He's wonderful!

612
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:28,577
Absolutely the most magnetic man
I’ve ever met in my whole life

613
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,496
next to Howard, God bless his soul.

614
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,039
Do you know what he told me?

615
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:36,084
That I’m going to be rich, strike oil.
And promise you won't tell.

616
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,629
I’m going to be married again.

617
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,507
And Clinton Stark is the lucky one.

618
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,176
That's very nice,
but why shouldn't I go in?

619
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,220
Well, he's not very polite.

620
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,223
He pinched me three times.

621
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:53,352
But I suppose you haven't anything
to worry about, come to think of it.

622
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,645
Toodle-loo.

623
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,647
Estimable educator.

624
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,441
Mother of fatherless Mike,
good friend.

625
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,651
Lose something?

626
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,694
Yes. My mother-in-law.

627
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,905
She over there, I think.

628
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,574
Have plenty fun. You too?

629
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,701
Well, it's very nice, thank you.

630
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,370
Good, good, good.

631
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,205
Exhibit around corner.

632
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:27,441
Step in. Step in.

633
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,360
Step this way, if you please.

634
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,030
The most charming figure

635
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:36,867
in the old Greek
polytheistic mythology

636
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,661
is Pan, the God of Joy

637
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,707
combining the forms of man

638
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,542
and goat.

639
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,044
It's a fake.

640
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,384
It's gotta be.

641
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,430
Hi, there.

642
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:44,351
Why, don't be frightened, kiddo.
I’m harmless.

643
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,979
Dr. Lao saw to that.

644
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:50,941
Come here.

645
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,364
Do I look familiar to you?

646
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,745
Now that you mention it, you do.

647
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,166
This circus is like a mirror.

648
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,711
You see yourself in it sometimes.

649
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,130
Sometimes someone else.

650
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:16,008
Didn't Dr. Lao tell you about it?

651
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,219
He will, Mr. Stark.

652
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,973
How do you know my name?

653
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:28,395
I know a lot of unimportant
stuff like that.

654
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:32,483
Well, whoever you are
and however you work

655
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,526
you interest me.

656
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,361
You know why?

657
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,490
Because we look alike
and have much in common.

658
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,825
For one thing

659
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,870
our suspicion.

660
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:50,876
-Why do you buzz your tail like that?
-Why not?

661
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:54,505
It's the most treasured gift
of my ancestors.

662
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,800
-I wouldn't care to trade with you.
-Maybe not.

663
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,303
But the point is, my scaly friend

664
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:04,848
that you are in a cage
while I’m free to walk about.

665
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,684
Oh, you have your cage too.

666
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:12,147
You test your bars just as
often as I test mine, kiddo.

667
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:16,527
Why do you wear those things
over your eyes?

668
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,570
So I can see.

669
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,073
I have an astigmatism.

670
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:22,699
They're glasses.

671
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:27,788
The creator who made you cunning

672
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:31,458
made my eyes efficient enough
to perceive objects

673
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:33,085
without aid.

674
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:38,006
In fact, the Lord of All Living
dealt with me quite generously.

675
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:42,219
Strength He gave me
and symmetry and endurance

676
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,346
and patience.

677
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,098
But look at you.

678
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:50,686
You even have to hang rags on yourself
to protect your weak skin.

679
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,231
You have to hang things in front
of your eyes in order to see.

680
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,024
Look at yourself!

681
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,822
I’ll admit I’m not perfect, but--

682
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,575
You can say that again, kiddo!

683
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:10,497
You're just about the most imperfect
creature I’ve ever seen!

684
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:13,000
And I’ve seen some lulus!

685
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:15,377
To tell you the truth

686
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:19,965
even the thought that
I resemble you makes me ill.

687
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,468
Well, it doesn't make me
too happy either.

688
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:25,596
Hey, boss

689
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,348
we've been looking
all over for you.

690
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,934
You don't have to worry
about no newspaper no more.

691
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,477
Who was you talking to?

692
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:38,442
-No one.
-Well, I thought I heard--

693
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,529
-That's an ugly devil!
-Let's scat. Let's scat!

694
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:46,950
You wouldn't say that if I were
on the other side of these bars.

695
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,327
Let's get out!

696
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:50,787
Mr. Stark!

697
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:07,137
“Monsieurs et Mesdames”, it give me
great pleasure to present to you

698
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,724
direct from a long and successful
run at the court of King Arthur

699
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,476
that inimitable dramaturge

700
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:17,481
that master of magic, sorcery,
wizardry and prestidigitation

701
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,650
the crown prince
of the black arts

702
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,693
Merlin the Magician!

703
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:28,784
Go on!

704
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,828
On with the show!

705
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,459
Oh, dear, I’m terribly sorry.

706
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,681
What sort of magic
would you like to see?

707
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,766
What kind have you got?

708
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,811
Oh, all sorts, really.

709
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,063
Though I am a bit out of practice.

710
00:48:58,313 --> 00:48:59,857
Well, let's see now.

711
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:01,525
What have we here?

712
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,111
Oh, we have a ball, haven't we?

713
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:08,198
Just an ordinary ball, isn't it?
I suppose so.

714
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:13,120
Oh, dear, now we have two!

715
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,998
Make a rabbit come out
of the bag.

716
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:18,584
Oh, very well. I’ll try it.

717
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:20,002
Hocus

718
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,336
Pocus.

719
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,094
I wanted a rabbit!

720
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:31,805
Oh, I’m sorry.

721
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,057
I did my very best.

722
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:35,851
Disappear.

723
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,270
Can you do magic with cards,
Mr. Merlin?

724
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,064
For you, sir, I will.

725
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:43,400
One

726
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,235
two

727
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:46,403
three.

728
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:49,698
I don't like that.

729
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:55,871
Faker!

730
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,289
Phony!

731
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:07,090
Why don't you change
the water into booze?

732
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:09,635
Very well.

733
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,304
Hocus-pocus.

734
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,097
Come and take it.

735
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,752
Would you care for some, young lady?

736
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:28,963
I never drink.

737
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,964
Neither does he.

738
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:33,801
Let me try some of that stuff.

739
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:40,141
Tastes just like ginger ale.

740
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:41,892
I beg your pardon, sir.

741
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:46,605
This is the finest vintage champagne
ever served in America.

742
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:50,109
Come on, do something!

743
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:51,610
Don't just stand there!

744
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,320
Show us some real magic!

745
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:56,490
Mother, have him do
something I like.

746
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,873
Do you like flowers, little lady?

747
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:04,915
A little.

748
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:29,648
The last one is for you, my dear.

749
00:51:57,635 --> 00:51:59,762
Now come on.
Do something really big!

750
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,265
Yeah! Make a woman float
in the air

751
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:05,434
like I seen once in Tucson!

752
00:52:05,643 --> 00:52:07,353
She was beautiful.

753
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:14,693
Mother, I’m tired of this.

754
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,488
Be still. This gentleman
is trying to do tricks.

755
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:19,698
Tricks!

756
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:22,910
Gadzooks, madame.
These are not tricks.

757
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:26,372
I do magic. I create.

758
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:29,291
Il transpose. I transubstantiate.

759
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,710
I break up. I recombine.

760
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,671
But I never trick.

761
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:36,006
You stink!

762
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:38,217
It’s just done with mirrors!

763
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:40,219
-Fake!
-Phony!

764
00:52:41,804 --> 00:52:42,638
You're wrong!

765
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:45,015
I’m a great magician!

766
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:50,896
I have just created something
from nothing. Isn't it enough?

767
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,357
Anybody can make a bunch of flowers.

768
00:52:54,692 --> 00:52:57,027
Very well. Flowers aren't enough?

769
00:52:57,236 --> 00:53:00,239
Perhaps you'd like
a few man-eating tigers!

770
00:53:00,406 --> 00:53:01,699
Fat chance.

771
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:05,744
How about a pink elephant?

772
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:07,955
Wag.

773
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:09,248
Willow.

774
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:10,541
Wick!

775
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,710
Bugs! Let's go!

776
00:53:13,002 --> 00:53:15,129
You can't throw the lady
in the air?

777
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:16,589
Come on!

778
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:19,049
Wick. Wag. Wiggle!

779
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:21,677
Wee. Wire!

780
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:28,184
Oh, how does that go?

781
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:33,564
I’ve forgotten.

782
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:40,070
I’ve forgotten

783
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:43,073
so many things.

784
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,163
So long, girls.

785
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:06,138
It's all right, Mr. Merlin.

786
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:08,724
They don't understand,
but I do.

787
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:11,727
I think you're the
greatest magician ever.

788
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:15,314
-I believe in you. Really.
-You do?

789
00:54:17,817 --> 00:54:19,401
Thank you, my boy.

790
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,793
Hey, doc.

791
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:38,712
What's this supposed to be?

792
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:40,673
Him my pet!

793
00:54:41,632 --> 00:54:42,633
Him pet!

794
00:54:42,842 --> 00:54:44,426
A catfish for a pet?

795
00:54:44,844 --> 00:54:48,681
My man, you are gazing upon the
legendary terror of the seven seas.

796
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:52,643
A genuine, bona fide sea serpent.

797
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:58,983
What's the matter with you crazy
people? All the time ''ha-ha''!

798
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:02,903
Please! Please!
You make sea serpent very mad!

799
00:55:03,112 --> 00:55:07,032
If I was to catch a itty-bitty
thing like that, I’d throw it back!

800
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:11,495
I fear you do not understand, laddie.

801
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:14,498
There are certain lakes
in Switzerland

802
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:16,500
certain lochs in Scotland

803
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:19,628
which are called
the eyes of the sea.

804
00:55:19,837 --> 00:55:24,675
They are so called because these
lakes and lochs are bottomless.

805
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,848
Aye. They extend far beneath
the surface of the land

806
00:55:31,056 --> 00:55:34,101
and lead to the great
and mysterious oceans

807
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,811
of which they are a part.

808
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:40,983
Not unlike salmon, sea monsters,
as they're referred to

809
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:43,819
come to the lochs to breed.

810
00:55:44,236 --> 00:55:46,947
I caught this one
as a wee baby myself.

811
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:50,493
It was a wee, sleeked,
cowering, timorous beastie!

812
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,286
That's a lot of hogwash.

813
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,330
Just what do you take us for?

814
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:57,041
Those lads who are fishermen

815
00:55:57,249 --> 00:56:01,086
are doubtless familiar with
the species maculatus spheroides

816
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:03,172
otherwise known as the blowfish.

817
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,176
The blowfish is a small creature
inhabiting the depths of the sea.

818
00:56:07,384 --> 00:56:10,429
Take him from those depths,
where the pressure is extreme

819
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,723
or into the air, where there's
little pressure

820
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:14,100
and what happens?

821
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:16,227
His eyes bulge, then

822
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:19,522
he puffs himself up
many times his natural size.

823
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,565
Hence the name blowfish.

824
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:26,737
So it is with the sea serpent.
In the water

825
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,073
he is small,
insignificant, petite.

826
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:32,034
But out of the water
and exposed to the air

827
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:34,995
and he doubles his size
every 10 seconds

828
00:56:35,204 --> 00:56:38,582
until he reaches his full growth,
and no man knows how big that is.

829
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:43,129
You see what happened? He pulled
his head out of the water

830
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:46,090
it has grown huge,
and men on passing ships

831
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:49,426
have sworn they have
seen a gigantic monster.

832
00:56:49,885 --> 00:56:52,972
Which explains the legends
of lurking sea serpents.

833
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:56,434
There ain't no pressure in that bowl.
Just a little water.

834
00:56:56,642 --> 00:56:58,269
Show us a demonstration.

835
00:56:58,477 --> 00:57:01,105
Oh, so sorry. No can do.

836
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:05,151
Look, this monster's fondest ambition
eat up Dr. Lao!

837
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,695
Cannot understand why.
Very bad thing.

838
00:57:07,903 --> 00:57:12,783
Honorable servant probably taste
like leftover turkey!

839
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:18,330
Don't touch it.

840
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:21,584
-We just wanna take a look!
-Watch who you're pushing!

841
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:22,710
Carey!

842
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:34,180
Come on.

843
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:44,523
Step up. Step up. Step up.

844
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:48,152
Good citizens of Abalone,
you are about to see

845
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,029
the Medusa.

846
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:52,990
The Medusa is a third cousin

847
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,785
of the original Gorgon sisters

848
00:57:56,577 --> 00:58:00,998
who disturbed the land of Greece
in the time before Ulysses

849
00:58:01,207 --> 00:58:03,417
Agamemnon, Achilles

850
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:05,336
et cetera, et cetera

851
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:07,838
and, of course, et cetera.

852
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,804
And like her Gorgon sisters

853
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:19,683
she has the power to turn those who
dare to look straight into her eyes

854
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:21,977
into stone.

855
00:58:22,353 --> 00:58:25,856
To spare you good people
from being converted

856
00:58:26,065 --> 00:58:29,318
into monuments, obelisks
and so forth

857
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:32,404
I have rather ingeniously,
I think

858
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:35,699
made it possible for you
to see the Medusa

859
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:37,993
only in a mirror.

860
00:58:39,203 --> 00:58:41,705
Thus seen, she is

861
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:42,706
harmless.

862
00:58:42,915 --> 00:58:46,877
I entreat you, please be content
with the reflected image.

863
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:50,506
Do not go peeking around
the edges of the canvas.

864
00:58:50,714 --> 00:58:54,969
It is a move which might produce
most unpleasant results.

865
00:58:55,344 --> 00:58:57,179
She is a genuine Medusa

866
00:58:57,388 --> 00:59:00,391
over 3000 years old.

867
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,727
She don't look a day
over 500 to me, doc.

868
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:17,616
It's a disgrace!

869
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:19,535
Now, Kate, please.

870
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,371
I just wanna say one thing.

871
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:23,873
Where is he?

872
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,544
-Where is that old faker?
-Yes, madam?

873
00:59:28,752 --> 00:59:30,045
I wanna say one thing

874
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:34,216
that I never listened to such
lies in all my born days.

875
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:37,428
Snakes turning people
to stone! The idea!

876
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:40,723
Please. Don't make trouble
in front of all these people.

877
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:43,184
Shut up! I’ll say what
I darn well please.

878
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:44,226
My dear lady

879
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:47,688
the role of skeptic
becomes you not.

880
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:50,608
There are things in the world
not even the experience

881
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:53,778
of a lifetime spent
in Abalone could conceive of.

882
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:58,699
Is that so? I’m gonna make a liar
out of you in front of everybody.

883
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:00,409
Get out of my way!

884
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:04,705
I’ll show her!

885
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:07,792
All right, cheap little hussy,
you don't--

886
01:00:29,814 --> 01:00:32,108
It's all right.
Pete, help me.

887
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:35,361
Arthritis attack.
She's had them before.

888
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:48,499
Hey, Luther. Did you
buy yourself a statue?

889
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:50,918
This ain't no statue. It's my Kate.

890
01:00:51,168 --> 01:00:53,629
Stoned again?

891
01:00:54,505 --> 01:00:56,006
She looks better that way.

892
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:59,176
-Call a doctor.
-This is the worst attack she's had.

893
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:03,514
Hocus

894
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:06,600
pocus dominocus.

895
01:01:07,184 --> 01:01:09,437
Chay, Chay

896
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,105
Chay.

897
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,333
Luther.

898
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:39,550
Let's go home.

899
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:43,345
Giddap. Come on, giddap.

900
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,055
You see

901
01:01:45,264 --> 01:01:46,807
I told you.

902
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:50,728
I told you I was a good magician.
Did you see?

903
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:53,481
Everybody go home. Circus over.

904
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:57,359
Oh, dear. Oh--

905
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:03,449
Come back tomorrow. Big finale!

906
01:02:03,908 --> 01:02:06,410
Goom-bye. Come back tomorrow.

907
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:07,912
Big show.

908
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,583
Scram. Goom-bye. Goom-bye. Phew!

909
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,887
Now eat your food,
Mr. Cricket. Eat it.

910
01:02:25,429 --> 01:02:28,307
You're making me angry at you.
You're a bad cricket.

911
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,936
Don't speak back to me.
I’m very disappointed in you.

912
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:40,361
What's the matter you?
You crazy boy.

913
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,780
You want mother and
grandmother to worry?

914
01:02:42,988 --> 01:02:44,949
They're asleep. I snuck back out.

915
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,286
Dr. Lao, I wanna have
a talk with you seriously.

916
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:52,039
No. No time. Very upset.

917
01:02:52,623 --> 01:02:54,959
On account of Mrs. Lindquist
turning to stone?

918
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,920
No. On account of cricket.

919
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,801
Okay. You have problem?

920
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:09,765
I need a full-time job,
and I was just wondering

921
01:03:09,974 --> 01:03:12,893
if maybe you could use me
with the circus?

922
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:14,937
But I like your circus.

923
01:03:15,146 --> 01:03:16,605
And I’ve always wanted to

924
01:03:16,814 --> 01:03:20,734
be in the circus. I’d work hard,
and I wouldn't be any trouble.

925
01:03:20,985 --> 01:03:23,654
And I can do a lot of tricks. Look.

926
01:03:31,704 --> 01:03:33,122
How you do that?

927
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:36,792
Oh, that's very good. Very good.

928
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:46,969
But, Mike, we have a magician.

929
01:03:47,386 --> 01:03:51,140
Confidentially, you much better.

930
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:55,936
But that make the Great Merlin
very sad. You understand?

931
01:03:56,854 --> 01:03:59,231
I understand. You can't use me.

932
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:02,818
Mike, let me tell you something.

933
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:06,781
The whole world is a circus
if you know how to look at it.

934
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:12,077
The way the sun sets when you're tired
and comes up when you're on the move

935
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:14,288
that's real magic.

936
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,002
The way a leaf grows.
The song of the birds.

937
01:04:20,669 --> 01:04:24,840
The way the desert looks at night
with the moon embracing it.

938
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:30,221
Oh, my boy, that's circus
enough for anyone.

939
01:04:31,013 --> 01:04:34,975
Every time you watch a rainbow
and feel wonder in your heart.

940
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:37,770
Every time you pick up
a handful of dust

941
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:40,106
and see not the dust

942
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:44,318
but a mystery, a marvel,
there in your hand.

943
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:47,154
Every time you stop and think:

944
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:52,451
''I’m alive, and being alive
is fantastic.''

945
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,163
Every time such a thing happens

946
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:58,541
you're part of
the Circus of Doctor Lao.

947
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,293
I don't understand.

948
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,003
Neither do I.

949
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:40,458
Well, I always say:

950
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,627
''If you're gonna do something,
do it right.''

951
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:48,466
You look surprised.

952
01:05:48,757 --> 01:05:53,012
I am. I didn't think
Stark was this worried about us.

953
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,889
Well, he ain't worried no more.

954
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:10,571
What are you aiming to do?

955
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,490
Get drunk!

956
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:09,964
Angela!

957
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:11,382
Is that you?

958
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:12,508
Yes, Mother.

959
01:07:13,217 --> 01:07:14,343
What is the matter?

960
01:07:15,094 --> 01:07:16,053
Nothing, nothing.

961
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:19,598
Just that infernal music.
It makes me nervous.

962
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:21,767
What music?

963
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:24,353
Never mind, Mother.

964
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,355
You're perspiring.

965
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:28,983
Am I?

966
01:07:30,443 --> 01:07:32,361
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

967
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,823
Yes, Mother, very sure.

968
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:39,160
Go back to bed. I think
I’ll get a glass of cold water.

969
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:43,122
All right.

970
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,758
Do you suppose that crazy little
Chinaman had something to do with this?

971
01:08:36,091 --> 01:08:37,426
Who else?

972
01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:44,934
How?

973
01:08:46,102 --> 01:08:50,689
We'll figure that out later.
Right now let's get to work!

974
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:16,590
What's your problem, cousin?

975
01:09:16,757 --> 01:09:18,050
Where's Stark?

976
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:19,635
How are you, Ed?

977
01:09:19,844 --> 01:09:21,053
Couldn't be better.

978
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,722
Glad to hear it.
What can I do for you, boy?

979
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:27,393
Not a thing. I thought you might
wonder about your paper.

980
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:29,520
Well, I did miss it.

981
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,272
No problems, I hope.

982
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:33,023
Just one.

983
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:35,276
The presses broke down.

984
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:37,570
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.

985
01:09:37,778 --> 01:09:38,737
It's all right.

986
01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:40,531
They're fixed now.

987
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:45,286
A short tissue this time, but you'll
understand. Won't you, Mr. Stark?

988
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:48,497
Let's see. You're not
a subscriber, are you?

989
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:52,877
You ought to think about it.

990
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:57,381
How're you gonna know what's
happening in town without the Star?

991
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,551
Here's a complimentary issue.
For you too.

992
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:04,722
-So long.
-Ed.

993
01:10:05,514 --> 01:10:07,433
You really think you have a chance?

994
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:09,977
Well, I was beginning to wonder.

995
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:12,730
Then something happened
that cheered me up.

996
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:15,399
You read about it on page one.

997
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,657
Boss, it couldn't be.

998
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,243
It really couldn't be!
We ruined it.

999
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:27,661
Shut up!

1000
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,836
It ain't possible, is it?

1001
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,435
I hate to tell you this.

1002
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:55,606
There aren't any fish in that river.
In fact, there isn't any river.

1003
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:58,400
That's okay. Me no use bait.

1004
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:00,486
Oh, I see.

1005
01:11:01,195 --> 01:11:04,990
I want to thank you
for what you did.

1006
01:11:05,574 --> 01:11:07,993
I don't suppose you'd
tell me why or how?

1007
01:11:08,202 --> 01:11:11,622
What's the matter? All the time, talk!
Scare away fishie!

1008
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:14,625
-Wise guy.
-Hey, Ed.

1009
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,627
Ed, come here!

1010
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:23,509
Ramsey and some of them
other fellows had a get-together

1011
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:24,969
in the café.

1012
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:27,221
-Well?
-They're gonna sell out to Stark.

1013
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:30,641
-You sure?
-Vote's tonight. It don't look good.

1014
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:31,976
They're scared.

1015
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:34,812
Stark was right.
I was crazy fighting for--

1016
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:36,981
Mr. Cunningham. Please.

1017
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:40,860
You come to circus tonight.
May be big surprise.

1018
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:53,205
I got you.

1019
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,209
Oh, fishie!

1020
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:01,505
Oh, look what Dr. Lao has! Trout!

1021
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,174
Did you see that?

1022
01:12:03,382 --> 01:12:05,843
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

1023
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:06,886
Ed.

1024
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:08,721
It's a trout.

1025
01:12:10,181 --> 01:12:11,849
Big, big trout.

1026
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:37,541
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!

1027
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,128
Welcome to the final showing
of the Circus of Dr. Lao.

1028
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:45,633
Tonight we present to you what they
call in the language of France

1029
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:46,926
the piece de resistance.

1030
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:50,471
In the words of Philosopher Mencius,
''You ain't seen nothing yet!''

1031
01:12:51,097 --> 01:12:53,766
You can say that again, doc!

1032
01:12:59,772 --> 01:13:00,606
I’m sorry.

1033
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:02,650
Hello.

1034
01:13:11,992 --> 01:13:13,494
You remind me of someone.

1035
01:13:15,996 --> 01:13:19,083
A woman I know.
Her name's Angela Benedict.

1036
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,503
Same height. Same weight.
Same general features.

1037
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:23,963
Ever meet her?

1038
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:26,674
No, but I’ve heard of her.

1039
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:30,511
She's supposed to be
a most unpleasant person.

1040
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:32,096
Oh, no.

1041
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,806
Now.

1042
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:39,061
Whoever told you that? It's a lie.
Angela is.

1043
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:43,149
Well, you see,
Angela has got a problem.

1044
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:44,692
What kind of a problem?

1045
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,319
The worst kind, same as mine.

1046
01:13:47,736 --> 01:13:49,113
Loneliness.

1047
01:13:51,282 --> 01:13:53,617
It's the worst thing
to happen to a person.

1048
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,954
You see, people think
that Angela's hard.

1049
01:13:57,163 --> 01:13:59,206
People think she's cold.

1050
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:02,126
But she isn't hard and she isn't cold.

1051
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:05,337
She's soft and warm.

1052
01:14:06,839 --> 01:14:08,674
She's afraid to let anyone know.

1053
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:12,887
Well, that sounds very odd to me.

1054
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,597
No, it isn't odd at all.

1055
01:14:14,805 --> 01:14:17,725
I’m trying to tell you,
loneliness can do that.

1056
01:14:19,059 --> 01:14:23,481
Then, of course, it isn't
any of my business, but

1057
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:26,567
why don't you and this person
become friends?

1058
01:14:27,234 --> 01:14:30,196
I mean if-- lf you're both lonely.

1059
01:14:30,404 --> 01:14:31,238
She doesn't like me.

1060
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:36,076
And it doesn't make
any difference now.

1061
01:14:37,328 --> 01:14:40,372
Town we live in will be deserted
in a few weeks.

1062
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:43,667
They haven't decided yet?

1063
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:48,047
Just pretend they haven't.
I’m pleased to meet you, Miss--

1064
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,799
Call me Angela.

1065
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:52,843
Angela.

1066
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,054
Beautiful name.

1067
01:14:57,056 --> 01:15:00,976
You were born with a great love
for humanity, Clinton Stark

1068
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:05,856
but this love soon turned
to bitterness and contempt.

1069
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,441
Why?

1070
01:15:09,652 --> 01:15:12,446
It's because in all your years

1071
01:15:12,655 --> 01:15:16,867
you've never been able to
understand that perfection exists

1072
01:15:17,076 --> 01:15:18,410
only as an ideal.

1073
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:22,706
Who's interested in ideals?
Get the money. That's what counts.

1074
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:25,709
Hold it out to the people.
They'll grab at it.

1075
01:15:26,418 --> 01:15:29,046
That's the truth.
There's nothing in between.

1076
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:32,216
Oh, but there is.
Life is sharing.

1077
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:37,179
You began with an extreme notion
of man's good

1078
01:15:37,388 --> 01:15:39,223
his strength and his nobility.

1079
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:43,686
You ended with another extreme,
equally false.

1080
01:15:43,936 --> 01:15:48,732
The notion of man's evil,
his weakness and his ignobility.

1081
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:52,194
Now you are involved
in proving that point.

1082
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,613
I’m proving it pretty well, I’d say.

1083
01:15:55,281 --> 01:15:57,199
If you believed that

1084
01:15:57,408 --> 01:16:00,119
you wouldn't need
to reassure yourself every day.

1085
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:02,371
Look at you now

1086
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:05,958
gloating over a victory
which is a defeat.

1087
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,045
A defeat for all the ideals
you once held sacred.

1088
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:13,132
They'll vote to sell.

1089
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:14,925
What have you shown

1090
01:16:15,134 --> 01:16:19,472
but your own greed, your own
sick hunger for self-destruction?

1091
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:23,893
If they sell their town to you,
you'll realize an extensive profit

1092
01:16:24,977 --> 01:16:29,607
because you alone know a railroad's
planned for this area within the year.

1093
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,150
How'd you find out?

1094
01:16:31,984 --> 01:16:34,278
I am Apollonius of Tyana.

1095
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:36,238
Did you tell anyone?

1096
01:16:37,948 --> 01:16:41,327
That would have the effect
of altering the future.

1097
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:45,748
Five cents, please.

1098
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:00,763
Am I going to win?

1099
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:04,975
Yes.

1100
01:17:25,037 --> 01:17:28,833
I can't figure out how he managed
to get so much into this tent.

1101
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:32,378
It seems to be bigger on the inside
than it is on the outside.

1102
01:17:32,586 --> 01:17:36,507
-Dr. Lao is a remarkable man.
-Peanuts.

1103
01:17:39,552 --> 01:17:42,096
Hey! How soon's the show gonna start?

1104
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:43,639
Almost instanter.

1105
01:17:43,848 --> 01:17:45,057
How much is peanuts?

1106
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:48,102
-One penny.
-I’ll take a bag.

1107
01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:51,689
Out of a nickel.

1108
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:55,651
Pass that up, please.

1109
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:58,404
-How much is the popcorn?
-What's that?

1110
01:17:58,612 --> 01:18:00,739
-How much is the popcorn?
-Popcorn's free.

1111
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,616
Right here!

1112
01:18:07,246 --> 01:18:08,038
And now

1113
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:10,332
on with the show!

1114
01:19:19,443 --> 01:19:21,445
Ride him, sonny, ride him!

1115
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:23,823
Ride him, sonny.

1116
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,340
For me?

1117
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:44,051
Oh, thank you.

1118
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:47,930
Nice man. A real gentleman.

1119
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:17,376
He's blind.

1120
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:19,795
He can't see. He can't see.

1121
01:20:43,402 --> 01:20:44,653
Ladies and gentlemen

1122
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,323
the spectacle you've
been waiting for:

1123
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:50,785
The Fall of the City.

1124
01:20:51,577 --> 01:20:53,996
I almost forgot.

1125
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:56,874
Excuse very much. Excuse.

1126
01:20:57,082 --> 01:20:59,668
I almost forgot.

1127
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:02,296
My pet.

1128
01:21:03,047 --> 01:21:04,673
The Loch Ness monster.

1129
01:21:04,882 --> 01:21:05,883
Excuse.

1130
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:09,345
Excuse very much. Excuse, please.

1131
01:21:09,553 --> 01:21:10,763
Excuse.

1132
01:21:25,236 --> 01:21:27,321
The Fall of the City.

1133
01:21:28,405 --> 01:21:31,867
The city's name was Woldercan.

1134
01:21:32,827 --> 01:21:37,331
It existed beyond the edge
of the world

1135
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,751
some years before the beginning
of history.

1136
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:44,046
There are no records of Woldercan.

1137
01:21:44,255 --> 01:21:47,049
No artifacts.
No descendants of its people.

1138
01:21:47,466 --> 01:21:51,011
In fact, there is no proof that
there was such a place.

1139
01:21:51,595 --> 01:21:55,182
Yet it was as real as pain.

1140
01:21:56,142 --> 01:21:58,936
Citizens of Abalone, I give you

1141
01:21:59,603 --> 01:22:01,230
Woldercan.

1142
01:22:03,315 --> 01:22:07,027
It was a small city. A humble city.

1143
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:10,573
Its people had little
in the way of worldly goods.

1144
01:22:10,781 --> 01:22:14,743
And this little made
for themselves by themselves

1145
01:22:14,952 --> 01:22:16,912
or euchred from the stubborn soil

1146
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:21,208
or plucked from the cold
and capricious heart of the sea.

1147
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:24,086
Yet the Woldercanese were content

1148
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:26,255
for in the goods of the spirit

1149
01:22:26,464 --> 01:22:27,256
they were rich.

1150
01:22:28,549 --> 01:22:31,635
For them, it was enough
to partake of creation

1151
01:22:31,844 --> 01:22:34,096
and to give thanks unto their God.

1152
01:22:34,472 --> 01:22:36,724
Enough, and more.

1153
01:22:39,518 --> 01:22:43,981
Then one day, a stranger
appeared in Woldercan.

1154
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,858
And he said to the people:

1155
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:46,942
Not enough!

1156
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:52,448
You are poor when you could be rich.

1157
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:54,241
You eat of humble fare

1158
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:57,703
when you could feast.

1159
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:02,792
You scratch at the ground,
and the ground mocks you.

1160
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:05,419
You pray to your God

1161
01:23:05,795 --> 01:23:07,797
and He laughs at you.

1162
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:12,718
Fools. Be gone
from this blighted place.

1163
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:14,345
Fools.

1164
01:23:18,015 --> 01:23:20,810
And suddenly people were not content.

1165
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:24,146
They listened to the stranger

1166
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,609
and sold their souls
for pieces of silver.

1167
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:31,987
Then a fearful thing happened.

1168
01:23:32,696 --> 01:23:36,575
The God of All Life looked down
upon the people of Woldercan

1169
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:38,911
and was displeased.

1170
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,954
And he said:

1171
01:23:40,538 --> 01:23:44,166
Treasures I had given
thee beyond compare

1172
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,669
yet thou didst spurn them

1173
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:49,797
and for a handful of silver

1174
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,758
sold thy souls.

1175
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:55,052
And because He had been angered

1176
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,430
God pointed His finger

1177
01:23:57,638 --> 01:24:00,641
and visited upon
the city of Woldercan

1178
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:04,645
the greatest plague of all:

1179
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:07,106
Oblivion.

1180
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:01,929
The time has come

1181
01:26:02,304 --> 01:26:04,807
when we must decide
whether to accept

1182
01:26:05,015 --> 01:26:06,725
Mr. Stark's terms.

1183
01:26:07,017 --> 01:26:09,061
But before the final vote is taken.

1184
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,646
I’d like to say.

1185
01:26:12,648 --> 01:26:14,733
Well, I’d simply like to say:

1186
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:18,320
''Let your conscience be your guide.''

1187
01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:23,576
Would a show of hands
be satisfactory, Mr. Stark?

1188
01:26:25,202 --> 01:26:26,162
All right then.

1189
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:30,082
All those in favor of accepting
Mr. Stark's proposal

1190
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:32,001
raise your hands.

1191
01:26:40,718 --> 01:26:45,139
I said, ''Those in favor of accepting
Mr. Stark's proposal.''

1192
01:26:47,266 --> 01:26:49,018
Those against?

1193
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:03,616
Citizens of Abalone, I’ve lost.

1194
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,785
I want you to know

1195
01:27:06,202 --> 01:27:08,579
it's the kind of loss

1196
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:11,957
I’ve wished for, a long time.

1197
01:27:13,334 --> 01:27:17,838
So I guess I’ve really won.
I think you ought to know

1198
01:27:18,255 --> 01:27:21,008
the railroad's coming
through Abalone

1199
01:27:22,384 --> 01:27:24,345
which means money for you.

1200
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:27,807
But you've gained something
more than money, my friends.

1201
01:27:28,015 --> 01:27:29,100
So have I.

1202
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:31,811
How it happened

1203
01:27:33,145 --> 01:27:35,064
I don't exactly know

1204
01:27:36,065 --> 01:27:37,149
but somehow

1205
01:27:37,566 --> 01:27:38,526
I think

1206
01:27:38,901 --> 01:27:41,153
we all owe a debt of gratitude

1207
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:44,907
to an old Chinese faker named Lao.

1208
01:28:06,303 --> 01:28:07,721
Dust storm!

1209
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,315
Well, good night.

1210
01:28:18,524 --> 01:28:20,234
-Good night, Tim.
-Good night.

1211
01:28:20,443 --> 01:28:21,944
Isn't it a beautiful night?

1212
01:28:22,153 --> 01:28:24,655
Oh, yes, it's beautiful.

1213
01:28:35,374 --> 01:28:36,751
It's getting worse!

1214
01:28:37,126 --> 01:28:39,253
You'd better stay a while.

1215
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:41,464
How do you feel?

1216
01:28:41,672 --> 01:28:44,091
Wonderful. I woke up
and found out something.

1217
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:45,926
Care to tell me?

1218
01:28:46,135 --> 01:28:50,264
Just that there's music in the air,
and that I’m a liar and worse.

1219
01:28:50,473 --> 01:28:51,724
I’m in love.

1220
01:29:16,248 --> 01:29:19,043
And I say he's a hypnotist.

1221
01:29:19,251 --> 01:29:20,252
Who?

1222
01:29:20,503 --> 01:29:23,464
That old Chinese faker.

1223
01:29:23,839 --> 01:29:27,426
The way I figure it, he's
got everybody hypnotized.

1224
01:29:27,635 --> 01:29:29,303
Dirty foreigner.

1225
01:29:34,683 --> 01:29:36,519
Harry, some more redeye, and fast!

1226
01:29:36,727 --> 01:29:39,647
What do you suppose happened
to the boss?

1227
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:42,775
He turned yellow, that's what.

1228
01:29:43,442 --> 01:29:46,779
And I’m through with him.
You hear me? Through!

1229
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,614
Carey, you know.

1230
01:29:49,281 --> 01:29:53,661
You know, I think we ought to pay
that little baldy a visit.

1231
01:29:54,537 --> 01:29:57,331
Yeah. Shake him up a little.

1232
01:29:58,165 --> 01:30:01,460
You'll see how fast them people
come to their senses.

1233
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,339
-We'll show them who's boss.
-What about the storm?

1234
01:30:05,548 --> 01:30:09,176
Well, who's afraid
of an itty-bitty storm?

1235
01:30:29,155 --> 01:30:31,699
Carey, how come the tent
don't blow down?

1236
01:30:32,032 --> 01:30:34,118
He's got it hypnotized too.

1237
01:30:34,326 --> 01:30:37,663
He's got everything hypnotized
except us.

1238
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:39,665
Let's go.

1239
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:44,295
Hey, Baldy. Where are you?

1240
01:30:44,545 --> 01:30:47,715
Come on out, you old Chinese faker!

1241
01:30:56,515 --> 01:30:57,558
Hey, Carey!

1242
01:30:57,767 --> 01:30:59,059
Have a look.

1243
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:07,193
Ruin it. Ruin it.

1244
01:31:08,068 --> 01:31:09,320
Hey, Carey!

1245
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:12,698
Look here. The fish.
Come here.

1246
01:31:31,759 --> 01:31:32,885
Carey, finish him off!

1247
01:31:37,389 --> 01:31:38,224
Dr. Lao

1248
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:41,185
open up, Dr. Lao! Hurry!

1249
01:31:41,393 --> 01:31:43,229
Dr. Lao! Please open up!

1250
01:31:43,437 --> 01:31:46,232
Dr. Lao! Please hurry!

1251
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:49,860
It's Mr. Stark's men!

1252
01:31:50,111 --> 01:31:51,403
They're wrecking your circus!

1253
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:52,905
They let your pet out.

1254
01:31:53,114 --> 01:31:54,573
Loch Ness monster out of tank?

1255
01:31:58,744 --> 01:32:00,871
Hey, look. Wait.

1256
01:32:10,005 --> 01:32:13,801
Okay, Mike. Oh, my pipe. My pipe.

1257
01:32:17,138 --> 01:32:18,639
Over there!

1258
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:49,128
Lucas, don't stand there!
Help me!

1259
01:32:49,336 --> 01:32:50,421
Oh, please.

1260
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:18,282
Be careful!

1261
01:33:47,394 --> 01:33:48,229
Dr. Lao!

1262
01:33:55,861 --> 01:33:58,656
Please! Please!

1263
01:33:58,864 --> 01:34:00,825
Out. Get out. Get out.

1264
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:07,373
Go. Get out. Out.

1265
01:34:42,324 --> 01:34:43,284
Dr. Lao!

1266
01:34:58,424 --> 01:35:01,093
Dr. Lao, look out!
He's gonna eat you!

1267
01:35:14,273 --> 01:35:16,317
My pipe. My pipe!

1268
01:35:56,899 --> 01:35:59,735
Dr. Lao! Dr. Lao, are you all right?

1269
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:01,112
I guess so.

1270
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:04,824
My glasses.

1271
01:36:05,366 --> 01:36:06,784
My glasses.

1272
01:36:07,993 --> 01:36:08,953
My glasses!

1273
01:36:13,624 --> 01:36:15,000
Here my glasses.

1274
01:36:23,884 --> 01:36:25,010
My pet!

1275
01:36:25,261 --> 01:36:26,679
My pet.

1276
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,807
Oh, I got him. Oh, I got him.

1277
01:36:32,184 --> 01:36:36,480
I got him. I got him. Okay.

1278
01:36:38,274 --> 01:36:41,861
That's show biz. Come on, Mike.

1279
01:36:57,585 --> 01:37:00,129
Look, the circus is gone.

1280
01:37:03,966 --> 01:37:05,926
Mike, I want you to tell the truth.

1281
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:09,096
Honest, Mom.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1282
01:37:09,346 --> 01:37:11,056
It was bigger than a building.

1283
01:37:11,265 --> 01:37:14,518
It chased them out of town.
It was gonna eat up Dr. Lao.

1284
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:19,190
But I lit the machine and it exploded,
and then it began to rain and--

1285
01:37:19,398 --> 01:37:21,859
This belongs to Lucas.
I recognize it.

1286
01:37:22,067 --> 01:37:25,196
You see. Now you
believe me, don't you?

1287
01:37:25,404 --> 01:37:29,158
I believe something fishy's
been going on the past couple days.

1288
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:30,868
There they are.

1289
01:37:33,162 --> 01:37:35,247
Michael! Mike, come back here!

1290
01:37:35,456 --> 01:37:37,374
Mike, come back here!

1291
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:40,753
Dr. Lao, Dr. Lao! Wait for me!

1292
01:37:40,961 --> 01:37:42,671
Mike! Michael!

1293
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:44,840
Come back!

1294
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:51,722
Wait for me, Dr. Lao. Wait for me.

1295
01:37:54,016 --> 01:37:55,559
Come back, Mike.

1296
01:37:58,104 --> 01:38:00,106
Wait for me, Dr. Lao!

1297
01:38:14,787 --> 01:38:16,455
I wonder where he came from.

1298
01:38:17,415 --> 01:38:18,624
Or where he's going.

1299
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:21,085
Or if he was ever here at all.

1300
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:35,266
I can do it. You see, Dr. Lao,
I can do it.

1301
01:38:35,433 --> 01:38:37,726
Look, Dr. Lao. Watch me.

1302
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,187
I can do it!

1303
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:45,276
Mike, the whole world is a circus
if you look at it the right way.

1304
01:38:46,569 --> 01:38:49,572
Every time you pick up
a handful of dust

1305
01:38:50,114 --> 01:38:51,866
and see not the dust

1306
01:38:52,491 --> 01:38:55,661
but a mystery, a marvel,
there in your hand.

1307
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:58,539
Every time you stop and think:

1308
01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:02,626
''I'm alive, and being alive
is fantastic. ''

1309
01:39:04,503 --> 01:39:08,340
Every time such a thing happens,
Mike, you are

1310
01:39:08,549 --> 01:39:10,968
a part of the Circus of Doctor Lao.
