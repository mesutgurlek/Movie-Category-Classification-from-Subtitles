00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,528
SORRY SIGHT I MUST SEEM
TO YOU THIS WAY, TWO PERSONS.

313
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,732
NOT LIKE THE MAN
YOU MET WHEN,

314
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,403
WHEN YOU WAS 10.

315
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:15,605
NO.

316
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,243
THE MAN I MET WHEN I WAS 10

317
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:21,945
[clears throat]

318
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,880
WOULD NEVER HAVE
FELT SORRY FOR HIMSELF.

319
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,982
BUT WHO'S GOT A BETTER RIGHT?

320
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,821
WHAT YOU SEEN TODAY
IS ALL THAT'S LEFT OF ME

321
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,623
AND MY LIFE.

322
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,359
[breathing heavily]

323
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,562
A SHOT-UP, BATTERED,

324
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,433
RUIN OF A MAN.

325
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:48,105
AND THE RANCH AIN'T NO BETTER.

326
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,641
THE LAUDANUM'S TAKING EFFECT,
JUST LET YOURSELF GO TO SLEEP.

327
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,246
10 YEARS,

328
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:01,518
15 YEARS AGO, WE WAS

329
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,855
THE BEST IN THE TERRITORY.

330
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,826
HAD ME MY MISSUS THEN,
AND MY BOY,

331
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:17,401
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
OUTSIDE MY DOORSTOOP.

332
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,403
WHERE ARE THEY NOW,
MR. HATCHER?

333
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:24,374
BURIED

334
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,146
OUTSIDE MY DOORSTOOP.

335
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,351
LOST ETHEL

336
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,589
THE WINTER OF '68,
NOVEMBER THE 11TH, 6:40 P.M.

337
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:44,561
SON CARL WAS NEXT.

338
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,630
WAS TEACHIN' HIM
TO BRAND A STEER.

339
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,966
GOT HIS HEAD STOMPED IN

340
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,669
BY A NO-GOOD-FOR-NOTHIN'.

341
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,407
HE WAS ONLY 9.

342
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:05,215
SHOT THAT STEER 6 TIMES,

343
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,486
CRYIN' ALL THE TIME.

344
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,829
HOW DID THINGS GET SO BAD,
MR. HATCHER?

345
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:23,433
AFTER MY FAMILY DIED,
I JUST SORT OF WENT TO SEED.

346
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:26,570
BY THE TIME I COME OUT OF IT,
I WAS TOO FAR GONE.

347
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,206
DROVE TOO HARD,
WAS TOO SCARED.

348
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,007
NO WAY TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

349
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,912
THE BANK'S GONE WITH ME
AS FAR AS IT'LL GO.

350
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,514
IF I DON'T MAKE THIS DRIVE,

351
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:38,982
AND I LOSE EVERYTHING,

352
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,884
THE RANCH,
THAT'S THE END OF ME.

353
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,187
YOU CAN BURY ME OUT THERE
WITH MY WIFE AND SON.

354
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,489
MY LIFE WOULD HAVE GONE
FOR NOTHIN'.

355
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:47,658
MR. HATCHER,

356
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,028
I DO NOT KNOW MUCH
ABOUT CATTLE,

357
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,299
BUT MAYBE WE COULD
FIND OTHERS WHO DO.

358
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,801
AND WE COULD HELP YOU
ON THIS DRIVE.

359
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:01,771
ONLY THING IS
YOU KNOW HOW FAR I GOT
BY TRYIN' TO HIRE MEN.

360
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,008
WELL, THERE MUST BE MEN
WHO NEED WORK.
I WILL FIND THEM.

361
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:07,277
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

362
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:08,412
OUTSIDE?

363
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,319
[sighs]

364
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:16,786
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKIN' ABOUT?

365
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,222
THAT'S 2 MONTHS' WORK
AT LEAST.

366
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,457
QUENTIN, WHEN I WAS 10
WE HAD A VERY BAD WINTER.

367
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,226
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR PAST HISTORY.

368
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,161
THERE WAS NO GAME FINALLY,
EVEN FOR THE WOLVES.
I'M NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

369
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,197
EVERYONE WENT TO SLEEP
HUNGRY AND COLD.

370
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,733
AND SOME OF THE OLD PEOPLE
AND CHILDREN BEGAN TO DIE OFF,

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,935
I THINK I BEGAN
TO DIE WITH THEM.

372
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,371
AND ONE DAY THIS MAN
CAME IN ON A HORSE,

373
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,607
AND 12 STEERS,

374
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:39,610
AND HE--HE WARMED HIS HANDS
BY OUR FIRE
AND THEN HE RODE AWAY.

375
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:42,212
HE NEVER EVEN ASKED
FOR A PAYMENT, OR THANKS.

376
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,349
ALL HE SAID WAS,

377
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,418
"I NEAR FROZE TO THE SADDLE
GETTIN' 'EM UP HERE.

378
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,520
DO NOT AIM
TO TAKE 'EM BACK DOWN."

379
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,489
YOU DON'T FIGURE
I EVENED THAT SCORE

380
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,258
BY PATCHIN' HIM UP?

381
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,227
I WILL ONLY OFFER MYSELF.

382
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:00,063
QUENTIN, I HAVE TO DO
WHAT I CAN TO HELP HIM.

383
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,736
WOULD YOU EVEN LIKE ME
IF I DID OTHERWISE?

384
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:07,671
NO.

385
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,483
WE'LL TRY.

386
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,252
MR. HATCHER,

387
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,888
YOU CANNOT THINK OF ANYONE
THAT WILL WORK FOR YOU?

388
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,223
(Hatcher)
NOT SINCE SANTOS LEFT ME.

389
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,059
UNLESS WE'RE FORCED TO

390
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:31,928
SCRAPE THE BOTTOM
OF THE BARREL.

391
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,297
I THINK WE ARE.

392
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:36,600
WELL, THERE'S--THERE'S PLENTY
AT THE STABLES. TUCKER.

393
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,936
HE'S OLDER NOW, BUT MAYBE...

394
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,407
HE HAD IT ONCE, ANYWAY.

395
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:46,610
I HEAR WALTER LUCAS
IS BACK IN TOWN.

396
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,646
AND THERE'S THE JANITOR
OF THE BATHHOUSE,

397
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:50,647
COOLER.

398
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,116
UH...

399
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:58,221
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ANYMORE,
I'M GETTIN' DEPRESSED.

400
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,493
(Quentin)
I CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW
AND CARE ABOUT HORSES.

401
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,129
BUT DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CATTLE?

402
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:08,031
CATTLE?

403
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,300
I'M PROBABLY
THE BEST BLACK COWBOY

404
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,803
THAT EVER RUBBED
HIS LEGS RAW ON A DRIVE.

405
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,205
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

406
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:18,742
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU.

407
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,311
(Quentin)
WHERE DID YOU DO
ALL THIS 'COWBOYIN'?

408
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,979
RANCH IN TEXAS.

409
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:23,980
YEAH.

410
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,750
I WAS BORN THERE.

411
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,886
AFTER THAT
GREAT WONDERFUL WAR
THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT,

412
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,155
I TOOK MY FREEDOM AND WENT

413
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,957
WHERE I WASN'T A BLACK MAN.

414
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:36,393
THAT WAS ON A TRAIL DRIVE.

415
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,961
AND I WORKED HARD.

416
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,465
BUT I BECOME
THE BEST THERE IS.

417
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,733
NOW I DON'T

418
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,934
PAY MUCH ATTENTION
TO THIS BLACK
AND WHITE BUSINESS,

419
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:46,970
BUT IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO HAVE THE BEST.

420
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,938
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME ALONG?

421
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:51,742
NOW, THE PAY'S
NOT MUCH UP FRONT,
IT'S ONLY $20.

422
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,110
BUT WITH A SHARE,

423
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,846
BY THE END OF THE DRIVE
YOU COULD DO REAL GOOD
FOR YOURSELF.

424
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,046
MAYBE $50.

425
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,616
$50?

426
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,885
ARE YOU RUNNIN' STOLEN CATTLE
OR WHAT?

427
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:04,287
NO, NO.
IT'S HATCHER'S DRIVE.

428
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,289
YOU MEAN OLD MAN HATCHER?

429
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,958
YEAH, THEY SAY--SAY
HE'S JINXED OR SOMETHING.
NOW IF THAT WORRIES YA...

430
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:11,027
JINXED?

431
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,730
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS STEP OUT ON THE TRAIL.

432
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:16,500
LUCK AND GOD
KISS YOU GOODBYE.

433
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,735
A MAN CAN GET STAMPEDED,

434
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:22,005
DROWNED, DRAGGED,
GOUGED, STOMPED,

435
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,408
FROZEN AND FRIED
ALL IN ONE DAY.

436
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:27,377
JINX. EVERY DAY'S A JINX.

437
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:30,580
HEY, HE'S HAVIN' TROUBLE
FINDIN' MEN, AIN'T HE?

438
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,451
W-WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

439
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,219
YOU'RE ASKIN' ME, AIN'T YA?

440
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,656
YOU FIGURIN' I'M TOO OLD?

441
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,425
I'M ASKIN' YOU, AIN'T I?

442
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,993
I'LL GO.

443
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:45,629
I'LL SHOW THESE PEOPLE
AROUND HERE

444
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,464
I AIN'T NO STABLE BOY.

445
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:52,869
(Morgan)
MR. LUCAS.

446
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,240
THAT'S RIGHT.

447
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:58,608
CAN WE TALK?

448
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,544
I GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO, BOY.

449
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,312
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

450
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:05,048
I USUALLY ONLY SAY THINGS
ONE TIME.

451
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,951
IT IS ABOUT MATTHEW HATCHER.

452
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,787
[sighs]

453
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:12,522
HE GONNA LIVE?

454
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,290
I THINK MAYBE SO, YES.

455
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,625
COME ON UP, BOY.

456
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,561
I WASN'T PLANNIN'
ON NO SPECTATORS.

457
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,430
YEAH, I DON'T PAY YOU
TO TALK, FRAN.
GET UP THERE.

458
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,783
OH, WANT A DRINK, BOY?

459
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,719
I AIN'T REFUSIN'.

460
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:45,455
MR. HATCHER SAYS THAT
12 YEARS AGO,

461
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,323
YOU WERE THE BEST WRANGLER
ON HIS RANCH.

462
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,859
[clears throat]
HMM.

463
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,293
I WAS.

464
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,896
THEN I LEFT HATCHER AND I,

465
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,899
I SIGNED ON WITH ONE
OF THEM OUTFITS
IN A RANGE WAR.

466
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,702
KILLED A COUPLE PEOPLE

467
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,304
IN THE LINE OF DUTY

IF I HAD YOUR TALENT,
I SURE WOULDN'T BE OUT HERE

954
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,129
YOU SAY THAT.

955
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:00,832
I TELL YOU, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS KIND OF LIFE

956
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,134
WHICH I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

957
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:06,037
WHAT I HOPE TO DO
WITH THESE DRAWINGS

958
00:52:06,105 --> 00:52:09,007
IS SHOW THE CITY PEOPLE
WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE
OUT HERE.

959
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:10,842
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S HARD.

960
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,477
THE GRIMNESS OF DEATH.

961
00:52:12,544 --> 00:52:13,745
BUT ALSO,

962
00:52:15,514 --> 00:52:17,215
ALL THIS OPEN SPACE.

963
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,152

I DON'T KNOW.

967
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:30,729
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHS
OF DEAD MEN BEFORE.

968
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:34,065
BUT THEY ALL LOOK
LIKE THEY WERE ASLEEP.

969
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,400
BUT THAT PICTURE
SHOWS YOU DEATH.

970
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:38,970
YOU CAN FEEL IT.

971
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:40,105
THANKS, TUCKER.

972
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:42,741
YOU KNOW, SON, YOU'RE RIGHT.

973
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:44,475
THERE AIN'T A COWBOY
WORTH HIS SPURS

974
00:52:44,543 --> 00:52:47,712
THAT WOULD WANT TO END UP
IN A BOOT HILL OR A CEMETERY.

OLD MAN HATCHER'S
TAKIN' IT PRETTY HARD.

00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:58,589
HE ALWAYS HAS.

979
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:01,159
I WAS WITH HATCHER
ON HIS LAST DRIVE.

980
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:04,328
AT THE FORDING PLACE
ON THE SALADO,
WE LOST MOST OF THE HERD.

981
00:53:04,396 --> 00:53:06,998
THE WATER WAS BAD.
THE CATTLE DRANK AND DIED.

982
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:10,769
AND ON THE WAY HOME,
2 MEN WERE STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING.

983
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,236
YOU WERE STILL RIDING
WITH HIM?

984
00:53:12,304 --> 00:53:15,606
[sighs]
YES, WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT IS?

985
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,142
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

986
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,044
I HAVE MY REASONS.

987
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:20,411
I OWE HIM A LOT.

988
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:22,647
SO DO I.

989
00:53:22,715 --> 00:53:25,249
I PROMISED MYSELF
I'D NEVER RIDE
WITH HATCHER AGAIN,

00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:26,785
BUT HERE I AM.

991
00:53:26,852 --> 00:53:29,154
HE PUSHES TOO HARD,
HE YELLS AT YOU,

992
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:31,589
HE TELLS YOU,
YOU AREN'T WORTH ANYTHING,

993
00:53:31,657 --> 00:53:34,693
AND YOU CAN HATE HIM
BUT YOU GO ALONG.

994
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,328
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HE WANTS SO BADLY TO MAKE IT,

995
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:39,864
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HE NEEDS YOU

996
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:42,100
BUT DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY IT.

I AIN'T JUST GONNA SIT

THE FIRST TIME I SEEN YOU.

I ALWAYS TREATED YOU
LIKE A SON, DIDN'T I?

1148
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:18,459
YES. YOU TREATED US BOTH
THE SAME.

1149
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,793
BUT I FORGAVE YOU.

1150

IS I AIN'T GONNA LIVE FOREVER.

IN THE EAST CALLED

SOME REALLY GOOD WORK
ON THE DRIVE,

1557
01:28:48,155 --> 01:28:49,589
YOU COULD SELL
SOME OF THOSE.

1558
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,624
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT,
THEY WANT TO SEE
MORE OF MY WORK.

1561
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:56,596
ARE STARTING TO BE CURIOUS
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT WEST.

1562
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,032
THEY SHOULD SEE IT
THE WAY WE'VE SEEN IT.

1563
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:01,500
ANYWAY I WAS TALKIN' TO
SOME OF THESE ARMY BOYS
IN HERE,

1564
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,236
AND THEY SAID
THAT THEY'RE SENDING OUT
A DETACHMENT NEXT WEEK,

1565
01:29:04,304 --> 01:29:06,338
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD GO ALONG WITH THEM

1566
01:29:06,406 --> 01:29:07,607
AND MAKE SOME ARMY PAINTINGS.

1567
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,542
YOU KNOW,
HAVE--HAVE ANOTHER SET READY.

1568
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,210
WAIT A MINUTE,
THE WHOLE DRIVE

1569
01:29:11,278 --> 01:29:13,980
ALL I HEARD ABOUT WAS,
"BESS, BESS. I LOVE BESS."
WHAT ABOUT BESS?

1570
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:16,015
(Morgan)
THAT'S RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT BESS?

1571
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:19,251
I--I STILL--
I STILL LOVE BESS, OF COURSE.

1572
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:20,720
BUT I THINK
HER FATHER WAS RIGHT.

1573
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:22,822
I--I STILL HAVE
A LOT MORE TO LEARN

1574
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,958
BEFORE I'M READY TO GO HOME
AND SETTLE DOWN.

1575
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:28,260
I'M GONNA WRITE TO HER
AND TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER.

1576
01:29:32,165 --> 01:29:33,499
AH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

1577
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:35,902
I'M GONNA MARRY HER
AND BRING HER ALONG WITH ME.

1578
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,270
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING.

1579
01:29:38,338 --> 01:29:40,707
QUENTIN, I'M OUT.

1580
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:42,809
LET ME BUY YOU
ANOTHER BEER.

1581
01:29:45,145 --> 01:29:47,179
I-- I NEVER REALIZED

1582
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:51,951
WHAT THOSE 12 STEERS
HATCHER LEFT US IN THE VILLAGE
WOULD MEAN TO ME.

1583
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:56,355
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU, MORGAN,
BUT I FEEL REAL GOOD.

1584
01:29:56,423 --> 01:30:00,793
I DID NOT THINK
WE WILL FEEL SO GOOD
ABOUT IT TOMORROW MORNING.

1585
01:30:00,861 --> 01:30:02,261
(Hatcher)
COME ON, ALL OF YOU.

1586
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:05,064
COME OVER HERE,
GATHER AROUND.

1587
01:30:05,132 --> 01:30:07,500
WELL, Y'ALL GOT YOUR $20

1588
01:30:07,567 --> 01:30:10,036
AND ANOTHER $30
SHARE BESIDES.

1589
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:13,172
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD MONEY
IN MY BOOK.

1590
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,542
REMEMBER, BOYS,
WAY BACK IN RED BLUFFS

1591
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,511
I SAID WE WAS GONNA MAKE IT

1592
01:30:18,578 --> 01:30:21,948
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO GO.

1593
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,752
WELL, NOW WE GOT
EVERYWHERE TO GO.

1594
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,187
NOW JUST DON'T
HOLD IT UP TO ME

1595
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:31,057
IF YOU COME
LOOKIN' FOR A JOB AGAIN
NEXT YEAR.

1596
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:36,062
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
THE FOLKS BACK HOME TO KNOW
I GONE SOFT.

1597
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,697
[laughing]

1598
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:38,898
ANYWAY,

1599
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:43,102
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

1600
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,575
AND FROM NOW
TILL YOU FALL FLAT
ON YOUR UGLY FACES,

1601
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:51,978
THE DRINKS IS ON ME!

1602
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,345
[all cheering]
