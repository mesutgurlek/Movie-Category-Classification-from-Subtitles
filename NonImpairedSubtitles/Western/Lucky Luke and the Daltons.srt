1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:27,203
"THE DALTONS"

2
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:03,066
Arre!

3
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,797
And now what we do?

4
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:52,359
I do not know you, but I return to house.

5
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:55,807
God mine. It is the third time in two days.

6
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,399
Why always it has
that to return to house?

7
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,647
The problem of your boy
it is problem of all.

8
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,133
Very they are looked for.

9
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,328
If, but what we can do?

10
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,738
It is necessary to bring them the house.

11
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:16,814
My Billy went away when it was 6 years old.

12
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:19,587
If not outside for that reason it were here.

13
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:22,107
He was a normal boy,
not "Billy, the boy ".

14
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,097
Ma Dalton is much right.

15
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:29,261
And yours?

16
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:31,099
Very well.

17
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,380
- What you think?
- It prepares a great blow.

18
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,691
Leave that laughter!

19
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,275
"Límpiese the feet"

20
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,281
Good morning.

21
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,445
Good morning. What I can do by You?

22
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:20,807
It has... tomato?

23
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,910
If, clear that I have.

24
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:29,009
- Please.
- How much it wants?

25
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,714
Average pound. Served well.

26
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,112
It does not want more than that?

27
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:56,202
- the short thing?
- As it wishes.

28
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,723
Hear! I lost my harmonic. What do?

29
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:41,812
Close... What is this?

30
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,349
Of where it is in favor the Knox Fort?

31
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:54,211
5 km. towards there, soon
turn and follow by 2 days.

32
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:56,115
And you, they are $5.95.

33
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:00,158
- How much it said to me?
- $5.95.

34
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:05,907
Some has a currency?

35
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,897
It seems that there was some confusion.

36
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,388
Cálmate, Joe.

37
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,379
If you do not want
tomato, you can give me.

38
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,268
Please.

39
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,227
You want it in serious?

40
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,549
- This you want?
- Yes, that.

41
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,952
It already is.

42
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:42,205
He is hard, eh? But it is just.

43
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,989
I can eat the cucumber?

44
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,796
Averell, it leaves those frijoles.

45
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:04,023
It is necessary to do something in serious.

46
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,770
We do it and we retired. That is.

47
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,235
- and what we are going to make Ma?
- If, what we do?

48
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,280
They do it as they want,
but I want that they attack

49
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,174
a bank.

50
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:20,437
Not in bank anyone,
but a great bank.

51
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,693
I want to declare this bank like the plus

52
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:27,108
surely of the world.

53
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,803
This it is the first bank
of the world that it has

54
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,565
a system that allows
to protect to its money

55
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,594
all along.

56
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,792
There will be no thief who
can rob this bank.

57
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:59,992
Although if they do not know it,
it can that tries it.

58
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,413
We go to the bank.

59
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,508
Espérenme, they do not leave me here.

60
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,720
Espérenme.

61
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,101
Everybody quiet one!

62
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,193
Raise its hands.

63
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,792
All throw their arms.

64
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:47,162
- Hello, Daltons.
- Lucky Luke.

65
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,713
How are you?

66
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:54,197
"The Law"

67
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,114
As consequence I condemn them to 100 thousands

68
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,453
weeks in prison.

69
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:26,695
No longer I can with this. I go away of here.

70
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,411
It hears, Joe, we go away.

71
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:31,714
- What you say?
- Cállate. They are going to us to hear.

72
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:33,624
What you mean?

73
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,665
It means that there is
that to do it in silence.

74
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:41,886
- There is something written for you.
- Where?

75
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,650
There is a box for you here.

76
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,416
"It learns to read in 2 classes."

77
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:50,620
Yes, he is good that.

78
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,232
It is necessary to do something since we failed.

79
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,794
- Some idea?
- an idea of what Joe?

80
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,383
Why you create? It stops
to leave here, stupid idiot!

81
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:02,852
You do not say to him stupid idiot, it is its birthday.

82
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,674
The magical hat.

83
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:09,249
It removed the magical hat.

84
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,779
Of what this crazy person is speaking?

85
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,265
It attacked to us. He is damn.

86
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:19,664
- the magical hat Has.
- magical Hat?

87
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,246
- He will be invincible.
- Invincible?

88
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,449
- It stops the bullets.
- It stops the bullets?

89
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,028
God mine, I must save my town.

90
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,975
God mine, I have...

91
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,528
...to save my town

92
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,560
Dalton, they have visit.

93
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:45,343
We finished about that it dreamed...

94
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,708
- They watch this well.
- "Looked for $20"

95
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,436
I am in fact greater.

96
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,006
It does not matter to me who is but the great one.

97
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,791
Escúchenme well.

98
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:08,639
Or they rob that bank, or they do not return to house.

99
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,656
- What you mean?
- What I said.

100
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,262
If they do not do what
I request to them, they will be eaten

101
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,516
of coyotes.

102
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,368
I know that he is hard, my children...

103
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,850
...but I do them by its good.

104
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:29,993
By you also, my small one.

105
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,867
Me they will thank for it later.

106
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,146
I do not know if we will be able to do it,
because we are here.

107
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,906
The prison is not a problem.

108
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:47,482
Here I bring to them
sausages of the freedom.

109
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,788
Now... they already know
that they must do.

110
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,938
- Guard!
- I already go.

111
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,132
Rantanplan, it is called on to you to take care of.

112
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:17,093
It is right.

113
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,789
We must carry to us like men.

114
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,110
I will do what you request to me.
I want to prove what

115
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,826
I am worth in fact.

116
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,980
From now on acceptance my destiny.

117
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,425
You will feel proud of my.

118
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:34,650
As much if you want to form
part of this, like

119
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,740
if you want to wait for a
the search. Search...

120
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:42,245
Well. Since all we agree,

121
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,589
it is not more than to take sausages.

122
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:48,129
What will be what smells
so delicious here?

123
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:56,054
Let us look for a solution
in order to leave here.

124
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:58,400
We had to follow the idea of the Mexican of

125
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,800
magical hat.

126
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:07,193
But I do not know if You... perhaps...

127
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,902
What?

128
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:16,189
I have a great idea.
Let us look for the magical hat

129
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:17,918
That intelligent!

130
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,509
But we do not know if it exists.

131
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,819
It is necessary to remove to him to
Mexican everything what knows.

132
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:24,912
And soon we will escape of here.

133
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,696
Boys that fall hurt to me here.

134
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,475
Boys, I already spoke to them of my dream?

135
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,266
When you fought in the war?

136
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,434
Why? I have never dreamed that.

137
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,733
The last time you did not know...

138
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,541
But it is my dream. All are their sleepy.

139
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,260
- But it is that...
- Nothing!

140
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,170
Now I am going to speak to you of my dream.

141
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:56,181
- the dream that it has to do with...
- It is enough!

142
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:59,639
Then, my dream...

143
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,099
It is on a town
pressed by a wizard

144
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,419
with great magical powers.

145
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,404
A Mexican town. Why no?

146
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,600
A town next to Mexico.

147
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,524
I know of which town you speak.

148
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,354
One that is terrified
by a bandit who

149
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:23,573
he is invincible thanks
to a magical hat.

150
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:27,017
You. they are the gringos of the providence.

151
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,677
Exactly.

152
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,333
When it is that they want to start off?

153
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,406
In a moment.

154
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,622
During the fair of the sausage.

155
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,430
- We cut...
- Very well.

156
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:44,206
They will give a great one them
recibimiento in the town.

157
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,020
But first I must
to warn to them of its visit.

158
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,307
I am going to warn to them with
my carrier pigeon.

159
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,823
It flies, small.

160
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:05,435
It flies, my small pigeon. It flies!

161
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,016
How we do?

162
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,835
- Somebody wants to send some letter?
- Yes.

163
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,010
Of foot.

164
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,928
Let us open the sausage.

165
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,676
Luck goes! A shovel.

166
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,711
- Averell. Averell!
- What?

167
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:46,181
- If. What?
- you already ate the sausage?

168
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,519
- No.
- Surely?

169
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,351
You the right of perpetual ownership.

170
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,423
I believe that better I go bathroom...

171
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,783
It is not the moment. It remembers
what there is to do.

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,182
Hope!

173
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,658
They will not arrive that way.
The ground is very hard.

174
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:12,883
"12 years later..."

175
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,481
And if we proved by the wall?

176
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:33,882
Why was not happened to us that before?

177
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,339
We had been 12 years here.

178
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,551
"the News of the West"

179
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:42,509
A sad one arrives to us
the news from the prison.

180
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,421
The Dalton brothers, known like "

181
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:46,813
cretinos of the West ", they have escaped.

182
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,729
They made 4 tunnels stops
to escape of the jail.

183
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,828
In the town it increases
rage by the news.

184
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,787
In the bank of the city
it increases the security.

185
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:00,685
The alarms are alert so that

186
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,640
servants of the law
take care of our economy.

187
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,617
Even Sundays.
But meanwhile

188
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,453
the Dalton runs, rather, they galopan.

189
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,370
They have already attacked a circus.

190
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,792
They attack and they ransack until the trousers.

191
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,467
It is sad but certain.

192
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,990
Their mothers cry, but
that Lucky Luke does.

193
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,176
These were the "news of the West".

194
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,850
"Border of the town."

195
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,007
It will work to pass by the customs?

196
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,830
They are not worried. Before
we will see somebody.

197
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,683
Why always you are
you who issue the orders?

198
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,337
Cannot be I the head by once?

199
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,835
Of what they are ed ***reflx mng?

200
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,694
I am looking for a
McDermott, the falsifier.

201
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:14,866
I am.

202
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,018
- Since you have changed!
- I have always been thus.

203
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,460
Go to the store.

204
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,706
Since it has changed!

205
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:30,830
Nor I almost know it.

206
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,841
By its photo it can
to know its identification

207
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:41,206
and all its official documents.

208
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:46,836
If they want its photo we must negotiate.

209
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,658
By the photo?

210
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:52,520
No! By all documents.

211
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:56,878
The total cost of
operation is of $30.

212
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,828
There is no problem.

213
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,637
"It pays duty on"

214
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:19,878
Mexico.

215
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:30,082
Good morning Mr..

216
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,436
- I Am.
- I Am.

217
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:40,274
- I Am.
- I Am.

218
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:41,795
No, I am.

219
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,842
- He is he.
- I Am.

220
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,346
- And You. it is...
- the last one.

221
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,196
- Jean Michell?
- No.

222
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,196
- Oh. Chow My Cheng.
- That same one.

223
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,271
Mr.. welcome to Mexico.

224
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,042
Good bye. Thanks.

225
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:11,139
To where they go, friends? They are Chinese?

226
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:14,634
Impossible.

227
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,969
They were to the best one
specialist in frauds.

228
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,214
Well, I listen to Mr..

229
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:27,821
We came with ours
clothes, but it had

230
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:31,804
dehorn. We had to leave it everything.

231
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:38,555
We left our clothes, our food.

232
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:59,787
The water raised and we began
to row and to row...

233
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,865
We rowed with movements of Kárate that

234
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,823
we learned of our ancestros.

235
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:18,768
Blows of Kárate of our ancestros.

236
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:26,840
Yes. It has proven "pudebereset"?

237
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:30,073
Pudebereset of the Chai teacher.

238
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,901
We are children of
same mother, but not of

239
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,709
same father.

240
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,911
Clear! Clear. It did not understand.

241
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:45,719
It did not understand the kinship and it was for that reason.

242
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:52,577
As it is said well in Mexico... bienve...

243
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,350
It advanced.

244
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,263
Good bye Mr.. customs officer.

245
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:05,799
You know? It came to me well
to speak a little of Chinese.

246
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:17,178
PROPERTY OF
DALTON. PROHIBITED TO HAPPEN.

247
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,498
Each one of our children already left

248
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:22,327
the prison.

249
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,832
That rare. They always cause some disaster.

250
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:27,354
"Disaster" is its second names.

251
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,171
In addition...

252
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:39,343
- Good morning. Mrs.. How are you?
- What you want?

253
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,810
It wanted to know if they had
the news of its children.

254
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,982
And why it was going them to have?

255
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,973
I thought that they would happen
after they escaped.

256
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:55,477
Very graceful Luke. No
let us speak here outside.

257
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,200
Excuse, it is Lucky Luke.

258
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:09,669
They have the news?

259
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:11,582
Think that they are men?

260
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,574
- we are crying by our children.
- Clear.

261
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,300
I imagine that all
sheriff of the state

262
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:17,933
- they are after its track.
- Clear.

263
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:21,115
Of course that all
they are organized.

264
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:23,933
- Clear.
- What is that of "clear"?

265
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:28,135
I am following to you
the steps. I do not like

266
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,374
much your attitude.

267
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,383
And if you love an advice,
ponte for yours

268
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,588
immediately, because if
I know them well, they are

269
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,694
preparing a very great blow.

270
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:38,234
- Clear.
- Clarooo.

271
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:52,101
I dismissed it as it is deserved. He is dangerous.

272
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,029
- Clear.
- Clear.

273
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,599
"Faiblos Town. Here we are cowardly and

274
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:26,454
sluggish, we are our right."

275
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:58,876
There is somebody here?

276
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:13,199
We already arrived. Now
they can leave its houses.

277
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:17,286
It hears, Joe. There is nobody. Why?

278
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,706
It is that I was already mistaken once.

279
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,955
- But if...
- I asked something to You, William? No.

280
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,991
That is an answer
to that I said?

281
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,921
No, it is not answer.
It closes the mouth. Silence.

282
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,719
I must reflect.

283
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,461
It seems that there is nobody here.

284
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,198
Enough well with
the customs officer delay.

285
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,348
You mean that it was my fault?

286
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:45,565
A letter arrived to us from the prison.

287
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,469
Mexicanito!

288
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:56,023
Caramba! Ours
dove brought a message.

289
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:37,362
It is enough already! Leave of
to do that, we do not like!

290
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:45,453
Discúlpenlo. It is not thus.

291
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,686
It is its form to express the joy.

292
00:26:48,837 --> 00:26:52,871
He is very contented. It is to say...

293
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:56,619
Imagine that they are in
an enchanted town.

294
00:26:56,837 --> 00:27:01,002
And that that magic has them catched.

295
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:03,121
And that then we injured
we to remove them

296
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:07,625
of that encantamiento and to release them.

297
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,951
It is right.

298
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:28,016
I request excuses. In agreement?

299
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:34,197
I believe that they do not want that you enter.

300
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,087
You return to me to close the door and I kill to you.

301
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,985
I want to know the name
of the type that attacks a

302
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,995
this town, the days
that it comes, the powers

303
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,517
exact of the magical hat and all

304
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,978
arms that it has. You include/understand?

305
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:11,351
I am not safe of
that me they will say it but...

306
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:13,656
I will look for the way to speak to them.

307
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:18,266
I will do as if it had...

308
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:33,373
I was a sleepy yesterday.

309
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,845
A dream about its town.

310
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:40,910
In my dream the houses were of chocolate.

311
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:45,091
The walls were of cream.

312
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:47,410
In my dream there was a voice.

313
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:51,151
- a voice that said to me, Averell.
- Averell.

314
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:52,997
- Averell.
- Averell.

315
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,179
I am speaking with the men.

316
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:57,186
For that reason same, it speaks
also with the women.

317
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,522
I can help it, Mr.?

318
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:05,673
Whichever firearms have?

319
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,259
We only have a pair of old guns.

320
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,040
Those are all the arms that they have?

321
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,130
- You. he is safe of not having more?
- If, Mr..

322
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:17,522
- He is safe...
- Averell.

323
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:21,308
I believe that they do not have more arms. You do not create?

324
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,825
I know that he is hard for you.
I feel it from here.

325
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,800
But I am treating
to communicate to me. I can?

326
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:31,851
It walks. Me you will thank for it later.

327
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,343
Joe, you will leave speaks to you thus?

328
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:41,388
I will support it by the hat.

329
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:53,267
We lived in constant siege. He is atrocious.

330
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,602
It does not touch that that is like a pump.

331
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,366
He is very strong.

332
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,102
We lived in the misery.
Everything what we won

333
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:10,235
in gold, he us the acquittal. It is the devil.

334
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:16,713
Averell, it already dresses like
it is called. "Devil".

335
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,902
- My brother...
- No.

336
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:23,104
I want to speak with You.
and not with the great one.

337
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:24,923
It does well. Later us
we will put in agreement.

338
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,900
I promise to him that I can be
a man very educated.

339
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,590
No, it is not certain. It does not listen to it.

340
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,514
He is evil is reality.

341
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,524
It is not educated, but vulgar.

342
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,030
Averell!

343
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:40,559
- east Cómete pepper.
- I am not hungry.

344
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,580
I asked if you had
hunger? I said that you ate.

345
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,483
It is a pump.

346
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,501
This is the pump? She is very flavorful.

347
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,067
Goad a little in the throat.

348
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,153
How is called that bandit?

349
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:21,917
It is called "the Tar it".

350
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,843
The Tar It?

351
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:31,628
No, it does not listen to it. Discúlpelo.

352
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,957
It takes a small piece from pump, pajarito.

353
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:51,895
Truely they want that it writes to him?

354
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:55,554
And what I put to him?

355
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:59,259
What you want. You are the head.

356
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:03,124
You are looking for to me. You are tiring to me already.

357
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,001
Understood, head.

358
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:08,291
I put what to him then?

359
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:10,547
That this is charming,
we are well rich

360
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,210
and we eat well. That the weather is good.

361
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:14,711
We wished to return soon to your arms.

362
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:16,227
We want to you.

363
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:20,334
That does not serve. They are only wordinesses.

364
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:23,823
I feel it. I will draw to him
a house and much sun.

365
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,722
With that it will include/understand.

366
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,893
But that is not
drawing. That is not clear.

367
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:31,490
I have the right to do it as it wants.

368
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,427
But that is not clear.

369
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,515
What you want Averell?
You do not want to write to him?

370
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,027
I want to write to him, not to draw to him.

371
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:44,334
- Averell.
- Averell.

372
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,573
What has to do that we discuss?

373
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:50,957
What is going to do?
To strike to me like always...

374
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:54,592
Hold... Mother!

375
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:58,032
It is enough! You do not return to say to me what to do.

376
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,703
It did not pass anything to me. The moan.

377
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,387
Bravo... You won.

378
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,857
- What happened?
- It is that I know that does not know to write.

379
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:21,595
And when we said to him
that it wrote, it drew

380
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:22,991
a house.

381
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,335
I said to him, you are not going to write? It said, no.

382
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:30,610
But that drawing is not clear.

383
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:35,031
I help you, but that is not clear.

384
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,675
And that it wanted...

385
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:56,237
If me they allow it, it comes the Tar it.

386
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,347
Pity we do not use
the heavy machine gun.

387
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:28,460
What heavy machine gun?

388
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:31,136
That that a Mexican colonel donated to us.

389
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:33,393
We asked more than three times...

390
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,303
Averell.

391
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,849
Go, go. No longer it is necessary...

392
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:42,727
You will see what I am going to you to do now.

393
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:44,830
The Tar It.

394
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,672
Excuse.

395
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:51,434
Sometimes I let myself take by my character.

396
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,162
We can see the machine gun?

397
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:58,825
Please.

398
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:45,485
If you allow me, I believe that he is a small one

399
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,833
problem of the piston,
because the Mexicans...

400
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,927
You do not know nor what you say.

401
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:38,134
Yes that can do
damage that machine gun.

402
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,253
We see the week that comes.

403
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:58,609
What hat! He is magnificent.

404
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:04,068
It preferred like was
before. Without the holes.

405
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,956
It will already see. In one week we will go away.

406
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,882
It is not certain, Mexican?

407
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,508
Listen. That my brother dies of form

408
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,118
atrocious if nonencounter
to who did this to them.

409
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:46,805
- It watches, by your fault.
- Cállate. It was the Tar it.

410
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:50,489
No, Joe. Cálmate.

411
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:57,555
Where we can find
to sombr... to the Tar it?

412
00:39:58,169 --> 00:39:59,967
In its property.

413
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,934
There is something more to know or I already know everything to
it?

414
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:05,135
There are other things, but
I do not believe that it interests to them.

415
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:10,567
- it is rented.
- How?

416
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:13,359
Its house is rented.
He is not the proprietor.

417
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,700
- and?
- and nothing?

418
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:20,542
But all think that
it bought it. You, no?

419
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:26,257
I do not know. It had not been happened to me.

420
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,451
It spoke of a celebration. When it is?

421
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:32,701
Tomorrow. But they do not count
with being guests.

422
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:37,248
Only there are 4 people
guests. The Panchos.

423
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,541
Pity that already is here.

424
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:51,316
Something more. During
celebration, the Tar it only

425
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,484
it speaks with the most original person,

426
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,288
most exotic.

427
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:59,016
If they want its hat,
they must seduce it.

428
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:01,829
It is here. Prepared.

429
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:03,608
I have a question, Joe.

430
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,553
- and if we seduce it and soon...
- Averell?

431
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,553
Here above. So that you do not know

432
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:14,538
feelings of the people...

433
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:20,137
We will seduce it stops
to clear the hat to him.

434
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,829
- Tequila?
- No, thanks.

435
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,532
- They are the Panchos?
- If.

436
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:57,336
They will begin in one hour and average.

437
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,872
Listen, we have 80min to act.

438
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:02,319
Averell.

439
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:04,488
This is good. It is for amusing itself.

440
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,632
4 tequilas, please.
Póngale of which it itches.

441
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:15,348
Very well. Let us continue.

442
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:19,399
Hear. If it wants to smoke,
that is the area.

443
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:36,899
- Panchos, they begin soon.
- But...

444
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:43,305
"Déme minutes."

445
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,361
Calm, Joe.

446
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,718
Cállate.

447
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:03,287
Thank you very much. Thanks.

448
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:06,490
I hope that they are
contentments in my property.

449
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:09,447
My property...

450
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,882
It would say it, but she is not mine.

451
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:19,988
It is that we are three
competing in the zone.

452
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,874
But I am who
he has the best registry.

453
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:29,697
What they hoped... The celebration!

454
00:43:57,313 --> 00:44:01,256
Now we will prepare ourselves
in order to empower to us of his

455
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,065
magical hat.

456
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:19,690
You know? I have seen
many incredible things.

457
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:23,536
I also have seen
things. You know what I saw?

458
00:44:24,138 --> 00:44:26,783
Extraterrestrial. But it takes care of...

459
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:30,037
It was half earth dweller,
extraterrestrial half.

460
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:34,919
So extraterrestrial.

461
00:44:35,113 --> 00:44:37,242
I finish listening that
it saw extraterrestrial.

462
00:44:40,031 --> 00:44:41,372
And what did in the Earth?

463
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,974
They were in its flying subject of gossip looking for

464
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,026
force to rise.

465
00:44:49,414 --> 00:44:50,841
Watch, it is in its house where I have seen them

466
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,275
several times.

467
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,595
Young lady, a glass, please.

468
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:56,952
So it has been more of once?

469
00:44:57,188 --> 00:44:59,574
If, we have seen them...

470
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:01,576
Panchos, it touches to them in 30min.

471
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:07,346
You. he is the musician?

472
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:18,356
If. We are. Recognized musicians.

473
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:22,158
We have participated in many marriages.

474
00:45:22,382 --> 00:45:29,477
Mexican marriages,
Indians, of cattle tenders...

475
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:34,838
It knows that...

476
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:37,583
The Tar it it only speaks with
the most exotic person.

477
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,089
It is not possible to be attacked.
It has a magical hat.

478
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:46,443
And when...

479
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:51,138
- Where it is?
- one went away to eat.

480
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:54,516
- What went to eat?
- All we went to eat.

481
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:56,747
What you mean?
It does whatever was that?

482
00:45:56,942 --> 00:45:58,340
Panchos, they begin is 10min.

483
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:00,638
What? I take half an hour reflecting.

484
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:02,814
It is long time to reflect.

485
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,513
Now we must act.

486
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,965
...all thanks to you!

487
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:00,146
Of side the musician is comedian.

488
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:03,154
Panchos, what do? They touch in 1min.

489
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,609
Alpaca, Boy, Luis Miguel.

490
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,071
And now what we do?

491
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,549
What we are going to do? We touched in 1min.

492
00:47:16,218 --> 00:47:18,556
Averell. We are
Dalton, not them Panchos.

493
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,649
It hears, Joe. To where we go?

494
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:29,588
They do not speak, let us hope
at that the night arrives.

495
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:32,287
We are going to remain calm.

496
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:41,936
Good night.

497
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:47,326
First of all we wanted
to be thankful to the Tar it.

498
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:49,958
Let us sharpen.

499
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,561
- Joe, you are well?
- I am well.

500
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:26,948
It seems that the Panchos changed.

501
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:30,272
What was what happened?

502
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,817
Perhaps because we are
simply, the Dalton.

503
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:38,144
The Dalton? Who are the Dalton?

504
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,766
In fact we are, the Dalton.

505
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:53,038
Who said that we were
Panchos? We are Dalton.

506
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:55,380
Déjenme to explain to them.

507
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,229
And You. what hope? To them.

508
00:50:39,066 --> 00:50:43,152
Who was the one that invited the Panchos?

509
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:03,037
"Welcome to EUA" "Everything
exit is definitive "

510
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:07,984
"For Morris. For Mexico. For Paris."

511
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:20,241
- Averell.
- If, it tell me. What happens?

512
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,693
Better thus.

513
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:32,057
You do not move. The bad thing already happened.

514
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:34,930
- You trust my?
- If. You are my brother.

515
00:51:48,812 --> 00:51:52,382
That is so that you remember
who is the head, ok?

516
00:52:32,153 --> 00:52:35,750
Now we will be the owners of everything.

517
00:52:47,095 --> 00:52:48,960
He is a great one compensates.

518
00:52:49,188 --> 00:52:51,045
Sight so that you see.

519
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,878
Go that yes it is a fat prize.

520
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:00,442
Checkmate.

521
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:06,288
I won, I won, I won...

522
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,441
- We look for these boys.
- we go away?

523
00:53:28,565 --> 00:53:32,115
It tell me, cattle tender, create
that we get to catch

524
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:37,293
- to those bad boys?
- Clear.

525
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:16,999
Síganme.

526
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,254
- What we do?
- they are not hopeless.

527
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:28,895
Now we will make magic.

528
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:34,137
Magic!

529
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,099
It seems that it does not work without the light.

530
00:54:46,228 --> 00:54:48,029
We must change of plan.

531
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:55,201
Acérquense all. Ladies and horsemen.

532
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:59,600
Good morning Mrs.. and
Srs. And mainly Srta.

533
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:04,482
But I do not want to be discourteous, I am

534
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:08,565
Dr. Doxe.

535
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,212
Today I present/display to them
extraordinary product.

536
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,657
Elíxir of the truth.
A second later

537
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:19,813
to take it and already they are
saying the truth.

538
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:22,075
Repeat with me: I will say the truth.

539
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:29,380
- You Say.
- It is certain Mrs.. and Mr..

540
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,721
After I took it I said all the truth.

541
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:36,921
It is certain. You. he is not a prattler, but

542
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:38,197
a Dr. really.

543
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:39,772
My son took elíxir
of the transformation

544
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:41,920
and they watch in which it was.

545
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:44,910
They must investigate before taking something.

546
00:55:50,636 --> 00:55:52,451
I do not know if the dogs
they persecute the cats,

547
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:54,077
but apparently the doves persecute

548
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:56,335
to the chickens.

549
00:55:57,465 --> 00:55:58,939
Thank you very much, cattle tender.

550
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:01,160
You deserve yourself my to elíxir of the truth.

551
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:08,558
We go away, Rantanplan.

552
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,441
It is good day to take a walk by the town.

553
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:30,284
Lucky Luke. The one that
it published our name.

554
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:32,582
A cocaine tail, please.

555
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:36,295
How they are, Daltons?

556
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:38,788
I have listened that the businesses go well.

557
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,729
If, they go well.

558
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:45,648
Nor you imagine what we have.

559
00:56:50,124 --> 00:56:51,521
The guards always come by

560
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,250
this district.

561
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:58,007
That bank is not nothing bad, certain?

562
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,241
What bank?

563
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:15,993
Let us see that they say to
that it published its name.

564
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,949
Let us put a little elíxir of the truth.

565
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:48,471
To its health, Daltons.

566
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:15,679
They already have thought what to do?

567
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,868
We want to attack the bank.

568
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:27,798
We want to enter and to take $2 to us thousands.

569
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:29,676
He is everything?

570
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,029
... magical hat.

571
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:42,293
You do not do case to him. In fact nor it is

572
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:44,357
magical hat.

573
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:49,806
It is certain that it has
a Mexican hat,

574
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:53,697
but it is not what magician says itself.

575
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,458
- it does not have anything of magician.
- Clear.

576
00:58:59,209 --> 00:59:01,838
Just in case I am watching them.

577
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:07,456
I do not understand as I could not close the mouth.

578
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:15,608
The hat, Bravo.

579
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,920
The idea for attacking the bank is good.

580
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:23,512
We do not have to worry about Lucky Luke.

581
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:26,992
- In fact...
- Cállate!

582
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:29,351
Mrs.. and Mr.. them
I propose to elíxir for

583
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:32,571
to change its face.

584
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:39,580
That is certain. One hour ago I took it

585
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:41,911
and I follow old.

586
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,038
Youth is not beautiful.

587
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:47,247
- It walks, we go.
- Calm.

588
00:59:47,495 --> 00:59:50,110
I believe that already I have
idea of which we will do.

589
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:17,687
He is not nothing personal,
but as they include/understand

590
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:19,979
it is impossible to employ to them to me.

591
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:22,374
Why? We do not include/understand?

592
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:28,359
- We waited for a decision...
- ...fast.

593
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:31,465
It is necessary to know how to read?

594
01:00:32,986 --> 01:00:35,262
I can have confidence to them?

595
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:37,718
Excuse, but...

596
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:40,200
...for my the confidence is like...

597
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:49,151
The confidence is... it is like...

598
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:02,853
The confidence is like the confidence.

599
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,980
It is not the same.

600
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,090
That is what You. it wants.

601
01:01:14,764 --> 01:01:17,170
I will show to him what is the confidence.

602
01:01:40,244 --> 01:01:43,224
Welcome to the Bank of the city.

603
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,719
They can look for its uniforms.

604
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:50,179
- and our brother.
- To that they remove it.

605
01:02:20,922 --> 01:02:22,952
Cállate already!

606
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:26,712
Cálmate, Joe.

607
01:02:28,635 --> 01:02:30,557
That way it comes.

608
01:02:40,317 --> 01:02:42,552
I have its rooms.
They can sleep in

609
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:44,482
house if they wish it.

610
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:46,796
Nonmother. I feel it, but not tonight.

611
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:49,570
We will return to that
house when we have

612
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:53,158
that you requested to us. Truth, Jack?

613
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:55,271
Clear that if.

614
01:02:55,455 --> 01:02:56,847
- Truth, William?
- I also create it.

615
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,897
And you my small one?

616
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,363
It is its form to say yes that.

617
01:03:13,738 --> 01:03:16,793
Well. They already know what there is to do.

618
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:29,271
We go. It is the great day.

619
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:47,307
We are going to complete details.

620
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:55,608
It is very important that
know what you have

621
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,706
that to do.

622
01:03:59,028 --> 01:04:04,978
You are going to attract the attention
of all in the bank.

623
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:08,478
Escúchame!

624
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:12,051
Jack and William already know
what must do.

625
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:15,152
We must do it with discretion.

626
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:22,800
In agreement. Now it is the moment.

627
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:25,893
It leaves that.

628
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,256
It walks, it sees.

629
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:54,301
It hears, boy!

630
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,918
You are of this way?

631
01:05:05,432 --> 01:05:09,311
It passes something to you in the face?

632
01:05:11,647 --> 01:05:14,146
Good joke.

633
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:32,512
You must attract the attention.

634
01:06:40,885 --> 01:06:43,563
It is good. He is bad, but it is good.

635
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:48,737
We see ourselves, boys. Game of idiots.

636
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,514
Sight that to ask to me if
I have something in the face.

637
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,899
They thought that it could not?

638
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:37,561
Huston, we have a problem.

639
01:10:06,805 --> 01:10:11,190
We obtained it. Already
we can take to mother.

640
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:17,391
Calm. Let us breathe.

641
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:20,263
Let us take advantage of to change.

642
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:33,485
The last news. Four
monsters make

643
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,551
the robbery of the century.

644
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:42,611
First, they are three monsters and an idiot.

645
01:10:43,145 --> 01:10:47,126
Second, we are not
monsters, we are the Dalton.

646
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:50,458
The last news. The Dalton made

647
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:52,376
robbery of the century.

648
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:56,767
You. I come to look for what it belongs to me.

649
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,335
That magical hat that will allow us...

650
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:01,778
The hat that them
it will allow to martyr to

651
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:06,217
town does not have to be of
Tar it nor of the Dalton.

652
01:11:06,521 --> 01:11:10,025
They robbed the clothes to us in the way.

653
01:11:10,568 --> 01:11:13,351
They wanted documents and
they took ours.

654
01:11:13,559 --> 01:11:15,557
These personages arrived and took my

655
01:11:15,765 --> 01:11:18,292
elíxires without saying nothing.

656
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,348
That is the youth of today.

657
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:23,168
I already feel a little more young person.

658
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:26,564
I also. Today they took the breakfast and

659
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,875
they did not pay the account.

660
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:32,296
Nobody moves. The controlled situation.

661
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:42,001
Hope. Escúchenme.

662
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:44,906
I know that them we made bad.

663
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:47,133
I know that we have not been most honest.

664
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,883
In name of my brothers and mine, 

665
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:52,688
we include/understand, friends mine.

666
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:57,399
There is a very simple form
to fix all that.

667
01:11:58,073 --> 01:11:59,908
I am going away them to explain quickly.

668
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:04,748
It is the war!

669
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:16,453
Clear.

670
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:19,440
Lucky Luke.

671
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,514
- Joe?
- Cálmate.

672
01:12:22,725 --> 01:12:24,280
What we are going to eat?

673
01:14:02,182 --> 01:14:05,342
You already see, Lucky Luke? There are two types of

674
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:07,452
people in the life.

675
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:12,708
Those that have a hat
magician and those that no.

676
01:14:55,664 --> 01:14:59,097
What passes Lucky Luke? You failed?

677
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:09,479
What fear! You knocked down the columns.

678
01:15:21,193 --> 01:15:23,680
No, it hopes.

679
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:36,570
You ***reflx mng yourself of my?

680
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,895
You ***reflx mng yourself?

681
01:15:41,299 --> 01:15:44,347
You will see what is to face the four

682
01:15:44,563 --> 01:15:46,283
bandits more looked for of the West.

683
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:53,225
Dame the "D". Dame the "A". Dame the "L".

684
01:15:53,402 --> 01:15:57,468
Dame the "T". We are the Dalt.

685
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:05,218
- we are not the Dalt.
- No, we are not it.

686
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,811
- Lack something.
- I do not know what is...

687
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:12,618
- Delay a little while.
- It listens.

688
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:18,926
Dame "GIVES it", you are
the "L", you are the "TO"

689
01:16:19,164 --> 01:16:23,639
And I am
"N". DA-L-TO-N.

690
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,854
Nobody is going to understand
that of DA-L-TO-N.

691
01:16:26,089 --> 01:16:27,731
But we spoke
and we understand.

692
01:16:28,052 --> 01:16:30,602
Good, we are
the DA-L-TO-N.

693
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:42,669
It arrives. One behind
of the other. To the prison.

694
01:16:44,192 --> 01:16:46,534
And for the horse, nothing.

695
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:12,927
That horse only serves to eat.

696
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:18,403
And you who you are?

697
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:22,129
I am Ma Dalton. Mother
of the Dalton brothers.

698
01:17:22,377 --> 01:17:25,485
The four bandits
more looked for of the West.

699
01:17:36,912 --> 01:17:43,731
Lucky Luke, Lucky Luke, Lucky Luke...

700
01:18:17,851 --> 01:18:19,597
- Prepared...
- Joe.

701
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:22,197
- Cállate, cállate.
- That will not serve as anything.

702
01:18:22,587 --> 01:18:25,830
5-4-3...
Now.

703
01:18:58,548 --> 01:19:02,020
- it is not possible.
- You I have been saying it for 2h.

704
01:19:02,243 --> 01:19:04,917
Still we are constructing the line.

705
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:07,023
We cannot follow if it is not by the line.

706
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,745
But it is that you do not listen to me.

707
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:12,680
Because who decides it is
Joe, who speaks is Joe.

708
01:19:12,834 --> 01:19:15,209
Joe, the best one. Let us follow for here,

709
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:17,920
soon for there...

710
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:29,376
The federals. Let us follow horse.

711
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:39,923
They are graceful, truth?
