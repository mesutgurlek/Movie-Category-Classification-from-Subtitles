It isn't. Try again, Robbie.

00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,446
He had these wild ideas a lot,

167
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,981
but he never went
through with the marriage.

168
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,383
We were able to talk some sense into him.

169
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:48,155
Guess he just held onto the picture.

170
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:51,158
[Sighs]

171
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,128
I'm sorry, but we're not done yet.

172
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,098
No one's watching the sheep.

174
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,469
Let him go.

175
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,839
That was weird... Sal
just leaving like that.

176
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,874
I got four brothers, and
we don't always get along.

177
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,409
But if you told me one of them was dead,

178
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,045
I wouldn't give a damn about any sheep.

179
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:17,577
What you thinking?

180
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,446
I can't tell if Marko's
family is lying to us

181
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,882
or if Marko was lying to his family.

182
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,917
What makes you say that?

183
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:26,420
This picture was taken here.

184
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,555
This girl's in Wyoming.

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,670
What's that?

187
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,040
Uh, this picture that Walt
found at the victim's house.

188
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,042
Something about it told him
it was taken from around here.

189
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,511
She's cute. Got a nice smile.

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,314
More than I can say for some people.

Ohh.

This is David Mackey.

David, this is Sheriff
Longmire, Absaroka County.

198
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,701
I need you to run a name
through the computer for me...

199
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:09,236
Marko Vayas.

200
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:12,239
I'm curious if any other
law-enforcement agency's

201
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,107
ever run his name for anything.

202
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,976
Sure, I'll check the database.

203
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:18,311
Now, listen... while
I got you on the phone,

204
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,646
uh, has there been any hit

205
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,948
on that name I gave you a while back?

206
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,516
Sheriff, I told you before,

207
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,419
if anyone looks into this
Henry "Standing Bear" guy,

208
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,587
I'll call you. Ok?

209
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:30,390
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

210
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,294
Ferg: I got it.

211
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,130
- It's the mountain.
- Nope. It's the bird.

212
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,933
- A red-tip meadowlark. 
- Yeah.

213
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,301
Wyoming native.

214
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:44,004
Don't go much further
south than the bighorns.

215
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,537
Come out to the pasture this time of year

216
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,706
to eat the clover that
grows in the sheep droppings.

217
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,076
So, the picture could have
been taken on Marko's land.

218
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,079
You get anything from the biker's video?

219
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,547
Uh, no.

220
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,749
Besides the crash, there's
really nothing to see.

221
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,285
It's about two hours long.
I watched it in fast forward.

222
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,554
You go too fast, you
miss the little things.

Marko's toxicology report
back for a few weeks,

225
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,527
and I have spent the last two hours

226
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,329
going through 100
mail-order-bride websites.

227
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,497
Hey, Walt?

228
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,033
Why does she get all the good assignments?

229
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,535
We need to get ahold of Marko's computer

230
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,637
if we're ever gonna figure
out which services he used.

231
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,074
Marko didn't have a computer.

232
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,575
Where'd he find the girl, then?

233
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,077
[Coughs]

234
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:32,351

00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,130
Hmm.

238
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,234
You know the number-one epidemic
facing American men today

239
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,602
is heartache.

240
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,305
What you got is a lot
of very frustrated fellas

241
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,707
looking for a better class of woman.

242
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,577
Luckily, though, right on
the other side of that border,

243
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,746
you've got plenty of lovely Latin ladies

244
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,082
who are also looking
to improve their lives.

245
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,118
So I put these two together,

246
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,553
and bingo... problemo solved.

247
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,622
A cure, if you will.

248
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,091
I can't believe men actually
pay you for this stuff.

249
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,426
A lot of guys actually think

250
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:18,130
American women are pushy and overbearing.

251
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,531
Sheriff, I couldn't help but notice

252
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,700
that you don't have a ring on that finger.

253
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,369
You know, I'd be more than
happy to offer you my services.

254
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,304
No. No, thank you.

to easing some of the obvious
stresses of your daily life.

257
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,245
I'm seeing someone.

258
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,947
We're not here to talk
about his love life, okay?

259
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,282
[Sighs]

260
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,718
Do you recognize this girl?

261
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,387
Oh, yeah. That's Rosa Marquez.

262
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,024
And a true rose she is.

263
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,028
Married a basquo boy by
the name of Marko Vayas.

264
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,431
Couldn't have been more than a month ago.

265
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,132
Yeah, we spoke to Marko's family.

266
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,367
They had the impression

267
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,469
he didn't go through with the marriage.

268
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,639
A lot of times, families have
a hard time understanding love.

269
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,509
But I can assure you they were married.

270
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,212
I helped her put her
immigration papers in order

271
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,414
and I officiated the ceremony.

272
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,982
Good. Then you'll have
her immigration papers

273

and her last known address.

Mm, my stuff's not all that computerized.

Besides, I can't just give you
my client's personal information.

276
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:24,129
Marko Vayas was found dead,
possibly murdered, and Rosa...

277
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,565
There was no sign of her at his house.

278
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,267
Oh, hold on here. If you think that Rosa

279
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,602
had anything to do with Marko's death,

280
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,437
you got another thing coming.

281
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:35,530
I put all my girls through
a rigorous background check,

282
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,400
and I'll tell you that Rosa
is as good a girl as they come.

283
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:41,403
Jeremiah, I'm not
accusing Rosa of anything,

284
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,338
but I do need to talk to her.

285
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:45,040
I mean, I'm sorry about Marko.

286
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:49,711
My heart goes out to
his family and to Rosa.

287
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,246
But I'll tell you what,

288
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,114
I haven't spoke to either one of them

289
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,649
since the day they got hitched.

290
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:00,655
All right. You hear from
Rosa, give us a call.

291
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,657
I certainly will, but I can assure you

292
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,594
you won't find that she had
anything to do with any of this.

293
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,555
Oh, Sheriff.

294
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:10,325
If things don't work out
with your lady friend,

295
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,893
here's my card.

296
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,897
Give me a call if and when you
change your mind, all right?

297
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:22,137
[Knock on door]

298
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:25,140
I, uh, got the preliminary autopsy report.

299
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:26,675
Marko didn't die from an
aneurysm or a heart attack.

300
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,210
It was respiratory failure caused by,

301
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,080
and I quote, "exposure
to an unknown substance."

Poison.

303

- Where are we with Rosa Marquez?
- Stuck.

304
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,086
Immigrations and customs

305
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,621
said they'd get back to
me on Rosa's visa info,

306
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,890
but who knows how long that'll take, so...

307
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,562
Lizzie brought that by for you.

308
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,333
So...

309
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,767
What?

310
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,269
Uh... I found something.

311

[Telephone ringing] Oh, sorry.

- No, that's my phone. I think.

313
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:03,778
Uh, before I show you the video, I just...

314
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,880
I just wanted to say that,

315
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,882
about the picture in the paper...

316
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,553
I wasn't there supporting Branch.

317
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,556
We were on patrol. He said
he just needed to make a stop.

318
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,359
- I didn't know it was gonna be for the campaign...
- Ferg.

319
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,860
What did you find on the video?

320
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,668
You see that?

321
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,704
The biker had a bottle of water with him.

322
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:31,639
And?

323
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,508
Well, if Marko was in
those hills for a while,

324
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,210
he would have had drinking water, too.

325
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,513
Hot day and all. But you didn't find any.

326
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,217
Someone must have poisoned his canteen

327
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,652
and took it before you got there.

328
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,858
Okay.

329
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,395
See if you can find that canteen.

That was immigration.
I underestimated them.

As far as they know,

332
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,268
Rosa hasn't left the country, but get this.

333
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:04,439
The address on her visa...
it's not Marko's place.

now mail-order brides.

335
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,546
That's quite the clientele.

Hey!

341
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,173
Rosa just jumped out the window.

Look, hear... hear me out,

345
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:56,020
But the innocent party here is Rosa.

346
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,289
Most innocent people don't
jump out the window and run.

347
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,625
She's afraid she's being deported.

348
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,927
Thinks 'cause her husband up and died,

349
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,462
she's not a citizen anymore.

350
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,331
Told her it ain't so, but
she won't listen to me.

Sheriff, I didn't mean to
interfere with your investigation,

352
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,602
but somebody's got to look
out for this girl here.

353
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:15,406
You seem to care an awful lot about Rosa.

354
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:18,376
I care more about my business.

355
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:20,011
I guarantee all my girls

they're gonna be safe
from police harassment.

357

It helps if your girls
don't murder their husbands.

358
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,053
I never kill Marko.

359
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:31,089
He was a good man.

360
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,626
He gave me a house, new life.

361
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:38,396
We searched Marko's house. No
one was living there but him.

362
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,565
No.

363
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:45,570
I visit once. It... was a beautiful land.

364
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:50,441
But... Marko was scared
of what his brothers say,

365
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,444
so we decide I could go live at the hotel,

366
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,147
and when Marko sell his land,

367
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:00,318
we could get a new house together.

368
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:02,653
Marko was selling his land.

369
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,147
You didn't think to mention that?

370
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:07,216
I thought about it.

371
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:08,551
Who was he selling it to?

372
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,886
No idea.

373
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,457
I think they conned him.

374
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:17,326
Jeremiah convinces Marko to
sell his land to get the girl,

375
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:19,428
they kill Marko, Rosa inherits,

376
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,597
she and Jeremiah split the profits.

377
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,499
Need to confirm that Marko
was selling his land first.

378
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,035
Well, I'll head over to
the county clerk's office,

379
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,271
see if anyone was pulling
permits on the land.

380
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:31,173
Any luck with the canteen?

381
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,708
No, but I'll keep looking.

382
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,411
Also, get some search
warrants for Jeremiah's office,

383
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,113
Rosa's hotel room.

384
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,116
Look for any types of poison.

385
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:43,386
Meantime, I'd say those
two are a flight risk.

386
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:45,288
Let's lock them up for a bit.
What about Marko's brothers?

387
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,623
Rosa said Marko was afraid of them.

388
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:50,159
If he was selling the family
land and they found out,

389
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,194
they'd have reason to be pissed.

390
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:54,597
Yeah.

391
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:58,301
When your mother, uh, left the hospital

after her chemo treatment around 8:00,

393
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,439
she stopped into this café.

394
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,075
The waitress said she ordered a cup of tea.

395
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:09,211
About 30 minutes later, she left,

396
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,547
heading back to the hotel.

Somewhere in the scuffle,

400
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:23,115
he stabbed her twice and took off.

401
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,922
Is this where she died?

402
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:33,526
No. She survived the initial stabbing.

403
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:36,028
She died a few hours later.

404

get ahold of your father.

but we work it together... equally.

Oh, it's possible he didn't tell you.

431
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,946
like the fact that he married
that girl from Ecuador.

Vic: It's strange that
he never mentioned that.

433
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:07,885
Maybe he was afraid of how you'd react.

00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:44,244
belonged to a basque sheep
herder... Marko Vayas.

489
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:47,214
He was recently found dead.

490
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:53,019
Well, that sounds tragic.

491
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,624
I've heard Marko may have
been reconsidering the sale.

492
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:01,561
How badly did your company want that land?

493
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,367
Are you accusing me of something, Branch?

494
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,536
Jacob, I'm sure it's just a coincidence,

495
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:13,540
but a dead body turning up in
the middle of a business deal

496
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:15,475
is bad P.R.

497
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,043
I know you don't need that,

498
00:25:17,144 --> 00:25:21,047
so I'm here to discuss
it with you privately.

499
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,550
But if you don't give me anything,

500
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:28,154
sooner or later, Walt will come knocking.

501
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,927
Well, I can tell you that our company

502
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:35,929
has wanted that parcel for quite some time.

503
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,331
Mr. Vayas rejected our first two offers,

504
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:41,134
but I thought we were
finally nearing a deal.

505
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:46,406
So, his death now, in fact,
poses a problem for us.

506
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:50,944
Thanks.

507
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:52,145
You bet.

508
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,680
What can you tell me about the case?

509
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,615
You got suspects, witnesses?

510
00:25:55,716 --> 00:25:58,184
Do you know who inherits Marko's land?

511
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:01,187
I can't give you details
about an ongoing investigation.

512
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:06,626
Branch... I didn't donate
$100,000 to your campaign

513
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:09,162
because I like your smile.

514
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:16,670
I was up at Marko's
Wells looking for hemlock,

515
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:20,173
and, uh, these are some of
the cuttings that I took.

516
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,175
This is elderberry.

517
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,144
It's almost identical to hemlock

518
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,313
except for the berries, obviously.

519
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,481
Oh, and it won't kill you.

520
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,550
And how exactly does that help us?

521
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:32,986
Well, I didn't actually
find hemlock by the wells,

522
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,487
but I just thought

523
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:38,491
it might be useful to see
what it sort of looks like.

524
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:41,561
You get anything from
Jeremiah's house or the motel?

525
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:44,598
No poison, no canteen.

526
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,566
Jeremiah and Rosa are still in jail.

527
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,168
It's been almost 24 hours.

528
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,429
If we want to hold them,

529
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:50,914
we're gonna have to
charge them with something.

530
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:52,182
Jeremiah's lawyer's
already on his way here.

531
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:55,542
All right. Release them, Ferg.

532
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,912
Before you do, impound their cars

533
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,348
and have Rosa surrender her passport.

534
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:06,987
What's all this?

535
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,990
Turns out Marko was poisoned by hemlock.

536
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,324
He's probably the only
person that died from it

537
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:14,027
since Socrates.

538
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:15,295
All right, I googled it.

539
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,398
Poison's nothing new.

540
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,000
Back when the rail road was coming through,

541
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:23,336
the U.S. army used to poison
Indian wells on occasion

542
00:27:23,404 --> 00:27:26,573
to kill the natives and
take their land, so...

543
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:30,076
But Marko's brothers were the only ones

544
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:31,578
who knew where that well was.

545
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,146
Not the only ones.

546
00:27:33,214 --> 00:27:36,149
Rosa said she spent some
time on the property.

547
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,852
Marko could have showed her the well,

548
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:41,354
showing off the estate to his bride-to-be,

549
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:43,356
or anyone looking to buy the property

550
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:46,226
could have done some surveying,
found the well that way.

551
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,828
You find anything at the
county clerk's office?

552
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:50,297
Yeah.

553
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,300
Big Pines Timber was
trying to buy Marko's land.

554
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,169
Spoke with an official from the company

555
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:58,338
who said Marko rejected
the first couple offers,

556
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,607
but looks like they were
close to cutting a deal.

557
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,008
Which official?

558
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:04,878
Spoke on the condition of anonymity.

559
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:08,148
We're not reporters, Branch.

560

[Door opens]

You think you can just kill us?

You'll have to do better than poison.

567
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:32,639
We won't die so easily.

Look. They've already begun.

573
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:54,427
They're wiping us out.

574
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:57,297
You have to do something, Sheriff.

575
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,632
- Please.
- Take him.

576
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:09,909
Any truth in what Sal's saying?

577
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,513
His brother came to us wanting
to sell his part of their land,

578
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,014
but the company thought

579
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,883
it would be better to have the whole thing.

580
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:20,787
We made the family an offer
for all three plots a week ago.

581
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:23,123
It was a very generous offer.

582
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,092
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

583
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,001
Is this the knife he used to kill her?

584
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:38,138
Fales: Yeah, we found it with his body.

585
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:42,142
Her DNA was on the
blade. I know it's tough.

586
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,011
I'm only sorry you had
to get all this from me.

587
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:47,514
I'm sure this would have been
easier coming from your father.

588
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:50,216
Unfortunately, he didn't
leave us much of a choice.

589
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:51,451
Well, it couldn't have been easy for him

590
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:53,086
keeping something like this from you.

591
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:56,022
You'd be surprised. He's
gotten pretty good at it.

592
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:58,191
Don't be so hard on him.

593
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,960
I mean, everything
you're feeling right now,

594
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,329
he's had to go through it alone.

595
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:04,931
I mean, besides you,

596
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:07,100
he only has that friend of his to talk to.

597
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,969
Um... uh... Henry.

598
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,407
Henry. That's right.

599
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,313
Is this his body?

600
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:22,415
- He didn't die of an overdose?
- No.

601
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,117
Someone broke his neck.

602
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,920
Do you have any idea who killed him?

603
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:28,421
None.

604
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:31,224
But I've been at this a long time.

605
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,926
And sooner or later,

606
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:36,529
everyone tells their secrets to somebody.

607
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:41,935
Hey, uh, I hope all this helped.

608
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:45,104
It did, I think.

609
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:48,007
You need anything else,
feel free to call me, okay?

610
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,010
I don't think I'm gonna
do that. No offense.

611
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:52,612
No offense taken.

612
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,020
Who was that?

613
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:02,255
She was either sent here

614
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:04,424
by the prime suspect in my murder case

615
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:09,362
to find out what I know,
or she's my new best friend.

616
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,230
That was Costa. Told him the situation.

617
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:15,565
He said he'd get down
here as soon as he could.

618
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,068
Why am I in this cell? Why?!

619

It's those Timber people
that should be in here.

620
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,475
There's no crime trying
to buy someone's land.

621
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,478
We know Big Pines Timber made
offers to all your family.

622
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,215
That's a lie. No one
came to offer me anything.

623
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,784
Everything they said so far has been true.

624
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,653
Whatever that Timber company offered,

625
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:38,788
looks like Marko was gonna accept it.

626
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,023
And you would have done just about anything

627

to stop that, wouldn't you?

00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,661
Branch: That land's been in
your family for generations.

629
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:46,896
Marko was about to sell you all out.

630
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:48,798

You ever hear of Guernica, Sheriff?

634
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:09,853
Yeah.

635
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,155
It's a basque down in Spain.

636
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,508
Hitler bombed it,

637
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:18,511
Picasso made a painting about it,

638
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:21,848
and Marko had a copy of it in his house.

639
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:27,787
In 1937,

640
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:33,693
Franco let Hitler use
us for target practice.

641
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:39,132
My grandparents were the only
ones of their family to survive.

642
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:43,636
Their land was gone... destroyed.

643
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:48,141
But they had each other.

644
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:53,046
If you think I care more
about land than my brother...

you're wrong.

646
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:03,089
But if what you're saying is true...

647
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:09,696
if someone killed Marko
over a piece of pasture...

Because if I get to them first,

00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:23,042
I will rip them apart with my bare hands.

651
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,603
Death came in like thunder.

Vic: Walt?

653
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,646
If you're a man like Sal

654
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:03,082
and you wanted to kill someone...

655
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,289
you do it face-to-face.

00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,964
You'd want to see him up close...

00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:20,833
watch the light go out of their eyes,

658
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:24,003
and you wouldn't care if you got caught.

Poison is a coward's weapon.

660

Killers that use it are patient, sneaky.

661

They want to get away with it.

662
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:36,816
Sal doesn't fit that bill.

663
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,886
But there are a few people that do.

664
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:43,223
Branch, Ferg, go find Jeremiah and Rosa,

665
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,757

I just stopped by the

669

I'm guessing you know where she is.

I don't see their truck.

673
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:12,051
Maybe Costa's on his way to
the station to pick up Sal?

674
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,221
[Static] Ferg: Walt, it's Ferg.

675

I got Jeremiah in custody,
but it looks like Rosa bolted.

[Static]

677
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,694
All right, bring Jeremiah in.

He didn't come with me.

682

I need to speak with Jacob.

683

- He's out at a business dinner.
- Where?

684
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:38,110
I know times, I don't know places.

685

But I'll tell him you dropped by.

686
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,781
No.

687

What did you say to Costa when you called?

693
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:03,302
I just told him about Sal
and the lumber company.

There's nobody here.

I didn't. I had no idea.

knew that he was trying to sell his land.

That's right. [Sniffing]

You didn't tell your husband

You didn't tell them
what Marko was planning.

[Voice breaking] I didn't have a choice.

If Marko sold his land,

that would mean less water,
less grazing land for the sheep.
