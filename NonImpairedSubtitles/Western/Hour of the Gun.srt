1
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,964
They're leaving town.

2
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,235
Wyatt.

3
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,384
Ike Clanton,
Andy Warshaw, Latigo...

4
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,855
Curly Bill Brocius.

5
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,633
Who's in the corral, Virg?

6
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,863
Billy Clanton.

7
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,337
And the McLowerys.

8
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,806
We've come to disarm you.

9
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,073
Raise your hands
over your heads!

10
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,948
Virgil?

11
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,682
Can't walk.

12
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,745
Morg?

13
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,815
It's the shoulder.

14
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,686
- Doc?
- Yeah?

15
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,752
Did Virg deputize you?

16
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,889
I swore to something
he was muttering about.

17
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,626
Then wear the badge.

18
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,638
Virg, let me help you.
Here... here.

19
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,423
I'm all right, doc.
See to Virg.

20
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,156
- Doc, he's hit.
- It's just my leg.

21
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,130
Just stay still, Virg.

22
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,723
Well, arrest 'em.

23
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,794
I don't know if a county sheriff can
arrest a city marshal without a warrant.

24
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,204
We can take him if you can't.

25
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,936
We got enough guns
to settle the whole thing right here.

26
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,989
You're under arrest.

27
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,218
For what?

28
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,453
Murder.

29
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,929
Not today, tomorrow, or ever.

30
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,660
You don't have jurisdiction
in the city of Tombstone.

31
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,895
If you did,
you couldn't make it stick.

32
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,802
We got enough men behind us
to make it stick.

33
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,865
Stillwell, if you so much as turn
your head toward those men,

34
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,071
you'll be laying in the horse manure
with your friends.

35
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,143
Wyatt, give me a hand here.

36
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,518
I'll get a warrant.
I'm serving you, Wyatt!

37
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,584
Your badge
won't help you this time.

38
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,180
Please accept my condolences,
Mr. Clanton.

39
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,748
We'll be ready in a moment.

40
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,222
You got the warrants now?

41
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,127
Ready for the judge's signature.

42
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,859
If you'd had the law in your hands,

43
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,369
Wyatt would've let you lock them up
out at the corral. I know him.

44
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,371
It was a stupid play
to try without it.

45
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,930
I didn't have the warrants

46
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,671
because I didn't think the Earps
would be alive to be served.

47
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,009
At least, that's what you told me.

48
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,413
Yeah, they're alive now.

49
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,417
But their hands are dirty.

50
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,817
And you all got to understand that.

51
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,551
That's what's going to get you
elected city marshal.

52
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,426
That is if the county doesn't let the Earps
slip through our fingers at the trial.

53
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,488
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I don't intend to.

54
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,228
Get this through your heads.

55
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,165
If this were back east,
I could make law the way they do.

56
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,671
But the best thing
I can do out here is buy it.

57
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,905
You get good value, don't you?

58
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,674
It's been working.

59
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,277
It works until the east gets here.

60
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,182
But if I'm not big enough to buck them

61
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,747
when they start to corner the ranges
and the railroads and the stockyards,

62
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,157
you boys are going to have to go back
to living on what the county pays you.

63
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,661
But meanwhile...

64
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,890
Meanwhile, if we don't
wanna get eaten up,

65
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,401
we're going to have to grow bigger
and faster than nature intended.

66
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,296
Yeah...

67
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,864
and hope their brothers don't continue
to be so lucky as they were this morning.

68
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,240
They won't.

69
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,906
One way or another.

70
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,109
We are ready now,
Mr. Clanton.

71
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,497
I hope you are satisfied,
Mr. Clanton.

72
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,769
I am.

73
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,846
Yay, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

74
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:02,360
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

75
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,387
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...

76
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,327
Why did you give up practice
in dentistry and take up gambling?

77
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,963
What's the word they use?
Irrelevant?

78
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,566
I'll rule on that, Mr. Holiday.
You answer the question.

79
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,534
Was it because of your illness?

80
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,772
Partially.

81
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,577
Or as your
growing reputation as a killer?

82
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,314
No. I found there was more gold
in people's pockets than in their mouths.

83
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,980
Does that satisfy you?

84
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,388
Eminently.

85
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,156
What was your reason

86
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:40,221
for volunteering your services
as a gunfighter to the Earp family?

87
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,130
I owed Wyatt Earp a favor.

88
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,996
You mean you killed a man you didn't
even know as a favor to another?

89
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,339
I killed a lot of men I didn't know
between 1861 and 1865.

90
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,241
Nobody said anything about it then.

91
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,472
War, Mr. Holliday.

92
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,879
Well, I never did
understand the difference.

93
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,008
How many men have you killed
as a civilian?

94
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,078
Oh, I don't know.
Somewhere between 18 and 25.

95
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,989
I presume they were all quarrels
over your gentlemanly honor.

96
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,392
No. Over money.
That's my profession.

97
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,861
Are you finished?

98
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,923
No. No, not quite.

99
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,602
Then you admit
that you accepted a deputy's badge

100
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,608
and used it as a cloak to cover
an act of homicide as a favor?

101
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:28,841
I accepted a deputy's badge
to uphold the law against lke Clanton

102
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,405
who was threatening it
with a gang of gunmen...

103
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,476
until he decided to pull out
and sacrifice his brother

104
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,886
to make the Earps look like baby killers
so they'd lose votes.

105
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,484
You're out of order, Mr. Holliday.
Just answer the question.

106
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,392
Did you not, as a fact,
accept a deputy's badge and...

107
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,128
- I don't need a badge to kill.
- Only the word of Wyatt Earp!

108
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,363
I'd go to hell and back
on the word of Wyatt Earp.

109
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,167
So would half the men in this room.

110
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,506
And you observed these impressions
of the gunfight from where, Mr. Clanton?

111
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,513
Fly's Photographic Gallery
across from the O.K. Corral.

112
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:06,244
I see.
With the court's permission.

113
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,545
Is Andrew Warshaw in the court?

114
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,614
Yeah. Right here.

115
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,852
Would you mind
standing up, Mr. Warshaw?

116
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,988
Is Andrew Warshaw
in your employ?

117
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,257
Yes, he is.

118
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,267
Is this the same Andrew Warshaw
who's wanted in Pecos County, Texas

119
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,065
on two counts of armed robbery
and three of murder?

120
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,197
I wouldn't know that.

121
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,868
In what capacity do you employ
Mr. Warshaw?

122
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,774
Scientific stock breeder.

123
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,441
I see.

124
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,006
Now, Andrew Warshaw
has been observed regularly

125
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,417
wearing a six-gun and
saddle holstering a Winchester carbine.

126
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,719
Are these normally considered
the tools of his profession?

127
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,453
Maybe he has
to force the stock to breed.

128
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,763
Mr. Holliday...
that will be all.

129
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,971
You can sit down now,
Mr. Warshaw.

130
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,305
Would William Brocius
please stand up?

131
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,207
Is William Brocius
in your employ?

132
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,683
Yes, he is.

133
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,913
Is this the same William Brocius

134
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,822
who is wanted variously
on eight counts of murder

135
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,453
in Kansas City, Missouri,
Abilene, Texas, Gallup, New Mexico

136
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,259
between the years 1878 and 1881?

137
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,391
I wouldn't know that, either.

138
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,401
In what capacity
do you employ him?

139
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,629
Bookkeeper.

140
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,797
- I beg your pardon?
- Bookkeeper.

141
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,868
I see.
That'll be all, Mr. Brocius.

142
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,747
Now, is it a fact that you're
a heavy financial backer

143
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,547
of another one of your employees,
Pete Spence,

144
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,215
for the Tombstone City Marshal post
now held by Virgil Earp?

145
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,621
It is a fact.

146
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,250
That will be all.

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,991
When you heard the shooting,

148
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,334
why did you not go to the aid
of your brother and the McLowerys?

149
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,398
It's been so long since there's been
a gunfight in this county,

150
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,808
I could scarcely believe my ears.

151
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,541
When you did ascertain
that a gunfight was actually in progress,

152
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,775
what did you do?

153
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,011
Nothing. I was unarmed.

154
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,816
I find that my familiarity with weapons
is not an asset to me as a businessman.

155
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,885
It has been stated
that your employees...

156
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,295
the bookkeeper
and the cattle breeder...

157
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,198
were armed.
Why, Mr. Clanton?

158
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,328
I've been told that there's
a plot to assassinate me.

159
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,168
Because of my stand for freedom
of the range against the easterners.

160
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,907
In my opinion...

161
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,813
such was the purpose of
the marshal's attack on the O.K. Corral.

162
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,414
That is all.

163
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,587
Then you did have an animosity
toward the Clanton group

164
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,989
prior to October 26, 1881?

165
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,721
Everyone in town knows I did.

166
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,628
Oh, Marshal, you walked down
to that O.K. Corral

167
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,690
with your brothers and Doc Holliday
in a state of frustration,

168
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,600
with malice in your heart,
toward lke Clanton and his group.

169
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,265
I've said that. Repeating the question
won't make it any stronger.

170
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,740
That's all.

171
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,379
Just a moment, Your Honor.
I should like to reexamine the defendant.

172
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,482
Wyatt, did malice move you
against the Clanton group?

173
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,610
No.

174
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,415
Would you tell the court what did?

175
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,355
The Clanton group was armed

176
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,417
and made threats
of death and violence against us.

177
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,829
It was our duty as sworn peace officers
to disarm and arrest them.

178
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,629
I would disarm and arrest
General Ulysses S. Grant

179
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,468
if he appeared on the streets of
Tombstone under those circumstances.

180
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,031
Wyatt, I told you
before you went down to the corral

181
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,513
that I had met with the Clanton group
and they agreed to leave town peaceably.

182
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,312
Bryan, you take bribes. You're a thief,
a liar, and a disgrace to your office.

183
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,377
I wouldn't take your word
if you swore to it on your mother's grave.

184
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,615
You'll live to regret that.

185
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,459
I want to recall Sheriff Bryan.

186
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,100
Now, Sheriff Bryan...

187
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:28,112
would you mind repeating under oath
the statement you just made?

188
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,007
I said I attempted
to stop the Earps and Holliday

189
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,918
as they marched down the street
toward the corral.

190
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,649
How did you go about that?

191
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,085
I told them that none of the men
at the corral were looking for trouble.

192
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,823
They had all agreed
to leave town immediately.

193
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,626
And what was their reply?

194
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,693
They ignored me.

195
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,359
And what did you do then?

196
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,499
I watched them.

197
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:59,977
I saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLowery
raise their hands above their heads...

198
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,640
and Tom McLowery threw back his coat
and lapel to show that he was unarmed!

199
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,206
And that's when the Earps
and Holliday opened fire!

200
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,617
- You swear this under oath?
- I do!

201
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,020
That they fired on the deceased
with their coats open

202
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,423
and their hands raised in the air!

203
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,794
That's all, Your Honor.

204
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,198
So we see that the prosecution has
introduced a substantial body of evidence

205
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,532
pointing to the guilt
of the defendants.

206
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,131
And much of this stands unrefuted
by the defense.

207
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,039
But in the last analysis,

208
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,102
the prosecution's case
turns on two points.

209
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,012
Whether in fact
the shooting was a crime,

210
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,913
and whether there was a motive.

211
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,009
As to the first point,

212
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:47,753
both the coroner's report and the
independent medical testimony indicate

213
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,229
that William Clanton's wrist
was penetrated from the outside

214
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,494
and that the bullet lodged
in his abdomen.

215
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:02,505
That is not the wound received
by a man with his hands in the air.

216
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,109
Tom McLowery's wounds were not
the sort that could be received

217
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,171
with his hands
on his lapels like that,

218
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,741
but rather with his hands
around a Winchester carbine

219
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,220
which he had recently extracted
from his horse's saddle holster.

220
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,321
The testimony of Sheriff Bryan
therefore stands refuted.

221
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,121
Therefore, since no crime
has been established...

222
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,190
or even a motive for one...

223
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,231
I find that the defendants
were fully justified in their actions,

224
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,970
and that these homicides occurred
in the discharge of their official duties.

225
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,536
The case of the prosecution
is therefore dismissed.

226
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,673
Court is adjourned.

227
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,276
Everybody rise.

228
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,392
Well, shooting from the front side
didn't work.

229
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,456
Next time, he'll try it from the back.

230
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,526
We'll get Clanton at the election.
Thanks, Horace.

231
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,094
See you at the polls.

232
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,805
Good night.

233
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:15,040
Harry... take this over to Doc
before you check out, will ya?

234
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,006
Okay.

235
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,047
- Good night, Marshal.
- Good night, Harry.

236
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,785
Hit me.

237
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,690
How much the baby weigh?

238
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,252
Too much.
Don't distract me.

239
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,592
Hit me again.

240
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,499
- Charley, I don't think that...
- Just give me the card, will ya?

241
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,166
If the population keeps growing

242
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,074
and you keep stopping in here
every time you deliver a baby,

243
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,542
you're gonna go broke.

244
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,440
I can't understand
why I never win.

245
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,509
You don't play very well.
Besides that, you never cheat.

246
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,078
Cheat?
Do you?

247
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,215
No, I'm too good.
I don't have to.

248
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,591
Well, if you weren't that good?

249
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,993
I'd cheat.

250
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,455
Well, I'll be damned.

251
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,525
I don't think
the correct word is "cheat," Charley.

252
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,437
What is that word? Just how much
is a player supposed to lose?

253
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,997
Well, now...

254
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,533
the house rules fix the percentage.
The regulars know the odds.

255
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,843
Doc's just trying to keep you
from giving us your money.

256
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,780
Checked the horses and the prisoners.
You're on duty.

257
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,483
Don't you think it's time
to go home, Charley?

258
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,047
I'll walk along with you.

259
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,861
Nope. I'm gonna stay
and do a little rule bending.

260
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,328
Good night.

261
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,456
Harry.

262
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,030
Harry, wake up.

263
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,863
Harry, get out of bed.

264
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,768
I just got into bed.

265
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,672
There's someone breaking in
downstairs in the barbershop.

266
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,404
What can they steal
in the barbershop?

267
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,072
Harry, do you want me
to go downstairs?

268
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,308
Sure. You go. You go.

269
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,183
All right. All right.

270
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,047
- Marshal.
- Get my brother. Get my brother, please.

271
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,120
Morg, check the alley!

272
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,716
It's your brother, Marshal.

273
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,818
- Virgil, you all right?
- Couldn't see.

274
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,490
- Stick with us.
- I don't feel anything.

275
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,556
- Where'd the shots come from?
- Barbershop.

276
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,535
Out of the way, Wyatt.

277
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
Hold him up, will ya?

278
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,411
Harry, did you see anything?

279
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,973
No. Nothing. Nothing.

280
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,347
Harry, you're lying.
Who did you see?

281
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,083
It was dark.

282
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,929
Where was it dark, Harry?

283
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,332
Marshal... I got a boy and a wife.

284
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,402
So has Virgil.

285
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,203
I can't.
They'll kill me.

286
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,940
That won't help nothing.

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,146
Harry, you've got just as much to fear
from me as you have from Clanton.

288
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,208
Now, who was it?

289
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,753
It makes no difference
what you do to me.

290
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,682
I can't.

291
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,163
Unless you promise I don't have
to say this to anyone but you.

292
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,436
All right, Harry.
You've got my word.

293
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,901
Stilwell.

294
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,878
You said "they."

295
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,304
Brocius.

296
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,872
And Spence.

297
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,350
And Warshaw.

298
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,051
All right, Harry.

299
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,788
Whereas six witnesses
for the defense have testified

300
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,798
that the accused, Peter Spence,
Andrew Warshaw, and William Brocius

301
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,027
were playing poker
at the Alhambra Saloon

302
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,094
at the time of the assault
on Marshal Earp's life,

303
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,765
and whereas Sheriff Bryan
has sworn

304
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,436
that his deputy, Frank Stilwell,
was on duty at the county jail...

305
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:52,245
...and since the city prosecutor has failed
to produce any evidence to the contrary

306
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,445
or any witnesses
to the actual assault

307
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,683
or to the number
or identity of assailants...

308
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,693
Mr. Fitch?

309
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,327
Therefore, the charges of feloniously
assaulting Marshal Virgil Earp

310
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,342
brought by the city of Tombstone
against these defendants are dismissed.

311
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,571
This court is adjourned.

312
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,805
Everybody rise.

313
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,227
Wyatt, he knew you had a witness.
He gave you every chance...

314
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,458
Let it go, Tom.

315
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,194
I'll be damned
if I understand a man

316
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,101
whose word to a waiter
is more important than his brother.

317
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,662
The law won't work
when part of it is ignored

318
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,573
because everyone is either
bought off or terrified.

319
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,043
Then I'll enforce the part
that does work.

320
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,443
Wyatt...

321
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,239
Your brother will be
a cripple for life.

322
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,854
Who's gonna take his place
on the ballot, Wyatt?

323
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,515
I am.

324
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,601
I don't wanna hear
a word from you.

325
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,164
I'm just educating myself.

326
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,233
I've never been
on the right side of the law.

327
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,973
I want to see how much good
it does you when you are.

328
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,989
Andy Warshaw.

329
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,657
Andrew Warshaw.

330
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,559
Andrew Warshaw.

331
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,255
Anson Safford.

332
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,861
Anson Safford.

333
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,596
Anson Safford.

334
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,677
Nervous?

335
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,381
Fair amount.

336
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,618
Well, it should be over
by midnight.

337
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,930
I won, didn't I?

338
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,196
Yes, Morgan.

339
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,773
You did.

340
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,775
Wyatt?

341
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,363
What'd he say?

342
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,975
When we were kids,

343
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,776
we used to argue about whether,
when you were dying,

344
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,046
your whole life
flashed in front of you or not.

345
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,120
He said,
"It ain't so, Wyatt."

346
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,090
There's two more bags
in the carriage.

347
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,934
What are you gonna do, Wyatt?

348
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:21,843
I'm taking them to Tucson to meet
the transcontinental train to California.

349
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,776
Virgil will bury Morgan
out there with my folks.

350
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,512
I don't mean that.
What about here?

351
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,747
What do you want us to do?

352
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,653
Nothing.

353
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,056
I'll take legal action
when I get back.

354
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,424
The runner-up takes office
in Tombstone.

355
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,158
We had to swear in Spence
as City Marshal this morning.

356
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,928
You're not gonna find
any legal action that's gonna stick.

357
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,833
We'll see.

358
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,567
We've gotten together $20,000
to post his reward money.

359
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,801
Thank you, Hansen.

360
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,172
All aboard!

361
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,738
Horace.

362
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,545
You'll get a telegram from me
by the time you reach Tucson, Wyatt.

363
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,085
What are you doing here?

364
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,485
I'm crazy about trains.

365
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,299
Telegram for you, Mr. Earp.

366
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,530
Thank you.

367
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,509
"I've secured your appointment,
Federal Marshal,

368
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,074
"and authority you form posse.

369
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:46,988
"Arrest suspects Stilwell,
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.

370
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,787
"Warrants in mail.

371
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,556
Sorry, no public funds available.
Horace Solomon."

372
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,722
He doesn't name Clanton.

373
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,528
Not enough evidence
to get a warrant against Clanton.

374
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,593
Well, you got the first gun
for your posse.

375
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,729
You hear the part
about no funds available?

376
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:06,675
I hear the Chamber of Commerce
has put up $20,000 reward money.

377
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,180
For arrest and conviction.
Not dead or alive.

378
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,738
Not your style, Doc.

379
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,752
For that kind of money,
I can be as law-abiding as, uh...

380
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,914
...you are.

381
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,484
- Hi, Sherm.
- Wyatt.

382
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,886
Thanks for meeting us.

383
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,617
I'm very sorry about Morgan.

384
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,785
Yeah. You know Doc Holliday.
Sherman McMasters.

385
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,729
You were the arresting officer when
I shot Long Nose Ernie here in '74.

386
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,958
That's right.

387
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,193
Good to see ya.

388
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,427
Wyatt.

389
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,971
I got a tip, and figured it mightn't wait,
so I came out to meet you.

390
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,098
Yeah?

391
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,475
You can talk in front of me.
We just went in business together.

392
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,143
Clanton sent Frank Stilwell
and two of his gun hands into Tucson.

393
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,708
I think he means to make
a clean sweep of the Earps.

394
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,646
Where do you think it'll come?

395
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,123
There's no telling.

396
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,524
If I were you,
I'd get my family off to California,

397
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,586
take this train back to Tombstone.

398
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,708
I wish you'd sign on, Sherm.

399
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,712
I would, Wyatt,
but I can't afford it.

400
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,112
You know they only pay
$53 a month in Tucson?

401
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,522
With a family, that keeps me
on the edge all the time.

402
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:04,857
I'll match that out of my own pocket,
plus a half...

403
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,762
and you get a crack
at the $20,000 reward.

404
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,597
You'll take this train
back to Tombstone?

405
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,226
Yeah.

406
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,397
I'll get my gear.

407
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,375
Stilwell's had time
to get to Tucson.

408
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,644
Take care of your family.

409
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,211
All aboard!

410
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,476
Stilwell...
you're under arrest.

411
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,810
Drop the shotgun.

412
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,353
Now the gun belt.

413
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,324
Before you start steaming, lke,

414
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,202
Tucson has issued a homicide warrant
for Earp for Stilwell's murder.

415
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,001
We'll serve it in Tombstone.

416
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,338
What happened to the two hands
you sent with him?

417
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,401
- Earp nailed the first one.
- And the other?

418
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,969
- He, uh...
- Yes?

419
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,378
He left.

420
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,058
Now...

421
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,529
Bryan.

422
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,230
If I gave you a posse
of 25 men...

423
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:48,802
you think you might be able
to find Earp and maybe even arrest him?

424
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,515
I can handle it, Mr. Clanton.

425
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,239
Ike...

426
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,044
This is local law
against federal law.

427
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,521
It's gotten too big for us.

428
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,320
They'll send troops here
if anything happens to Earp.

429
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,758
Sit down, Roy.

430
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,522
Advice like that
I can get cheaper than you come.

431
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,101
Bryan, after you organize your posse,

432
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:18,665
I want you to put 20 men under Spence
as Deputy City Marshals.

433
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,403
Put Latigo in charge.

434
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,270
Latigo?

435
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,776
Solomon, Clum, and the rest of them are
bound to organize a vigilante committee.

436
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,014
I want them disarmed
and out of the way.

437
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,281
Okay, Mr. Clanton.

438
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,556
Ike? Bryan and Latigo
don't have to handle that.

439
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,457
I can take care of it.
It's my job.

440
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,855
You won't even be here.
You're going to disappear.

441
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,423
How do you mean disappear?

442
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,198
I'm the city marshal now.
I can stand up to Earp.

443
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,205
You're a joke.

444
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:54,543
Earp would drop you and a dozen
like you quicker than he did Stilwell.

445
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,805
Brocius, you like to drink.

446
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,643
Go to Texas
and booze yourself into silence.

447
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,449
Sure.

448
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,051
Warshaw?

449
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,854
I've been to Texas, Mr. Clanton.

450
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,419
If you want me to go, I'll go, but I can
find a spot right here in the ranch,

451
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,159
stay there real quiet,
and just not go no place.

452
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,996
The city marshal
can't just disappear.

453
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,402
Business trip.

454
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,575
That'll take money.

455
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,836
You've had all the money you're going
to get out of me. Find it somewhere else.

456
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,082
I can't go, lke.

457
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,343
The talking's over, Spence.

458
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,835
What do you think you're doing?

459
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,905
Marshal Spence heard some
of you people been wearing guns.

460
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,917
We have orders to find out.

461
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,577
Whose orders?

462
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,451
Marshal Spence.
We're his deputies.

463
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,787
Where is the marshal?
I wanna talk to him.

464
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,758
- He's out of town.
- Why?

465
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,553
Business trip.

466
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,621
May I have your firearms?

467
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,966
No.
I challenge your authority.

468
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,027
John. John.

469
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,966
That's not gonna
get us anywhere now.

470
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,874
After all, they are the law.

471
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,606
You're just playing
into their hands.

472
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,011
He's right, John.

473
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,629
I'll let you know
when you can pick up your irons.

474
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,365
You won't have it that long.

475
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,694
I'll leave these gentlemen to you.

476
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,259
I can't stand pillars of society
when I'm not taking their money.

477
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,768
Here's your posse authorization.
I'm glad to see you.

478
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,834
Gentlemen, this is
Sherman McMasters from Tucson.

479
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,072
Anson Safford.

480
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,307
John.

481
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,178
Now, what do they want?

482
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,248
They've got what they wanted.
Our guns.

483
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,987
Spence's men
ordered us disarmed.

484
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,552
Where is Spence?

485
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,531
Out of town.
On business.

486
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:08,661
Well, it's Spence's duty
just as it was Virgil's to disarm you.

487
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,263
You're not defending Spence?!

488
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,474
Just the law.

489
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,771
What were you doing
wearing a gun, John?

490
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,841
That mob of Clanton's
armed to the teeth.

491
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,079
I want to arm a hundred men,
organize a vigilante's committee,

492
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,552
back you,
take this town away from Clanton!

493
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,782
They're legally elected.

494
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:30,020
Till they step out of line, neither you
nor I have a right to touch them.

495
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,494
If we do...
you said it in court...

496
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,053
you've got anarchy.

497
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,793
All right.
What do you think we should do?

498
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,357
Just sit tight.

499
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:41,598
Clanton's got a murder warrant
out on you for Stilwell's death.

500
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,163
Bryan's got a posse together
to serve it.

501
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,232
Let him.
He hasn't got a case.

502
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,471
You can get it kicked out
of court, can't you?

503
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,844
You won't be alive
long enough to get to court.

504
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,774
Do you know that for a fact?

505
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:59,516
The way I see it, if Clanton actually
wants you arrested and taken to jail,

506
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,922
these deputies could do it
easily right now.

507
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,482
I don't see 'em moving.

508
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,996
I know it's against your principles
to run away from the law,

509
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:11,728
but under the circumstances, my advice
to you right now is... start movin'.

510
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,803
I think you're right, Horace.

511
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,335
Don't think I don't appreciate
your offer, John.

512
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,313
Sherm, the situation
has changed here.

513
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,817
Bryan's got his posse on my tail.

514
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,382
Clum feels they're
gonna try to kill me.

515
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,325
They'll have to catch up
with us first.

516
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,886
That's what I mean.
You got a wife and children.

517
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,795
I had 'em when I started.

518
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:48,698
There's a water station about 20 miles
up the line. We'll drop off there.

519
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,104
You get us outfitted
and meet us there.

520
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,665
I'll meet you there, too.

521
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:57,439
I'm gonna raise a posse for you...
not the kind you'd come up with...

522
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,177
...but it'll be a posse.

523
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,776
Wyatt...

524
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,913
Damnit, I hate to see you
make a wrong move here.

525
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,583
Let me organize the vigilante's committee.
Just say the word.

526
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,293
No. But thank you, John.

527
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,784
You sure got cheated
on that table.

528
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,822
I know you can draw before I can raise
this up. Go on! Get it over with!

529
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,391
I got no such thing
in mind, Jack.

530
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,302
I wasn't duckin' out on you, Doc.
I know I owe you 800.

531
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,863
I just been saving up, that's all.

532
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:02,207
Sure. What would I want
with a lousy $6.50 anyway?

533
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,110
You see, the thing is...

534
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,672
I'm in the hole for another thousand
with Bill Rayner.

535
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,281
So there wouldn't be much point
in shootin' a bankrupt.

536
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,688
That's it. You'd just be gettin'
yourself a lot of trouble with Bill.

537
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,089
He'd be sore as hell at you

538
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,094
if you was to kill me
and me still owin' him all that money.

539
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,099
Supposin' we go
for a little walk?

540
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,499
I'd sooner you give it
to me right here.

541
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,400
Put that thing away.

542
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,268
That's for the drinks
and the table.

543
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,083
Raise your right hand.

544
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,297
Do you solemnly swear to enforce
the laws of the United States of America

545
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,528
and the territory of Arizona to the best
of your abilities, so help you God?

546
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,331
Well, you must be
out of your mind.

547
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,736
- Say, "I do."
- I do.

548
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,138
You are now
a Deputy Federal Marshal.

549
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,368
I am?

550
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,435
There's $15,000
reward money in this.

551
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,344
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.

552
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,746
Dead or alive?

553
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,276
Arrest and conviction.

554
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,515
The way you handle a gun,
you're lucky that's the way it is.

555
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,419
- When do I start?
- Right now.

556
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,007
All right, you men.
Off the wagons. Off the wagons!

557
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,814
Get your tools.
Let's go! Let's move out!

558
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,877
Pick it up! Pick it up!

559
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,582
All right, you men.
Let's go. Let's go.

560
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,556
All right, let's get the lead out.
Let's move!

561
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,732
All right, let's get it in there!

562
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,869
Pretty dangerous fellas
you got here.

563
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,465
Might scorch you
with one of them headlamps.

564
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,969
Hello, Doc.

565
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:18,640
A gunslinger like you
bullying miners.

566
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,380
You oughta be ashamed
of yourself.

567
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,713
I have to make a living.

568
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,346
You don't have to make it
busting mining strikes.

569
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,946
That's what they pay me for.

570
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,016
I just can't make it
as a hired gun in the west anymore.

571
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,583
Well...

572
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,061
Ike Clanton's hirin' guns right now.

573
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,361
I wouldn't raise a finger
against the Earps.

574
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,098
That's what I
wanna talk to you about.

575
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,631
- Wyatt staked you, didn't he?
- After I got outta jail.

576
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,765
- So? He still staked ya.
- He sent me to jail!

577
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,002
- You still owe him a favor.
- I did him a favor.

578
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,272
I didn't hire my gun to Clanton.

579
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,477
No, you just used it
to push poor miners around.

580
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,417
Well... you don't expect me
to work, do ya?

581
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,976
Raise your right hand.

582
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,386
What for?

583
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,447
I'm gettin' up a posse.

584
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,720
- Against Clanton?
- That's right.

585
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,954
Why should I?

586
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,154
That's a foolish question.

587
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,167
Yeah.

588
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,001
And there's $15,000
reward money in it.

589
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,770
Do you solemnly swear to uphold
the laws of the United States of America

590
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,613
and the territory of Arizona to the best
of your abilities, so help you God?

591
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:31,085
- I do.
- You are now a Deputy Federal Marshal.

592
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,314
Follow me.

593
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,556
Texas Jack Vermillion,
this is Turkey Creek Johnson.

594
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,388
How'd he sucker you?

595
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,129
Well, you see,
I owed him this $800.

596
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,377
You sure they're hiding
over at Clanton's ranch?

597
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,917
Only one way to find out.

598
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,052
It's right over them mountains,
ain't it?

599
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,722
Maybe Wyatt isn't headed
for Clanton's ranch at all.

600
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,095
Maybe he's just trying
to put a lot of rough ground

601
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,566
between that posse of Bryan and us.

602
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,603
Is that possible, Wyatt?

603
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,832
If that's so, we oughta move outta here
before we get squeezed in the middle.

604
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,845
I think the boys are trying to tell you
it'd be a lot safer

605
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,972
if we headed away
from Clanton's place.

606
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,949
- Nobody said that.
- Then stop thinking about it!

607
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,781
Wyatt...

608
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,847
Here.

609
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,290
You know who they were?

610
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,622
It was Pete.

611
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,389
Pete Spence.

612
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,866
How many were there?

613
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,302
And where's your shotgun rider?

614
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,537
If we can get him across the river,
maybe we can get some help.

615
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:11,945
Forget it.

616
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:46,847
Mine payroll.

617
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:50,045
Why? This isn<i>'</i>t
Spence<i>'</i>s kind of play.

618
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,351
No, it sure ain<i>'</i>t.

619
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,914
It<i>'</i>s traveling money.

620
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:58,553
I got a feeling we<i>'</i>ll find Spence
down around Guatemala.

621
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,262
I want you boys to stay here
and watch for Bryan<i>'</i>s posse.

622
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,564
And if he does show?

623
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:10,471
Hold <i>'</i>em off if you can.
If you can<i>'</i>t, lead <i>'</i>em off downriver.

624
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,202
Where will you be?

625
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:17,771
If you have to cut out, I<i>'</i>ll meet you
at Marshal Kiergan<i>'</i>s place in Contention.

626
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:21,113
Wyatt, Sherm asked,
<i>"</i>Where will you be?<i>"</i>

627
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,748
I<i>'</i>m gonna play a long shot.

628
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,190
No handier than Spence is.

629
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,750
He won<i>'</i>t try to horse back
over those mountains.

630
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:33,661
He<i>'</i>ll be at Algodones
waiting for the eastbound stage.

631
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,460
All right. I<i>'</i>ll go with you.

632
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,795
Doc...

633
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,993
I want you to stay here
and handle the posse.

634
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,528
Spencer<i>'</i>s bound to have some men
with him. He wouldn<i>'</i>t pull this alone.

635
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:45,932
I don<i>'</i>t expect too much trouble.

636
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,774
Then what are
these two bodies doing here?

637
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:03,324
How come Wyatt don<i>'</i>t just admit
he wants Spence for himself,

638
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,259
same as I would
if he killed my brother?

639
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,730
He wants Spence
because the law says to get him.

640
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,562
Then do me a favor, will ya, Doc?

641
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,798
As long as he<i>'</i>s got no personal
feeling about it one way or the other,

642
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,705
why don<i>'</i>t you just talk him into
taking the rest of them alive?

643
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,436
I could really use that reward money.

644
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,844
Doc, you got any idea how to cut out
Bryan and his whole posse?

645
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,315
The time has come to have one.

646
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:56,703
Hello, Spence.

647
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,110
Waiting for the stage?

648
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:12,818
Yeah. I<i>'</i>m going on a trip east...
on business.

649
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,726
Two men killed
on the Naco stage this morning.

650
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:22,288
The driver, shotgun rider.

651
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:25,899
Mine payroll was taken.

652
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:28,431
- Mine payroll?
- Yeah.

653
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,338
When<i>'</i>d that happen?

654
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:35,344
Oh... half hour,
45 minutes ago.

655
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:43,480
From the looks of the tracks,
there was three or four men involved.

656
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,749
I<i>'</i>m traveling alone.

657
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:49,986
You don<i>'</i>t think I had anything
to do with that?

658
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,288
Traveling alone, are you?

659
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,386
Yeah, just, uh...

660
00:58:53,464 --> 00:58:55,125
Just taking a trip east on business.

661
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,627
Both those men got it
in the back with a shotgun.

662
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,702
The same way my brothers
Virgil and Morgan got it.

663
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:08,300
Wyatt, I know how you feel
about your brothers, but...

664
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,144
You know how it feels
to look down the side of a shotgun...

665
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,012
...at a man<i>'</i>s back?

666
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,144
Wyatt, don<i>'</i>t try
to hang that on me.

667
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,712
There<i>'</i>s a federal warrant
for your arrest, Vince.

668
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,849
I was acquitted in court once,
I<i>'</i>ll be acquitted again.

669
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,553
- I had nothing to do with it.
- You had nothing to do with that stage?

670
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:26,220
Nothing!

671
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,893
Charlie.

672
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:43,499
Okay.

673
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:58,447
I see you boys made it all right.

674
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,921
Where<i>'</i>s Marshal Kiergan?

675
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,015
Charlie said
he<i>'</i>d be back this evening.

676
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,632
- Did you find Spence?
- He<i>'</i>s dead.

677
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:19,039
Obviously no chance
for a formal arrest.

678
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,508
That<i>'</i>s right.

679
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:24,377
Well, now, that leaves
$10,000 on the table.

680
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,109
That<i>'</i>s right, Doc.

681
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,845
Keeps this up,
we<i>'</i>ll all lose money on the deal.

682
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,511
Mine payroll?

683
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,851
Yeah. Sherm,
you<i>'</i>d better take charge of this.

684
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:36,916
Probably a little short. Spence said
he was traveling alone when I found him.

685
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,825
What next?

686
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:43,560
Now we<i>'</i>ll just stay here until we figure
Bryan<i>'</i>s posse<i>'</i>s moved on.

687
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,102
Well, you<i>'</i>ve already
had a busy day.

688
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,497
What?

689
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,365
Nothin<i>'.</i>

690
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:18,794
Hey, Charlie!

691
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,227
Come <i>'</i>ere.
Crack another bottle, will ya?

692
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,234
He says there ain<i>'</i>t any more.

693
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,237
How do you know
what he<i>'</i>s sayin<i>'</i>?

694
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,916
<i>'</i>Cause I told him
not to buy any more.

695
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:37,878
Here<i>'</i>s the money you gave him.

696
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,461
A bottle in a bag,
a bottle for now, and a shot glass.

697
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,695
Yes, sir.

698
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02,600
What can I do for you, sir?

699
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:06,005
- You know Bill Brocius?
- He was here up till an hour ago.

700
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:07,566
Any idea where he went?

701
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:10,306
Yeah. Across the street
to the Desert Queen.

702
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,574
Drunk?

703
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:13,309
He was making the rounds.

704
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,543
Thanks.

705
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,262
Just make sure you<i>'</i>re not so free
giving out information about me.

706
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,501
I don<i>'</i>t even know
who you are, sir.

707
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:12,699
Very sloppy riding, Brocius.

708
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,912
I remember seeing
something like this in the circus...

709
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:29,515
...once when I was a child.

710
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:32,555
They lifted up the canvas,
and there they were...

711
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,453
statues.

712
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:40,555
Any of you gentlemen...
want not to be statues?

713
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,106
He<i>'</i>s drunk, Holliday.

714
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,436
So am I.

715
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,102
Now, let me see.

716
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,645
Oh, yes.

717
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:00,710
By authority vested in me
by the government of the United States

718
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:03,617
and the territory of Arizona...

719
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,178
you, Curly Bill Brocius...

720
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,749
First unhook your gun belt.

721
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:43,422
You did that deliberately.

722
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,833
What are you so sore about?

723
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,497
You got Brocius, didn<i>'</i>t you?
That<i>'</i>s what you wanted.

724
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,739
Killing Brocius
is gonna lead Bryan right to us.

725
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,539
We can<i>'</i>t move by surprise now.
You fixed that, Doc.

726
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:04,102
Yeah.

727
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,013
Well, everybody has
their bad luck.

728
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,677
I cough when I drink.

729
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,745
You come up
against sneaky people...

730
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,655
who get you
to help them commit suicide.

731
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,060
Get your horse, Doc.

732
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,521
Look what<i>'</i>s comin<i>'.</i>

733
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:51,524
Play dead.

734
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,467
Get your gear
and a horse, Warshaw.

735
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:09,944
You<i>'</i>re under arrest.

736
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,479
For what?

737
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:18,714
Get his horse.

738
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,449
Put a blanket roll on it.

739
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,753
But for why?

740
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,628
For felonious assault
and murder...

741
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,592
...to Virgil and Morgan Earp.

742
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,071
I didn<i>'</i>t do either of those.

743
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:43,435
You were seen.

744
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,847
Well, I swear to you
I didn<i>'</i>t do <i>'</i>em.

745
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:51,348
What did you do?

746
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:57,787
I only watched
to see that no one came.

747
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,294
From the barbershop?

748
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,263
Around the corner
from your brother Virgil only.

749
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,834
I wasn<i>'</i>t in the barbershop
with the guns.

750
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,062
What did you do
when Morgan was shot?

751
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,709
Again, I only watched.

752
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,673
Where?

753
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,243
In the alley
behind the billiard parlor.

754
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,349
Why<i>'</i>d you watch?

755
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:39,167
Well... to see that the men
with the guns were left alone.

756
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,900
Clanton pay you for that?

757
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:46,006
Well, sure.
He always pays me.

758
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,305
I work here for Clanton.

759
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:49,538
What<i>'</i>d he pay?

760
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,776
Oh, hell.
If I told you that...

761
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:55,840
What<i>'</i>d he pay?

762
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,049
He paid...

763
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:02,214
...$50 to me.

764
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:11,193
Before or after?

765
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:16,398
After.

766
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,737
Clanton ain<i>'</i>t so free
with his money.

767
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,713
A man<i>'</i>s life... $50.

768
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,532
I<i>'</i>m gonna give you a chance
to make another $50.

769
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,264
I don<i>'</i>t want such a chance.

770
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,263
My men<i>'</i>ll stay back.

771
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:55,240
I<i>'</i>m gonna count,
<i>"</i>One, two, three<i>."</i>

772
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:59,440
You can draw on two,
I<i>'</i>ll wait till three.

773
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:05,176
If you get me,
my boys won<i>'</i>t bother you.

774
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,622
Who knows?
Maybe...

775
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:11,291
Maybe Clanton<i>'</i>ll pay you
another $50.

776
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,226
Wyatt, he can plug you.

777
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:15,230
He<i>'</i>s too scared.

778
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:18,358
For God<i>'</i>s sake, Wyatt,
you got men watching you.

779
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,230
He<i>'</i>s gonna draw first.

780
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,173
I don<i>'</i>t wanna shoot anybody.

781
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:31,435
I didn<i>'</i>t shoot.
I only watched.

782
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,383
$50...
to see my brother shot.

783
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,614
One. Two. Three.

784
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:03,472
Take him back to his boss.

785
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,952
Well, it<i>'</i>s the end of the line.

786
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,449
Sorry about the reward money.

787
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,628
You don<i>'</i>t hear
any complaints, do ya?

788
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:55,459
I owe you money.

789
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:59,157
You don<i>'</i>t have call
to talk to us like that, Wyatt.

790
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,068
I<i>'</i>m sorry, Sherman.

791
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,639
I wanna thank you boys.

792
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,525
Boy, you sure gave him a chance.

793
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:30,862
I<i>'</i>d just blown his head off
as he lay in bed.

794
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,140
You better have one.

795
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,546
- I don<i>'</i>t need it.
- Oh, yes, you do.

796
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:51,781
You need it to make this morning
stay down, just like I do.

797
01:14:57,293 --> 01:15:00,785
God... when I think back...

798
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,195
Five minutes after we left
the OK Corral,

799
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,996
I wanted to say,
<i>"</i>Get Clanton, Wyatt.

800
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,401
Get him before he gets you<i>."</i>

801
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:09,961
But I didn<i>'</i>t.

802
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:13,372
You don<i>'</i>t...
speak that way to Wyatt Earp.

803
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:16,344
You got too much respect for him.

804
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:20,246
Then Virgil got it...
and then Morgan...

805
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:25,243
And I watched you keep your word
to that waiter back in Tombstone.

806
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:28,518
You thought it was your honor that
stopped you from making him testify,

807
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:29,922
but it wasn<i>'</i>t.

808
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,984
You couldn<i>'</i>t get a conviction
in a Federal court or a local one,

809
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,893
and you never intended to try!

810
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,626
You just didn<i>'</i>t wanna be
cheated out of this!

811
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:41,159
And those aren<i>'</i>t warrants
you got there.

812
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:45,298
Those are hunting licenses...
Stilwell, Spence...

813
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,673
That was a pretty good shot
you made at Brocius. God!

814
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,736
That<i>'</i>s when I hooked it all together.

815
01:15:50,813 --> 01:15:53,509
And now Warshaw,
and then you<i>'</i>re gonna get Clanton.

816
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,847
You<i>'</i>re gonna kill Clanton
just like I would,

817
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,682
and you don<i>'</i>t need
a warrant for that.

818
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:02,156
So go on.
Go on, have one.

819
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:06,025
If you<i>'</i>re gonna kill like me,
you might as well drink like me!

820
01:16:31,854 --> 01:16:33,344
That<i>'</i>s all right.

821
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,151
This stops.

822
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,631
I<i>'</i>m taking you to Colorado.

823
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:51,036
Sorry to spoil your party.

824
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,345
- Mr. Clanton...
- Don<i>'</i>t tell me. I<i>'</i>ve heard it.

825
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:19,166
Bryan, Earp and the rest of that crowd
will be heading for Colorado by now.

826
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:22,898
Well...
that does it, then.

827
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,303
Doesn<i>'</i>t it?

828
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,242
I mean, he can<i>'</i>t operate
from Colorado.

829
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,642
I expect you to be waiting
at the border for him.

830
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,873
Might be a little tough to do, lke.

831
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:35,611
Your posse outnumbers Earp<i>'</i>s
five to one. What are you worried about?

832
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:38,518
I thought having him out of the way
was all you needed.

833
01:17:38,588 --> 01:17:42,615
I need Wyatt Earp dead and cold,
and nothing seems to get that for me.

834
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,785
I<i>'</i>ve been doing
the best I can, lke!

835
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:46,988
Well, then get back to it!

836
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:49,896
If you don<i>'</i>t get Earp at the border
before he moves into Colorado,

837
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:52,799
I want you to get to the governor
for papers to extradite him!

838
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,131
Where will you be?

839
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,035
I<i>'</i>ll get back to you
when I need you.

840
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:07,207
Something you wanna say?

841
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:12,946
No.

842
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,820
Good morning, Mr. Earp.

843
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,288
Welcome to Denver.

844
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:49,517
Thank you.

845
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:52,654
302.

846
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,060
I put you in the room
next door to your friends.

847
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,060
Thank you.

848
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:05,104
Has Bryan got to the governor?
Have I been extradited? What?

849
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,573
Bryan<i>'</i>s finished.

850
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,339
Who managed that?

851
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,105
Well, Bryan and Clanton
had over a hundred men between them.

852
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:14,740
Clanton left town...

853
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:18,210
...and we bought
the rest of the men off.

854
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,380
You bribed them?

855
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,516
I wouldn<i>'</i>t put it that way,
but if you want to... yes.

856
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,219
Where is Clanton?

857
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:26,818
Mexico.

858
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:28,158
Doing what?

859
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,830
I should judge
stealing cattle, Wyatt.

860
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,232
Prospering?

861
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:35,361
Yes.

862
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,497
What part of Mexico is he in?

863
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,234
Somewhere out of Nogales.

864
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:41,469
Wyatt, we want you
back in Tombstone.

865
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,377
We<i>'</i>ve got an appointment for you
as Chief U.S. Marshal.

866
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,712
We<i>'</i>re growing, Wyatt.
And you can grow with us.

867
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:49,917
Grow to what?

868
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:53,085
Adjutant-General of the territory.

869
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:56,488
That would make you
chief law enforcement officer in Arizona...

870
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:58,891
and that could be
just the beginning for you.

871
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:05,531
Do I have to give you
a yes or no right now?

872
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:09,661
Well, we can<i>'</i>t stall the answer
to Washington for too long.

873
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,777
I<i>'</i>ll have to give you
my answer later, gentlemen.

874
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:19,439
Thanks for the drink.

875
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:22,783
We<i>'</i>ll hear from you?

876
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:25,343
I said you would.

877
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,597
Once again.

878
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,306
How am I?

879
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,640
If you put pipes on those lungs,
you could play a hymn. Terrible.

880
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,876
But I<i>'</i>ve been following your orders...
rest, fresh air, fresh eggs...

881
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,109
Go on.

882
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,747
You know, you don<i>'</i>t have
to get well to please me.

883
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,880
I<i>'</i>m used to people dying on me.

884
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,355
So am I!

885
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,925
Don<i>'</i>t laugh too hard.
Those lung scars won<i>'</i>t stand it.

886
01:21:07,797 --> 01:21:09,924
My friend,
if you don<i>'</i>t give up drinking,

887
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:12,160
you<i>'</i>ll go like that.

888
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:16,068
I<i>'</i>ll say this for you...
you got one hell of a bedside manner.

889
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:17,969
Put him back in the icebox.

890
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,199
That<i>'</i>s terrible stuff.

891
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,029
I wouldn<i>'</i>t drink that
if I were you.

892
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,238
Doc.

893
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:01,811
It<i>'</i>s cold out here.

894
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:05,877
I<i>'</i>ll send for blankets and a wheelchair.
I<i>'</i>d like you to try it for a while.

895
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:08,947
Don<i>'</i>t ask for sympathy from me.
You<i>'</i>re doing this to yourself.

896
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,289
Come on, you didn<i>'</i>t come all the way
out here to get on my back.

897
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,124
No...

898
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:20,125
Solomon and a few of the others
were back at the hotel when I got there.

899
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:21,863
I have to go back to Tombstone.

900
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,529
They extradited you?

901
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,176
No. They want me
to be Chief U.S. Marshal.

902
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:30,007
Well...

903
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:33,674
Are they gonna give you enough
manpower to operate against Bryan?

904
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:35,478
Bryan is finished.

905
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:36,882
And Clanton?

906
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,981
He<i>'</i>s high-tailed it for Mexico.

907
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,216
How'd they swing all this?

908
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,883
They bought their men off.

909
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,457
You approve?

910
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:47,860
It<i>'</i>s done.

911
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,524
If it<i>'</i>s so easy,
why didn<i>'</i>t they do it before?

912
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,328
Too expensive.

913
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:56,235
That<i>'</i>s what I like
about your friends... idealists.

914
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,104
Are you gonna take
the marshal<i>'</i>s appointment?

915
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:02,737
Yeah.

916
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,813
You know, this could lead to me being
the Adjutant-General of the territory.

917
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:11,216
I wouldn<i>'</i>t leave you for anything less
than that. I figured you<i>'</i>d understand.

918
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:14,950
I do. I understand. You<i>'</i>re a bigger rat
than I thought you were.

919
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:17,089
Probably.

920
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,791
You gonna be all right here?

921
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:22,695
Yeah, except for
a slight dying spell.

922
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,464
I<i>'</i>ll see you at Tombstone.

923
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:26,865
Absolutely.

924
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:29,666
Hey... listen,
I wanna give this to the doctor.

925
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,797
Oh, no. Here.
Give it to me.

926
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,603
Amazing thing... modern life.

927
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:08,307
I<i>'</i>m going south to Nogales,
you<i>'</i>re going west to Tombstone,

928
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,436
and we<i>'</i>re both on the same train.

929
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:14,510
Train fare was $18.65.

930
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,074
I<i>'</i>m keeping the rest
for expenses.

931
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:20,246
I believed you were going
back to Tombstone.

932
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,722
I did... for about five seconds.

933
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,952
Then it popped into my head...

934
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,187
Clanton.

935
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,995
Still Clanton, isn<i>'</i>t it?

936
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,225
Lay off it, Doc.

937
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,962
You let me have it once...
that<i>'</i>s enough.

938
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:35,970
We don<i>'</i>t have
the only law in the world.

939
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:37,699
They<i>'</i>ve got law in Mexico.

940
01:24:37,773 --> 01:24:39,172
I<i>'</i>m going to the <i>federales,</i>

941
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,574
and if Clanton is operating
down there, I<i>'</i>ll bring him back.

942
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:45,136
The next stop,
you use your expense money.

943
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:48,615
Buy a return ticket
and go take care of yourself.

944
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:00,518
No, thank you.

945
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:35,857
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

946
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:38,263
Hello, Latigo.

947
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:53,147
- He said that...
- Yeah. I know what he said, captain.

948
01:26:13,569 --> 01:26:15,298
Just in case he didn<i>'</i>t tell you,

949
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:17,202
they have tried
to arrest us before.

950
01:26:18,474 --> 01:26:21,739
Yeah, but never for stealing
Mexican government cattle before.

951
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:17,496
Whose cattle?

952
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:23,101
- Whose cattle?
- Clanton.

953
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,409
And you...

954
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,471
Who hired you
to drive these cattle?

955
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:34,811
Clanton.

956
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:42,957
Go get your warrant.

957
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,631
- Lieutenant.
- <i>Senor.</i>

958
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:30,737
<i>Gracias.</i>

959
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,271
- Hello.
- Hello, Captain.

960
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:34,673
Sit down, please.

961
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:39,641
The purpose of my
sending for you is unfortunate.

962
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:41,809
Well, let<i>'</i>s have it.

963
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:44,614
The two witnesses we took
with the cattle this morning

964
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:48,417
are dead one hour ago...
of guns through the bars of the jail.

965
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,651
Those who shot
escaped into the night.

966
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:53,892
And Clanton?

967
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:57,693
We will bring him in to be questioned
as we will find those who killed,

968
01:28:57,766 --> 01:29:01,827
but you understand for Clanton there could
be no arrest under the circumstances.

969
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,201
Yeah, I understand.

970
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:09,210
Without the two witnesses,
there could be no trial.

971
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:13,274
Thank you, Captain.

972
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,016
I tried to notify you
of this immediately

973
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,416
because perhaps you<i>'</i>re now
in some danger.

974
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:20,148
Thanks for your kindness.

975
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:46,003
- Doc?
- Yeah?

976
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,816
You were right
about Warshaw and the others.

977
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:53,477
Now you can be right
about Clanton.

978
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,054
Clanton<i>'</i>s different, Wyatt.

979
01:29:58,427 --> 01:30:00,759
Warshaw was in anger.

980
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:03,320
But you<i>'</i>re planning this one
without the law.

981
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,501
You<i>'</i>re throwing away
all the years you lived by the rules.

982
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:11,132
I don<i>'</i>t care
about the rules anymore.

983
01:30:12,341 --> 01:30:14,673
I<i>'</i>m not that much of a hypocrite.

984
01:30:16,478 --> 01:30:18,537
The whole thing<i>'</i>s hypocrisy.

985
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:20,605
The rules they<i>'</i>ve tacked on say

986
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:24,675
unless you<i>'</i>re wearin<i>'</i> that badge
or a soldier<i>'</i>s uniform, you can<i>'</i>t kill.

987
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,613
But they<i>'</i>re the only rules there are.

988
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:31,849
And they<i>'</i>re more important
to you than you think.

989
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,454
Play it that way, Wyatt...

990
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:38,189
...or you<i>'</i>ll destroy yourself.

991
01:30:39,368 --> 01:30:40,699
I know you.

992
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,101
You can<i>'</i>t live like me.

993
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:48,669
Virg played it by the rules.

994
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:50,575
He<i>'</i>s crippled for life.

995
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,513
Morgan... dead.

996
01:30:57,853 --> 01:31:00,686
I can<i>'</i>t let Clanton
get away with that.

997
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:03,691
I know where to find him...
I<i>'</i>m gonna find him.

998
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,222
Doc...

999
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:12,833
Go back to the hotel.
Take care of yourself.

1000
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:17,437
No, thanks.

1001
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,405
You got some kind of plan?

1002
01:32:34,483 --> 01:32:35,814
I have.

1003
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:39,076
You wanna tell me about it?

1004
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,085
We take whoever gets
in our way.

1005
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:44,783
You call that a plan?

1006
01:32:46,495 --> 01:32:48,156
You got a better one?

1007
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,390
No.

1008
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,788
Morning.

1009
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:17,889
Good morning.
Doc.

1010
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,331
Too bad I<i>'</i>m not feeling better.

1011
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,433
Too bad you don<i>'</i>t listen
to your doctor.

1012
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:33,504
I should<i>'</i>ve listened
to my mother in Baltimore.

1013
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,018
Wyatt?

1014
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:48,693
When we were down
with the <i>federales...</i>

1015
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,630
...when I said about your
not being able to go back, I...

1016
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:58,168
Well, that was talk.

1017
01:38:01,776 --> 01:38:04,040
But I have to know something.

1018
01:38:04,112 --> 01:38:06,103
Are you going back to Tombstone?

1019
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:09,643
Sure.

1020
01:38:11,186 --> 01:38:13,518
Don<i>'</i>t lie to me this time.

1021
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:17,188
I<i>'</i>m going back.

1022
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:21,158
That<i>'</i>s what I had to know.

1023
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,401
Hey, do me a favor,
will you?

1024
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:35,807
Sure, Doc.

1025
01:38:35,877 --> 01:38:37,868
Get outta here.

1026
01:38:37,946 --> 01:38:39,607
Go on. Don<i>'</i>t hang around.

1027
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:45,450
All right, Doc.

1028
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:49,516
Wyatt?

1029
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:51,718
Yeah?

1030
01:38:58,233 --> 01:38:59,632
So long.

1031
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:03,969
So long, now.

1032
01:39:18,486 --> 01:39:21,421
Thank you, Doctor.
I<i>'</i>ll be in touch with you.

1033
01:39:25,894 --> 01:39:28,158
You<i>'</i>ll be in Denver or Tombstone?

1034
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:30,720
I<i>'</i>m not gonna be
in either place, Charles.

1035
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,632
When he...
where will you be?

1036
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:38,800
I don<i>'</i>t know, but I<i>'</i>m not
gonna be in this part of the country.

1037
01:39:38,873 --> 01:39:42,172
Well, Clum told me you got
the appointment... U.S. Marshal.

1038
01:39:43,211 --> 01:39:45,372
I<i>'</i>m not gonna accept it, Charles.

1039
01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:48,576
I<i>'</i>m through with the law.

1040
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:51,141
I wanna thank you
for coming up here.

1041
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,387
So long, Charley.

1042
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:26,613
God! That<i>'</i>s terrible.

1043
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:29,282
Where do you get that stuff?

1044
01:40:34,162 --> 01:40:35,322
Kings.

1045
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:40,794
Aces.
