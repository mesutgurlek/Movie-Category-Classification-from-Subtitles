1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,611
What did you know about me, Bullock?
First we met?

2
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:37,374
- No concern for my feelings, huh?
- That you were a killer.

3
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,517
Certain facts show in the mug.
Look at her.

4
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:48,961
- You know she's fucked for food.
- What's the point?

5
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:51,429
In your mug, there is no such history.

6
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:56,199
Are you a cunt-driven, near-maniac
or a stalwart driven by principle?

7
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:59,714
The many cannot tell, for you yourself
are so fucking confused.

8
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,641
But you do make a good appearance...

9
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,363
so they're prone to grant
you their trust...

10
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,161
which we will use as an asset
in the coming campaign.

11
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,501
What's the campaign?

12
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:11,601
You have friends in Montana in high
positions, some type fucking judge?

13
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,863
- I've cut ties with the judge in Montana.
- Amiably or owing money?

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,959
Maybe you're mistrusted less
as a killer...

15
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,634
than showing your cards
a corner at a time.

16
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:23,271
Our cause is surviving.

17
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,170
Not being allied with Yankton or cogs
in the Hearst machine...

18
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:30,806
to show it don't fate us as runts, or...

19
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,446
two-headed calves or...

20
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,792
pigs with excess legs,
to a good fucking grinding up.

21
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,591
I only mention the judge in Montana...

22
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:40,391
toward maybe drumming up interest
in us there.

23
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:43,022
Annexation to Montana
instead of Dakota?

24
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,830
Hiking our skirts to Helena
might put Yankton back on its heels.

25
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:50,560
And as minutes turn to hours
over the piss-pot, I wonder, should we...

26
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,660
ruminate publicly in loud voices
over forming a new territory...

27
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:58,129
with an eye towards future statehood,
or even our own republic?

28
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,306
No dictatorship?

29
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,690
What the fuck do we need
a dictatorship for...

30
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:05,205
that silences the public voice,
that eases the enemy's way?

31
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,759
Noise made, overtures to
outside interests and...

32
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:11,642
enlistment of the hooples' participation
is what this situation demands.

33
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:15,083
And a trustworthy mug
with a vague motive...

34
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,633
out there, bugling the call.

35
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm not interested.

36
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:26,758
Our moment permits interest in
one question only.

37
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,178
Will we, of Deadwood...

38
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,611
be more than target for ass-fucking?

39
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,248
To not grab ankle is to declare
yourself interested.

40
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,524
What's your posture, Bullock?

41
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,784
As you see.

42
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,166
Huzzah, then.

43
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,910
"The operations of
the old Aurora and Keets mines, and...

44
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,679
"a number of smaller adjoining claims,
are now entirely consolidated...

45
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,863
"accessed through the former
hidden-treasure property.

46
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,075
"Anxious as I know you to be,
Mr Hearst...

47
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,498

48

49
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,862
"the matter of Chinese labour remains
delicate of introduction.

50
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:15,373
"And we must therefore rest content
with Germans...

51
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,883
"and Cornish unwilling to work at night.

52
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:20,192
"We shower them after every shift...

53
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,613
"and the gold they've combed into
their hair with grease...

54
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:26,553
"we recover from the traps installed
beneath the wash-house facility.

55
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,524
"The Cornish are quicker than
the Germans but...

56
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,774
"ever ready to combine and complain.

57
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,783
"And deserve their reputation
as high-graders...

58
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,125
"which, if anything, is understated."

59
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,510
"Through the vigilance of
our security fellows...

60
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,352

these cunning and...

61
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,908
"clannish men is held

62
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:45,211
"I cite in particular the effectiveness
of Captain Turner...

63
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:48,940
- "invaluable to us since the Comstock."
- Watch it!

64
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:53,453
"With purchase of the claim formerly
operated by the Manuel brothers...

65
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:56,891
"we will control, save one,
the Garret property...

66
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,602
"every considerable deposit

67
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,490
"I am told your arrival is imminent,
Mr Hearst.

68
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:06,132
"I look forward to showing you every
aspect of what I believe soon may be...

"Francis Wolcott."

72
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,191
No one is with child.
Tessie may have clap.

73
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:21,488
We'll take her off the firing line, then.

74
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:25,261
With whatever intervening supervision...

75
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,473
I take it these new-arrived
Chinese whores...

76
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,280
- to be under your control?
- Well-evaluated, Doc.

77
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,179
I'd be available to see to their care,
like I do these here.

78
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,317
Declined, with thanks.

79
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:41,999
You may not be aware
that beyond their afflictions...

80
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:44,800
these girls are fucking starving to death.

81
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,447
I ain't one, Doc, holds the white man's
as the sole and only path.

82
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,046
I strive to tolerate what
I may not agree with...

83
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:58,693
but those people's culture,
their women are disposable.

84
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:03,007
They ship them unfed,
replace them when they expire.

85
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:08,526
They dose them with opium, I know,
which I gather eases their pangs.

86
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,120
Well, under this arrangement...

87
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,548
I withdraw my care for your whites.

88
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,405
- For Christ's sake, Doc!
- No, I need to live, too!

89
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:23,377
Raise your rates on these, then. Don't
disrupt the other fucking equilibrium.

90
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:27,107
I would see to those others pro bono.

91
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:31,039
I know what that means.
Prove to me you do.

92
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,599
- It won't cost you anything.
- Well, Jesus Christ.

93
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,877
Here, too, let me tolerate
a different point of view.

94
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:02,043
- Studying on a getaway, Tom?
- Ain't she a beauty, Al?

95
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,017
In the French, it's called a velocipede...

96
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:07,522
meaning "go swiftly into the world."

97
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:09,747
This is the gent's Boneshaker model...

98
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,416
and the French can stay
the fuck out of it.

99
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,389
How's that for a contraption, boss?

100
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,863
Someone from Farnum, that...

101
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,671
cunt with the long kraut moniker.

102
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:23,767
E. B. Ain't been over for coffee.

103
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,983
Should I ask if Farnum's
come for coffee...

104
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,451
before I get you to summon that cunt?

105
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,889
Dead and without a body...

106
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:37,482
you still outstrip him for intelligence.

107
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,831
Would you please know
Mr A. W. Merrick?

108
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,551
- I'm A. W. Merrick.
- Good.

109
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,626
I'm Blasanov...

110
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:53,647
agent for Cheyenne and
Black Hills Telegraph Company.

111
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,228
- Welcome, Mr Blasanov.
- Thank you.

112
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,289
Can you show me immediately to
my apparatus?

113
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,175
Our long-anticipated telegraph operator.

114
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,363
Your company, having leased space for
you in my office, your apparatus, sir...

115
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:11,547
is next to mine, and I will show it to you
with pleasure. This way.

116
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:19,583
Has my apparatus been... Thank you.
Been guarded from interference?

117
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:24,109
In candour, Mr Blasanov, some nights
more successfully than others.

118
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,697
There's a fucking pair to draw to.

119
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:32,180
I hope the electrical fluid is not
blistered with fierce voltage, someone...

120
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:36,702
- foolish to ground its potential.
- I'm not aware of any blistering...

121
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,002
and my hopes in that regard
may be different from yours.

122
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,224
Did you see my bicycle, young man?

123
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,278
They call that type bone-shaking, sir.

124
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,496
They do, for a mortal truth.

125
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,031
Look at it this way, then.
Mightn't the Lord give second chances?

126
00:08:56,873 --> 00:09:00,170
Not on merit, necessarily.
I ain't claiming that.

127
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,980
Say he does it on whim, on any basis.

128
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:06,491
And here she comes...

129
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,504
with that little one beside her
and another she fixes to produce.

130
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,811
And keenness to
my shortcomings don't...

131
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:17,582
blind me to seeing a-right,
that when a boulder needs hauling...

132
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,382
I will haul a boulder,
which is asset to a woman...

133
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:25,704
with a child in her care
and another she readies to deliver.

134
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,256
Now, what harm is there in believing...

135
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,867
that not taking a chance might be
a confounding of His will?

136
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:41,051
I'm taking that silence for
fucking support.

137
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,369
- Mrs Bullock.
- Thank you so much for seeing us.

138
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,805
- Good morning, William.
- Good morning, Mrs Garret.

139
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,854
Please, come in.

140
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,539
It smells awful nice in here.

141
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,928
We had berry tea
before Sofia's lesson.

142
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,145
Will you have some?

143
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:05,498
- Please, if it's not a trouble.
- I don't want any, thank you.

144
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:08,130
I didn't know the smell was from tea.

145
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:13,952
Will you show William your corner
in our other room, Sofia?

146
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,792
Not your toys.
Show him only your books.

147
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:19,056
Thank you.

148
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:24,248
And thank you for the candy
when I first got to camp.

149
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,126
Please, forgive the suddenness
of my coming.

150
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,210
Not at all, Mrs Bullock.

151
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:40,234
I feel an urgency about the matter
which brings me.

152
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,684
Please tell me what it is.

153
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,441
You know that Miss Stokes...

154
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,330
the teacher for whom
we'd waited so long...

155
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,797
Has fled.

156
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:57,264
Yes.

157
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:01,441
A great disappointment to me,
as I'm sure it was to you.

158
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:04,253
I hope I'm...

159
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,969
adequate to guiding my son's studies.

160
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,272
I believe I am...

161
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,456
but a child in solitude cannot find
his gift for society.

162
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,218
What do you propose?

163
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:20,060
That I teach the camp's children.

164
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:41,533
The water is usually brought from
the kitchen, already at a boil.

165
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:44,800
- Please don't bother with the tea.
- It's no bother.

166
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:48,474
It would hardly be a bother,
if I were only properly prepared.

167
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:56,596
On a second opportunity, with adequate
notification, we will meet you in order...

168
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:57,935
and readiness.

169
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:01,912
I seem always to come upon you
with inadequate notice.

170
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,846
As you remarked,
simple courtesy would forestall that.

171
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,857
I'm trying to imagine
what courtesy of mine...

172
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:13,413
would have forestalled
the last awkwardness between us.

173
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:22,956
Do you wish, then, to take Sofia
under your care as well?

174
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,385
As well as whom, Mrs Garret?

175
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,944
Why, Mrs Bullock, as well as your son.

176
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:32,456
Whom else would I mean?

177
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,303
Good morning.

178
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,539
Good morning, Mr Swearengen.
Excuse me. Change of light.

179
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:44,180
Pupils slow adjusting,
hope that don't owe to morphine.

180
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,180
- No.
- Anyhow, thanks for...

181
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:48,069
brushing against my prick.

182
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,199
May I sit down?

183
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:54,804
Too early for you?

184
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,892
- I don't time my drinking.
- Dan!

185
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:03,762
$50,000. Now, to me.

186
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,610
Mr Dority signs for the murder of
Brom Garret...

187
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,741
on my orders, as commissioned by
his faithless wife.

188
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,338
Second document, signed by you.

189
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:16,901
Detailing during transport to New York
for trial, along with faithless wife...

190
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,993
Dority escapes custody.

191
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,799
$50,000, now to me. $10,000...

192
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,847
now you to Dority.
$10,000, now you to Adams.

193
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,116
Agreed, with these amendments.
$25,000 to you on signatures...

194
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,038
on Dority's safe return
following his escape...

195
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,478
and by your giving over the document...

196
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,691
signed by me to an agent
designated by Pinkerton...

197
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:40,828
or burning it in the agent's presence...

198
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,172
the second $25,000.

199
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:46,529
- Agreed.
- Will you draft Dority's confession?

200
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,863
I'll draft both fucking documents.

201
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,556
Now, would you find your own way out...

202
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,269
while I explain myself to the guilty party?

203
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,989
You want to brush agin my prick?

204
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,937
Got a good fucking head
on her shoulders...

205
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,575
unlike some other parties in this room.

206
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,602
That's some kind of contraption
you got there.

207
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:17,488
Do you suppose had the inventor
moved among us...

208
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:20,840
he'd have made a model more
suited to sinkholes?

209
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:24,979
Guided and pedalled a-right, she'll
roll smooth as a ball on a green.

210
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:28,540
Yours ain't the fucking hands
or the fucking feet.

211
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:33,557
So, this is the famous place of death.

212
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,152
At that very table, Mr Blasanov...

213
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:40,002
- Wild Bill Hickok was shot.
- I've read the account...

214
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,965
perhaps from your hand?

215
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,639
My bicycle...

216
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:47,451
masters Boardwalk and Quagmire
with aplomb.

217
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,887
Those that doubt me
suck cock by choice.

218
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,650
Does that signal a willingness
to wager?

219
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,299
You're goddamn right,
in specie or fucking currency.

220
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:04,266
Surely odds must differ between
Quagmire and Boardwalk.

221
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,287
I don't speak of
the Quagmire lengthwise.

222
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,839
Well, shall Quagmire be the Bella
Union gap of the main thoroughfare?

223
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,098
Done.

224
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:16,697
- 8-to-1 odds on the Quagmire.
- I shall swoop across it.

225
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:21,132
- 8-to-1 taken to 100.
- Even money on the Boardwalk.

226
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:25,316
Done! Taken to 100.
Loose boards to be nailed...

227
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:28,746
commerce suspended,
animals, drunks and sundries...

228
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,221
- cleared from my lane of passage.
- Done.

229
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:34,729
May I have time to
ready my camera, Tom?

230
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,116
- Get going.
- I'll make fresh plates...

231
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,088
- and a new stop-bath.
- Whatever the fuck that means.

232
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:43,107
- Come, Mr Blasanov.
- What has just happened?

233
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,704
Those who doubt me
suck cock by choice.

234
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:58,420
I had time only to make
cold meat sandwiches...

235
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,721
after seeing Mrs Garret.

236
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:05,025
- Fine.
- Ice-cold cider in the cellar.

237
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,036
I'll get it.

238
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:14,572
She thought it wonderful that
I should teach the camp's children.

239
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,624
- Good.
- Wonderful.

240
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:23,901
Poor woman.

241
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,714
Husband killed, left alone.

242
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,904
Any person would have found
her situation sympathetic...

243
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,835
let alone someone of your instincts.

244
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:47,588
- Mr Nuttall has received a bicycle.
- Has he?

245
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:51,980
- William was very excited to see it.
- Good.

246
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,325
Your food is ready.

247
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,307
He's out back waiting. William is.

248
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:22,228
- That's mighty good for business.
- Shut up!

249
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:29,342
There's a girl sitting by herself
in that whorehouse...

250
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,018
Joanie Stubbs.

251
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:34,835
Next you see her,
give her my congratulations.

252
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,272
Seeing you know about losing friends...

253
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:44,074
you might be a good person to go on
and talk to her.

254
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:47,047
How does standing in my own puke...

255
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:50,849
prompt you to volunteer me to give
a condolence call?

256
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,283
Why fucking wouldn't it, Jane?

257
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:57,131
You like being situated how you are?

258
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:03,287
What fucking friends
did she lose, anyway?

259
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,146
How are Martha and William?

260
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,330
Well.

261
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:29,149
What would you think of Marcus' lot,
Seth, as location for the bank?

262
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,486
I could see arguments in favour.

263
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,496
He's going back to Bismarck.

264
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,313
Asking $14,000, 10 of which he'd carry
at 1% a month, which I find reasonable.

265
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,495
Obviously, the location's its great virtue.

266
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:45,675
Under all the circumstances, I disagree.

267
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,660
- Too central?
- Not too central, no.

268
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,712
I'm thinking more the chief backer
might find unpleasant...

269
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,899
- this building being always in her view.
- I see.

270
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,908
Anything further you need explained
chapter and verse?

271
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:03,924
I hadn't understood the matter
continued so tender.

272
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,473
It ain't tenderness, avoiding provocation.

273
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,562
It's common fucking courtesy.

274
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:11,369
Which neither of you is showing
fucking much toward me.

275
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,540
It's over.

276
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,142
It's finished!

277
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,346
You've got the worst brother, Mose...

278
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,065
as ugly as he is,
that miserable a disposition.

279
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,503
Mr Manuel, how are you, sir?

280
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,064
Fuck you, Tolliver,
your crooked games...

281
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,410
- and your watered-down liquor.
- Francis Wolcott, Mr Manuel.

282
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:44,847
- Thank you for coming.
- State your business.

283
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,148
An admirable rigour in manner.

284
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,953
Would you join me, please?

285
00:19:55,688 --> 00:20:00,699
Do I guess rightly, sir, that you and
your brother do not deal happily with...

286
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,209
- groups of men?
- Nor each other.

287
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,433
Yet you have made a rich find
and have done...

288
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:09,485
- very well in beginning its development.
- State your business.

289
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:13,842
Further development may require
organisation on a scale and...

290
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:17,694
dealings with men to which you and
your brother are not suited...

291
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:19,616
or not disposed to attempt.

292
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,587
With thieving bastard Cornishmen,
you mean?

293
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:26,272
Underground in the shafts,
high-graders every one of them.

294
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:29,240
The interests I represent have learned
to deal effectively...

295
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,508
over the years with high-grading
and other forms of theft by employees.

296
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:37,022
You ain't learned no effective method
when it's my brother going against you.

297
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,280
Against us in what sense?

298
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,715
In all five fucking senses.

299
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:44,352
More reason you and he might sever...

300
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,602
connections toward taking
separate paths.

301
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,827
I'm sitting here, ain't I?

302
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,643
We would offer $200,000 for
an undivided ownership on your claim.

303
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:55,643
We'd both have to fucking sell.

304
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,531
I'd presume your brother
has stays and...

305
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,867
encumbrances on your right
to separate sale?

306
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:03,472
He's encumbered every fucking breath
I've ever fucking taken.

307
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,777
$200,000?

308
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:09,620
Would it expedite matters if I made
our case to your brother?

309
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:13,389
I'll make the fucking case,
once I find the saloon he's in.

310
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,740
He should understand that our patience
is not inexhaustible.

311
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,824
- Did I say I thought that?
- No.

312
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:21,596
- Don't tell me how to talk to my brother!
- Certainly not.

313
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,678
Unless you're trying to
fucking irritate me!

314
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,521
Opposite of my intention.

315
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:31,508
- $200,000?
- Cash.

316
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,380
- Mrs Garret.
- Why do you linger?

317
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:03,854
The stages are frequent,
and you're past your stated purpose.

318
00:22:03,942 --> 00:22:07,285
- Have you another?
- Please, Mrs Garret, do come in.

319
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:16,192
Do you believe I do?

320
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:20,216
My beliefs about you have to do with
your soul...

321
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:25,693
which I feel is cold and ungenerous,
unless you are a counterfeit.

322
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,508
And if you are a counterfeit,
the deception comes so naturally...

323
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:34,773
I'd credit its source in such a soul,
meaning cold and ungenerous...

324
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:38,876
and as capable of counterfeit,
manipulative and treacherous as well.

325
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:42,348
Who can you think I am, Mrs Garret?

326
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:45,952
- I, a poor working girl?
- You are not.

327
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:51,092
I only hope your high wroth, ma'am,
don't bespeak some affair gone amiss.

328
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:57,453
I hope to Christ not involving Mr Bullock.

329
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:03,821
Even under such duress,
you oughtn't presume to strike me.

330
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:09,125
For who do you take me, then?
For who do you mistake me?

331
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,989
I mistake you for no one, Miss
Isringhausen, and I know you for a fact.

332
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,875
All right then, Mrs Garret.

333
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:23,144
You've had your fit of temper.
Get the fuck back to your room.

334
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,003
How's his toothache?

335
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,725
I ain't requiring about
his toothache, Richardson.

336
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,980
And you oughtn't be requiring about
his toothache, either.

337
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,537
You ought to be hoping that his nibs
will be sleeping, so...

338
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,305
we can both sneak away
and go watch the ride.

339
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,347
What are you, what are you...

340
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:13,831
- You stupid...
- Mr Farnum, are you in there?

341
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:18,723
I need your permission, Mr Farnum.
I'm coming in.

342
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,162
What's killing you?

343
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:31,020
What's afflicting you?

344
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:36,544
Stop it!
For God's sake, get away from me!

345
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:44,121
I put clove-soaked cloth to my tooth.
I must have gagged on it...

346
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:48,389
- when I was napping.
- Are you saved, sir?

347
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,356
Your filthy hand was down my throat!

348
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,133
May I go out to watch the bicycle?

349
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:01,281
Watch the earth yielding up its dead,
so long as it's not near me!

350
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:05,957
And never violate
my private office again!

351
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,653
That cocksucker.

352
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:16,261
What do you think of that, Chief?
Some kind of fucking division of...

353
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,731
feeling? Yeah?

354
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:25,124
If I'm overstepping, boss, I apologise.

355
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,558
I'm waiting.

356
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,046
Sometimes I hear you speaking
in here...

357
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,975
when I know there's nobody
in here but you.

358
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:40,951
You have not yet reached the age,
Dan, have you...

359
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,760
where you're moved to
utterance of thoughts...

360
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:49,026
- properly kept silent?
- Been known to mutter.

361
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:53,290
Not the odd mutter.
Habitual fucking vocalising of...

362
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,593
thoughts best kept to yourself.

363
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,269
I will confide further.

364
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:01,654
Lately...

365
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:05,638
I talk to this package.

366
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,606
The severed, rotting head...

367
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:13,543
I paid bounty on last year
of that murdered fucking Indian.

368
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,324
Well, anyways, it's the late shift.

369
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:25,757
You subscribe one way or another to
Tom Nuttall's big ride?

370
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:30,077
No. I don't see him making it,
but I didn't want to root agin him.

371
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,136
The Indian got an opinion?

372
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,748
Don't the decapitated
deserve recreation, Chief?

373
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,591
As much, if not more so,
than those of us yet not dismembered.

374
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,884
You, fucking Chief,
are uglier than before...

375
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,062
when you were also
not a treat to the eyes.

376
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,797
Suffer the low vantage.

377
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,028
It's better for my standing in the camp.

378
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:29,245
That is a lay-down you propose!

379
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:36,058
Corruption won't never breathe stinky
on my bicycle!

380
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:39,281
Sent many of your friends to
the happy hunting ground.

381
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:43,258
Formidable, Tom was, and no more
a fool now than time shows us all.

382
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:47,232
Using the smallest possible aperture,
Mr Blasanov...

383
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:52,507
and the fastest shutter speed,
our endeavour is to capture...

384
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:56,814
Mr Nuttall's attempt
in all its vigour and velocity.

385
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,755
- We got to sell this claim, Charlie.
- Why?

386
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:05,059
'Cause if we don't,
we're going to fuck it up.

387
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:06,652
Speak for yourself.

388
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:20,718
Speaking for myself, if we don't sell,
you're going to fuck it up.

389
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,393
Speak for yourself.

390
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:33,893
Come on, Tom.

391
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:48,286
Go on, my son!

392
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,642
He made it, Chief.

393
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:20,089
My brother had an accident.

394
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:23,775
- What's his condition now?
- Fatal. Dead.

395
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:27,742
- Fatal gunshot.
- So, an accident.

396
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,970
Handling his weapon.
A self-inflicted wound.

397
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,170
Fucking stupid, showing off when
he's been fucking drinking.

398
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:43,312
Or a stupid fucking trick,
more than one fucking time he'd do that.

399
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:47,789
- For Christ's sake.
- Are there other kin, Mr Manuel?

400
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,727
- There's just us.
- Mother and father dead, no siblings...

401
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:54,237
- What did I just fucking say to you?
- Do you accept our offer...

402
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,504
as your brother's sole heir and
agent of your own interests?

403
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:01,690
$200,000.

404
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:05,239
- Cash upon execution.
- We already executed.

405
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:18,132
Jane Cannary! Jane Cannary coming in.

406
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,817
- Hello!
- Closed.

407
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,036
I ain't here for any funny business.

408
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,432
My name's Jane Cannary.

409
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,899
You and me got a pain-in-the-balls
mutual acquaintance...

410
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:36,044
- Charlie fucking Utter.
- How do you do, Jane?

411
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:38,471
Joanie Stubbs.

412
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:45,585
Would you like a drink?

413
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:50,553
Yes! But my opening position is no.

414
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,820
I'm having a drink, Jane.

415
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:56,884
I'll probably join you directly.

416
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:04,283
Charlie says you lost your friends.

417
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,171
Yes.

418
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:13,150
- I don't guess it was plague.
- No.

419
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:17,880
Fucking violence, probably.

420
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:27,801
I worked a plague tent last year.

421
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:31,773
People spoke of the good you did.

422
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,453
Some left the tent upright.

423
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:38,133
Maybe I will have a fucking drink...

424
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:42,697
just for sociability's sake
and 'cause I'm a fucking drunk.

425
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:44,751
Well, what's your preference?

426
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,021
That it ain't been previously swallowed.

427
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:52,452
Bourbon, if you got it.

428
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,001
Bourbon from Kentucky.

429
00:31:56,094 --> 00:31:58,427
I should certainly fucking hope so.

430
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,371
Thank you.

431
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:09,808
Murdered? Your friends?

432
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:14,245
It's best probably not to talk about it.

433
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:16,504
If we held to that rule, we'd be...

434
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,660
mute like monks
months at a fucking time.

435
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,512
Three of them murdered.

436
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:31,201
Others shooed from camp
so they wouldn't be.

437
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:37,093
I heard of a beating
Charlie Utter dispensed to some...

438
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:40,648
cocksucker yesterday.
I wonder if that's connected.

439
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,917
I wouldn't be surprised.

440
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:47,091
Yes.

441
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,716
Does he pose a further danger to you,
the cocksucker?

442
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:57,552
Is that what's got you sitting in the dark?

443
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:00,273
Sitting count as waiting?

444
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:07,268
I'll say that's an attitude fit for darkness.

445
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:11,283
Not knowing what else to say...

446
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,002
or pretending that it ain't familiar.

447
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:18,604
Anyways, I'm fuck...

448
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,110
I'm pleased to meet you,
pleased to meet you.

449
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:25,220
- Pleased to meet you, Jane.
- All right.

450
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:31,413
Thank you for coming by.
Don't you want your drink?

451
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:34,421
I guess I'll leave it.

452
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,317
Refined spirits will sometimes
convulse me.

453
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:15,687
- Mr Ellsworth.
- I was hoping for a word.

454
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,568
As many as you'd like.

455
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:29,243
- Is your purpose clandestine?
- Private, as far as that goes.

456
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:33,305
Sofia's taking her nap.

457
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,617
Let me get you a better chair.

458
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,599
Would it speak ill of me that
I'm comfortable here?

459
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:56,112
The other morning, you was...

460
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:57,994
indisposed.

461
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:01,378
I regret having imposed
that on your attention.

462
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:03,972
I had a wife.

463
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:08,786
Took by typhus, and our baby girl.

464
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:12,346
- I'm so sorry, Mr Ellsworth.
- Thank you.

465
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:16,731
Anyways, I'm acquainted with certain...

466
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,749
experiences.

467
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:24,555
- Throwing up mornings, as an example.
- I see.

468
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:29,116
And I'd say, not claiming credentials...

469
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:31,045
for raising a family, as...

470
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,728
my time with them was...

471
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,482
brief.

472
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,998
But I'd hope it'd testify to willingness...

473
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:43,350
as a candidate for...

474
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:45,819
marriage, and so forth.

475
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:49,964
Offering myself.

476
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:59,329
Completing the sorry presentation.

477
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:09,421
I'm deeply grateful for your proposal.

478
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:17,916
May I ask a brief interval before
giving you my answer?

479
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:20,544
Long as you like.

480
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,946
- It will give me time to get up.
- I'll ask...

481
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:29,754
a little longer than that,
and some solitude.

482
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,352
Of course.

483
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:40,342
Thank you very much, Mr Ellsworth.

484
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,316
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,371
- Is the boy warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.

486
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,607
This roof over our heads, Mr Bullock...

487
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:17,416
testifies to your care for
William and me.

488
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,599
The fostering affection and guidance...

489
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:25,530
you show my son
to shape him into a man...

490
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,583
will only deepen my gratitude to you.

491
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,443
As for myself...

492
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:37,707
no further demonstrations
are necessary as...

493
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:41,228
other duties claim your attentions.

494
00:37:41,944 --> 00:37:45,120
None such as you conceive
since your arrival...

495
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:48,968
nor will they again,
whatever the state of our relations.

496
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:54,698
Do not sacrifice further
on my account, Mr Bullock.

497
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:02,067
I reject the offering. I repudiate it.

498
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,369
I find it poisonous.

499
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:28,049
Not the eyesore of my previous visit?

500
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,031
Ah, Al, welcome. Yes, yes.
Tidied and reconstituted...

501
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,084
prompted in no small measure,
I might add, by your...

502
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:38,424
very much appreciated exhortation.

503
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,279
I just jotted a few fucking thoughts
down for your perusal.

504
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,081
In what regard?

505
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:46,881
Well, peruse it,
and you'll fucking find out.

506
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:51,358
What the fuck is this?

507
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,419
That is a telegraph apparatus,
whose operator, Mr Blasanov...

508
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,974
presently is taking the air.

509
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:03,446
"Sheriff Bullock would not confirm
having met with representatives...

510
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,801
"from the Montana territory
to discuss their offer of annexation."

511
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:12,198
- Is this true, Al?
- Did he fucking confirm it to you?

512
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:14,917
- I haven't spoken to Bullock.
- So...

513
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,755
then I guess it ain't confirmed.

514
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:21,280
Answer me this fucking question.
Why in fuck...

515
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,289
do I find out about
this telegraph operator...

516
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,926
arriving tardily and by accident?

517
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:31,186
I wasn't aware that you were owed
official notification.

518
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:35,045
Merrick, you and me are allies...

519
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:39,437
marching into battle together,
and aren't smart-assed...

520
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:43,121
replies amongst allies
a waste of fucking time?

521
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,059
Allies? Marching?

522
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:51,735
"Allies? Marching?"
Is exactly fucking right.

523
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:54,590
And this operator hitting camp is big.

524
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:57,263
The main dereliction is Farnum's...

525
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,815
whose bailiwick specifically is
new arrivals.

526
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:03,664
But you have also been fucking remiss.

527
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:08,474
What battle are we marching toward
in formation of some sort, Al?

528
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:13,249
I purchased a sleeping equipment.

529
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,431
Mr Blasanov, Mr. Swearengen.

530
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,414
How do you do, Mr Swearengen?

531
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:26,131
All right, Blasanov. That's some
pronounced fucking accent you've got.

532
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:27,939
I am Russian.

533
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:33,125
Now, you could have waited saying that
before I was fucking seated, huh?

534
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:37,051
Mr Swearengen was
keenly interested to hear...

535
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:39,861
that you're the camp's
telegraph operator.

536
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,880
- How do you do?
- Oh, no, no, no. How do you do?

537
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:49,357
You are the master of
the fucking secret code...

538
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,829
and all the other fucking
secret things, isn't that right?

539
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:56,262
- Not so secret.
- No, that's some fucking skill.

540
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,234
I'm sure people are trying to
bribe you right and left?

541
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:03,715
- No, no. I'm not allowed.
- Nor am I, no.

542
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,266
None of us are.

543
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,993
We are, every one, strictly forbade.
That's the fucking beauty of it all.

544
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:14,429
I think I haven't enough
English for you...

545
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:17,521
- Mr Swearengen.
- Bullshit.

546
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:20,950
You have the perfect,
exact fucking amount.

547
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,292
My only question for you, young man...

548
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:24,969
is your feelings on...

549
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:29,198
your prick being sucked constantly
and without charge, yeah?

550
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:37,478
And thus you encounter one of
our wonderful meaningless...

551
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:41,879
American traditions, Mr Blasanov,
the tall-tale conversation...

552
00:41:42,425 --> 00:41:46,304
and tales and good nature.

553
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,491
The Gem, Blasanov...

554
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:53,337
my saloon. Very convenient to
your place of business?

555
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:56,728
Via private walkway,
which I will employ as we speak...

556
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,819
or by the public thoroughfare.

557
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,668
Visit, and you will experience
a tradition...

558
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,617
only used in this camp or my place...

559
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:13,840
by newly-arrived telegraph operators,
fucking free.

560
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:17,024
Be their preference of tail tall...

561
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:21,921
or fucking otherwise.
And by all means, welcome to America.

562
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:33,515
Evening, Bill.

563
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,206
Jane ain't with me, 'cause she's
a drunken fucking mess...

564
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:42,549
and I don't know what to do about it.

565
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:48,497
I know you want her looked out for,
and I'm doing my fucking best.

566
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,351
But I won't stand before you
claiming optimism.

567
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,997
Other news...

568
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:03,978
That letter you wrote your wife just
before that cocksucker murdered you...

569
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:05,694
it come to my hand.

570
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:10,218
I won't even try explaining fucking how.

571
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:14,983
And knowing what we know about
our fucked-up postal system...

572
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:17,655
I ain't committing it to the fucking mails.

573
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:22,055
You know I'll try to get it to her...

574
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:25,324
which I pray be a portion off your mind.

575
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:31,721
When I've found where she's at...

576
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,900
on my way setting off, I'll tell you.

577
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:42,271
All right. God bless you, Bill.

578
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:48,085
And as far as Jane,
as drunk as you've seen her...

579
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:51,049
you've never seen her this worse.

580
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:54,774
Between us, maybe having lost...

581
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:56,374
wanting to keep on.

582
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:01,472
So I don't know what the fuck to do!

583
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:10,849
But you know I'll... I'll keep trying.

584
00:44:49,474 --> 00:44:51,390
Is this adequate, Mr Manuel?

585
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:54,406
Your brother's mortal remains
are housed inside...

586
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:56,294
under the care of Mr Lee.

587
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:03,108
- Do you speak Chinese?
- I do not, sir.

588
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:05,496
However you accomplish
communication...

589
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,881
with that son of a bitch,
then the more the...

590
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,303
disgrace to your soul!

591
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,582
Are we through here?

592
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:19,220
Can we finally complete
our transaction?

593
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:22,019
It fucking happens,
the fucking gun he was cleaning...

594
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:23,576
when he shot himself was mine.

595
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,458
- Is that so?
- And I'm asking to know if a person of...

596
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:31,691
the mind to blame me will have a way
to recover the fucking bullet?

597
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:35,625
I expect not, Mr Manuel,
or that other than yours...

598
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:39,224
any such mind is in the camp.
And suggest you think of other things...

599
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:40,895
like the money that Mr Tolliver's...

600
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:43,663
waiting to present to you
at the Bella Union.

601
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:48,760
That easy! To forget a fucking brother!

602
00:45:48,935 --> 00:45:51,184
Money has properties in this regard!

603
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,787
Though no remedy is discovered yet...

604
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:57,376
sovereign against sentimental remorse.

605
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:00,773
Close your eyes!

606
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:22,956
It's open.

607
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,765
Do what you came to.

608
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,379
I don't know what I came to do.

609
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,558
Is it easier saying that?

610
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:53,409
The other nights I've known.

611
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:59,358
You're supposed to look out for that
madam, fucking asleep at the switch.

612
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:12,403
Where's fucking Charlie to piss in
my ear when he's fucking needed?

613
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,701
Basil Hayden bourbon,
you were waiting for me.

614
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,511
No, my friend Jane left that.

615
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,919
And you leave me alone!

616
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:40,776
And I got a fucking gun in here, too!

617
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,257
And get the fuck out!

618
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,224
And lock the front fucking door!

619
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:16,010
- Are you the fucking cocksucker?
- I may well be.

620
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:20,364
Did you just kill that girl
in the Chez Ami?

621
00:48:20,457 --> 00:48:23,549
I did not.
That girl in the Chez Ami is well.

622
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:25,717
Well, whose blood's on
your fucking mug?

623
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:29,191
My own. My name is Francis Wolcott.

624
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:31,787
If you find me untrue in any particular...

625
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,044
I stay at the Grand Central Hotel.

626
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:38,319
Who runs that joint?

627
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,456
A grotesque named Farnum.

628
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,979
You ain't lied so far.
