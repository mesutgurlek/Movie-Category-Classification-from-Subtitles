1
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,320
<i>Are you ready to go
back now, Durango?</i>

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,834
All right, mister,
I guess you win.

3
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,684
Oh!

4
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,998
Oh!

5
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,341
You're pretty good,
Marshal.

6
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,887
You want to try again?

7
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,156
No, I had enough.

8
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,299
<i>Looks like the people around
here are sort of hard to convince.</i>

9
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,496
Some of them
couldn't read.

10
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,505
You shoot them all?

11
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,473
Only those
who didn't get hung.

12
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,372
It don't give a man
much choice, does it?

13
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,536
Why didn't you shoot me
when you had the chance?

14
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,705
I'm hired to keep the peace,
not kill people.

15
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,739
It seems like the two of them
sort of go hand in hand.

16
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,876
At least you got
the satisfaction

17
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,887
of knowing you'll
get hung legal.

18
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,321
That might be some
satisfaction to you.

19
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,918
But I can't help thinking
you'll wind up dead either way.

20
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,953
He's bringing him in!

21
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,262
Frame Johnson's bringing in
the Durango Kid!

22
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,136
He's bringing him in!

23
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,636
Frame Johnson's bringing in
the Durango Kid.

24
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,078
<i>Hear that, Denver?
Here comes some new business.</i>

25
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,379
That comes under the heading of old
business. I've been ready for days.

26
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,750
- What about my $2?
- I ain't got time now. I'll be back.

27
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,525
Jeannie! Jeannie!

28
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,190
It's Frame. Frame's back and
he's bringing in the Durango Kid.

29
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,462
Durango Kid?!

30
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,005
Come on, you kids, get
off of there. Come on!

31
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,133
Hurry up!

32
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,341
<i>Make sure he's got some money
in his pocket, Denver.</i>

33
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,211
Hi-yah!

34
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,581
Are you gonna bury him
with his boots on?

35
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,745
Get him before
he gets cold, Denver!

36
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,068
- Where's the Durango Kid?
- That's him.

37
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,970
You mean to say
you brought him back alive?

38
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,598
Well, for the time being.

39
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,109
Now, we've been friends
for a long time, Frame.

40
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,169
But since you cleaned up this
town, I can't hardly make a living.

41
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,807
How do you expect me
to make any money off of him?

42
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,443
Don't worry about it, friend.
You won't have to wait long.

43
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,975
How's the food in your jail?

44
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,648
We haven't kept anybody there
long enough to die from it.

45
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,953
A man can't complain
about treatment like that.

46
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,253
Come on.

47
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,745
Nice looking girl.

48
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,685
Yeah.

49
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,278
Yours?

50
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,755
I like to think so.

51
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,384
Big crowd out today.

52
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,328
We had a better one the day
the governor came through.

53
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,524
Maybe I should've
gone into politics.

54
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,966
Why didn't
Frame kill him?

55
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,704
Seems to me you're old enough
to understand your own brother.

56
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,678
Maybe I ought
to do it for him.

57
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,682
Put that hog leg away
before I make you eat it.

58
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,057
Have any trouble
with him, Frame?

59
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,086
No more than with
anybody else.

60
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
Take the cuffs off of him
and lock him up.

61
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,629
Well, if it's
all right with you

62
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,162
I'll lock him up first
and then take the cuffs off.

63
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,903
Any way you like it, Allie.
I'm going to get cleaned up.

64
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,622
You look about
two shades lighter

65
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,785
than you did when
you started washing.

66
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,920
There isn't enough water
in that desert to drink,

67
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,953
let alone wash in.

68
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,129
Where's Jimmy,
he isn't in trouble, is he?

69
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,830
Not any more
than usual.

70
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,135
He's not like
you and me, Frame.

71
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,300
He was sort of disappointed
when you brought

72
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,310
Durango in alive
instead of killing him.

73
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,507
I guess a lot of other people
seem to feel the same way.

74
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,913
Maybe it's just
because he's young.

75
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,884
Sure, give him time.
He'll grow up.

76
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,521
Have you seen
Jeannie yet?

77
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,853
I wanted to get
some of the dirt off first.

78
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,654
When are you two
getting married?

79
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,423
She seems to think I'd make
a poor risk as a husband.

80
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,430
She could be right
about that.

81
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,591
You've probably got
more people gunning for you

82
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,430
than any other man
in the territory.

83
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,994
Come in.

84
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,140
<i>Come in, Allie.</i>

85
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,075
You better get to the jail.
They're forming a lynch mob!

86
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,441
They're coming
to get Durango.

87
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,843
Get on down there.
I'll be right along.

88
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,404
If you don't mind
I'll go with you.

89
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,745
I'll walk down
with you.

90
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,647
No, if one can't handle this,
two won't do any good.

91
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,142
I'd sure hate to be
in Durango's boots.

92
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,100
I thought you said
I was gonna get hung legal?

93
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,136
- You are.
- That mob don't sound legal to me.

94
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,579
They aren't going
to hang you either.

95
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,810
String him up!

96
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,149
<i>Come on, Marshal!</i>

97
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,678
H... here they come! Maybe the best
thing to do is to let them take him.

98
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,692
Never had a prisoner lynched yet
and I don't intend to start now.

99
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,217
- Bring him out here!
- Bring him out!

100
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,697
<i>We ain't got a chance,
Mr. Johnson!</i>

101
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,429
Allie, why don't you slip out the back
way and get the kid some meat and potatoes?

102
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,460
He hasn't had anything
to eat since sunup.

103
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,530
Thanks.

104
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,010
Luck.

105
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,518
All right, boys,
that'll be enough.

106
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,753
Hurley, you're the mayor of
this town. Tell them to go home.

107
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,159
They won't pay
any attention to me, Frame.

108
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,823
- All we want is Durango.
- You're not going to get him.

109
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,128
- Who says we ain't?
- I do.

110
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,862
He's my prisoner.
I brought him in

111
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,995
to get a fair trial
and he's going to get it.

112
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,972
You wanted law and order
in this town, you've got it.

113
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,942
<i>And you're going to keep on
having it as long as I'm marshal.</i>

114
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,807
I give you my word,

115
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,314
I'll shoot the first man
who starts for those steps.

116
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,180
We've got your brother
out here with us.

117
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,117
What are you going to do
if he starts up?

118
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,017
What are you going
to do about him?

119
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,649
I told you I'll shoot
the first man

120
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,659
that starts
for those steps.

121
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,154
He's bluffing, boys,
let's get him.

122
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,866
The next one gets
a load of buckshot.

123
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,304
Any takers?

124
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,832
Jimmy, get inside.

125
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,539
The rest of you
go on home.

126
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,010
Have Doc Pollard
take a look at that leg, Sam.

127
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,182
Tell him to put it
on my bill.

128
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,542
Tell Lute to start packing
our gear. We're pulling out.

129
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,018
<i>What about your job?</i>

130
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,045
I'm all through.

131
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,023
'Cause I was in
that lynch mob?

132
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,322
That's part of it.

133
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,057
I've been at it too long. I'm tired
of trying to give people something

134
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,463
they don't seem
to want anyway.

135
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,400
- Frame.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,836
Would you have
shot me out there?

137
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,231
I don't know.

138
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,410
Jeannie: No more bets, boys.

139
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,982
Number 17,
black and odd.

140
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,148
Nobody on it.

141
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,725
Your lucky night.

142
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,698
Could be at that.

143
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,894
- Don't press it too far.
- Why not?

144
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,062
I can name you at least
20 people in the room

145
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,095
that wouldn't mind
taking a shot at you.

146
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,573
They had a better chance
a few hours ago.

147
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,603
When are you going to give up,
Frame? Or do you want to die young?

148
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,173
If it comes up 13
I'll buy a wedding ring.

149
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,481
<i>Not while you're
still a marshal.</i>

150
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,749
You'll find the badge
down in the mayor's office.

151
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,484
<i>I turned it in.</i>

152
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,391
I bought a ranch
up in Cottonwood.

153
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,622
I need some help
with the plowing.

154
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,627
Do you need a horse
or a driver?

155
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,635
I've got a horse.

156
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,936
Jeannie:
Well, number 13,

157
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,498
the winner.

158
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,443
I always knew you ran
a crooked game in this joint.

159
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,459
- You leaving town, Denver?
- Yep.

160
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:23,127
I'm going to Cottonwood
with the Johnsons.

161
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,935
Getting so in this town
people only die of old age.

162
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,873
I should think with Frame leaving
town, business might pick up.

163
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,275
Well, if it gets real good,
maybe I'll come back...

164
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,370
if it gets real bad
in Cottonwood.

165
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,058
You can always change
your mind, Frame.

166
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,033
No, I'll send for you
when I get settled.

167
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,059
I'll be here.

168
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,816
This is the hardest riding
rig I've ever been on.

169
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:50,379
The customers I usually
carry don't complain.

170
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,482
What kind of a spread
did you buy up there?

171
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,584
I don't know.
I've never seen it.

172
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,596
Bought a wife
like that once.

173
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,723
She didn't turn out
so good.

174
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,859
I understand this Cottonwood's
sort of a wild town.

175
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,369
I don't aim
to live in town.

176
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,803
Come on, try to miss
some of the holes in the road.

177
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,603
Maybe you'd be more
comfortable riding back there.

178
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,440
That's a ride I've been
dodging for the past 10 years.

179
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,386
Yah, yah!

180
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,932
- Yes, sir.
- Have you got room for them?

181
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,731
I don't know about stalls.
We got a corral out in back.

182
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,933
That'll do. Give them some feed and
water before you turn them loose.

183
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,941
Yes, sir.

184
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,107
What'll it be, gents...

185
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,200
Frame Johnson!

186
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,711
<i>Don't you remember me,
Mr. Johnson?</i>

187
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,509
I'm Ben Wiley.
I used to own

188
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,277
the Black Nugget
in Dodge City.

189
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,876
Ben Wiley,
sure I remember you.

190
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,820
The kind of a place you ran I
never figured you'd live this long.

191
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,288
Quit drinking
my own whiskey.

192
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,257
Courtesy of the house.

193
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,125
<i>Frame: Any place we can bed
down around here for the night?</i>

194
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,129
<i>Ben: I've got some fine beds upstairs.</i>

195
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,994
<i>Number 12, the best room
in the house.</i>

196
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,125
Deal me out.

197
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,240
Johnson...

198
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,472
remember me?
Kurt Durling?

199
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,606
Sure, seven or eight
years ago I ran you

200
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,309
and your whole tribe
out of Abilene.

201
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,683
You left me
with this, too.

202
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,281
Next time don't try
to hide a gun up your sleeve.

203
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,022
- I won't forget it, Johnson.
- Maybe you'd have been happier if I'd killed you.

204
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,656
Maybe some day
you'll wish you had.

205
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,666
Whenever you two
have your showdown,

206
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,895
you tell your relatives
to get in touch with me.

207
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,630
I've got a card here that...

208
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,297
I run this town,
Johnson.

209
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,364
You're not wanted here.

210
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,638
I've been not wanted
in a lot of places.

211
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,906
That never kept me
from staying.

212
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,345
So that's Frame Johnson.

213
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,815
He don't look
so tough to me.

214
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,182
That's how he looked
to a lot of people,

215
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,517
but they're not
around anymore.

216
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,589
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

217
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,187
Give me a hand.

218
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,324
Here's the man
who can help us, Dixon.

219
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,631
Frame Johnson.

220
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,770
Did he say this was
the best room in the house?

221
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,339
You heard him say it.

222
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,977
I hope I never have
to sleep in the worst one.

223
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,419
Who was your
friend downstairs?

224
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,356
- A business acquaintance from Kansas.
- What kind of business?

225
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,586
He dealt in cattle...
other people's cattle.

226
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,220
That gives a high
margin of profit.

227
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,355
It's apt to give a high
rate of mortality, too.

228
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,946
Oh, you can do better
than that, Jed.

229
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,583
<i>- You ain't even nicked him
- Oh no, mister. Please!</i>

230
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,490
What's the matter?
What're you afraid of?

231
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,325
Afraid we can't shoot
straight enough to miss you?

232
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,263
All right, Bart.
That's enough.

233
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,664
Every time you get tanked up
you pick on the poor kid.

234
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,635
You go peddle
your beer.

235
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,073
You've had your fun.
You leave Johnny alone.

236
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,277
I'm tired of you
breaking up my place.

237
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,513
You get out
of my way.

238
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,219
Jed.

239
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,327
Why don't you
come up and get him?

240
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,324
Bart!

241
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,349
What do you want?

242
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,385
Sit down.

243
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,729
When you start a play,
finish it.

244
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,261
I don't want any son
of mine showing yellow.

245
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,570
He run you out
of Abilene, didn't he?

246
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,872
Deal.

247
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,019
Yes, sir. It's a right
lively little town...

248
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,158
for a man of my profession,
of course.

249
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,361
I saw a couple
of jokers down there

250
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,370
that'd make
nice-looking corpses.

251
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,032
Just let me know when
the mood comes over you, Lute.

252
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,271
You get me a job as marshal, Denver,
and we'll drum up a little business.

253
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,278
Shut up.

254
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,371
All of you.

255
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,431
- Martin.
- Oh, it's Mr. Durling.

256
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,600
There's an issue of your paper
coming out today.

257
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,475
Yes, sir, I've just finished
setting the type for it.

258
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,445
Here's an editorial.

259
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,675
Run it on the front page.

260
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:27,048
"It has been called to the
attention of your editor

261
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,815
that a certain
undesirable... "

262
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,050
I... I can't print this,
Mr. Durling.

263
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,218
- I'd get sued.
- You like running a paper in this town, don't you?

264
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,592
- Oh yes, Mr. Durling.
- Print it!

265
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,007
- Hello, Frame.
- Hi.

266
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,636
- See the paper?
- No, I just got up.

267
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,646
It's got
your name in it.

268
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,648
That's right thoughtful
of somebody.

269
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,650
Well, it is
and then again it ain't.

270
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,481
Here, read it.

271
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,613
"Notice to the citizens.

272
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,021
It has been called to the
attention of your editor

273
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,390
that a certain
undesirable character...

274
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,292
has come to Cottonwood.

275
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,127
He is Frame Johnson,
notorious peace officer.

276
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,497
Under the protecting
guise of the law,

277
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,025
this man has murdered
over 40 men in cold blood. "

278
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,662
Ain't you going
to finish it?

279
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,572
I've sort of got
the general idea already.

280
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,872
I didn't know that
you'd killed 40 of them.

281
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,641
Neither did I.
Mind if I keep this?

282
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,580
I'm all through with it.

283
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,463
That's him.

284
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,264
Well, has anybody
talked to him yet?

285
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,998
He just got in town
last night.

286
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,871
Dixon and I thought Judge Williams
was the one to talk to him.

287
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,772
Yeah.

288
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,944
Well, this is a real
pleasure, Mr. Johnson.

289
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,975
Come in.
Have a chair.

290
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,316
We've been expecting you
for some time.

291
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,655
Here's the deed
to your property,

292
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,627
if you'd care to take
a look at it.

293
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,097
- Looks all right to me.
- You've got a fine piece of property, Mr. Johnson.

294
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,225
Good grazing lands...
got a good house on it.

295
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,825
When do you want
to take possession?

296
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,461
Soon as I can find out
where it is.

297
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,870
Reckon it is kind
of important, isn't it?

298
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,635
Now, you're here

299
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,505
in the northwest sector,
close to town.

300
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,534
Right next
to the Durlings.

301
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,014
- Did you say the Durlings?
- Yes, he's an important man in this community.

302
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,211
- Nothing like having important neighbors.
- That's what I always say.

303
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,345
I'd be glad to introduce
you to him at any time.

304
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,947
- Thanks, we've already met.
- Oh, that makes it nice.

305
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,117
Now, you take the main road
west out of town...

306
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,600
There he goes!

307
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,841
Hey, there's your killer!

308
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,247
Go get him!

309
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,420
- They're going to hang me.
- What'd you do?

310
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,552
I killed him. I didn't
know what else to do.

311
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,960
- I've been hiding all night.
- Get him inside, Jimmy.

312
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,965
<i>- It's none of our business,
you know?</i>

313
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,297
- We want Johnny!
- He killed Bart!

314
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,166
- He murdered him.
- Now wait a minute.

315
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,570
You ain't stopping us, mister.
We're going to take him.

316
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:38,303
- The boy's entitled to a trial.
- Get out of the way, Johnson, I want Johnny Benton.

317
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,244
- Haven't you got any law in this town?
- I don't need any law.

318
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,679
- It was my boy that was killed.
- If he was the one

319
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,616
that was bothering the kid last
night, he deserved to be killed.

320
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,142
- Come on.
- Don't come closer, anybody.

321
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,314
What's all the trouble?
What's going on here?

322
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,324
Oh howdy, Kurt.
What's all the ruckus?

323
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,521
Johnny Benton killed Bart.
Johnson's holding him in there.

324
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,654
All right, boys,
I'll take over.

325
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,927
You got any reason
for protecting him, mister?

326
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,332
I'm not protecting him.
I'm holding him for the law.

327
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,030
You can let him go then.
I'm Fin Elder, Sheriff.

328
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,370
- Bring him out, Jimmy.
- You were a little late getting here, Fin.

329
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,341
I can't be
everywhere at once.

330
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,004
- What are you going to do with him?
- Throw him in jail.

331
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,411
Isn't that inviting a
lynching? Why don't you take him

332
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,313
to Elderville?
Wouldn't he be safe there?

333
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,477
That sounds like a good
suggestion, Sheriff.

334
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,420
It's all right with me, but it
seems like a lot of trouble to go to.

335
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,650
You ain't going
to let him take me?

336
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,681
Nothing I can do,
Johnny.

337
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,895
Mr. Johnson,
I'm Judge Williams.

338
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,163
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Well, what about?

339
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,762
I think that's something
we should discuss in private.

340
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,170
Let's go inside.

341
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,198
Get the horses, Jimmy.

342
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,310
Here's the situation,
Mr. Johnson.

343
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,285
This town is a sinkhole
of violence and evil.

344
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,811
The Durlings
control it completely.

345
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,687
They elected
Fin Elder sheriff.

346
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,658
They select the juries
in my court.

347
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,558
Why, it's reached
such a state now

348
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,961
that a decent, honest citizen
doesn't open his mouth.

349
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,898
- I've already seen it.
- Does During own the newspaper, too?

350
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,300
No, but what he can't buy
he gets through intimidation.

351
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,271
This is a perfect example
of what we're up against.

352
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,207
If things are that bad, why don't
you form a vigilance committee?

353
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,837
Except for a few of us, we
aren't sure whom we can trust.

354
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,110
There's another drawback.
If we group as an organization,

355
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,912
the result would be
open warfare.

356
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,885
Many innocent people
might suffer.

357
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,546
Looks like you're
already suffering.

358
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,647
We want a man
who's big enough

359
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,624
to oppose
their organization.

360
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,421
We've decided
you're that man.

361
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,896
I'm sorry, Judge,
I've got other plans.

362
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,593
But we're prepared to pay
any price you ask.

363
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,865
- Money isn't important.
- Aren't people's lives important?

364
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,838
Mine's important to me.

365
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,863
That's why I'm
turning down your offer.

366
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,398
But, Mr. Johnson.

367
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,411
Don't waste
your time, Judge.

368
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,436
He's not going
to change his mind.

369
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,491
Looks like it needs
a little fixing, don't it?

370
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,931
You're pretty handy with
tools, aren't you, Denver?

371
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,561
Well, I hate to brag
but I probably build

372
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,094
the best pine box
west of the Mississippi.

373
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,970
Ever tried your hand
at building a house?

374
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,841
- Not that I can recall.
- Due for a new experience.

375
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,435
<i>Now look here, Frame.</i>

376
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,107
The barn and the corral seem
to be in pretty good shape.

377
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,275
I hadn't counted
on living in the barn.

378
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,444
Let's get back to town.
We can't do anything here

379
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,579
till we get something
to work with.

380
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,233
- It's Johnny Benton.
- Cut him down.

381
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,353
Looks like you got
some business, Denver.

382
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,947
That's the kind of business
I ain't looking for.

383
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,017
I'd enjoy working on that
sheriff real good though.

384
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,614
Here's your prisoner.

385
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,176
He escaped from me.

386
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,586
I was just going to round up
a posse to go after him.

387
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,557
If he starts to run this time,
maybe you ought to shoot him.

388
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,686
It'll look better.

389
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,062
<i>- Where'd you find him?
- Right where you left him.</i>

390
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,964
What happened to him?

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,093
He got away from me
on the way to Elderville.

392
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,400
Johnson here found him
hanging in an oak tree.

393
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,599
I didn't say anything
about an oak tree, Sheriff.

394
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,404
I just said I found him
where you left him.

395
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,676
I'm going over
to the land office.

396
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:10,806
You two give Denver
a hand with the supplies.

397
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,512
Uh, Mr. Johnson, you can see for
yourself what it's like in this town.

398
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,112
This sort of thing takes place
entirely too often.

399
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,955
- I'm still not interested.
- But he was just a boy, a poor harmless boy.

400
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,620
If this sort of thing isn't
stopped, nobody will be safe.

401
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,562
- He killed a man, didn't he?
- He was entitled to a trial.

402
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,566
Why don't you speak plain
to him, Judge?

403
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,192
Everybody knows
who killed Johnny.

404
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,601
If you know who did it, why
don't you have him arrested?

405
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:36,266
- You've got a sheriff.
- We need somebody here to arrest this sheriff.

406
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,468
When I heard you were
coming here, Mr. Johnson,

407
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,944
I felt sure you would be
an asset to the community.

408
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,879
It seems I was mistaken.

409
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,350
I may not be an asset to the community,
but I figure I'll live longer this way.

410
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,376
Then we can only conclude that
you're afraid to take the job.

411
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,253
You conclude
anything you want.

412
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,281
Too bad, Judge.

413
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,953
Next time pick a candidate
with a little guts.

414
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,161
Jimmy, take it easy.
We don't want any trouble.

415
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,031
You got trouble already.

416
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,036
Keep that wet-nosed kid
out of town

417
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,368
or he'll wind up
like Johnny Benton did.

418
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,568
You still want
a marshal in this town?

419
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,737
- Yes.
- You've got one.

420
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,612
- Where do I go to get sworn in?
- Let's go into the office.

421
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,483
What happened
to Lute and Jimmy?

422
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,495
They're over
at the marshal's office.

423
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,497
I thought this town
didn't have a marshal.

424
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,329
They have now.
Lute just took the job.

425
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,830
You want me to wait here
or go on ahead?

426
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,709
Well, I guess one Johnson's
as good as another.

427
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,336
- Congratulations.
- I'll do my best.

428
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,472
Maybe we'll get this town
fit to live in yet.

429
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,642
You can depend on us
backing you all the way.

430
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,118
I'm going to need it.
Oh, excuse me.

431
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,686
- Why'd you do it, Lute?
- I got sort of annoyed with the sheriff.

432
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,424
- Not on account of me?
- Naw, this is a private matter.

433
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,898
Our personalities
just seemed to clash.

434
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,731
Congratulations, Marshal.
Take care of yourself.

435
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,602
Don't worry, I learned
from an expert.

436
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,233
Well, Jim, it looks like
we lost a good ranch hand.

437
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,573
Come on, we've got
a lot of work to do.

438
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,670
All right, Denver.

439
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,850
<i>Coming, Jimmy?</i>

440
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,148
- Hello, Ben.
- Congratulations, Marshal.

441
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,183
Drinks on the house.

442
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,492
Thanks.

443
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,863
Maybe someday you'll learn to
keep that big mouth of yours shut.

444
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Now we've got a marshal
to put up with.

445
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,497
What are you worried about?
I'll take care of him.

446
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,013
Congratulations.
If we can ever do anything

447
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,179
to help you, Marshal,
be sure and let us know.

448
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,080
Yeah, you can call
on us anytime.

449
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,588
Real thoughtful
characters, aren't they?

450
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,599
Yeah, if you like
that sort of thinking.

451
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,999
- Have another drink.
- No.

452
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,265
Don't let them
get under your hide, Lute.

453
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,295
That's what
they want you to do.

454
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,544
- Maybe I'll have that other drink after all.
- Sure.

455
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,778
Denver!

456
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,056
Hey, them look
pretty good!

457
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,087
Got them
for a good price, too.

458
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,164
All right, Clem,
run them in.

459
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,231
Yo, hey, yah!

460
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,774
You've got the start
of a good herd there.

461
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,712
Wait till you see them a year
from now. How's the house coming?

462
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,979
You're making an awful mistake,
Frame, fixing up this place so good.

463
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,249
- Why?
- Jeannie ain't gonna have nothing to complain about.

464
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,653
I'm wondering if she's
gonna like living on a ranch.

465
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,158
Oh, I reckon she'd
like it anyplace...

466
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,921
as long
as you was around.

467
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,485
Where's Jimmy?

468
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,520
He went out riding fence
like you told him.

469
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,095
Hey!

470
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,398
Hey, wait!

471
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,465
What are you
running from?

472
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,990
- Who are you?
- My name is Johnson, who are you?

473
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,731
- I live near here.
- You've got a name, haven't you?

474
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,239
<i>- Well, what is it?
- Man: Maria!</i>

475
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,740
Get back to the house!

476
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,608
Stay on your own side
of the fence, Johnson,

477
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,143
and keep away
from my sister!

478
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,734
Oh, Lute,

479
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,396
Samuels was in town
last night looking for you.

480
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,339
- Samuels?
- Yeah, he's got a little spread south of here.

481
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,842
Rustlers came last night...
drove off most of his herd.

482
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,105
That so?

483
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,137
Well, Marshal, I see
you got the mules back.

484
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,547
Why'd you tell me
these mules were stolen?

485
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,710
Well, I'll tell you.

486
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,482
I went down to the barn one
morning and they wasn't there.

487
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,581
So I just figured
somebody stole 'em.

488
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,790
Lopez says you loaned
them to him.

489
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,820
By golly, Marshal, I did.
I plum forgot about it.

490
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,196
Say, that's a good joke
on me, ain't it?

491
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,536
- Where's the marshal?
- Right here. What do you want?

492
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,632
Rustlers in Black Mesa Canyon!
They're running off the Davis herd.

493
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,644
It might be another
wild mule chase, Marshal.

494
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,612
You'd have all that
riding for nothing.

495
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,844
Don't press your luck too far. I
don't like to get shoved around.

496
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,750
I don't know what you're
talking about, Marshal.

497
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,550
Keep pushing me,
maybe you'll find out.

498
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,023
<i>Hey, you want us
to ride with you?</i>

499
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,687
You might need some help.

500
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,925
Well, I guess that'll take care
of him for the rest of the day.

501
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,263
Better start that herd
moving north.

502
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,814
- See Lute?
- Yeah, I saw him.

503
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,786
Well, how was he?

504
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,448
They're giving him
a bad time.

505
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,423
That Durling outfit's
ganging up on him.

506
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,187
Ah, Lute will
handle it all right.

507
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,924
I figured maybe you'd want to help
him. After all, he is your brother.

508
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,932
I didn't ask him
to take the job.

509
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,059
<i>You know what they're
saying about you in town?</i>

510
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,865
Yeah. That I'm afraid...
gunshy.

511
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,099
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

512
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,130
Live to be
an old man I hope.

513
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,254
He just isn't man enough for
it. That's the size of it.

514
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,019
Maybe so.

515
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,424
We didn't ask him to take
the job. It was his own idea.

516
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,329
Oh, Lute, we were just having
a little discussion about you.

517
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,595
- I heard it.
- No luck this time either, huh?

518
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,626
There hasn't been a cow stolen
in Black Mesa in over a year.

519
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,764
Well, who was robbed
this time while I was gone?

520
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,899
McKesson.
Lost about 100 head.

521
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,206
That's the third herd
run off this week.

522
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,144
I can only be
one place at a time.

523
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,443
You're beginning to sound
like our sheriff.

524
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,279
Listen, mister,
when I took this job

525
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,444
I wasn't told I had
to take any talk from you.

526
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,978
That's enough, Dixon. Let's
not fight among ourselves.

527
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,923
We all know how
the Durlings operate...

528
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,586
confuse you, run you ragged,
send you off in every direction.

529
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,993
While you're chasing rainbows,
they're rustling cattle.

530
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,191
I've worn out six horses
in three days

531
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,258
and I wasn't riding
for my health.

532
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,738
There's your badge. You can have
your money back if you want it.

533
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,535
Mr. Johnson,

534
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,235
I want to apologize
for Mr. Dixon.

535
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,541
We appreciate all you've tried to
accomplish and I want to assure you

536
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,742
that this meeting was not called
to ask for your resignation.

537
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,946
- What do you want then?
- We want you to persuade your brother to help.

538
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,817
Well, you've already
talked to him, Judge.

539
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,947
That's why I'm asking
you to do it this time.

540
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,925
If you could only convince him
of the good he could accomplish.

541
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,449
I don't think
it'll help any,

542
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,325
but I'll try.

543
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,033
I'm sorry you're
in trouble, Lute,

544
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,197
but it's your play
and I don't want in on it.

545
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,401
I thought between the two of us we
could clean it up in a couple of weeks.

546
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,909
Clean it up in one day.

547
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,377
All you have to do
is kill five or six people.

548
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,380
Just let me know
when the shooting starts.

549
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:14,111
- I'll help you, Lute.
- Oh thanks, Kid, but I don't think they'd deputize you.

550
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,779
What difference does that make?
I can still play dog for you.

551
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,086
- No, Jimmy.
- Just because you quit on him is no reason I have to.

552
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,092
Shut up. Frame knows
what he's doing.

553
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,492
Yeah, he always knows.
I guess what they're saying

554
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,860
about him in town is true.
He's gunshy.

555
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,127
Why you impudent
young whipper-snapper!

556
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,794
Let it go, Denver.
Kid just doesn't understand.

557
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,976
I'm sorry. I didn't know
this was going to happen.

558
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,741
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

559
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,681
Take care of him,
will you?

560
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,184
Sure.

561
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,210
He'll be all right.

562
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,529
You want
to go back, Jimmy?

563
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,554
No, I'll see you in town
in about an hour.

564
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,796
- Stay out of trouble, Kid.
- You're beginning to sound like Frame.

565
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:18,438
<i># I have a true love #</i>

569
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,461
Hi.

570
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,464
Well, aren't you going
to ask me in?

571
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,332
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't come over to see you.

572
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,564
Hey, that's one
of my favorite songs.

573
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,799
<i># I have a true love... #</i>

574
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,831
It's mine, too.

575
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,704
You're pretty.

576
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,680
Am I?

577
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,013
I guess a lot of people
have told you that.

578
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,179
Um-mmm.
You're the only one.

579
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,280
I guess the rest
of them around here

580
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,223
must have
poor eyesight.

581
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,351
I don't know
anybody else.

582
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,954
You know me.

583
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,964

586
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,106
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Why not?

587
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,040
Frank would kill you
if he knew.

588
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,975
You let me worry
about Frank.

589
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,205
- You better go.
- I just got here.

590
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,271
Please, please go.

591
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,976
He'll be home
in a minute.

<i># I love my true love... #</i>

Your family...

595
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,357
they're usually in town
nights, aren't they?

596
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,021
Yes.

597
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,122
- Well, I'll be back.
- You shouldn't.

598
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,326
I will.

599
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,830
Please, fellas,
I had it shipped out here

600
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,525
all the way
from Kansas City.

601
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,740
Give me your gun, Jed.

602
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,918
Nothing wrong in a man
having some fun, is there?

603
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,014
Looks to me like
you're overdoing it.

604
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,617
<i>Would you rather sober up
at home or in jail?</i>

605
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,628
What are you going
to throw me in for?

606
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,324
For... creating
a disturbance.

607
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,264
Who am I disturbing?

608
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,666
Me. I've got
a room upstairs

609
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,465
and I don't like
loud noises.

610
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,473
Now do I get the gun or do I
have to take it away from you?

611
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,635
You gotta take it
away from me.

612
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,668
Well, that's
all right, too.

613
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,788
Give it back to him
when he sobers up.

614
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,128
Whatcha doing,
Marshal,

615
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,258
making your own laws?

616
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,324
Any objections?

617
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,699
Yeah.

618
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,534
You know where to find me
when you want to make them.

619
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,733
Hey!

620
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,038
I'm making 'em...
right now.

621
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,440
Anytime you say,
Frank.

622
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,323
Lute!

623
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,424
We'd better
get him upstairs.

624
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,958
I'll take him.
You get a doctor.

625
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,772
Get Doc Harley.
I'm gonna get Frame.

626
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,578
You know what
you've done, don't you?

627
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,415
You've flushed out
Frame Johnson.

628
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,449
You're the one
that kicked the chair over.

629
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,324
Think I want to see
you get killed, too?

630
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,770
Deal.

631
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,675
It's Lute, Frame.
Frank Durling shot him.

632
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,684
- He's at my place.
- Is he hurt bad?

633
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,117
I'm afraid so.

634
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,212
Get the horses, Denver.

635
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,721
He's right outside.

636
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,807
It was fair and square.
Ask any man in here.

637
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,942
They all saw it.

638
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,220
How is he, Doc?

639
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,366
I'm sorry, Frame.

640
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,898
I guess I just wasn't
as good as you.

641
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,808
Don't talk crazy, Lute.

642
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,836
You're the best.

643
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,548
Lute!

644
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,850
Frame, do something!

645
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,225
Nothing to do, Jimmy.

646
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,128
Doesn't look like we got
much to worry about

647
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,694
from the Johnsons.

648
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,671
Easy, Kid.

649
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,473
What are you
going to do?

650
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,451
What Frame
should have done.

651
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,249
Jimmy's out to get
Frank Durling.

652
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,279
Crazy kid!

653
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,589
Put it on my bill!

654
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,430
- Jimmy!
- What do you want?

655
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,932
Let Frame take care of it.
He knows what he's doing.

656
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,333
Sure he knows.
He always knows.

657
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,166
Now you stay
out of this

658
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,229
'cause this is
a family affair.

659
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,071
Well, right now
I feel like family.

660
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,169
They murdered him... no
matter what they call it.

661
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,204
Perhaps we're
at fault, too,

662
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,149
thinking that one man
could stand up alone

663
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,982
against a band
of thieves and murderers.

664
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,988
Here's Lute's badge.

665
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,013
Have you got
somebody for the job?

666
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,525
After this, I doubt if we
could get anybody to take it.

667
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,323
I'll take it.

668
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,557
Providing I can
do it my way.

669
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,997
Anything you say,
Mr. Johnson.

670
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,729
- I want an ordinance passed.
- An ordinance?

671
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:27,703
I want an ordinance
making it illegal

672
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,400
to carry firearms inside
the town limits of Cottonwood.

673
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,806
No guns? We'll be the
laughing stock of the West.

674
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,708
Those are my terms,
take it or leave it.

675
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,145
But how's a man going to
protect himself or his family?

676
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,340
That's up to the law.

677
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,407
And you think you can
handle it alone?

678
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,247
I think he can.

679
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,413
If that's what you want,
I'll go along with it.

680
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,389
We've got a quorum here.
How about it?

681
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,392
Well, it's worth a try.

682
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,724
All right, but I hope

683
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,128
we aren't making
a mistake.

684
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,359
We'll pass
your no-gun ordinance.

685
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,061
It may cause
a lot of trouble.

686
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,092
I'll take care
of the trouble.

687
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,905
But he'll have a gun,
won't he?

688
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,539
Of course, how else is he
going to enforce the peace?

689
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,411
That isn't
what bothers me.

690
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,145
I just hope we haven't
legalized a murder.

691
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,055
Cards are coming.

692
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,424
The gentleman wins
and the gambler loses.

693
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,429
Place your bets, boys.

694
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,796
- What's the limit?
- Anything you happen to be carrying around.

695
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,960
That could be a real
interesting game.

696
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,295
You'd probably
be disappointed.

697
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,533
Place your bet, mister.

698
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,439
Hit me.

699
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,848
I'll stand.

700
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,715
I'll take a hit.

701
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,483
Thought you was located
up Cottonwood way.

702
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,422
I was, but the whole
town blew up.

703
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,289
Somebody killed a marshal
named Johnson.

704
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,521
<i>Hit me.</i>

705
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,053
I said "hit me," miss.

706
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,758
- That's good.
- I'll take a card.

707
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,429
That's enough.

708
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,735
King and queen, 20.
Paying 21.

709
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,401
That's enough
for me.

710
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,672
Louie!
Take over.

711
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,415
Buy you a drink, ma'am?

712
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:27,480
Thanks, but I make it a rule
never to drink at my own bar.

713
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,151
Your health.

714
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,093
You wouldn't happen to know that
marshal's first name, would you?

715
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,097
The one who got killed?

716
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,157
Yeah, it was Luther. His brother
Frame took over the badge.

717
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,134
Says he's going to clean up
the whole town.

718
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,434
Thanks. Give this gentleman
a drink on the house.

719
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,940
Mr. Sterling?

720
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,951
You still want
to buy the place?

721
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:57,180
- At my price?
- At your price.

722
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,881
It's a deal.

723
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,822
I'll meet you at the bank
in the morning.

724
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,348
Oh, Jeannie.
I'm glad you're selling.

725
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,487
Your father wouldn't have liked
to see you running a saloon.

726
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,464
It's the only thing
he left me.

727
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,058
I can't teach school
and I can't sew.

728
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,331
A girl has to make
a living someway.

729
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,812
<i>"The Town Council
has met in solemn body</i>

730
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,939
<i>and decreed that starting
at noon this date,</i>

731
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,280
<i>April 23rd, 1882,</i>

732
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,048
carrying a gun
in the township of Cottonwood

733
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,988
will be a misdemeanor,

734
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,220
punishable by a fine
or jail sentence, or both.

735
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,318
Signed: Judge Williams. "

736
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,123
Well, that's real sporting
of Mr. Johnson, ain't it?

737
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,726
First thing you know we'll
have to shave every day.

738
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,397
- He won't get away with it.
- Nobody's going to take my gun.

739
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,531
What's Johnson trying to do,
run this town?

740
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,610
Looks like your sign's
not very popular.

741
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,771
No guns,
huh, Marshal?

742
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,020
Well, in that case, I guess I'll
just have to get rid of my bullets.

743
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,616
You're under arrest.

744
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,753
- Me? What for?
- Breaking the law.

745
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,163
Your law don't go into effect
until noon. It says so right there.

746
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,225
I'm arresting him anyway.
All right, Durling, let's go.

747
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,294
Somebody get Kurt!

748
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,272
You can't hold me.
You're just wasting your time.

749
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,139
- I got lots of time.
- What's the charge?

750
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,270
- What was he doing?
- Defacing public property.

751
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,143
Since when is there
a law against that?

752
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,241
Since the inception of the Town
Charter, Local Ordinance 27,

753
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,115
which our sheriff has
seen fit to ignore.

754
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,587
You're getting awful law-minded
all of a sudden, Judge?

755
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,648
I've always been conscious
of the law, Mr. Elder.

756
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,921
It so happens
that at long last

757
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,258
we have found someone who is
willing to enforce it.

758
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,127
That's what
I'm talking about.

759
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,157
I don't like having someone
appointed over me in my jurisdiction.

760
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,431
As Chairman of the Cottonwood
Town Council,

761
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,438
I have the right
to appoint a marshal.

762
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,406
<i>If you don't
like that law,</i>

763
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,408
<i>call the council together
and have it changed.</i>

764
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,967
In the meantime,
I find you guilty

765
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,775
of violating Ordinance 27

766
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,838
and I fine you $50
or 10 days in jail.

767
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,282
- I won't pay it!
- Be reasonable, Judge.

768
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,980
You know no one pays any
attention to that old ordinance.

769
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,013
This time you've got a choice:
Pay the fine or go to jail.

770
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,025
- He's got it in for us...
- Shut up!

771
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,550
A law is a law. If you break
it, you pay the penalty.

772
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,990
Go on.

773
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:42,007
Is Jimmy
cooled off yet?

774
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,384
He's so mad he wouldn't
eat any of his food.

775
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,554
Good, too.

776
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,524
- Changed your mind, Kid?
- You know of any reason why I should?

777
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,690
He was my brother, too.

778
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,098
Gunning for Frank Durling
isn't going to help matters.

779
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,534
That's not the way I see it,
and if you let me out...

780
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,265
That's just
why you're in there.

781
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,170
And that's why you're
going to stay there

782
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,175
until you get some sense
through your head.

783
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,685
Craziest darn fool thing
I've ever heard of!

784
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,654
Charlie Walsh!

785
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,485
This the place
that takes the guns?

786
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,787
That's right, miss.
Right over there.

787
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,630
You know, this ain't
a bad law at that!

788
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,231
What's the matter
with you?

789
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,208
I never knew
she carried a gun.

790
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,378
Thank you,
Miss... Miss...

791
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,381
Clarissa.
What's the matter, honey?

792
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,383
Got a short memory?

793
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,652
And I'll be seeing
you, too, Judge.

794
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,152
Better turn
those guns in.

795
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,057
We're only waiting
for the stage, Marshal.

796
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,652
You can get them back
when the stage leaves.

797
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,924
He'll take them
right in there.

798
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,659
But we're leaving town
in a little while!

799
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,691
That's all right!
How about you?

800
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,794
Shirts is my line, mister!

801
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,135
I don't even know
how to shoot a gun.

802
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,913
We'll be gone as soon
as the stage comes in!

803
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,083
- What name do I put on these?
- He was too drunk to know.

804
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,023
Anybody cause
any trouble?

805
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,687
No, but we're going to have
to hire somebody for this job.

806
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,390
- We've been swamped all morning.
- I'll give you a hand.

807
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,524
I'm trying to keep them
filed alphabetically.

808
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,000
It'll simplify these
when we go to give them back.

809
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,169
- What name do I put on it?
- Martin Kohler.

810
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,836
Martin Kohler.
Colt 45.

811
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,973
All right, what name
on this one?

812
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,712
Oh, just Jeannie.

813
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,481
- Jeannie!
- Hello, Frame!

814
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,580
- What are you doing here?
- I got tired of waiting.

815
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,250
Let's get out of here!

816
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,987
I'll be back!

817
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,405
Nice place, isn't it?

818
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,101
How did you wind up
in a fleabag like this?

819
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,905
Oh, I had a choice!

820
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,913
I could either stay here
or at the livery stable.

821
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,074
Well, I'm going to take
you out to the ranch!

822
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,981
It isn't fixed up quite
the way I wanted it,

823
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,008
but it's a big
improvement on this!

824
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,383
You might at least
kiss me first.

825
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,050
I might at that.

826
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,632
Jeannie, I have to tell
you something.

827
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,267
I heard about Lute,
if that's what you mean.

828
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,351
I took over his job
as marshal.

829
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,050
Why do you think
I came up here?

830
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,490
Oh, but you said once...

831
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,255
I know.

832
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,421
I said I wouldn't marry you
because every time

833
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,364
you went out into the street I'd
be afraid you'd never come back.

834
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,458
The odds haven't
improved any.

835
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,765
The odds never will.

836
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,170
You're big and you're ugly
and you're stupid,

837
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,003
and I happen
to be in love with you.

838
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,941
So, if you insist
on being a walking target

839
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,308
for every gunman
in Arizona,

840
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,245
I guess I'll have
to put up with it.

841
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,545
Took you a while
to find that out.

842
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:39,112
I've known it
for a long time.

843
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,646
But I kept hoping it was
something like measles

844
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,057
and maybe
I'd get over it.

845
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,963
You're going to make
a beautiful bride.

846
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,010
Hey, Denver!

847
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,309
Denver!

848
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:06,645
You want something,
Jimmy?

849
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,810
Yeah! I want to get out of here.

850
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,183
You know what Frame said.

851
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,051
He said he'd turn me loose if I promised

852
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,646
not to go gunning
for Frank Durling!

853
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,749
I ain't heard you
say anything yet!

854
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,919
Well, I'm promising,
right now.

855
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,191
I don't know, Jimmy.

856
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,061
Frame's gone on out
to the ranch.

857
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,157
Look, how can I go
gunning for anybody?

858
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,395
I haven't even got a gun.

859
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,131
By golly, you're right!

860
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,071
All right, Jimmy!

861
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:33,132
Now, if I was you, I'd head
right on out to the ranch.

862
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,667
That's just what I
figured on doing!

863
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,306
- You made me a promise, Jimmy.
- And I'll keep it!

864
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,179
I'm not going looking
for Frank Durling.

865
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,116
But I have a call to make
and I need a gun,

866
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,641
just in case
anything happens.

867
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,677
All right, you get
on back in the cell.

868
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,222
See you, Denver.

869
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,817
Jimmy!

870
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,409
I didn't think you
were coming back!

871
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,819
I didn't have a chance. There
was some trouble in town.

872
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,413
I know. I heard them talk about it.

873
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,754
Frank killed
my brother, Lute.

874
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,657
You have to leave!
They'll kill you, too!

875
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:00,060
That's the reason I came out
here! You're going with me!

876
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,723
You want me
to come with you?

877
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,595
We could find a preacher
in the next town.

878
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,396
I wouldn't care, Jimmy.

879
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,765
Get your stuff together
and let's get out of here.

880
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,799
It won't take me long.

881
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,478
That's young
Johnson's horse.

882
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,746
Looks like he moved
in on your sister.

883
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,776
The young squirt!

884
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,426
Johnson! I told you
to keep away from her!

885
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,555
- I asked him to come!
- Shut up!

886
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,629
Drop your guns!

887
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,040
I said drop them.

888
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,369
Maria, get to the horses!

889
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,608
Go ahead!
I'll catch up with you!

890
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,209
All right, now,
back up to the wall!

891
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,108
You gonna let him
get away?!

892
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,807
This time I'm going to
let the law work for me!

893
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,048
Do you think it would help
if I talked to Jimmy?

894
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,718
I don't know.

895
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,624
He's got a right
to feel the way he does.

896
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,652
I wouldn't help Lute
when he asked me to.

897
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,158
If you want to blame
somebody, blame me.

898
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,031
I'm the one
that made you quit.

899
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:49,436
No. I quit
because I wanted to.

900
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,940
'Cause I was tired
of being a hired killer.

901
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,464
My only mistake
was in thinking

902
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,034
I could run away
from a reputation.

903
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,138
Maybe you didn't run
far enough.

904
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,877
Maybe I didn't.
I'm going in town.

905
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,782
I'll send Denver back
to stay with you.

906
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,613
I'm not afraid
to stay alone.

907
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,919
I've been alone
most of my life.

908
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,118
You won't be much longer.

909
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,093
I don't mind
waiting, Frame.

910
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,891
Just hurry back, huh?

911
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,597
I came to tell you, Frame,
I just killed Frank Durling.

912
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,464
- You young fool!
- It wasn't his fault!

913
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,697
- Frank was going to kill him! I saw it!
- Who's she?

914
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,365
- Maria Durling.
- Durling?!

915
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,136
I wanted you to know, I didn't
go gunning for him deliberately.

916
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,006
- Come on, Maria.
- Where are you going?

917
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,137
- We're headed for the border.
- No, you don't!

918
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,147
You're going to stay here
and stand trial.

919
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,775
What chance have I got of
getting a fair trial in this town?

920
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,148
I'll see that you get it.

921
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,552
You keep your law and order.
I'll take my chances in Mexico.

922
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,614
Don't start running, Kid.

923
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,386
I'll just have
to come after you.

924
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,884
Well, in that case, maybe I'd
better give myself a head start!

925
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,065
I'm taking him into town.
You two better come along.

926
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,864
It might not be safe
out here.

927
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,480
I've got a warrant for
the arrest of James Johnson

928
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,077
for the murder
of Frank Durling.

929
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,610
Who says it was murder?

930
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,486
He killed him in cold blood!
Never gave him

931
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,424
a chance to draw!
We all saw it!

932
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,587
That's a lie! Frank would've
killed him! I was there!

933
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,960
Were you, Maria?

934
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:23,022
There are three of us
who say you weren't!

935
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,158
Don't let them take him!

936
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,759
Who're you going
to believe, Marshal?

937
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,361
A girl that's in love
with a killer,

938
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,804
- or three eyewitnesses?
- I'll take the prisoner.

939
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,671
So we can find him
hanging from a tree?

940
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,074
<i>- He's got to be held for trial.
- When's the trial?</i>

941
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,204
First thing in the morning,
it'll be a quick one!

942
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,737
- I'll have the prisoner there.
- Oh, no, you don't!

943
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,649
<i>- You'll turn him over to me right now!
- Fin!</i>

944
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,778
Let him keep him!

945
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,914
I knew you hated Frank,
Maria,

946
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,119
but I didn't think
you'd lie to save his killer!

947
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,801
You don't think he'll bring
the kid up for trial, do you?

948
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,831
Probably would,
but I don't want him to.

949
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,275
- You got the keys to the jail, Fin?
- Sure. Why?

950
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,404
Jed, tonight you go over
and let the kid out.

951
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,107
What are you talking about?

952
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,514
If the Judge thinks Johnson
turned his brother loose,

953
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,678
he won't be marshal
much longer.

954
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,621
<i>- Who's there?
- Don't ask questions, Kid.</i>

955
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,926
If you don't want to hang,
get out of town.

956
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,262
I got a horse
waiting for you outside.

957
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,313
Say, Marshal,

958
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:54,714
arresting your brother
certainly convinced the people

959
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,650
that you mean business
about law and order.

960
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,246
It's a great day
for Cottonwood.

961
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,780
I take it that ordinance
of yours doesn't include me.

962
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,918
After all, I am an officer
of the law.

963
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,656
That's a matter
of opinion.

964
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,357
Almost time
for the trial.

965
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,888
- I suppose the prisoner's here.
- He'll be here.

966
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,543
- What happened?
- Somebody probably let Jimmy out.

967
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,280
Go over to the jail
and get him, Fin.

968
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,484
- We can't stand around here all day.
- I said he'd be here.

969
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,355
He's your brother.
For all we know,

970
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,759
you could've turned him loose
last night. Go get him, Fin.

971
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,422
I wouldn't go
if I were you, Sheriff.

972
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,830
He might try to escape and
then you'd have to shoot him.

973
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,731
<i>Denver: Frame!</i>

974
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,793
- Where's Jimmy?
- I don't know.

975
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,000
Somebody came in last night, slugged
me over the head and let him out.

976
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,508
Man: Do you hear that?
The Johnson kid's escaped.

977
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,908
That's convenient,
Johnson.

978
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,242
All right,
round up a posse.

979
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,304
We'll get our guns back
and go get him.

980
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,680
Don't go any further,
Kurt.

981
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,880
Denver, I'm deputizing you
to keep peace while I'm away.

982
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,047
Shoot the first man
that gets through that door.

983
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,121
You're gonna defend
your brother all the way.

984
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,222
I said I was responsible
for the prisoner.

985
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:19,257
- I'm bringing him in.
- You expect us to believe that?

986
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,928
You see what he did?

987
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,837
Fixed it so his brother could
escape after he took our guns away

988
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,431
so we couldn't do
anything about it.

989
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,237
You've still got
your gun, Sheriff.

990
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:28,868
Why don't you do
something about it?

991
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,177
I got no personal quarrel
with you, Johnson.

992
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,280
I have. You've been riding
pretty high, Marshal.

993
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,723
It's about time somebody
cut you down to size.

994
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,387
I'm kind of looking
forward to it, Kurt.

995
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,766
Let's both of us
stay out of this.

996
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,355
- Frame!
- I'm all right.

997
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,232
- Get my horse.
- You're not going after Jimmy now!

998
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,634
What're you trying to
prove, Frame? Durling's dead.

999
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,504
- There's nothing to be gained.
- I said get my horse.

1000
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,679
Let him go.
We know he's innocent.

1001
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,081
Let him go
his own way in peace.

1002
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,142
I said I'd bring him
in for trial.

1003
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,681
Oh please, Frame!

1004
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,988
Must you always think
like a marshal?

1005
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:34,792
Can't you think like a
human being? Just this once?

1006
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,821
I'm going alone.

1007
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,505
Why?

1008
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,407
It's the way he is.

1009
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,345
You can't ask
a man to change.

1010
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,985
It is finished.

1011
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,218
Well, it took you
long enough.

1012
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,284
I am not
a good blacksmith.

1013
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,557
The shoe
had to be forged.

1014
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,394
I'll take a bottle
of this stuff with me.

1015
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,059
S, senor.

1016
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,440
But... but, senor!
You forgot to pay.

1017
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,473
Senor! Oh.

1018
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,465
Listen, men,
let's stop this talking.

1019
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,905
Get your guns
and go after him!

1020
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,204
The sheriff's right.
What're we waiting for?

1021
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,336
Nobody gets their guns
till Frame gets back.

1022
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:57,936
He's not coming back.
Why should he?

1023
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,175
We want our guns, Judge.
Give us our guns.

1024
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,773
Just a minute, men.

1025
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,944
Don't you see what
the Sheriff's trying to do?

1026
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,613
He's afraid Johnson
will come back.

1027
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,212
That's what he's trying
to prevent.

1028
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,157
That's not true. I'm just trying
to do my duty as a law officer.

1029
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,387
Don't listen to Elder.
Now that Durling's dead,

1030
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,591
he wants the town for
himself. Give Johnson a chance.

1031
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,327
What do you say, miss? Is your
man coming back or ain't he?

1032
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,857
He'll be back.

1033
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,995
I say give
Johnson a chance.

1034
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:25,097
Give him until
sundown tomorrow.

1035
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,739
S, senor, there was
such a man here.

1036
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,475
Two, three hours
he stay.

1037
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,382
His horse lost a shoe.
I had to make a new one.

1038
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,215
He bought also a bottle
of tequila

1039
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,881
which he forgot
to pay for.

1040
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,949
Gracias, senor. Muchas gracias. Gracias.

1041
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,245
Jimmy!

1042
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,716
Don't come
any closer, Frame.

1043
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,121
I'm warning you!

1044
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,888
We're going back, Jimmy.

1045
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,916
No we're not!

1046
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,732
You're gonna make
me do it, Frame!

1047
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,396
It's no life, Jimmy.

1048
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,133
Running all the time.
Hiding.

1049
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,731
<i>You got to stand up
and face it</i>

1050
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,140
<i>if there's ever going to
be anything ahead for you.</i>

1051
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,873
Don't come any closer, Frame,
or I'll shoot!

1052
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,006
I'm not drawing, Jimmy.

1053
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,243
I'll never pull
a gun on you.

1054
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,878
I mean it, Frame.
I'll kill you!

1055
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,160
Frame!

1056
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,100
Frame!
Frame, I didn't mean it.

1057
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,602
Put the guns back, men!
Put them back!

1058
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:34,013
You shouldn't do this, men!

1059
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,880
It's against the law!

1060
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,115
Hey look!

1061
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,444
He's your prisoner, Judge.
Call off the dogs.

1062
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,471
I'll get Doc Harley.

1063
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:20,384
He's lost a lot of blood, but
it ain't going to kill him.

1064
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,455
I'm still not riding in back.

1065
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,591
You think any jury
will convict him now?

1066
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,535
I'm not sticking around to find
out. I'm heading for California.

1067
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,334
It's a long ride to make
alone. You got company.

1068
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,305
Frame!

1069
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,047
It's all right, Jeannie.

1070
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,107
Everything is all right now.

1071
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,118
I'm taking it off
for good this time.

1072
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,250
We got a lot
of ranching to do.

1073
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:58,355
Doesn't look like he's
going to be much help to us.

1074
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,831
Denver! We could use
a good ranch hand.

1075
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,169
Sorry, ranching's
not my line.

1076
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,368
Besides I figure business
ought to be picking up

1077
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,207
back in Tombstone
along about now.

1078
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,735
Hya!
