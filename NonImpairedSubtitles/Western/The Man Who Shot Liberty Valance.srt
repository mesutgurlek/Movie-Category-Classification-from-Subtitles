Did you know that Liberty Valance
is in town tonight?

327
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,870
I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed

if I didn't know
what everybody else knows.

I don't know what to do,
Mr Peabody, I swear.

330
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,088
Do what you're paid to. Run him out!

331
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,632
Run him out... Liberty... Me?

- My advice to you as...
- Coroner.

- And your personal...
- Physician!

334
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:53,601
Is to get your supper and go to bed.
No charge.

335
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:58,314
Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.

Hallie, my love, where are you?
I await you, my dear.

338
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,123
Good evening.
Saturday night, Mr Peabody.

339
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,585
Better order early before those
drunks come from across the street.

340
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,382
Hallie, please.
The proprieties concerning the cutlery.

341
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,634
How many times have I told you,

342
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,388
the fork goes to the left of the plate,
the knife goes...

You superstitious or something?

344
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,935
What are you having to eat?

345
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,604
The usual.

346
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,774
Steak, beans, potatoes,
and deep-dish apple pie.

347
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,652
Three steaks with a lot of black.

348
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,157
- All right.
- KAINTUCK: Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.

All right, Kaintuck!

350
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,746
Three steaks,
burnt black for the Lazy J boys.

351
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,500
Heavy on the beans.
Usual for Mr Peabody with fixings.

352
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,545
Steak, beans, potatoes.

353

And deep-dish apple pie.

different, and we'll all faint.

Goodness, Rance,
aren't you finished yet?

356
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,815
No wonder if your mind isn't on it.
Let me help.

00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,568
Hallie, I found it. I'll show...
No, my hands are wet.

00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,279
Get the book.
Come on, take the book a minute.

Nora, Peter, come here and hear this.

Now, get the book.

00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,287
Now, that place right here where it says,

"Under the law of this territory."

Hallie, you read it out loud.

364

I got Liberty Valance
exactly where I want him.

365
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,214
Just exactly where I want him.

366
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,384
What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it.

367
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,762
I can't.

368
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,516
What?

369
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,601
You... Well, why not?

370
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,231
Well, I never had the schooling,
that's why not.

371
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,693
Well.

372
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,783
You mean you can't read at all?

373
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,497
No. I can't read, and I can't write.

Here, take your book.

isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?

Oh, no.

- Hallie...
- Not enough beans on it.

00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,017
I... I could teach you.

What for?

382
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,440
What good has reading
and writing done you?

383
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,901
Look at you. In an apron!

Be right with you, boys.

I do look funny in this.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

386
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:02,207
She'll get over it.
What is reading and writing for a girl?

387
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,335
She'll make a wonderful wife
for the man she marries.

388
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,881
Yeah. And if Tom Doniphon is smart,
he pops the question to Hallie

389
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:14,510
before some busybody I am married to
upsets his bag of apples.

390
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,764
Aw, you!
Eat supper before come the drunks.

- But I'm not finished.
- Go sit down! Eat!

I'm hungry.
Could I impose upon your hospitality?

Just a couple of those steaks
and no beans.

And double on the potatoes.

One steak for one marshal on the cuff.

Marshal, I was wrong the other day,

402
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,571
but I've been reading up, and there it is.

403
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,200
I'll draw up the complaint,
take care of the details,

but you do have jurisdiction,
it says so right there.

The next time he sets foot
in this town, you arrest him.

Anything you say, Mr Stoddard.

What was that? Arrest who?

409
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,220
Liberty Valance.

Just when I was starting
to get my appetite back.

413

- A lot of black-eyes.
- Right, right.

414
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:56,029
Steaks for the Brophy boys
with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.

- They're sober tonight, too.
- Burn four.

Why, there's nothing to it.

It is a beauty. Look at it, Nora.

- Should look nice in your garden.
- But it should go in now...

- I'll be pleased to plant that.

who's across the street?

00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,812
Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.

478
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:03,359
He won't like what the town's
been saying about him and that hold-up.

- Well-burnt.

- Deep-dish apple pie.

- Yeah.
- Coming up.

Mighty pretty.

I agree with you, sir.

00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,090
Just told her so.

Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.

Isn't that the prettiest thing
you ever saw?

496
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,709
Yeah, it's very pretty.

497

Did you ever see a real rose?

No.

- Sure.
- Washing dishes is enough for him.

- A man waiting on tables?
- Well, no, I'd be glad to help.

Well, by golly!
If we can only get them to vote,

607
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,111
maybe we can handle
those cattle barons

00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,688
One, two, three.

636
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,443
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

637
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,238
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

638
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:42,242
Q, R, S and T, U, V

639
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,204
W, X and Y and Z

640
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,334
Now I know my ABCs

641
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:54,087
Tell me what you think of me

642
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,965
RANCE: Well, that was just fine,
just fine.

643
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,552
Well, I see a couple more
new pupils back there.

644
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:05,265
Highpockets, Kaintuck,
you fellas really serious about readin'?

645
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,476
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.

646
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,023
Well, Miss Hallie,

647
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:16,651
she talked such a right smart
argument to the Lazy J...

648
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:17,944
(STAMMERING)

649
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,738
The boss of the Lazy J...

650
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:24,117
Well, he just up and told
all the hands to cut the cards

651
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:27,913
to see who come to school, and I lost.

652
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:32,084
I see. Well, we'll try...
Good morning, Mr Carruthers.

653
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:36,588
Good morning. Caught him
playing hookey again, fishing.

654
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,382
Catch anything, Herbert?

655
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,551
- No, sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.

656
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,179
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.

657
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,349
For the benefit of those
of you just starting,

658
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,894
none of us in here smoke,
Mr Carruthers.

659
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,147
Thank you.

660
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,776
For those of you who have just started,

661
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,238
I might explain to you
that we've begun the school

662
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,698
by studying about our country

663
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,660
and how it's governed.

664
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:08,787
Now, let's see.

665
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,539
Well, now, Nora...

666
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,836
Would you tell the class what you've
learned about the United States?

667
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,679
The United States is a republic

668
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,349
and a republic

669
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,353
is a state in which

670
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,149
the people are the boss.

671
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,485
That means us.

672
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:46,700
And if the big shots in Washington
don't do like we want,

673
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:50,203
we don't vote for them,
by golly, no more.

674
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,414
- Any more!
- Any more.

675
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,709
That's fine, Nora. That's just fine.

676
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,796
Now, I wonder
if anybody in class remembers

677
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,883
what the basic law of the land is called.

678
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,177
You remember I told you

679
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:08,430
it had to be added to
and changed sometimes

680
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:10,307
by things called amendments.

681
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,184
Does anybody remember?

682
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,144
Julietta, your hand's always up.

683
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,189
Here, let's... Pompey, you try this one.

684
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,655
It was writ by
Mr Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.

685
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,534
- "Was written", Pompey.
- Written by Mr Thomas Jefferson.

686
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:33,747
- He called it the Constitution.
- RANCE: Declaration of Independence.

687
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,416
It begun with the words,

688
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:40,378
"We hold these truths to be..."

689
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,548
- (WHISPERING) Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.

690
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,885
"Self-evident that..."

691
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,472
"That all men are created equal."

692
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,893
That's fine, Pompey.

693
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,479
I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.

694
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,608
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.

695
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,026
Thank you.

696
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,278
This law also states

697
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,031
that the governing power
rests with the electorate.

698
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,201
Now, that means you,
that means the people.

699
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:16,456
And you exercise this power
through the vote. Now, then. Yes?

700
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,167
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

701
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,965
Well, Hallie? Go right ahead, Hallie.

702
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,470
Now, here is the best textbook
in the world.

703
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:31,846
It's an honest newspaper.

704
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,684
This is the Shinbone Star,
Dutton Peabody, Editor-in-Chief.

705
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,729
And reading this ought to
bring home to everybody

706
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:42,732
the importance of using that vote.

707
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:46,236
Now, the headlines say,
"Cattlemen fight statehood.

708
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,280
"Small homesteaders in danger."

709
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:53,034
It says clearly that if big ranchers
north of the Picketwire River

710
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,496
win their fight to keep this
territory in open reign,

711
00:56:56,581 --> 00:57:01,209
then all your truck farms and your corn,

712
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,378
the small shopkeepers and everything,

713
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,090
the future of your kids,
it will all be all over, be gone!

714
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,677
And they call upon you in this article,

715
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:15,765
they call upon you to unite
behind a real strong delegate

716
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,352
and carry this fight to Washington
if necessary.

717
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:21,354
Hello, Tom.

718
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:24,024
Welcome back. You want to join us?

719
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,276
I'm looking for Pompey.

720
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,905
I've been away three weeks,
and there's no sashes or doors in yet.

721
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:35,785
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.

722
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,497
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...

723
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:43,126
What I got to say to you
will be a whole lot rougher.

724
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,547
The good editor here
has written some noble words,

725
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:51,760
and you read 'em good,
but if you put that paper out,

726
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,763
the streets of Shinbone
will be running with blood.

727
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,141
Why are you against this, Tom,
you of all people?

728
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:02,395
Aren't there more votes
south of the Picketwire than north?

729
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,940
That's right, but votes
won't stand up against guns.

730
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,568
Guns? What guns, Tom?

731
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:12,947
You think Valance stays away
from here 'cause he's scared of you?

732
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:16,242
He's recruiting hired guns
for the big ranchers.

733
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,911
- Julietta.
- (SPEAKING SPANISH)

734
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,788
Take the little ones home.

735
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,706
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

736
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,832
Come on.

737
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:26,711
Hallie, it would be a good idea
if you dismissed class.

738
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:29,589
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.

739
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,508
(RINGING)

740
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,302
Class dismissed! Same time tomorrow.

741
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,346
AMOS: You get to the store.

742
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,644
This could get worse
than the sheep wars.

743
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,481
- Will they start anything here?
- It's already started.

744
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,275
Valance and his men
crossed the river yesterday,

745
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,904
killed old man Holliday and his son.

746
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,865
- You know that for a fact, Tom?
- I do.

747
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:59,994
They tried to bushwhack me,
unfortunately for one of them.

748
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,497
You gonna put that in your newspaper?

749
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,708
It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.

750
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,168
Print that, he'll kill you, sure as hell.

751
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,712
LINK: You think they'll come here, Tom?

752
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,591
They'll be here,
tomorrow or the next day,

753
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,970
according to how much
who-hit-john they consume,

754
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:21,725
but election day, pilgrim,
you can depend on it, they'll be here.

755
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,269
Hallie, go back where you belong.

756
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,771
I don't want you in no shooting gallery.

757
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:29,149
Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.

758
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,527
What I do and where I go
is none of your business.

759
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,154
You don't own me.

760
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:40,160
Like I said, Hallie,
you're awful pretty when you get mad.

761
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,621
Hal.

762
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,267
Rance, after all you've taught us,

763
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,228
how can you say
we should knuckle under now?

764
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,856
You heard what Tom said.

765
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:13,318
When force threatens,
talk's no good any more.

766
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,575
Hallie...

767
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,164
Hallie, you go find Tom
and make it up to him.

768
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,373
He...

769
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,210
He's only trying to protect you.

770
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,585
Rance.

771
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,255
Rance!

772
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,216
Better let him go, Hallie.

773
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:23,888
Why? Where's he going?

774
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,433
He's gonna need
all the practice he can get.

775
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:32,105
Practice? What are you talking about?

776
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:38,945
I might as well let you know now.

777
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:43,241
When he decided to come in with me,
I let him have a gun of mine.

778
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:48,121
He's been going out in the country
twice a week, practising, ever since.

779
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:53,543
You mean he's going to face up
to Liberty, Liberty Valance?

780
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:55,545
Rance?

781
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,922
That's the only way I can figure it.

782
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:01,467
He never would discuss it.
He just keeps on

783
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,137
practising.

784
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,481
Tom! Tom Doniphon!

785
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:24,490
TOM: Hey, professor.

786
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,453
Where you going?

787
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,835
I want to talk to you.

788
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,170
Tom, I'm going...

789
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,338
(URGES HORSES)

790
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:04,197
Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.

1429
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:32,600
Pork chop money.

1432
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:53,579
Hallie...

1433
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:58,334
Hallie, would you be too sorry

1434
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:02,672
if once I get the new
irrigation bill through...

1435
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:09,595
Would you be too sorry
if we just up and left Washington?

1436
02:01:11,515 --> 02:01:12,557
I...

1437
02:01:13,684 --> 02:01:18,563
I sort of have a hankering
to come back here to live.

1438
02:01:20,023 --> 02:01:23,025
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...

1439
02:01:25,404 --> 02:01:28,156
If you knew how often I'd dreamed of it.

1440
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,159
My roots are here.

1441
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:35,037
I guess my heart is here.

1442
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:38,499
Yes, let's come back.

1443
02:01:41,253 --> 02:01:44,380
Look at it. It was once a wilderness.

1444
02:01:45,549 --> 02:01:47,216
Now it's a garden.

1445
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:49,552
Aren't you proud?

1446
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:58,186
Hallie, who put the cactus roses
on Tom's coffin?

1447
02:02:00,272 --> 02:02:01,564
I did.

1448
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:12,408
Here, I got a brand-new spittoon,
cuspidor, Hallie.

1449
02:02:12,784 --> 02:02:16,496
And the engineer's got a full
head of steam in this bucket.

1450
02:02:16,914 --> 02:02:20,833
We'll make 25 miles an hour
or bust a boiler trying.

1451
02:02:20,918 --> 02:02:24,378
And we wired ahead to Junction City.

1452
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,672
They'll hold the Express.

1453
02:02:26,757 --> 02:02:29,967
In two days and nights,
you'll be back in Washington.

1454
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,844
Thank you, Jason.

1455
02:02:31,929 --> 02:02:35,264
I'll write to the officials
of this railroad

1456
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:39,644
and thank them for their kindness
and for going to all this trouble.

1457
02:02:40,062 --> 02:02:41,604
You think nothing of it.

1458
02:02:41,730 --> 02:02:45,274
Nothing's too good for
the man who shot Liberty Valance.
