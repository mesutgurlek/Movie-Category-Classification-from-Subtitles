00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,440
Centuries ago West it was
still unknown area.

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,640
It attracted all kinds of people:
pioneers looking for a house ...

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,680
and adventurers who
tension and gold were looking for.

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,160
But the West also questioned
outcasts to:

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,040
Law sought by the crooks,
murderers and tramps.

6
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,160
But there were also people
who fought for justice ...

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,960
as Charles Vaillant,
aka Old Shafterhand.

8
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,360
This hunter and trapper was
friends with Winnetou:

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
the chief of the Apache.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,520
We follow them along soon
mountains and valleys ...

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,840
and we will be desperate struggle
behold ...

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,520
to hold
enormous resources.

13
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,120
There he is al
Come on.

14
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,600
Hands up.
Come on, guys.

15
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,920
Well done, Colonel.

16
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,600
Give me a whiskey.

17
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Here is plaab. Go garble.

20
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,560
Sick, weak or old?
This means a cure for everything.

21
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,040
I said no because it 's my father
, but because it is true.

22
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,280
My father is the fairest man
in the world.

23

25
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,040

31
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,560
Why doeje so stupid?
-Get out, I said.

32
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,480
Look at that.

33
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,200
Never without hat
in the bright sun, friend.

34
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,280
Are you hurt?
-No, you know.

35
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,320
I got a topmedicijn.
-No thanks, I have nothing.

36
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,120
My horse is only
a few sizes too big.

37
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,680
Look at him.

38
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,080
I would love
may be on him.

39
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Thanks, what kind.
-I got something for you, girl.

40
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,440
I do not believe so.

OFWAT Who are you looking for here?

44
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,080
I search

45
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,040
I do not know that.
What does he look like?

46
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,600
Medium red with wings.

47
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,000
The blue variant
what is less rare.

48
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
A butterfly. I am
butterfly collector.

49
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,080
I was not touching you,
but that bottle there.

50
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
My rifle moved a little bit.

51
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,320
That will change the case.
I thought it "was a joke.

52
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,840
You will pop stand.

53
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,840
What happens now

54
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,680
That would you do

00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,200
Then he becomes rich.
Very rich.

56
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,320
My father.
You bet.

57
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Let 's take drink.

Cheers. Look, if doeje that.

59
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,760
There is also 'n secret,
but that I should keep quiet ...

60
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,000
to my dad with the coach
back from Salt Lake City.

61
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
What do you want from me?
Professor Jemerson-Hartley.

62
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,880
Medical and veterinarian of Appeal.

63
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,440
My horse and I are healthy.
Here you can not lose.

64
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,360
I got here
aqua chimborosa amore.

65
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,280
Three drops and every girl
dolverliefd is on you.

66
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,920
I guarantee that.
Slechb three dollars a bottle.

67
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
If I do need your elixir
for the love ...

68
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,200
it is bad to me made.
-In addition to the coach.

69
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,680
Why is there no koebier?

70
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Father.

71
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,880
He is dead.
-Kill.

72
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,800
I will find your killer.

73
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,520
Wait.

74
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,600
Five horses
without which a rider.

75
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,920
They came from that side and here
they left the horses behind.

76
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,720
The tracks lead to
the main road.

77
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,120
Why they have the horses
left behind?

78
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
This voebporen go
that way.

79
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,240
The others go down there.
Follow that but you.

80
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,040
There were whites on the lurk.
-They waited on the coach.

81
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,520
There are also traces.
They have just dragged.

82
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,360
No fight.
Shot in the back.

83
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,960
They made no chance. They are
murdered in cold blood.

84
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
Bandits.

85
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,040
The 3rd man was stabbed,
but ontkwam.

86
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,640
Then he was sitting in the koeb. None
it had only horse riders.

87
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,680
One of the dead has Engel.

88
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,360
Maybe he escapes
in the carriage.

89
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,520
What do we do now?

90
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,040
If you drive to Tulsa, I will
trace of the bandits follow.

91
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,680
There was only 50 dollars in that fund.
As postmaster, I know that.

92
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,080
Furthermore, there is only with
people on the passenger list.

93
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
Mr. Engel and blessed
Brown is one that is now gone.

94
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
Almost every rogue called himself
Brown.

95
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,160
This was not about the money.
-No? But wherever it about?

96
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,000
Maybe they were looking
Easter eggs.

97
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Fred, what is it?
-Where gaje go?

98
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,960
No movement.
-What a gruff greeting.

99
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Killer.

100
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,720
Think for your shoot.
Come and get out.

101
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,280
Hello, old giant.
That is coincidental.

102
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,480
That is the offender. Hang him.
-Wait a minute.

103
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,720
You do not see
that this is not a crook?

104
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,480
If such a horse and such guns
not 'n hunter bears are ...

105
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
I eat than on my scalp
's breakfast. Glad to see you.

106
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,000
Day, which every great hero has
with the name Old Shafterhand.

107
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,680
Is that him?
-If I'm not mistaken, however.

108
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Search the roversbende you?
He Freds-pa murdered.

109
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,200
They are now on their way to Tulsa.

110
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,560
What really for you. We talk it
if we are in Tulsa.

111
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,960
No, I am now going to find the perpetrators.
Winnetou, she is already on the track.

112
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,440
Is there news, Woodward?
-Where is the colonel?

113
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,280
Me and my men
follow him no longer.

114
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
Shut up.

115
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,320
Hilton, Knox, come here.

116
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,120
What was that?
-Nothing.

117
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,320
Woodward wants money for his
share in the postkoeboverval.

118
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,640
Are you sometimes forget
that you wanted us to speak?

119
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,480
Why do we
postkoeb who actually robbed?

120
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,240
Come inside.

121
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,920
Close the door.

122
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,000
Listen well,
but tell nieb further.

123
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,080
Understood?
Yes.

124
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,680
We are confident.
-We nNijgen as the grave.

125
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,840
Ever heard of the treasure
van 't Silver Lake?

126
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,040
These are just talk.
-Sun. Talking, HC?

127
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,920
According to Doc Hartley in Tulsa
Engel has a single card.

128
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,440
Hartley says that English map
a treasure map.

129
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,200
Therefore, we
which coach robberies.

130
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,120
So Angel was the man to
board the coach.

131
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,880
Him we have slain.
-And where is the card now?

132
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
This is one half.

133
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,320
Where is the other half?
-No idea.

134
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Engel had a son. Who knows down
but where the other half.

135
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,200
Where's son than English?
Doc-Hartley follows him.

136
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,000
He know a good medicine.
On-the doctor.

137
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,880
The bottle is empty.
Where bewaarjeje drink?

138
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,040
In the attic.

139
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,320
Engel wanted in Salt Lake City
that piece of land claim.

140
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
What is it?
-There is someone upstairs.

141
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,080
Hilton, this way.

142
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,920
Let me go.

143
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,320
Gotcha.
I got him. I got him.

144
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,680
Quick, colonel.
Fast.

145
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:05,000
Plug a lamp.
Fast.

146
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,160
What is it?
-Come quickly.

147
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,480
The colonel has been established.
-There is something wrong.

148
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,840
What is it, Colonel?
-A spy.

149
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Who is that man?

150
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,040
Burns. That's Burns.
-But where is the spy then?

151
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
Fixed jumped out the window.
To arms, men.

152
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,120
Kam 's camp out. Woodward,
versper the road to 'the forest.

153
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,520
Is it not too late for?
-Forward.

154
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,400
Knox, comb everything.
We must find him.

155
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,600
Come with us.

156
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,800
Listen carefully to Winnetou,
the chief of the Apache.

157
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,360
It showed that face
violating the peace treaty ...

158
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,600
will die.

159
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,240
Well done, buddy.
Come on.

160
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,480
It was a good hound,
but now he smells nothing more.

161
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,400
You have aqua Salamandra needed.
-Good.

162
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,440
Put ten drops on his leg
and he smells again rabbits.

163
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,440
No, thanks.
Well, well, or not.

164
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,920
Vieren_intig, vijfen_intig.
That miserable fly too.

165
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,320
Hey Aqua Salamandra,
where are you going?

166
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,400
I want my top stuff
sell.

167
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,360
The top guys
do not want to be disturbed.

168
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,320
I get it.
I did not, pal.

169
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
Then I try it
to the post master.

170
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,000
Only it. His wife is still
as ugly as drops for you.

171
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,200
For the old chief died,
he gave the card to father.

172
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,280
My father would treasure
Searching Pafterson go.

173
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Father to Salt Lake City
went to the ground to claim.

174
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,400
They have nothing to that card.
Father had thought of everything.

175
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,160
He has the map
in meeën torn.

176
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,320
The other half
he gave to Patterson.

177
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,200
Where is this now?

178
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,160
He is waiting for Butlers Farm
on my father.

179
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,120
Stay with that window came
until he is gone.

180
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,040
I've left
getro_en of that rat.

181
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,640
That we see no turning back.
Since vergisjeje-in, Sam.

182
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,520
Now know the gang
The card is.

183
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,960
We have previously enrolled in Patterson
than they are.

184
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,520
That treasure is yours if we
my dad's killer suits.

185
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,760
No friend, I'm not for sale.

186
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,640
But because of the law ...

187
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,240
ikje will help.
-Thanks.

188
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,680
We must quickly
Butlers to farm.

189
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,760
Why all this fuss?
That still-merkje.

190
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,280
Get up. The Colonel is coming.
-Nice. Let us sleep.

191
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,680
Get up, everybody.

192
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,480
Get up, I said.
Everybody-up. Come on.

193
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,720
Our friend heard that
what to get at Butlers farm.

194
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,280
We go there so go.

195
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Why?
-There is money, food and livestock.

196
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,080
All useful things for us.
-Exactly.

197
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
I think that too.
-That 's not too early.

198
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay, guys. Then we go.
-Wait a minute.

199
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,640
That cost us wounded.
That farm is just 'n fortress.

200
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,600
Hebje sometimes ieb opje liver?
Yes. I'm against it.

201
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,640
Is that clear, colonel?

202
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,200
So Woodward is against it.
Yes.

203
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,280
We would do it in El Doro
Schuyler gang to join?

204
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,680
So you refuse to obey?
-You bet.

205
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
Make a step forward.

206
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Woodward, I count to three.

207
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,040
One.
-I have many supporters.

208
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Two.
-Brent, Dicky, the Johan Sons.

209
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,680
Three.

210
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,200
Were there any other complaints?

211
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,880
Saddle your horse.
We go to Butlers farm.

212
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,920
Come on, guys.
We leave.

213
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,800
Brent, Dicky, Johannesson.
Henceforth'm ikjullie boss.

214
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,200
Faster.
-Why? We are almost there.

215
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,080
The gang wants us the pass
shearing.

216
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
These are Old Shatterhand
Engel and from Tulsa.

217
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,160
Faster, faster.

218
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,600
Put the gate open.
Winnetou is with them.

219
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,480
Put the cattle shed.

220
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,920
Remove the baskets with ammunition.
-Come on.

221
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,840
Fire.

222
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,200
Back, back.

223
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,480
Follow me.

224
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,520
You watch.
The rest goes with me.

225
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,120
Welcome to Butlers Farm.
-Nice to meet you.

226
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,680
At last I can once again 'n set
ve_elkomen honest men.

227
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,880
You're Mr. Hawkens,
if I am not mistaken.

228
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,240
This peace is established
Gunstick Uncle, the poet.

229
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,760
Like a lady praises me so
I feel it allerblijst.

230
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,680
Fame is not worthy of me ...
Alsje-doggerel you save me.

231
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,720
That little scheelde, HC Fred?
Say, where isje father?

232
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,240
He is dead.
-What?

233
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,400
He was killed on the way back
to Tulsa.

234
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,400
And all because of that card.

235
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,920
Where's Ellen?

236
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:02,520
They go fishing with her father.
They must turn back.

237
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,160
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,160
Bandits. Get out.

239
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,840
Halt. Where should that go?
Who are you?

240
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,440
My name is Patterson
and this is my daughter.

241
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,040
But preferably two.

242
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,040
That's good.
Alert the colonel.

243
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,120
What is this about?
-Shut up. We appreciate the questions.

244
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,600
They have
captured.

245
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,880
What will they do with them?
-Ransoms for their requirements.

246
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
Well, love him.

247
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,040
What do you want from us? You '
your time. I have no money with me.

248
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,520
Where is the map?
-What are you talking about?

249
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,600
This card says something?
-How do you get it?

250
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,480
I ask the questions.
-What have you done with Angel?

251
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
Bunch of murderers.
-Don 't. Father.

252
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,600
Where is the rest of the card,
Pafterson?

253
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,080
Tell him, Father.
-Still, Ellen.

254
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,880
They geeftje good advice, though.

255
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,400
And? Want to talk now?
-Father.

256
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
Put him on the ground.

257
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,080
No.
The card is on Butlers farm.

258
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,280
Mrs. Butler, the card should I?
-The card?

259
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,240
The colonel may 'm
in exchange for Ellen and Patterson.

260
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,600
No. They make only one chance
if we keep that card.

261
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,000
That wealth has been enough
misery in this place.

262
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,560
Without we 're also rescued.
-Wait. There is' n rider to.

263
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,520
Let me 's watch.

264
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,320
A man with a white flag.
It seems that he is alone.

265
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,840
He wants his shirt
sometimes dry?

266
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,280
What gotta?
-My boss wants what you say.

267
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
What does he want?
-You 'card, horse ...

268
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,120
and 5000 dollars.
-Anything else?

269
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,400
No. Alsje our demands limits
Iaten we caught the go.

270
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,920
And if not?

271
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,200
Then the farm 's on fire
and we all hang on.

272
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,280
So what is it?
-I have to consult.

273
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,080
Why?
-We want to discuss.

274
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,640
How long?

275
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,280
One hour.

276
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,800
What will they do with us?
Well-Be calm.

277
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,520
Mrs. Butler gives the map
The bandits then we are free.

278
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
Stay with them from the neighborhood
and do not speak with them.

279
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,360
Understood? If they try
to onbnappen, popping them down.

280
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,560
An hour to produce.
Hebjij nice friends.

281
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,640
There is only one solution:
we must liberate them.

282
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,920
That would be madness.

283
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,160
That is better than doing nothing.
-Not always.

284
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,000
Watch helps too.
-There 's nothing else on.

285
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,880
The gang sees everything we do.
-No, you know.

286
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,160
What do you mean by that?
That will ikje-show.

287
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,200
Here is the water.
Strekje arm.

288
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,560
My husband wanted an emergency exit
for T case.

289
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,240
The entrance is 30 cm
above the water ...

290
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,760
depending on the rainfall.

291
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,200
Where is he from?
-In a few struikjes.

292
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,320
In the near their camp.
Then, we know enough.

293
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,920
Good luck, Fred.

294
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,240
Do you see anything?
-No, it's quiet there.

295
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,320
Everything is ready.
Tie-ahead.

296
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,400
We have blankets needed.
Role-them here.

297
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Leave him here but lie.
-Good.

298
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,040
Make it as another one of those.

299
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,560
Isn 't powder dry?

300
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,680
Yes, but we need more.
-Please.

301
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,120
Our colonel is very cunning.

302
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,320
I'm curious
what he intends.

303
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,800
Why does Mrs. Butler
reflection?

304
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,680
Love you still.
You can not talk.

305
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
Why not give them the card?
-That 's all I know.

306
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,640
Zieje them all?
They must now surely are.

307
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,320
Well, they are not.
Take a look.

308
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,400
Halt. What gotta?
-I wanted to see that beautiful girl.

309
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,440
That should surely?
Not-colonel.

310
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,600
The colonel can imagine what.

311
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,960
Pakjij the man rechb?
I take the guard.

312
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,160
Go back or I shoot.
-Well, I go al

313
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,560
You guys are all mad as a hatter.

314
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,680
Do not move.

315
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,400
Give me 's what.
-What was that?

316
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,320
Nothing. Again, give some.
-I heard something.

317
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,920
Gotta see him again.

318
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,720
Watch out, not tripping.

319
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,000
Gentlemen, now he is gone.
Go-itself but also quick.

320
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,760
I should science.
And what do you?

321
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,840
Go away, I said.
Threatens me-you sometimes?

322
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,480
I count to three.
-Good. One, with three.

323
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,800
Still a hole in my hat.
You are very slechtgemanierd.

324
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,440
Well, I already district 's violence.
Herakles come, we go.

325
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,840
The hour is over.
Remove the prisoners.

326
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,640
Do you see anything, Mrs. Butler?
-No, nothing.

327
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,560
O God, as they are discovered ...

328
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,640
This time they won,
if I am not mistaken.

329
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,840
Where are they?
Where? Where?

330
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,240
Put everything ready for the attack.

331
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,400
Thank you.

332
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,680
Thank you.
You gave us T-minute rescued.

333
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,920
I believe they are so.
I can 't smell.

334
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,480
We will have bastards
and set fire ...

335
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,400
them to send to hell.

336
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,560
Quick, fill the buckets with water.
-Well, come on.

337
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,440
The roof is lit.
Quick, get the ladder.

338
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,320
Bring the water here.
-Bucket Brigade.

339
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,480
Jimmy, watch out.
-I need more water.

340
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,920
It also burns al

341
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,320
At attack.

342
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,800
Follow me.

343
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,720
This is the port.
Come on, all at once.

344
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,360
Fred, they beech the port.
They are already inside the fence.

345
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,640
Voorwaarb, voo_aarb.

346
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,080
Colonel, the Indians come
coming. Look.

347
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,760
The red skins are coming.
Run for your life.

348
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,800
You are a wonderful woman.
-And you're 'n old oiler.

349
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,680
My brother.
-The Osage are our friends.

350
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,480
Colonel.

351
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,760
This way. Come on.
But you take this horse.

352
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,680
Ellen.

353
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,160
It is Fred.
Fred is back.

354
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,120
We are 't brave chief
of Osage grateful.

355
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,000
The colonel escaped.

356
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,240
If 't Silver More' tjachtgebied
of the Ute Indians is ...

357
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,440
then the map well.

358
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,560
Here is an Indian symbol:
a bumel which a white rock licks.

359
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,320
That means drawing salt water.

360
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,240
Then that is fixed
the great salt lake.

361
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,160
Look, the sun sets the direction
on. Pal west.

362
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,320
This path runs through the gap Spoken
to the waterfalls ...

363
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,320
and then to 't Silver Lake.

364
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,640
According to the map 't more
surrounded by steep cliffs.

365
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,640
In places that are
roben flat ...

366
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,600
where waterfalls along
flows into the lake.

367
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,120
Exactly.

368
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,520
The waterfall shines as silver.

369
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,320
So it is not
referred to the treasure?

370
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,080
There is only one way to the
Silver Lake: via 's northwest.

371
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,760
Through a crack in the rocks.

372
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,320
We are on the right track.

373
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,360
Above the lake is a cave.
-This is the treasure.

374
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:04,360
The old chief was right.
That wealth brings only misfortune.

375
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:07,280
They were just like you Dad
can kill.

376
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,320
I feel doin 'it, Fred.

377
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,920
Your father was
such a simple man.

378
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,000
I previously thought
that it was well rewarded ...

379
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,560
and the evil was punished.
But it was not.

380
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:23,040
The good guys always suffer.
-Bullshit. That is not true.

381
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:25,360
Oh, yes, if it is just.

382
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,160
But this time
it will be different.

383
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,160
I grab my dad's killer
though 't my death.

384
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,240
With bare hands, I will ...
-Hold on, Fred.

385
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,360
I know that the
terrible for you to ...

386
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,400
I can not here me resign.

387
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,520
Understand that anyway.

388
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
I'm worried about you.
You are so bifter and resentful.

389
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,400
The hate is no plaab
in your heart for ...

390
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,680
There is place for you, Ellen.

391
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,520
Ellen goes with me.

392
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:36,800
Both Engel and I
wanted to go find the treasure.

393
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,760
And it definitely
also found.

394
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,560
I do not want to be happy
amijken of those plans.

395
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,200
I promised Fred
to avenge his father's death.

396
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,280
So we go with you,
Mr. Patterson.

397
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,640
DenM you that the colonel us
will be chased?

398
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,320
Yes, knows Winnetou 'tjachtgebied
of the Utes. He leads the way.

399
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,720
Sam is also old Hawkens.
-Yes.

400
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,320
He goes everywhere.

401
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,400
A young man is always needed.

402
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,840
I not only remain behind,
because I am willing ...

403
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
to the treasure to find.
I just wanted to lose.

404
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:34,360
Halt. Here we save our camp.
-Dismount.

405
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,120
Colonel, look at the men agree.
I have rarely seen such a mess.

406
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,200
Without the map
we find it never Silver Lake.

407
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,240
Easy. Schuyler is
with 60 men to El Doro.

408
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Hartley already there waiting on us.

409
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,320
But then Patterson
first to the treasure.

410
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,000
That we should avoid.
-We will also do.

411
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:43,040
Come baby,
I will do you no harm.

412
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,760
Be 's nice, rotinsect.
Wait a minute.

413
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,720
Monster, I get you later.

414
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,120
Do not laugh.

415
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,760
The Papilio polymnestor parinda
is extremely rare.

416
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,840
I like to believe that.
But I would be careful.

417
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,560
There is a lot of scum in the neighborhood.

418
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,120
I got a good horse
and a good rifle.

419
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,560
I'm Karl-Heinz Ulrich Leopold,
the Duke of Glockenspiel.

420
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,040
How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.

421
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,200
Sam Hawkens.
Duke of whiskey and soda.

422
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,680
Old Shatterhand and Winnetou,
the chief of the Apache.

423
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,480
Zel_ in Vienna familiar with them
Winnetou and Old Shafterhand ...

424
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:26,600
with tjachtgeweer
and the silver box.

425
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,400
Duke, we your horse
and look at your gun?

426
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,960
Yes, of course.

427
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,920
And? You can also drive?

428
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,000
Unfortunately, the horse
little too big for me.

429
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,080
Would you say
that you really can shoot?

430
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,200
I did not mean just
a shot in the air ...

431
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,200
I meant really ieb boards.
Not-so impatient.

432
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,000
Nice shot.

433
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:00,920
With a shot was the vulture
Estimated ...

434
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,920
We have to rookie
unjustly been cracks.

435
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,440
I think that is nice.

436
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,600
It is safer when you
is traveling with us.

437
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,360
I thank you very much.
I'm very honored.

438
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Halt.

439
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,560
What is all this smoke?
-Fixed a campfire.

440
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:34,040
No, that is the smoke of death.

441
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,680
Blijfjij but here, Ellen.

442
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:36,920
More than ten men
robberies have this village.

443
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:40,000
That was the colonel
with his gang.

444
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,920
They have the women
and children slain.

445
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:45,720
I do not see any dead warriors are.

446
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,160
All men are on buffalo hunting.

447
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,760
Come back, Fred.

448
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,880
We have your village
not destroyed. Watch out.

449
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:57,760
I haven 't strange feeling
that we all know each other.

450
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,520
Not to shoot the men.
Focus on the horses.

451
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,960
We are friends.
Friends of the Indians.

452
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:19,960
Where's Ellen?

453
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:55,000
The shots
came from there.

454
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:58,120
And the tracks run straight.

455
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,880
What is it?

456
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,920
Bring the card to El Doro
or Miss Pafterson vote.

457
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,520
We must go now.
-No, El Doro is a nest robber.

458
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:32,080
Soon we are in the minority.
-We must liberate her.

459
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,680
There is a chance.
You know the map outing head?

460
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,800
You can 't Silver Lake find themselves?
Yes.

461
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,080
Give mejullie cards. Patterson
and I go to it more.

462
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,800
Winnetou note the colonel
and Fred goes to El Doro.

463
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,280
Listen carefully: this is the plan.

464
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,600
Hello, Colonel.

465
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:14,600
We are waiting Saturday.
-Lock her up in the church.

466
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,280
What are you her

467
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,320
That comes later.
All of Schuyler heard?

468
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,480
He is in Los Animas. Start
Next week he is not here.

469
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,680
Then we do it without him.
The less people, the better.

470
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,400
Listen men, we leave
today or tomorrow morning.

471
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,200
We can not drive.
Well, if you 't hear destination.

472
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,360
It is a big job
and I hebjullie all needed.

473
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,040
That will do.
-Where are we going?

474
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,160
You know the treasure
of the Silver Lake?

475
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,360
Sure.
-What about it?

476
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:03,920
We are the treasure
van 't Silver Lake search.

477
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,720
Do you with me?
-We are behind you, colonel.

478
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,280
Long live the colonel.

479
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,960
Alarm, alarm.

480
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Simpleton.
That is the man on wachfte who I.

481
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,640
Well?
-I set for a return.

482
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,160
The estimates for the girl.

483
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,760
That is a bad return
if I already have both.

484
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,600
Frisk him.

485
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,040

Pafterson has him.

487
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,080
This time ontsnapje not.

488
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,000
Say wanneerje want to talk.
Close him.

489
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,000
Let me go, let me go.

490
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,960
You have the card not required.
I know the road.

491
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,040
I point to you the way. But only
alsjullie Miss Pafterson release.

492
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:40,320
Well, we go on 'n hours.

493
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,760
Where is Miss Patterson?
-Bring him with her.

494
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,040
Only this again.

495
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:52,080
If your friends
to appear, then .. .

496
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:54,160
I understand that.

497
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,360
Comb the area around it from camp.
-Te horse. Kam 't field.

498
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,920
Old Shatterhand and your father
count it off with that gang.

499
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:28,040
But we are hostage.
-I know.

500
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:31,640
Shatterhand they want
by the lake in the decoy.

501
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,680
I get it.
-We will stop the colonel.

502
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,080
Shatterhand within driving by
Ute-through area.

503
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,120
I can not anymore.
-Halt.

504
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,120
What now?
-Miss Pafterson to rest.

505
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,000
Nonsense. They rest but if we
't Silver Lake are. Forward.

506
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,320
Alsje want to go but forward.
Without me to get there anyway.

507
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:00,880
We love stop here.

508
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,840
Halt.

509
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:14,920
Tonight we store here
our camp.

510
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,200
Saddle the horses and make
fire. I look around now.

511
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,560
Alarm. We are surrounded
by Ute-warriors.

512
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:22,800
Climbing on the rocks.
-Take your gun them.

513
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,640
Everybody in coverage.

514
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,200
Faces appeared, on geefje
to the Utes.

515
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,560
Why are you with us?

516
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,680
You have our village
massacred.

517
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,280
That is not true.

518
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:04,600
Listen, we have your village
not burned.

519
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,880
Great Wolf, chief
of the Utes, says that you are lying.

520
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:19,480
I, Old Shatterhand,
diejullie Pokaimu call ...

521
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,800
careful not to lie.
-Pokaimu?

522
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,400
We have you
never harm done.

523
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,600
Who killed Little Dipper then?
-Nobody.

524
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,840
I got him beaten unconscious.
He wanted to kill my friend.

525
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,880
Small Beer is not dead.
He sleeps now.

526
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,120
Why you shelled us?

527
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,800
Your warriors attacked us, but
we are friends of the Utes.

528
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,400
If that is true,
appearing for the tribal council.

529
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,000
As friends?
-If prisoners.

530
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:53,080
No. Then we prefer
the battle.

531
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:55,840
Dusjullie choose death?
-Maybe.

532
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,480
But there are also many Utes
die.

533
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,960
I have a magic rifle.

534
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,320
Accepteerje the view
Board of the tribe?

535
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:11,360
Only when we are guests
and our weapons may hold.

536
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,360
All time savings is now gone.

537
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,360
I love my holy word.
I have spoken.

538
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,920
Wait here.

539
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,120
Whatever happens,
we keep the horses with us.

540
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,040
Hopefully those guys have
already had breakfast.

541
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
Come forward.

542
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:20,360
The faces appeared to
the sun is high in the sky.

543
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,080
Then the council will speak.

544
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,800
The horses ...
-Keeping us.

545
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,240
You want to run?
-No.

546
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,440
We are your guests and not
your prisoners, Great Wolf.

547
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,520
Otherwise, my magic stick
speak. Take a look.

548
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,040
I'm clear, chief?

549
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,600
You would strain the Board
appear.

550
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,400
We can not wait,
we must continue.

551
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,840
If the shadow touches the spear,
will have the right to speak.

552
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:13,200
We are doing hours lost.

553
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,720
Come on, duke.

554
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,960
Drumming them out of anger?
Yes. But who are they angry?

555
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,760
The consultation is over.
-I should hope not.

556
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:13,840
Great Wolf
won 't happen verdict.

557
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,960
What? That klinM creepy.
-Silence.

558
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,400
Look, the medicine man
and 't chieftain.

559
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,480
Mankeer but I nieb.

560
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,040
According to the council did you
our village massacred.

561
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:34,480
We pull into battle
or ulcers .. .

562
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,960
that we kill every white
in our hands.

563
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:40,480
You may for your life
fight.

564
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,160
Not all.
Only Old Shatterhand.

565
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:45,720
Salad my friends Friday
if I win?

566
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,440
Yes, But you will not win.

567
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:53,160
Because Great Wolf
your opponent.

568
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:55,360
What weapons?
Ax-and knife.

569
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,560
What unfair.
I may not oppose him billiards?

570
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,600
It was found face
should keep his big mouth.

571
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,160
Well, when we fight?
-Now.

572
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:23,440
Wager 'n Papilio parinda
that guy is planning what?

573
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,520
Probeerjij now but once.
-Good.

574
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,960
But he can not
lie.

575
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,680
Soon he lies in the way
if we fight.

576
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:12,760
Great Wolf is so brave
like a rabbit.

577
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,640
If your scalp on my belt
depends, are you 're dead coward.

578
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,080
I am sick of an old t vrou_je
to follow.

579
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,600
If you're so courageous,
then stand still.

580
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,520
Well?
Who is the winner?

581
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:58,480
His scalp is now mine.
But I do not want him.

582
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,120
I am a friend of the Indians.

583
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,240
He is not dead.
I pour you his life.

584
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:08,840
Winnetou.
-My brother.

585
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,840
What's new with Ellen and Fred?
-Good.

586
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,200
The colonel with Fred and Ellen
ondeMreg to 't Silver Lake.

587
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:20,520
We must hurry.

588
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,840
The Ute-warriors
have abandoned their village.

589
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,840
They are followed you.
Come on, brother.

590
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,640
If the colonel is for us,
Fred and Ellen will die.

591
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,440
Look, there they are.

592
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,120
Thirty of warriors
Rolling Thursday follow us.

593
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:47,200
Great Wolf has lied.

594
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,040
No, that was still asleep
when the left was chased.

595
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:55,120
The Utes have been distilled by
Rolling the schemer Thursday.

596
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:58,120
On the card was' t path ...
-By the waterfall.

597
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:00,280
Spoken through Kloof
's more.

598
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:04,360
The gap can not be far.
But the Utes-follow us.

599
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,280
We should strike.
-Six men with guns.

600
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:12,360
Who will be the bait?
-Winnetou.

601
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,240
Hey, behind me.
This way.

602
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,320
Halt.

603
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:37,800
I know those hills yesterday.
We just drive around.

604
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,800
Then it was left.

605
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,160
On the card is only that:
Make a U-turn to the waterfall.

606
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:49,280
Go left.

607
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:02,760
Where are we, Fred?

608
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,560
On 'n indianenpad
Spoken by the Gorge.

609
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,400
Tomorrow we reach it anymore.

610
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,280
Fred? Is there another way
's Silver Lake?

611
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:14,800
No.

612
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:21,400
Then we had Shatterhands
spores have already seen?

613
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,480
Maybe they are days
on us.

614
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,680
And they have
obliterated their tracks.

615
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,920
Be quiet and try to sleep.

616
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,200
The Utes and only
Rolling Thursday 's got a gun.

617
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:49,200
The colonel was here this morning
yet. We must hurry.

618
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:53,200
You know the rest 't already?
-Yes, they close the gap off.

619
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:54,720
Good.

620
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:55,920
The Utes are weak and follow
the Rolling liar Thursday.

621
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:44,720
Weapons road, otherwise speaks
my magic stick.

622
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,480
The gap is closed. Geefje
about survival than you.

623
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,560
Why hide your
for your brothers?

624
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,680
Winnetou is our friend.

625
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,800
Here I am.

626
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:02,080
Great Wolf
the traitor punished.

627
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:09,600
Great Wolf held his word.
Pokaimu, saving our warriors now.

628
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,320
The battle between us and
Pokaimu's friends is over.

629
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,600
We are here.
There it is Silver Lake.

630
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,040
Dismount, men.

631
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,720
Where should we go?

632
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,520
Well? I am waiting.

633
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,280
The path must
to 'n chasm lead.

634
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:53,120
When we are through,
It 's not far.

635
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:55,800
Come on.
Scream-not.

636
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,640
Halt. I go first.

637
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,320
leather gets his share
and I determine how many that is.

638
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,120
The prisoners went along
Greg Gonzales and stay here.

639
01:27:06,279 --> 01:27:10,440
Why?
-Stay. Soon we share the spoils.

640
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:20,360
Tell me. Where is the treasure?
Where?

641
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:25,520
You would release us
ikje as that would tell.

642
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,480
Speak or she goes out.
I count to three.

643
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,720
One, _ee ...

644
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:40,160
On the card was the treasure
indicated ...

645
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:44,480
with a button nNart
on the bank to the other side.

646
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,440
And next?

647
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,960
Somewhere in the rocks
we need a cave to see.

648
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,440
Since the estimates are.

649
01:28:58,119 --> 01:29:01,040
Cap some trees.
We build a raft.

650
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,560
Hey, there.
Look out, look out.

651
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:28,280
But late fall.
-Well, we got him.

652
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:30,480
Now just watch.

653
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:36,120
Did you see him?

654
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:39,360
Yes, we got him.
Everything is fine.

655
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,160
Ellen, please maakje
t worry.

656
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,840
I get it in water. I'm fascinated
with leather straps ...

657
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,040
leather and stretched as it is wet.

658
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,640
Do alsofje what will drink.

659
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,920
What are you doing?
-I drink something. You can see that right?

660
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,360
Do not again.

661
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,320
Why should we both
continue? I go to it more.

662
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:33,520
Nothing of it.
-Be reasonable, Greg.

663
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,200
We toss it.
Me-best.

664
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:40,200
Lay down.

665
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,280
Even tightly drawn.
Good. Lay down.

666
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,240
Come on.

667
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,960
No movement.

668
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,000
Wildeje swindle me?

669
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,280
Come out.

670
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,160
Tie them tightly.

671
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,560
Come Colonel, give me that thing.

672
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,440
If Hilton, Knox, Hartley and I
about 3 hours in the cave are ...

673
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,680
you can hang him.
For her, but what you make.

674
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:44,360
Can not you guys a little faster?
Come on.

675
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:27,280
I am the friend
of all Indians.

676
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:31,280
The chief
has kept his word.

677
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,920
I need your help.
Not for myself ...

678
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:39,720
but the whites to beat
your village have been murder.

679
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:44,240
It is a large group
bad men.

680
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:47,880
But with your help
they get punished.

681
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,960
I have spoken.

682
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,320
Here we go ashore.

683
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:49,080
Who are you?

684
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,440
That is Tongkawa.
That means the Big Dipper.

685
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:01,480
He bewaaM the treasure.

686
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,120
Where is the treasure?

687
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:06,160
Where?

688
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:07,960
Where is the treasure?

689
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:12,120
Forget it.
We find him without you.

690
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,360
Gold, gold.
-Gold.

691
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,280
It is gold.

692
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:39,160
Come back.

693
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,240
But Colonel, there is enough
for all of us.

694
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,880
The three hours are over.
Remove the strap.

695
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,040
Shall we go find them?

696
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,560
Hey, colonel.

697
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,240
Hey, colonel.

698
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:28,840
Why is the Colonel
not yet recovered?

699
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,240
Then go look at themselves.
-You know it is not.

700
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:34,160
Hang him up.

701
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:37,040
His girl can 't see swing
in the wind.

702
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,080
Come to the battle.

703
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,520
Let him go.
He has done nieb.

704
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,120
Moop him.
Love his arm.

705
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:05,120
Get the strap.

706
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:11,720
Fred. No.

707
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:26,040
Take the boulder away.

708
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:21,520
These wretched helmet too.

709
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,960
Stop, no movement.

710
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,200
Stay dead still stand.

711
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,560
No. Please.
I have wife and children.

712
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:48,280
Papilio polymnestor parinda.

713
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,920
Do you believe now
that we are your friends?

714
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:22,680
The Utes are courageous and Large
Wolf is a good chief.

715
