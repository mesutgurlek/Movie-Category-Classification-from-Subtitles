1
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,673
GARDEN OF EVIL

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,395
- Captain, what's this town called?
- Puerto Miguel.

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,033
- Is it alive?
- It's asleep.

4
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
When the sun falls people
will get up. They call it a siesta.

5
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,638
Do we have to siesta here
for 4 weeks?

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,472
4, 5, 6...

7
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,029
- Take that long to fix an engine?
- Not me. The engineer.

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,760
I didn't make the steamboat,
I just operate one.

9
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,596
- Captain, wait!
- Every mother's son

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,399
is picking up gold by the fistful
in California

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,873
and I'm marooned in a Mexican village
called Pu...

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,197
- What did he call it?
- Puerto Miguel.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,079
Puerto Miguel.

14
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,950
- But what can we do about it?
- Nothing.

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,029
- They must have some alcohol.
- I think so.

16
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,153
There we are.

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,079
It's a funny thing.

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,116
I know everybody on board except you.
I don't know anything about you.

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,912
- Your called Hooker and that's it.
- That's it.

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,516
That kid thinks he knows you
from Texas, but he can't remember.

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,872
Then it couldn't have been much.

22
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,720
And even if it was,
it wouldn't be any of my business.

23
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,394
I can't see how.

24
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,076
Being a professional gambler,
I like to know the people I meet

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,435
because I might play them sometime.

26
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,318
That's what makes me so inquisitive.

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,474
- That's natural.
- I'm also a kind of poet

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,956
and all kinds of people
interest me.

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,390
- That makes sense.
- I see what I can get out of them,

30
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,996
either their money
or their character, or both.

31
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,954
You've heard of "getting blood
out of a stone", haven't you?

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,240
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm getting out of you.

33
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,749
Two drinks.

34
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,358
Two drinks.

35
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,998
This is the way my luck's running.

36
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,434
I can speak two languages,

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,398
but I'm in a country
that isn't one of them.

38
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,473
I found that pretty women
speak the same language everywhere.

39
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,476
- What about the ugly ones?
- I never listened.

40
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,639
It's not as bad as I thought it'd be.
It's worse.

41
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,311
Somebody once said:
"Believe nothing a woman says,

42
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,469
but believe everything she sings."

43
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,995
- Who said that?
- Me.

44
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,519
What's the trouble with him?

45
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,308
What's he saying?

46
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,399
He disliked the way that man
was looking at his girl.

47
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,348
You see we want to be peaceful
and friendly.

48
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,071
We may be here
for quite a while.

49
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,952
I can handle myself.

50
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,031
- I'm sure of it.
- You think not?

51
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,839
- He just said "he was sure of it."
- Relax, Daly.

52
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,470
It may not be as bad as you think.

53
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,837
We can fish in the mornings,
get drunk in the afternoons

54
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,438
and we can play cards at night.

55
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,954
- You might even get lucky.
- Like catching lighting in a bottle.

56
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,670
Fiske, you know what you can do
with a deck of cards?

57
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,869
You can tell my fortune.

58
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,748
Anything you like.

59
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,473
The Red Queen.
That means that...

60
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,234
What do you know.

61
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,837
- What's she saying?
- She's got a mine.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,992
Her husband is trapped in a cave-in.
She wants help to get him out.

63
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,915
- She'll pay 1,000 dollars a man.
- There ain't a man at the bar.

64
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,392
Did you hear what I said?
Did you understand?

65
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,353
He just told us.

66
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,632
I offered them a thousand a piece.

67
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,674
I'll double it for any of you
if you'll help.

68
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,116
A man is lying out there hurt,
maybe dying. An American.

69
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,434
- Lf that isn't enough...
- The price is right.

70
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,636
- But, why is it so high?
- Is a man's life too high a price?

71
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,877
I didn't put the price on it,
you did.

72
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,995
I don't know what to do
or what to say.

73
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,432
- I've got to get help or he'll die.
- Lady, won't you sit down?

74
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,349
Why will none of them go
even for so much money?

75
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,069
None of them will go out there.
They're afraid of the Indians.

76
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,759
Are you?
You don't look afraid.

77
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,078
Ma'am, the thing I'm afraid off
still hasn't been found.

78
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,716
He says only fools go up there.
He must be one.

79
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,473
He's going with her.

80
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,759
- You said 2,000 dollars?
- You've got it in your hand.

81
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,959
- All right, I'll go.
- 2,000 for each of the rest of you.

82
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,674
You?

83
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,517
Madam, I can live anywhere
in the world for 6 weeks,

84
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,639
but alone in this town.

85
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,948
Meet me in an hour
at the blacksmith's shop.

86
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,355
I'd like for one of you
to come with me now.

87
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,589
You.

88
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,190
- Are we lost?
- No.

89
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,598
We pass the face of that cliff.

90
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,314
What's this all about?

91
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,676
There's Indians here
and they left a message.

92
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,229
- What does it say?
- It's Apache.

93
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,914
- What else?
- That's enough.

94
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,916
Isn't there another way
we could go back?

95
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,510
- Not that I know of.
- Great.

96
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,352
How did you find this place?

97
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,793
With a map from an old priest
in Sacramento.

98
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,717
- He warned us against it.
- What did he come here for?

99
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,954
For God.

100
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,675
A better reason that ours,
isn't it?

101
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,953
Vicente's marking the trail.

102
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,350
Do you think
he'll want to come back?

103
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,234
He just might want
to get back from this one.

104
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,356
How did you happen to be
in Puerto Miguel?

105
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,311
We came around the Horn
headed for the gold fields.

106
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,277
The ship broke down
and we headed into the port.

107
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,476
- You came together?
- No.

108
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,520
- So, you don't know each other?
- No better than you do.

109
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,479
Look at her.

110
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,232
Taking 4 men like us
to a mountain of gold.

111
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,473
- She took what there was.
- That's true.

112
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,029
The barrel was empty,
she scrapped the bottom.

113
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,717
- How far is this place?
- Several days.

114
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,760
I wonder how she remembers
the way.

115
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,469
- Maybe she's got a good memory.
- No.

116
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,072
No, she's got a map.

117
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,236
She takes it out, unfolds it,
and then puts it away carefully.

118
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,352
When she thinks no one's looking.

119
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,388
- But you were.
- Always.

120
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,709
Look.

121
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,352
You see that? Before this is over,
you'll be just like that horse.

122
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,676
Eating right out of her hand.

123
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,588
Maybe it isn't the woman,
maybe it's the sugar.

124
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,630
Not you, Daly. Me.
I got a better reason.

125
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,518
You telling me what to do?

126
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,795
- Just this once.
- Just once, Hooker.

127
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,155
Nobody ever tells me
what to do.

128
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,392
All right.
This time I'm asking you.

129
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,597
I don't think I like him.

130
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,913
I don't think I like any part of him.
You understand?

131
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,274
- There's nothing more simple.
- And I'm not sure if I like you.

132
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,229
I'm talking.
Don't turn your back on me.

133
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,072
You're right. A man should never
turn his back on you.

134
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,715
Not if he cared for his life.

135
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,917
But I'm a peculiar man.
I don't care.

136
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,038
You followed me,
didn't you?

137
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,678
If you want to know
where you're going, ask me.

138
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,472
You can tell the others too.

139
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,837
Tell them, that without me
they're nowhere, they're lost.

140
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,959
And when you're lost in this country,
you're dead.

141
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,152
Then you won't need that gun.

142
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,190
You underrated me, Hooker.
Don't do it.

143
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,279
I don't think I will.

144
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,870
It looked like a good thing.
It looked like a miracle.

145
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,871
A woman leading you
to a gold mine

146
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,190
in a country where nobody goes
and anything can happen.

147
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,994
- Go on.
- Did you imagine I thought

148
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,957
you were doing this
to save a man's life?

149
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,675
A miserable little thing
like a man's life?

150
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,197
- Are you?
- You don't think so?

151
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,994
I think so.

152
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,318
I think anyone would care
about a man's life being in danger,

153
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,271
especially if it was
in a gold mine.

154
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,749
Say, Hooker,

155
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,196
before you became an idiot
looking for gold, what were you?

156
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,392
An idiot without any.

157
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,157
Is he still marking up the way?

158
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,797
I think he's memorizing it.

159
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,548
Are you?

160
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,157
- Does he know she's wiped his marks?
- I doubt it.

161
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,111
You'd think she'd get tired.

162
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,278
She's like something hammered
out of silver.

163
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,515
Now you, you're made out of leather.

164
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,834
Vicente, volcanic rock.

165
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,832
- And you?
- Words and flesh.

166
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,230
I think I'm the only
human being here.

167
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,278
- She's human.
- How can you tell?

168
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,758
- Because of what's driving her.
- And what is?

169
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,632
That man in the mine.

170
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,639
It makes every mile
and every hour precious.

171
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,992
Well, you sound
almost human yourself.

172
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,068
We'll camp there for tonight.

173
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,032
Not many hours old.

174
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,478
- Some kind of a ceremony or ritual.
- Who?

175
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,319
- Apaches. A new moon last night.
- So what?

176
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,876
This is a special month for them.
It's, "The Moon of the White man."

177
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,998
- How do you know?
- He knows everything. Let him talk.

178
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,353
It's from when they wiped out
all the settlements, like this one.

179
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,069
You know, back in that saloon
2,000 seemed like quite a bundle,

180
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,076
but out here it's dwindling fast.

181
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,756
Don't listen to him, it's a legend
he got from the priest in town.

182
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,030
But he was here.
This was his church.

183
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,956
Do you think they care about us?

184
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,635
They killed those who took
the land and built on it.

185
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,872
People who made homes
and fences and came to stay.

186
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,830
People like us, who hunt for gold
and run away with it,

187
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,312
do you think we're worth killing?

188
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,275
Maybe you're right when there were
two of you, a man and his wife.

189
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,510
- But now...
- Now you listen to me, all of you.

190
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,350
I hired you
to save a man's life.

191
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,354
It might be a little dangerous,
that's why I paid you good.

192
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,793
If a man's life isn't worth a risk,
tell me how much you want.

193
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,439
Go ahead. Tell me how much more.

194
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,834
- What's eating her?
- She's just tired.

195
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,718
Let's make the coffee.

196
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,319
- She put you in your place.
- All of us.

197
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,436
At first I thought
she was one of those women

198
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,559
who come along and fascinate men
without trying or knowing why.

199
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,553
And now what?

200
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,836
She tries and she knows why.

201
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,552
Tell me some more
about this White Man's Moon.

202
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,432
It's an open season.

203
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,398
- On what?
- On you and me.

204
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,034
What do you want?

205
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,918
What you said about quitting
and leaving with the money.

206
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,798
You didn't mean me,
did you?

207
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,873
I didn't come along for that.
They did, but I didn't.

208
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,550
That's all they're after,
but not me.

209
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,076
And don't be afraid of them
because I'm watching them.

210
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,319
I'm with you, Leah.

211
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,196
I know what's going on,
but I'm not with them.

212
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,477
It ain't the money with me,
it's you, you know that?

213
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,392
Take your hands off me.

214
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,793
You animal!

215
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,028
You scum!

216
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,917
Go to bed. We got enough trouble
without your problems. That's all.

217
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,113
- Is it? Is that all?
- You heard me.

218
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,630
What if I say it ain't all?
What if I say it ain't?

219
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,429
- Say what you want.
- All right. I'll say something.

220
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,069
Yeah, I think I'll say something.

221
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,191
I've had a gutful of you,
Hooker.

222
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,630
And I'll say it
the way I talk the best.

223
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,870
- Put that way, Daly.
- I've killed men like you before.

224
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,114
Yeah. I know about you.

225
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,076
You killed them
for rewards on their head

226
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,468
when nothing could be done
except give you the cash.

227
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,633
You shot them at tables
or in their beds.

228
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,312
Wherever their eyes were shut
or their backs turned.

229
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,393
I know about you.

230
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,236
I'll let you square yourself.

231
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,836
- Killing a man face to face.
- I'm telling you, Hooker.

232
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,509
I'm telling you!

233
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,839
I'm telling you!

234
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,709
Stop it.

235
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,473
Blame yourself.

236
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,075
Don't blame Daly or me,
or anybody but yourself.

237
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,398
- What do you think you're saying?
- I know what I'm saying.

238
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,959
And so do you.

239
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,870
If you want to get where
you're going, get some rest. Go on.

240
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,631
Here. Wash your face.

241
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,112
You'll be all right.
You just made a fool out of yourself.

242
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,279
Don't think it hasn't happened
to anybody else. All of us.

243
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,758
You just didn't understand it.

244
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,799
There's only one thing in her head.
That man out there.

245
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,954
Nothing else.
Now you know.

246
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,236
- Why didn't you kill me?
- I need you.

247
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,077
You don't need anybody, Hooker.
You don't need any of us.

248
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,879
I will.

249
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,872
We'll all need each other.

250
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,113
Come on, now.
Get to bed.

251
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,711
You got everything fixed now?

252
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,032
It'll hold for a while.

253
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,989
You see how it is? Now she's got
you fighting for her honour.

254
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,475
She's got you going unharmed against
a man she turned into an idiot.

255
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,598
- A boy.
- It was very heroic.

256
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,748
I admired you enormously.
I'm sure she did, too.

257
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,397
Some day, like Salome,

258
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,039
she'll have you bringing her
the head of Vicente in a frying pan.

259
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,994
- Or yours.
- No, not mine, Hooker.

260
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,152
Mine belongs to you.

261
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,758
- And you know what they say.
- What do they say?

262
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,675
Two heads are better than one.

263
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,315
Take one.

264
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,469
Put it back.

265
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,749
Sí?

266
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,034
- What's he say?
- He wants to do it again.

267
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,392
Shuffle? Cut?

268
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,035
Cut?

269
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,156
- How far will it be now?
- Tomorrow.

270
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,550
We could ride tonight
and be there in the morning.

271
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,278
Only the horses don't ride.

272
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,632
Do you want to tell me about him?

273
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,631
- Tell you? Tell you what?
- Anything.

274
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,918
He's a mining engineer.

275
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,430
We prospected in California
and we got a map from a priest.

276
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,440
A map of this country,
this place.

277
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,150
It was a boom town once.
A volcano covered it with lava.

278
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,717
Everything except a church steeple
and a mine shaft.

279
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,989
In 3 hours they lost half of God
and most of the gold.

280
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,077
- And they never went back?
- No, they were afraid.

281
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,629
Indians?

282
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,438
Yes, after the volcano
it became sacred to the Indians.

283
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,793
- A place of evil spirits.
- But you don't believe in them.

284
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,638
- Do you?
- I believe in Indians.

285
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,276
That's it. The town buried
in the lava from the volcano,

286
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,873
and the mine's on the other side.

287
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,794
Let's ride.

288
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,118
He's alive. He's all right.
He's alive.

289
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,198
Here, take it easy.

290
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,753
Be careful. I tried that
and it caved in.

291
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,792
We'll need timbers to support this.
Get some timbers, Daly

292
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,589
Here, try this.

293
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,679
Hold up that end.

294
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,912
- Use this for his feet.
- All right.

295
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,354
- Watch out when you lift his leg.
- Roll him over.

296
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,358
There we go.
Vicente, get on that end.

297
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,873
Take him to the house.

298
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,597
All right, get out.

299
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,358
I want to try and fix his leg
while he's still out.

300
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,351
- I'll help you.
- Take her out.

301
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,839
Come on, let's go.

302
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,948
Leave him alone.

303
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,069
Don't talk.

304
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,469
Don't try.

305
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,755
You'll be all right.

306
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,153
It was right there.
I kept shooting at it.

307
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,391
- I kept missing...
- Don't talk about it now.

308
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,592
You...

309
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,954
You...
You came back.

310
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,033
I'm here. You'll be all right.

311
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,148
He will be, won't he?
He'll be all right?

312
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,790
- He has a fractured leg.
- Is it bad?

313
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,875
I don't know. He'll live.
Get him some hot coffee and soup.

314
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,352
Heat some water and wash him.

315
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,479
How bad is his leg?

316
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,751
- I don't know.
- Can he ride?

317
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,197
- Not sure. Maybe when he's stronger.
- What if he can't?

318
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,436
He'll have to be carried
on a litter, if he does go.

319
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,873
What do you mean "if "?

320
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,193
He may stay. He's got supplies here.
He came to stay.

321
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,714
Where's Daly?

322
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,590
He's in the mine.
He's digging gold out of the wall.

323
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,276
I told him we'd be staying,
no need to get it all in one day.

324
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,872
He's crazy again.

325
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,836
First it was the woman,
not it's the gold.

326
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,239
He wants one or the other
even if it gets him killed.

327
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,515
It could.

328
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,356
- What will you do?
- Wash up with some water over here.

329
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,394
How is he?

330
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,799
He's sleeping.

331
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,590
- Who's he?
- He came back to help get you out.

332
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,919
He fixed your leg.

333
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,190
- Is it bad?
- I can't tell.

334
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,754
I can.

335
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,233
Just lie there.

336
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,070
I've made you soup and coffee.

337
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,474
I'll get it. You better
stay off of that awhile, Fuller.

338
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,157
- Where did you find him?
- Puerto Miguel.

339
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,869
Here, drink this.

340
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,914
You found him. Just like that
you found him.

341
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,073
Just like that.

342
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,069
A woman like her
going all the way to Miguel

343
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,509
and coming back for me.
Can you imagine that?

344
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,751
- I don't have to.
- I have to.

345
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,317
Days and nights in that black hole
trying to imagine it.

346
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,553
But I had time to think.
And you know what I thought about?

347
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,589
You and me.

348
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,950
And I said to myself:
"Sure, she'll be back."

349
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,678
"She'll be back,
but not for you".

350
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,115
And I knew then
that none of it was ever for me.

351
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,871
From the beginning to the end of it,
in that black hole.

352
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,995
And I knew what a fool I was
to be there

353
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,198
and who made me that fool
and why.

354
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,472
It was the gold, Leah.
Never anything else.

355
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,358
I was in love with you.

356
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,349
How could I know that all you saw
in me was someone to risk his life

357
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,276
to grovel, to dig?

358
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,637
That's all I ever meant to you.

359
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,596
A pick and shovel
to get your gold.

360
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,558
Yes, I wanted gold.
I wanted all the things it can buy.

361
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,319
Most people do.
I didn't want it like this.

362
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,314
Here, take this.

363
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,028
- Why?
- You want to live, don't you?

364
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,431
- Who cares?
- Just drink it, Fuller.

365
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,078
You falling for it too?

366
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,551
You're next.
You follow me.

367
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,352
I don't follow anybody.

368
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,711
You think I'm wrong.
You think I've gone crazy.

369
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,797
I think you talk too much.

370
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,397
One thing,
you don't have to worry about me.

371
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,638
- I'll try not to.
- Because it's being taken care of.

372
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,233
- What is?
- Me, her, all of you.

373
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,718
They're up there in those hills,
hundreds of them.

374
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,712
They came to the door of the mine
and stood there and looked at me.

375
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,958
You know why they didn't kill me?

376
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,550
Because they couldn't come up
with a worse way to do it.

377
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,831
But they will for you and her
and that scum. You tell her that.

378
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,478
Tell her not to worry about me.
We'll all be murdered together.

379
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,589
Tell her!

380
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,589
Tell her!

381
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,434
Vicente has got a bottle of mescal
in his bag. Would you like some?

382
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,474
No, thanks.

383
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,758
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

384
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,875
He's had a bad time.
He's a bit out of his head.

385
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,595
No, he isn't. He's wanted
to say that for a while.

386
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,399
And he finally said it.

387
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,519
- Is it true?
- It is to him.

388
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,999
What is it to you?

389
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,430
No one is all true to anybody
or anything.

390
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,792
- Some people are.
- Yes? Where are they?

391
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,749
I don't know. I don't move
in those circles. But some men have.

392
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,429
Like this one.

393
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,869
- What were you before? A preacher?
- A sheriff.

394
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,675
They're robbing you.

395
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,990
- Did you think they wouldn't?
- No.

396
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,998
When do you get yours?
Or is it yours already?

397
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,872
In a little while
it won't be anybody's.

398
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,111
- Why do you say that?
- We've got company.

399
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,788
Up there in the hills.

400
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,790
- Do the others know?
- They don't know anything.

401
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,110
They just want to get rich
before they die.

402
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,759
Let's go, partner.

403
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,590
- Can you guide them back?
- I'd just go with the sun.

404
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,557
Then get out of here tonight.

405
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,438
I'll build a fire
and move around.

406
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,750
It'll fool them long enough
to get a head start.

407
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,388
- And Fuller?
- You take him with you.

408
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,113
I thought you hated each other.

409
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,995
I don't hate him.

410
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,192
- He's trying hard to hate you.
- I know it.

411
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,349
You took him too far.
You took him over his head.

412
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,355
You made a coward of him
and he hates you for it.

413
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,751
It could happen to any man
with a woman like you.

414
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,918
- Any man?
- Well, almost.

415
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,636
There's gold in that shack.
Everything that's been taken out.

416
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,994
It's yours. I'll show you
where it is. You can have it

417
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,229
if you take him with you.

418
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,954
I'll tell them.

419
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,910
- Who's giving the party?
- It's rather impromptu.

420
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,475
They're inheriting a fortune
from Fuller.

421
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,795
I hope they don't get tired
of hats.

422
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,514
- What'd you tell him?
- That when you stop fooling around

423
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,398
you can go up and string
their bows for them.

424
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,028
- They're up there behind us. Indians.
- How do you know?

425
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,156
- Fuller.
- He saw them?

426
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,039
- He's crazy. He's out of his head.
- I'm not.

427
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,031
- You saw them?
- I saw their smoke.

428
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,236
Let's get out of here.
What are we waiting for?

429
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,717
- She has an idea.
- What? What's her idea?

430
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,399
You want to tell them?

431
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,070
I thought it'd be better
if you left at night.

432
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,517
I'll stay and keep a fire going.
They'll think you're still here.

433
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,878
It'll give you a long time,
a good start.

434
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,157
I don't get this at all.
What's the trick to this?

435
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,193
We take Fuller with us.

436
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,398
- Can he ride?
- Lf he can't, we'll carry him.

437
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,113
- Carry him?
- On a litter.

438
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,193
Are you crazy? You can't carry
him on a litter across that country.

439
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,557
Ask him.
Ask him if he'll carry Fuller.

440
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,439
And how about you?
Maybe you and Vicente?

441
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,111
Besides, why doesn't he stay?

442
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,595
He risked his life
for a ton of gold, I didn't.

443
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,230
- I'm not losing mine for him.
- You'll lose it if no one stays.

444
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,790
Can't Fuller stay?
We've all got business in P. Miguel?

445
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,996
Now, wait a minute.
What she means is

446
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,233
if somebody stays
and moves around the fire,

447
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,952
it'll look like we're still here.
And Fuller can't move.

448
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,593
You've got no choice
because you only have one chance.

449
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,918
What's she trying to prove?

450
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,239
That one of us is a hero
or a fool, or both.

451
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,958
Anyway, it's her funeral.
I don't go to any but my own.

452
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,675
You think it's a good idea.?

453
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,674
At least it is one.

454
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,512
You mean, you let her stay?

455
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,275
- Why didn't you ask her?
- Ask her, what?

456
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,313
Ask her if you could.

457
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,791
I liked your speech out there.

458
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,755
I thought it had a good idea.
It was very dramatic too.

459
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,639
You staying behind to save the life
of the man you once loved.

460
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,358
I didn't believe the truth
could move you so much.

461
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,117
- What truth?
- What Fuller told you.

462
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,154
He couldn't get to you heart
so he got to your pride.

463
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,198
And you decided to make this play.
You'll stay behind.

464
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,038
It isn't that much. A few hours
might give you a whole night.

465
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,274
- Don't make more of it than it is.
- I'm not.

466
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,996
I'm making it exactly what it is.

467
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,716
- What are you trying to say?
- That it's a fake...

468
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,236
A grandstand,
a trick.

469
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,915
That you think no one
will let you stay.

470
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,435
That you never had the least
intention of staying.

471
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,233
That no 5 men will ride away
leaving you here for a decoy.

472
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,948
- You believe that?
- Just like you do.

473
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,229
But it's a good trick,
and it'll work.

474
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,313
On who?

475
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,994
On me.

476
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,788
Because I'm staying with you.

477
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,355
Why?

478
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,677
Because I'm a fool.

479
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,754
Not to me.

480
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,994
What am I to you?

481
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,196
- Maybe it'll help if I tell you.
- It won't.

482
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:45,190
It's easy because it's nothing.
You're nothing at all.

483
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,199
Just nothing.

484
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,552
Another, Leah?

485
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,798
This one understands you,
but still he can't help it.

486
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,633
Now I know if I'd have understood
it, I'd have been the same.

487
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,156
They'll work and kill
and even get killed for you.

488
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,349
How do you do it, Leah?
What are you?

489
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,078
I'll get you ready to go.

490
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,868
You're staying
and he doesn't believe it.

491
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,911
He doesn't believe in you.
He despises you.

492
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,957
But he'd stay.

493
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,710
- Leah.
- Yes.

494
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,073
So would I.

495
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,592
I don't need it.
I can ride.

496
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,392
- I think I can ride.
- All right. Try that horse.

497
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,037
- Let's get rid of this.
- All right.

498
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,833
It's all right.
I can ride.

499
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,074
- How long will you stay?
- Don't worry. Here's the map.

500
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,035
If his leg holds up
we ought to get pretty far.

501
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,872
What should we do,
stay and gab about it?

502
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,310
- I don't go for this.
- Then stay out of it.

503
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,232
It's a little late for that.

504
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,195
It's too late.
Get on your horse.

505
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,919
You heard him.

506
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,278
- Are you sure you want it this way?
- You'd better get going.

507
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,789
I think you're right.

508
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,675
This will do.
We'll rest here.

509
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,479
On the dead run we don't have
too good a chance.

510
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,628
With this cripple along to slow us
down. Now you want to camp.

511
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,909
We're going to rest.
He's exhausted.

512
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,198
He can rest later.
I say we keep moving.

513
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,034
- Lf that's what you think, go ahead.
- Alone? Followed by Indians?

514
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,796
You've got a sack of gold,
buy them off.

515
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,754
- I'll build a fire and make coffee.
- No fire.

516
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,196
Don't you think
they know where we are?

517
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,711
Or how you came
or how you'll have to go back?

518
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:46,239
This isn't your best chance.
You have to ride and fight for it.

519
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,150
But you'd have to get rid of me.
Have you thought about that?

520
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,199
- I haven't.
- No, but they have.

521
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,557
That young one has,
hasn't he?

522
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,954
Why don't you answer?
Why don't you say it?

523
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,238
All right, I'll say it.
You have to cry like a sick cat.

524
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,314
How many times
will you have to die?

525
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,438
You never wanted to share
your gold.

526
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,875
What do you want them to share
your death with you for?

527
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,517
Somebody else got something to say?

528
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,551
Fiske, Vicente,
watch that end of the ridge.

529
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,918
You, take this end.

530
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,633
He's really not like this.
He's not this way.

531
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,153
- None of us are.
- You are.

532
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,198
I'll go fix some food.

533
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,709
Come here.

534
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,157
You want to get rid of me?
You hate me enough.

535
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,789
I don't care about you
one way or the other,

536
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,954
but we might get out of here
and you're blocking it.

537
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,032
I won't any more.
Help me with a horse.

538
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,312
- Where you going?
- What does that matter to you?

539
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,115
Nothing

540
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,154
Hold it, Daly.

541
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,715
He's dead.
He let Fuller get away.

542
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,556
- Why didn't you stop him?
- I tried. Get on your horse.

543
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,188
Hooker, here.

544
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,517
Why don't they take us?
What are they waiting for?

545
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,559
Maybe they like it this way,
one at a time in a place they pick.

546
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,355
John!

547
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,909
Don't look, it's no use.

548
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,389
Hooker.

549
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,115
Easy.

550
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,948
This ought to do.

551
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,514
- Coffee?
- No fire.

552
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,035
No coffee.

553
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,478
There's a little cave over there.

554
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,996
I could build a fire in it,
cook something warm for her.

555
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,909
- Do you think we ought to?
- It doesn't matter any more.

556
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,153
Go ahead. We'll camp.

557
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,958
- You couldn't sleep either?
- I did for awhile.

558
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,360
Every time I close my eyes
I see that cross.

559
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,236
I didn't think he hated me that much.
That he couldn't stay near me.

560
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,995
Maybe he didn't.
Maybe he loved you.

561
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,595
After all he said?

562
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,399
After all any man says,
it's what he does that counts.

563
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,676
- How do you mean?
- I mean...

564
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,832
He was a dead weight. He was
holding us back and he knew it.

565
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,196
You gave him
a chance to live.

566
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,070
Maybe he did the same for you.

567
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,709
I wish I could remember him
like that and believe it.

568
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,833
I do.

569
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,879
Go on to sleep.

570
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,396
A cross isn't a bad thing to see.

571
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,435
It can be beautiful
and everybody has one.

572
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,559
That was his.

573
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,994
Go on to sleep.

574
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,234
- Are we near that trail?
- It's a little way.

575
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,470
It's narrow,
they might not follow us.

576
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,509
Ride for it.

577
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,957
This looks like the place to stay.

578
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,153
When they want to try that trail
they're welcome.

579
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,999
Couldn't they come around the hill?

580
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,237
It'll take them a long time.
Too long for them

581
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,832
This is the chance I thought we had.

582
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,350
- You mean, if we stay here?
- Or one of us.

583
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,239
What does that mean?

584
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,398
You take her and get out of here.
I'll stay here for awhile.

585
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,792
- How long?
- I can hold it pretty long.

586
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,430
- I couldn't?
- You're a cardsharp.

587
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,353
With a rifle you can't hit
a broadside of that mountain.

588
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,229
- You want to bet something?
- I haven't got anything.

589
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,313
Neither have I. How about
our lives? They're not worth much.

590
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,988
Just do what I told you.

591
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,472
Hooker, you told everybody else,
but don't tell me.

592
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,869
Don't tell me what to do.

593
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,151
- No one of you are going to do this.
- Why not?

594
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,231
- Not for me.
- Who said anything about you?

595
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,391
This is between us.
This is a bet we're making.

596
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,278
Don't listen to him.

597
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,479
He's tried to make me bet something
for a long time. I accept.

598
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,509
All right.

599
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,915
- High card stays?
- That's good enough.

600
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,638
You never trust me.

601
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,149
I was always told, cut the deck.
You can't win but you'll last longer.

602
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,679
Are you both crazy?

603
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,638
- Have you gone crazy too?
- You stay out of this.

604
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,679
For once something has got nothing
to do with you. Cut.

605
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,557
Age before beauty.

606
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,797
You lose.
Now get out.

607
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,710
You bet something
and you won, so take it.

608
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,393
Take it and get out.

609
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,678
And take her with you.

610
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,435
This is the only thing
I was ever lucky at:

611
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,872
cards.

612
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,708
See you later.

613
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,993
Sure, see you there.

614
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,919
You're in the clear now.

615
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,993
The old priest called it,
"The Garden of Evil."

616
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:31,235
Fiske. He cheated me back there.

617
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,516
I don't know how,
but I know why.

618
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,037
- Why?
- You.

619
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,429
- You'd have stayed if you'd won.
- Yes.

620
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,195
- Why?
- Somebody always stays.

621
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,638
All over the world,
somebody gets it done.

622
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,952
He cheated me. He's better than
I thought he was, in every way.

623
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,475
I've got to go back and tell him.
I've got to go back now.

624
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:07,477
- You knew that?
- Yes.

625
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:10,754
I'll see you sometime.

626
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,149
No, don't.

627
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,909
Don't move me.

628
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,753
You...

629
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,039
you said I

630
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,954
couldn't hit the side
of a mountain.

631
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,029
- Look at that.
- You did real good.

632
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,517
One thing I had against you,

633
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,437
you knew so much.

634
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,359
You always knew everything.

635
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,628
Not quite.

636
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,353
You were right about her.

637
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,679
But not about you.
You cheated me.

638
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,469
- You come back to tell me?
- That's right.

639
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,239
There it goes, Hooker.

640
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,630
Everyday it goes

641
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,832
and somebody always goes with it.

642
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,918
Today it's me.

643
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,232
Yeah, I cheated you.
You want to forget it?

644
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,159
No.

645
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,835
Go home, Hooker.
Go home.

646
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,835
Build one somewhere.

647
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,549
Get a hammer and nails.

648
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,589
You know how,
you know everything.

649
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,838
Take...

650
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,670
Take her home.

651
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,396
The Garden of Evil.

652
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,111
If the earth was made of gold,

653
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:21,074
I guess men would die
for a handful of dirt.
