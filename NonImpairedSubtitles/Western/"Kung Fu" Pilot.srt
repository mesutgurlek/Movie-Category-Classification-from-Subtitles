00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Rip by ZenitZenZen

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,930
Who controls the rebound, wins the match...

3
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:12,914
Just as to who has a left hook,
that would move a tank.

4
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,251
However...

5
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,743
slam dunk makes me feel good.

6
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,949
To a kindhearted person.

7
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:51,038
Big Brother,

8
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:54,019
I found this baby by chance.

9
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,575
I can only leave it to you.

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,579
But I feel my fate
is connected to this child.

11
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,168
Here, count this as its present to you.

12
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,597
I can't read.

13
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:10,356
You can read. Please teach him this.

14
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,524
'Faltering Universe... '

15
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,955
For God's sake! It's 'Altering Universe'

16
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,788
So it is...

17
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:27,240
He's born for martial arts.

18
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,051
Is he? So, please look after him.

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,281
Goodbye.
Jump!

20
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,747
Your Lightness Kung Fu has improved a lot!

21
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,936
Next time you wanna jump,

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,166
please put some shoes on.

23
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,205
The world was divided into Heaven and Earth
when 'Qiqn and Kun' were created.

24
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,574
Every life form originated
from Yin and Yang.

25
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,670
All changes in life forms in this world'

26
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,581
are related to 'Qi

27
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,566
Master, I don't get it.

28
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,933
Everything in this world
is made of tiny particles.

29
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:04,058
'Altering Universe'
disassembles those particles,

30
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,179
taking everything apart,

31
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,265
then rebuilds it.

32
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:10,117
In a split second,

33
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:12,703
time is stopped.

34
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:15,280
You can even turn the clock back.

35
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,561
Master

36
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,975
Master

37
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,668
Master

38
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,075
Can anyone help my Master?

39
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,475
Any one?

40
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,629
Master!

41
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:40,457
Master!

42
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,167
Master...

43
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:57,358
My name is Fang Shijie.
I grew up in this Kung Fu school.

44
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,634
My Master told me
I was found next to a basketball court.

45
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,965
Now,

46
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:06,456
whenever I hear the sound of ball thumping,

47
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,781
my heartbeat increases...

48
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,072
It's not a heart attack.
It's because I will see her there.

49
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,599
I'm too old for love affairs...

50
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:32,315
But speaking of my love life,
it's been very eventful.

51
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,454
You see, in my life,

52
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,878
there have been 3 girls
who would die for me.

53
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,260
When I first discovered love,

54
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,446
there was a girl who would die for me...

55
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:43,427
If you keep stalking me,
I'll kill myself.

56
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,060
When I was an adolescent,

57
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,788
there was a girl who would wait for me
until the next life.

58
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,128
Wanna be my boyfriend?

59
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,445
Wait till your next life!

60
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:58,722
When I was poor and lonely,

61
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,120
there was a girl who would die with me.

62
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,409
If you don't give me the money back...

63
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,464
I'll jump from here with you!

64
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,518
This is a Kung Fu school.

65
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,110
Sure you can tell that?

66
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,227
This is where I grew up.

67
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:33,140
Technically speaking, since my Master
died from attempting 'Altering Universe',

68
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,283
I've become ever more defiant.

69
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,849
They're Master Fei and Master Wu.

70
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,055
The traditions of Shaolin and Wudang
have been passed on

71
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,826
from one generation to the other.
They're the masters of the 88th

72
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:48,973
and the 99th generations of the schools.

73
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,686
They are a couple,

74
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,604
Master Ni and Master Huang.

75
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,225
Oh, right,
they were pen pals before.

76
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,319
Good day! Headmaster!

77
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:42,445
There is someone else at the school
who you should know...

78
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,683
He's the so-called 'World No. 1 Fist God'

79
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,689
Our Headmaster - Wang Biao.

80
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:16,983
Everyone saw?

81
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,272
In the world of martial arts...

82
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,613
This is my job...

83
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,949
Headmaster's human punch bag.

84
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:25,024
But his fists are so weak,

85
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,663
as long as I put on my iron vest,

86
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:27,797
it doesn't hurt at all.

87
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,688
How many times have I told you?

88
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,510
Never put on the iron vest
when I punch you!

89
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:36,071
Here is your punishment: no dinner.

90
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,727
And get out!

91
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,378
Get out!

92
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,528
It's getting late. You're not going home?

93
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,189
I'm locked out.

94
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,150
Wanna sleep here overnight?

95
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:52,722
Yeah, why not?

96
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:53,901
Of course not!

97
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,787
Why not?

98
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,028
Why not?

99
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,557
I can tell you didn't eat anything.

100
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,839
And if you didn't eat anything,
you can't go to bed.

101
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,508
I'm not hungry.

102
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,530
I think you are but you have no money.

103
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:09,780
Here.

104
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,080
No. Thanks.

105
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:12,394
Hey, it's not for you.

106
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,681
It's for a bet.

107
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,781
If you can throw this coin into my mouth,

108
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,309
I'll treat you to dinner.

109
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,790
Surely not from such close range.

110
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,089
Not too far either.

111
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,337
Here is fine.

112
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,411
I'm good, right?

113
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:52,230
French cuisine! Wanna eat?

114
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,256
It's so expensive!

115
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:57,664
So that shows I'm sincere!

116
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,004
Come on, we're VlPs.

117
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,112
We have a special entrance. Follow me!

118
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:10,753
Wei, Hua and Fa!

119
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,580
Cool!

120
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,155
You know it's mealtime, right?

121
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,163
Come on...

122
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,139
They're cool!

123
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,832
They're on their home turf here.

124
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,503
But like me,

125
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,784
they don't want to go home.

126
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,974
I count myself as their patron.

127
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,600
And I have a patron as well.

128
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,079
Bao!

129
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:35,656
Dad!

130
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:37,627
My daughter, Bao.

131
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:38,788
Does she look like me?

132
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,844
Sadly... she doesn't.

133
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,092
She looks like her mum.

134
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:45,007
thought you weren't coming today.

135
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:45,774
Of course I'm coming.

136
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,083
We have a guest today.

137
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:48,777
Two set dinners!

138
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:49,938
Hmm...

139
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,000
Hmm... okay.

140
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,348
Let's have escargots for a starter.

141
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,649
There are lots left over.

142
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,547
And steaks as well.

143
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,899
Come on, cheers!

144
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,044
A '92 topped with a '94?

145
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,106
Wow, Dad, you're so good at tasting wine!

146
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,731
It's mixed with '92, '94 and '96.

147
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,903
Leftovers from 3 tables.

148
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,161
People choose a wine by the year,
but I go for the whole decade!

149
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,871
All the best wines of the '90s!

150
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,411
Try some escargots.

151
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,961
Take your time.
I need to check if the customers have left.

152
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,220
Come on, cheers! Here's to our grand plan!

153
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:43,665
Cheers.

154
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,689
What plan?

155
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:48,645
My grand plan means 'Two swords in One'.

156
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:51,850
Your athletic potential combined
with my brain.

157
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:04,951
Look at the colour of it,

158
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:06,325
isn't it great?

159
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,361
It tastes even better.

160
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,025
Almost the best whiskey
of the 21 st century.

161
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,011
Try it.

162
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,931
Hmm... it tastes really good.

163
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:26,994
Of course!

164
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,276
It's more than 1 000 dollars
cheaper than the real thing.

165
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,577
But the guests can never tell
what's good or bad.

166
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,611
Pricey booze is always good.

167
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:36,674
Brother Hu,

168
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,966
some idiot wants to bet on darts!

169
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:42,866
200 dollars for a round!

170
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:46,593
You know, I never lose in a darts game.

171
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,102
If we fill the bottles

172
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,735
with the fake whisky,

173
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,686
no one will ever know.

174
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,435
How about 70% for me and 30% for you?

175
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,129
Okay?

176
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:05,550
Brother Hu, can I have another 200 dollars?

177
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,113
How is this possible? You never lose!

178
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,089
I'll definitely win this time.

179
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,978
I'm being very fair...

180
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,101
One for you, another one for me...

181
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:37,169
One for me, one for me again
and another one for you...

182
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,842
I was wondering who would be your champion!

183
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:43,763
Hu!

184
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:48,382
Ah, I forgot we were on your turf!

185
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,948
Let's pretend it never happened,

186
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,606
alright?

187
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:56,226
You stole my money

188
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,688
and now you're giving it back to me.

189
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,416
What does this mean?

190
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:03,955
Do you remember

191
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,094
I was a good friend of your dad's?

192
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,428
I held you in my arms

193
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,221
and you peed on me...

194
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,696
Jie, come on,
don't forget we need to meet someone.

195
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:20,911
Come on, let's go...

196
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,061
You can have ice cream somewhere else!

197
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,722
Come on, quick, let's go...

198
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:24,883
Iet's go!

199
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,044
Jie, let's go!

200
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,892
'85? No wonder it's so good!

201
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,042
Beat him to death!

202
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,152
Surround him!

203
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:21,319
Have you decided yet?

204
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,370
Can we open the window?

205
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:30,241
We have to keep our meeting a secret.

206
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,078
All doors and windows have to be shut

207
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:34,229
until we've finished.

208
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,671
Okay, let me tell you.

209
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:42,104
We can never agree to a merger.

210
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:07,457
Ah... you're not listening to me...

211
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,420
Never listening to me...

212
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,549
I bet you won't give up
until the last nail is in the coffin?

213
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,836
Look at these big fat gold bars.

214
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,655
Enough to make up your mind?

215
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,668
It's all yours.

216
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:38,837
Last night,

217
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:43,622
a student of ours
was making trouble in a nightclub.

218
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:46,798
It's seriously damaged
the reputation of our school.

219
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,798
I hoped he'd come out and admit it.

220
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,962
Who did it? Step forward!

221
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:01,706
What have I taught you?

222
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:05,166
A decent man should be responsible
for what he's done.

223
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:16,334
Well, I'll count to 3.

224
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:20,099
If no one steps forward,

225
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,599
I'll expel you all!

226
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,106
One!

227
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:36,254
Two...

228
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,265
Thanks...

229
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:53,313
It was him!

230
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,672
Enough?

231
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,689
It's okay. He's really tough.

232
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,010
No... my hit men are tired.

233
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:31,869
Sure, sure, they must be tired.

234
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,350
I'll treat them to dinner tonight.

235
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:53,453
You never learned.
Now, you've ruined our reputation.

236
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:55,740
Now,

237
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,190
you're expelled!

238
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,837
Hey, Hey!

239
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,507
Ah, I was just about to talk to you.

240
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,981
I've done my research...

241
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,022
What suits you most is...

242
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:09,074
What's wrong?

243
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:12,908
Can you take me to the club?

244
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,053
I want them to pay the price...

245
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:18,828
You think you're Bruce Lee?

246
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:19,545
Forget about the nonsense.

247
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:22,530
Let's do something grand!

248
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,665
I can't play football.

249
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:27,069
How about basketball?

250
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:31,356
Come on, throw it into that trashcan.

251
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,405
Come on, give it a try!

252
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:38,326
YES

253
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:42,246
Playing basketball
is not just about winning.

254
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:45,004
If he plays basketball in order
to search for his birth parents,

255
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:46,263
isn't it more touching?

256
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,427
See, his audience have tears
in their eyes...

257
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,119
They cheer him throughout the match...

258
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,728
Won't it make the headlines?

259
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:55,486
Stop it

260
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,159
Abandoned by his parents,

261
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,588
he plays basketball
while searching for them...

262
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,340
It'll be a moving, sensational story.

263
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:01,808
Even if he's not winning,

264
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,598
the University will still
get lots of publicity.

265
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,081
Chancellor Zhou, look at him.

266
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,403
How innocent!

267
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,800
He's not only an obedient son,

268
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:16,260
but a role model for young people.

269
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,085
Because he's raised the athletic spirit

270
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:21,535
to a higher level.

271
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:24,882
He's showed us

272
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,590
the virtues of Chinese culture.

273
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:31,876
We all know
how important parents are to us:

274
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,964
Fang will keep playing basketball
until he finds his parents.

275
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:39,173
Let us welcome

276
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,085
Fang Shijie - the Basketball Orphan

277
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:42,896
who loves his parents so much
he'll never stop looking for them.

278
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,590
Fang Shijie

279
00:26:02,422 --> 00:26:03,638
Do I have to dress like this?

280
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,715
You look cool, come on...

281
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,055
Read from the notes.

282
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:17,356
Thank you all for your support. Thank...

283
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,133
my dear Uncle Li,
and the Chancellor. I'll...

284
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:26,662
I hope... I can find my parents soon.

285
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,721
I'll work hard...

286
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:29,861
Wait a minute!

287
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,423
No one can join our team

288
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,468
without the Captain's permission.

289
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,865
Who is she?

290
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,534
That's the basketball team.

291
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:48,420
We do have this tradition.

292
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,553
Well, since there are
so many journalists here,

293
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:55,444
Iet Jie demonstrate...

294
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,682
come on, no problem,

295
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,231
Even the Chancellor has to observe

296
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,666
the traditions of the First University.

297
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,227
Whether Fang Shijie
can join the team depends on...

298
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,318
They still can't find him...

299
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,317
The Captain's name is Ding Wei,

300
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,171
20 years old, 4th grade

301
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,653
As long as he can score one,
he'll be admitted...

302
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:10,962
It's still not certain whether

303
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,843
Fang Shijie can join the team...

304
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,380
Well, miss,

305
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:24,657
getting scared?

306
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,336
Hiding isn't a good idea.

307
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:36,875
Is any one answering?

308
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:39,173
Shall I ask Jie to shoot?

309
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,782
He scores each time

310
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:01,960
Here you are!

311
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,987
Someone is waiting for your permission
to join the team.

312
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:07,777
He's the Captain?

313
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:09,258
How is he going to play if he's drunk?

314
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,280
Here he is.

315
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:38,696
YA!

316
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,650
Shoot! Shoot!

317
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:01,688
Get back, please.

318
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,382
Sorry, get back, please.

319
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:05,044
Yes, please, get back.

320
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,552
YA!

321
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,038
Did you read the papers today?

322
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,146
A true life story of 'Oliver Twist'

323
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,563
Isn't it wonderful?

324
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:27,719
We're going to make a fortune!

325
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,274
Okay, that's it. Don't worry.

326
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:31,996
Okay, bye!

327
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,769
What's wrong?

328
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,649
What the hell! Such big coverage!

329
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,228
It's not right, look...

330
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:45,547
'Basketball Orphan Bullied by Captain'

331
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:46,989
Fantastic headline!

332
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,330
Very sensational! You don't like it?

333
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:50,453
Stop selling stories to journalists!

334
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,307
What do you know about it?

335
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:57,210
You're neither Yao Ming nor Liu Xiang.

336
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:58,676
They don't have to say anything but
they'll always be in the headlines!

337
00:29:58,677 --> 00:29:59,362
But you're nobody.

338
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:00,548
You know you're nobody?

339
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,076
No one would write about you.
You'll never get any exposure.

340
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:03,481
Unless you can spice up the story.

341
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:04,822
They don't care about you!

342
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:06,803
It's a sensational headline.
A story to tell!

343
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,017
Ah, I see...

344
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,067
You're worried you'll be bullied

345
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:16,521
when others read the story?

346
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:17,364
Well, that's for sure,

347
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,004
because you're a genius.

348
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,189
People are always jealous of geniuses.

349
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:23,883
It doesn't matter.
As long as you're famous!

350
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:26,245
You can have anything when you're famous.

351
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:27,432
That's how things work.

352
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,881
Come on, go practice.

353
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,465
Come on, be good and go.

354
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,409
Captain,

355
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:54,444
I know you're gutted.

356
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:56,330
It's fine if you want to beat me up,

357
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:57,961
I won't fight back.

358
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,455
Who said I wanted to beat you up?

359
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:07,305
There is a saying
amongst basketball players.

360
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:09,513
'He who controls the rebounds,

361
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:12,042
wins the match'

362
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,277
You can jump really high.

363
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:16,442
So you just do

364
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,432
one thing in the match -

365
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:19,940
rebound.

366
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,370
That's boring!

367
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:22,613
I'm good at shooting.

368
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,862
Never miss one.

369
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,540
Morning!

370
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,602
Why stopped? Keep playing!

371
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:49,805
Wow, are you okay, brother?

372
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:51,449
Sure you're not sick?

373
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:53,136
It's too early to show up!

374
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,458
I've found a secret weapon.

375
00:31:58,285 --> 00:31:59,927
What secret weapon?

376
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:28,908
Brother, your time has come!

377
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:31,183
We'll be the winners at the championship!

378
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:33,552
That's impossible.

379
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:35,734
Top 3?

380
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,070
Stop dreaming!

381
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,549
Then, top 8?

382
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:47,028
Possibly.

383
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,047
Possibly.

384
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:53,298
Come on, shoot!

385
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:55,412
Come on, shoot!

386
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,914
Cool!

387
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,986
Hello!

388
00:32:58,987 --> 00:32:59,723
I'm Zhen Li,

389
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,780
the agent of the Basketball Orphan,
Fang Shijie.

390
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,467
I'd like to send some photos to you.
Can I have the address?

391
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,620
Okay, thank you.

392
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:10,603
Xiao Lan! Xiao Lan... please sign for us...

393
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:13,136
Can you write my name on?

394
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:15,210
Can you take a picture with us?

395
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:16,682
So excited!

396
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:21,091
Work hard, Xiao Lan...

397
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:33,060
Hey, this is Jie.
He's so good at shooting hoops.

398
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:36,652
Jie. - Lily

399
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:38,770
This is Xiao Lan.

400
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:40,075
This is Fang Shijie.

401
00:33:42,315 --> 00:33:44,655
He got injured and just came back today.

402
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:46,479
Hello!

403
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:47,787
Lily's mentioned you to me.

404
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:50,952
She says you're very talented.

405
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,015
Really?

406
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:55,163
But the most important is
what you learn from the training.

407
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:57,595
Lily also says you lack basic training.

408
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,700
So you're saying you can beat him?

409
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:03,405
Try it, if you have the guts.

410
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:06,074
You know who the hero is? It's Jie!

411
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,702
Right?

412
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:34,287
Why are you clapping?
The journalists are here.

413
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,618
Stop clapping.

414
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,345
Did you get my point or not?

415
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,076
Know who the hero is?

416
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:54,824
You mean Jie?

417
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:55,791
Of course!

418
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,063
He's new.

419
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:58,440
He should be on the bench for a while.

420
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,650
On the damn bench?!
He's been waiting all day.

421
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,064
Come on.

422
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:06,004
What did she say?

423
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:08,044
She said she really wants to see you play.

424
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:09,682
I asked her to wait.

425
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,127
I warn you, there are only 5 minutes left.

426
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:35,175
If you don't let Jie play,
I'll call the police.

427
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,370
Put Jie on.

428
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:42,611
Hi, nice to meet you.

429
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,629
Oh! My God! Shoot! Shoot!

430
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,542
That's impossible. He's never missed!

431
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:18,914
Oh... My... God.

432
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:23,270
Foul! Foul!

433
00:36:23,271 --> 00:36:25,065
Referee, it's a foul!

434
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,977
Come on, try again, no problem.

435
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,636
Cool! Right?

436
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,305
Did you see it? Did you?

437
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:11,016
Hello.

438
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:13,385
This is Jie, have you eaten?

439
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:16,483
Jie, it's so nice to talk to you.

440
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:17,416
Really?

441
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:19,139
Tell you what. There is a pervert.

442
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,442
He's been standing downstairs
for more than an hour.

443
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:23,626
A pervert?

444
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,267
I've called my brother.

445
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:28,099
- He should be here soon.
- Hello,

446
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,123
the battery is going... hello...

447
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,783
Damn it! Run!

448
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:34,922
Hello!

449
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,099
Jie.

450
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,709
Where is the ball?

451
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,291
Captain, I've been practicing for ages,

452
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,060
can you teach me how to slamdunk?

453
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:11,977
Do you want to run before you can walk?

454
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,281
Take your time!

455
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:25,510
Is it really that difficult to dunk?

456
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:28,714
I know Lightness Kung Fu...

457
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,360
Hmm... so it can't be that difficult.

458
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:02,655
The starting line-up
of the First University:

459
00:41:02,656 --> 00:41:05,023
Captain Ding Wei, Shooting Guard Zhang Gui

460
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,071
Center Yang Rong, Power Forward Xiao Lan.

461
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,607
And the popular 'Basketball Orphan'...

462
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,175
Never seen you before. Are you new?

463
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,654
Yeah, nice to meet you.

464
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,854
This game is cruel.
It's never nice to meet you.

465
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,095
Only screaming and whining here.

466
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:17,055
They scream for me:

467
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,686
Oh! You're so cool!

468
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:19,646
You whine:

469
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,987
Oh! I'm so embarrassed!

470
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:24,038
It's a cruel world.

471
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:27,465
Jump ball!

472
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:37,310
Fang Shijie takes the ball
and passes to Xiao Lan.

473
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,553
Xiao Lan dunks! Fantastic!

474
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:43,710
This match has attracted
mass media attention.

475
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,296
Fang's search for his parents
has become the hottest topic.

476
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:54,398
Fang steals the ball

477
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:55,261
and passes to the Captain Ding.

478
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,472
Ding jams it in again!

479
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:00,612
But it's a pity that he can't dunk.

480
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:07,133
The ball is passed to Fang and he shoots...

481
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,262
It's impossible...

482
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,208
But he scored!

483
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:11,874
Did you see it?

484
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,401
He never misses! Crazy!

485
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,332
Fang has the ball...

486
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,548
He sheds the defense.

487
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:29,791
He looks like Michael Jordan in his prime!

488
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:31,492
Beautiful!

489
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:34,140
Xiao Lan's dunk has really
brought the game to a fever pitch!

490
00:42:37,197 --> 00:42:39,724
Dunk! Fang Shijie!

491
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,623
Slammmmm Dunk! Another dunk!

492
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:43,709
Dunk... Dunk...

493
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:53,043
Dunk... Dunk...

494
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,185
- Fang's got the ball
- Dunk...

495
00:42:57,186 --> 00:42:58,982
- and the crowd is going wild
- Dunk...

496
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:00,464
Dunk! Dunk!

497
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:04,124
Dunk! Dunk! Fang's going to dunk!

498
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:05,939
Never give your opponent a chance.

499
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,187
The mighty guards
of the First University...

500
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:07,634
It represents

501
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,395
the long history and traditions
of the First University Basketball Team.

502
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:10,831
Jordan, Kobe and Magic Johnson:

503
00:43:10,832 --> 00:43:12,335
at this moment,
their spirits have come to Fang.

504
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:13,134
Fang Shijie is now representing

505
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,253
the long history and traditions

506
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:15,830
of the First University Basketball Team.

507
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,985
At this moment, he's not fighting alone.

508
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:22,986
He scored!

509
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:25,413
The almighty
First University Basketball Team!

510
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,714
Happy Birthday to Fang!

511
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:29,836
Long Live Fang!

512
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:01,939
Come, have some water.

513
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:03,506
Thanks.

514
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:06,250
Tired?

515
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,892
Ah, sorry!

516
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:12,903
You played so well!

517
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:15,518
Everyone was watching you.
You're the soul of the team.

518
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,062
You're terrific!

519
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,371
Keeping working. Work hard!

520
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:29,509
When suits you?

521
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,955
Next March.

522
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,255
Then how about 1. 3 million dollars?

523
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:35,368
Can it be cheaper?

524
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:38,472
Hello! Yes, yes.

525
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:40,061
I'll arrange the interview for you.

526
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:41,256
Okay, no problem.

527
00:45:54,323 --> 00:45:55,550
I don't want to be your enemy.

528
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:58,647
I hope you can leave
the First University and join us.

529
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:00,182
Who are you?

530
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:03,664
I'll be your opponent
the day after tomorrow.

531
00:46:04,076 --> 00:46:05,390
We'll be opponents

532
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,724
in the Championship the day after tomorrow.

533
00:46:08,904 --> 00:46:11,209
That's good. Nice to meet you.

534
00:46:13,764 --> 00:46:14,947
I've been watching you for a while.

535
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:16,905
You shoot well; even from a long distance.

536
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:18,788
Shoot! The ball always goes in.

537
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:22,232
But your weakness is that
whenever you're distracted,

538
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:24,679
you miss.

539
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:28,928
This is my name card.

540
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,029
I can help you improve.

541
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,555
Captain of the Fire Ball?

542
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:41,242
Yes, that's right. Call me.

543
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:45,048
Think it over.

544
00:46:50,345 --> 00:46:53,212
Hello! Long time no see!

545
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:55,886
What're you doing here?

546
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:59,113
I came to see you;
to catch up with you, couldn't l?

547
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:02,854
Wow!

548
00:47:08,315 --> 00:47:10,735
Great! All our old friends are here.

549
00:47:12,023 --> 00:47:14,623
See you in the match
the day after tomorrow.

550
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:26,520
Hello! What?

551
00:47:27,436 --> 00:47:28,684
Big business!

552
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:32,267
That's right, it's me.

553
00:47:55,446 --> 00:47:57,900
Hey... His name is Li Tian.

554
00:47:58,388 --> 00:48:00,247
He joined our team two years ago.

555
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:03,471
Same as you, he was no good at first.

556
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:04,559
But he was very talented.

557
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,452
He picked up everything so quickly.

558
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:08,660
And be the skipper quickly

559
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:10,126
But he changed completely after a while.

560
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:13,415
He not only left the team
on the eve of the final match

561
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:15,624
But also took the best players with him.

562
00:48:15,783 --> 00:48:17,990
It must be really hard for you
that I'm always on top.

563
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:21,176
Actually,
I was 'on top' of your girlfriend as well.

564
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,131
They were neck-and-neck in the final.

565
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:27,747
There were 2 seconds left and
the First University was 1 point behind.

566
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,056
But my brother was
going to shoot 2 freethrows.

567
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:35,955
Yo! She was good...

568
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,628
YES

569
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:44,628
My brother was on the brink
of a nervous breakdown.

570
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,671
From the moment the ball was thrown,

571
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:48,596
every one knew the result.

572
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:50,059
At that crucial moment,

573
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,017
the most fearsome enemy appeared:

574
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,768
it was his own trembling hands!

575
00:48:55,624 --> 00:48:56,711
After that match,

576
00:48:56,712 --> 00:48:58,565
my brother could never get over the trauma.

577
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:00,327
He consoles himself with hard drinking.

578
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:04,672
Don't worry.
I won't let Li Tien get away with it.

579
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,517
But... I'm worried
Uncle Li might sell you out.

580
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:14,679
No way. It's impossible.

581
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:42,723
Uncle Li...

582
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:44,779
Jie, don't fall into the trap!

583
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:47,944
If you fight them,
you won't be allowed to play the match.

584
00:49:54,587 --> 00:49:56,511
You're the dream and ambition of my life.

585
00:49:57,721 --> 00:49:58,947
They just didn't get it.

586
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,961
How could it be possible for me
to sell my dream?

587
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:06,874
Thank you.

588
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:08,858
What for?

589
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:11,987
I'll never sell off my cash cow...

590
00:50:14,252 --> 00:50:16,967
but the price is damned tempting...

591
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:21,263
Please,

592
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:23,855
work hard and be successful.

593
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,048
Don't let me regret my decision tonight.

594
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,120
I won't let you down.

595
00:51:08,323 --> 00:51:10,629
I recognize them. All are hooligans.

596
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:13,544
They were banned from all matches in Japan.

597
00:52:32,258 --> 00:52:34,400
You get scared to death when you see me

598
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,887
My desire to win is so strong

599
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,205
You cut it! You pass it!

600
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:39,516
Run! If you're as fast as me

601
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:41,971
Your goosebumps
are falling in my spicy hot pot

602
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:43,002
Ha! My happiness

603
00:52:43,003 --> 00:52:44,888
is built upon your failure

604
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:45,719
You're still being indecisive

605
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,382
The basketball court
is the battlefield and we fight

606
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:48,820
Everyone is tough on the crime scene

607
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:50,483
It's made of iron,
can you shield yourself from it?

608
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:52,530
Are you up to the real challenge?

609
00:52:52,531 --> 00:52:53,521
I fight for my pride

610
00:52:53,522 --> 00:52:54,832
I fight for the excitement

611
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,431
Hey, two weeks ago,

612
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:58,253
in the game against the Warriors,
you dunked...

613
00:52:58,254 --> 00:52:59,564
Didn't I look just like you?

614
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:00,652
You'd die with them

615
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:02,410
Your dreams are shattered, and then?

616
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:03,690
All you family and friends
have lost their faces

617
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:05,288
Your basketball career has come to an end

618
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:06,632
Are you still struggling?

619
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:08,742
The answer is correct
and the same each time

620
00:53:08,743 --> 00:53:09,988
Come to the basketball court
if you have guts

621
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,555
I'll crush you to death

622
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:14,369
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

623
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,991
Our spirit is so high
that makes you shake with fear

624
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,686
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

625
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:19,869
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

626
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,663
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

627
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:23,394
Excuse me.

628
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,405
Hey, remember two weeks ago,

629
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,587
3. 25 pm, you dunked...

630
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,187
But I don't want to copy you,
hitting my head against the backboard.

631
00:53:35,698 --> 00:53:36,946
What can you do then?

632
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:12,751
Captain!

633
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:14,306
Are you okay?

634
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:17,007
Careful.

635
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:18,401
Get him off.

636
00:54:27,752 --> 00:54:30,413
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

637
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:33,018
Our spirit is so high that
makes you shake with fear

638
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,604
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

639
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,778
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

640
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:37,365
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

641
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:40,157
Sport! It's what I fight for.
It's my spirit

642
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:42,716
Our spirit is so high that
makes you shake with fear

643
00:54:42,918 --> 00:54:44,472
Victory! Winners become the kings
while losers become bandits

644
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:45,677
Brothers! Let's go and fight!

645
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:47,655
Fight! Until all enemies are crushed!

646
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,216
This is the foul
you played against my teammates

647
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,180
just one minute ago.

648
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:04,175
You're not the only one with a good memory.

649
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:07,067
Do whatever you like.
You're bound to loose.

650
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:28,815
Beautiful! Good!

651
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:44,019
Replacing?

652
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,455
Hey, we've signed the agreement.

653
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,839
The agreement is the same as the contract.

654
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,746
Of course not!
The game isn't finished yet...

655
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,966
Hello? Hello...

656
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:04,006
Ladies and Gentlemen,
as a result of the power cut,

657
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,079
the match is abandoned.

658
00:56:06,172 --> 00:56:07,431
The committee has decided...

659
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,208
- Count yourselves lucky!
- the match will be resumed...

660
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:10,545
- in three days.
- But you're going to lose...

661
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:11,433
sooner or later.

662
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:14,160
It doesn't matter when. Take a break.

663
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,780
I can't help if God is on our side...

664
00:56:19,991 --> 00:56:22,216
Is this your bad luck or my good fortune?

665
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:24,668
Bye!

666
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,144
Let's go!

667
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,864
What have you been daydreaming
about all afternoon?

668
00:56:40,026 --> 00:56:41,461
Nothing. I'm thinking of my parents.

669
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:43,879
It seemed like they came to the match.

670
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,144
Did you see them?

671
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:48,985
I could feel them there.

672
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:52,506
It's strange...

673
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:56,147
If they were here,
why didn't they come to me first?

674
00:56:57,064 --> 00:56:59,386
Yeah, you're right.

675
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:19,748
Still remember me?

676
00:57:19,749 --> 00:57:21,661
What? Looking for a fight?

677
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:24,963
Brother Hu.

678
00:57:25,587 --> 00:57:27,434
I'm not looking for a fight.

679
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:28,931
The match the other day.

680
00:57:28,982 --> 00:57:30,926
I caused the power cut.

681
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:33,277
So, it was you...

682
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,434
But why?

683
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:38,207
To be honest, I left Bi Tianhao.

684
00:57:38,882 --> 00:57:40,220
I must beat him.

685
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:42,860
So I put a bet on you.

686
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:45,360
How much?

687
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:47,105
5 million US dollars.

688
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:02,719
Jie,

689
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:06,530
Iook, who is here?

690
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:12,089
I saw you on TV. You looked cool!

691
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,114
Why are you all here?

692
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,865
Have you found your parents?

693
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:15,939
No, not yet.

694
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,867
Jie, searching for your parents
via basketball...

695
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,396
That's a good gimmick.

696
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,950
It's better than a soap opera.

697
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:24,517
You're in the paper every day.

698
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,742
They don't believe...

699
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,179
- I am your master.
Y es.

700
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:29,626
I guess you must have
heard Jie's news on TV,

701
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:31,834
I'm hoping you could do a favour for Jie.

702
00:58:31,835 --> 00:58:33,335
Play a Kung Fu basketball match for him.

703
00:58:34,183 --> 00:58:36,942
Jie is our best protege.

704
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:39,795
His business is our business, right?

705
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,143
Yes, sure.

706
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,764
As long as it's legal,

707
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:46,111
I was open to anything that would help him.

708
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:47,635
Say thank you to your Master.

709
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:48,789
Didn't you hear what he said?

710
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,823
He 'was' open to anything, 'was'...

711
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,419
What do you mean?

712
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:58,198
You know Bi Tianhao took over the school.

713
00:58:59,978 --> 00:59:02,399
To be honest, during the past years,

714
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:06,097
we've been serving that bastard Wang Biao.

715
00:59:06,387 --> 00:59:07,813
We're absolutely useless.

716
00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:09,953
It is a crappy job at the school

717
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:13,233
but it's my bread and butter.

718
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:16,627
I can't sacrifice it for a useless medal.

719
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,739
Hey, the soap opera is starting...

720
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:22,351
'Tales from the World of Martial Arts'

721
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,757
Hello! Yes, speaking.

722
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:32,847
Ah, I've no time for that...

723
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,262
I don't care which paper you write for.
I'm busy!

724
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,154
Hey, what's wrong with me?

725
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,487
Nothing. It's my problem.

726
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,597
I can't accept another woman in my life.

727
01:01:11,591 --> 01:01:12,745
Are you crying?

728
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:19,835
Stop crying.

729
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,556
Leave me alone.

730
01:01:24,964 --> 01:01:26,497
I won't.

731
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,794
Am I a nuisance?

732
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:34,522
No way.

733
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,491
You're always cheerful... you're...

734
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,470
What?

735
01:01:43,144 --> 01:01:44,136
Nothing.

736
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:49,150
What?

737
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:52,451
Really wanna know?

738
01:01:53,201 --> 01:01:53,708
Y es.

739
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,863
Promise you won't laugh at me.

740
01:01:57,675 --> 01:01:59,619
I liked ice cream so much when I was a kid.

741
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:02,122
But I could never have it.

742
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:05,112
So I'd do anything
just to get some ice cream.

743
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:07,522
You're just like ice cream...

744
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:14,275
I knew I shouldn't have said it.

745
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:30,640
- He should be here soon.
- Hello,

746
01:02:30,641 --> 01:02:32,454
Hello, the battery is going to go, hello...

747
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:59,359
Lily: Work hard, Jie.

748
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:32,161
Two cripples and two useless riff-raff,

749
01:03:32,162 --> 01:03:34,203
it's five fighting against one.

750
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:04,340
- Hey, Jie.
- Master.

751
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:09,251
We changed our mind.

752
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:11,164
We decided to get our hands dirty.

753
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:13,604
They're not students.

754
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:15,099
They're not qualified.

755
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:17,989
Ah, they've been transferred
to the University.

756
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,507
They're absolutely qualified.

757
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:22,921
Ah, but they are so old!

758
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:00,584
'Taiji born out of Wuji'

759
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:23,908
Jie!

760
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:44,728
Come on!

761
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:48,317
Hello, Handsome.

762
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:52,038
Yo! Look at his muscles.

763
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:16,710
Sit down!

764
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,926
Hey... that whistle blower...

765
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,338
What a referee! He sent us off...

766
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:24,178
Damn! I was on a roll...

767
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:25,550
Not having enough fun...

768
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,108
Me too.

769
01:07:27,352 --> 01:07:29,934
Jie, we asked you to come here

770
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,313
because we brought something for you.

771
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,803
'Jie, we saw you on TV

772
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,617
and we feel really sorry.

773
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:47,365
We never fulfilled
our responsibilities as parents.

774
01:07:48,642 --> 01:07:49,795
Play the basketball well.

775
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:52,460
We'll be there for you in the audience.

776
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:56,992
Masters, is it really from my parents?

777
01:07:57,335 --> 01:07:59,852
Uncle Li gave us this letter last night.

778
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:03,452
This is what changed our minds.

779
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:47,983
This is impossible...

780
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:53,702
You'd never expect that

781
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:56,145
we'd have recovered from the injuries.

782
01:09:18,413 --> 01:09:20,818
Sticks of sugar-coated fruits flying out
when I kick

783
01:09:21,019 --> 01:09:23,651
Memories spreading out
in the moonlight when I punch

784
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:26,165
A piece of ginger. A piece of the past

785
01:09:26,358 --> 01:09:28,900
I can give you an autograph for a keepsake

786
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,232
I say a windshield protects us
from snow storms

787
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,506
A roof shields us from moonlight

788
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:33,781
A window should be installed
in the world of martial arts

789
01:09:33,782 --> 01:09:35,024
A lance should be spun in a Peking Opera

790
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:37,470
I stand firm in the horse stance

791
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:40,187
I put on a Kung Fu suit
when I'm bored and tired

792
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:43,083
I don't sell tofu

793
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:45,821
What I learn in the martial arts school
is called Kung Fu

794
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,562
Kung Fu , Kung Fu

795
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:49,905
Quick, put on your Qibao

796
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,371
so I can't take advantage of you

797
01:09:51,372 --> 01:09:54,012
You're just like tofu

798
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,784
Your beautiful skin seduces me
when I'm practicing Kung Fu

799
01:09:56,981 --> 01:09:59,459
Kung Fu , Kung Fu

800
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:00,677
Quick, put on your Qibao

801
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:02,629
so I can't take advantage of you

802
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:09,122
When I kick lightly,

803
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:10,237
you're thrown to the edge of the world

804
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:11,543
If I kicked too hard,

805
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:13,328
there would be no world left

806
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:14,666
Flowers falling in the sunset

807
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:16,260
Climbing over mountains,
crossing over rivers

808
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:18,967
I clear my throat
and start to sing Peking Opera

809
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:21,200
Flying up to Dunhuang Going
deep into the Wild North

810
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,678
Who is there when I turn around?

811
01:10:23,877 --> 01:10:24,896
Ah, what kind of place is it?

812
01:10:24,897 --> 01:10:26,999
What situation is it? La, la, la...

813
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,477
I'll step on your shoulders
when I'm bored and tired

814
01:10:33,414 --> 01:10:34,790
Ah, are you okay?

815
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:45,661
3 seconds left...

816
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:52,948
The last throw...
I leave it to you and Xiao Lan.

817
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:03,368
Come on, hang in there...

818
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:05,635
Come on, you're gonna win!

819
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:11,763
You're so despicable!

820
01:11:12,675 --> 01:11:13,604
Headmaster...

821
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:16,115
You can jump high, right? So jump then!

822
01:11:16,116 --> 01:11:18,027
- Are you okay?
- Smash your shin.

823
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:20,077
Stop your blood flow...

824
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,181
Too late to use Qigong!

825
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,457
Don't be afraid.

826
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,887
Everyone is watching him.
But it's your show now.

827
01:11:29,086 --> 01:11:30,787
Jie, hang in there.

828
01:11:35,014 --> 01:11:36,171
He can't jump anymore.

829
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:37,381
Watch out for Xiao Lan.

830
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:38,326
Hey, what the hell is this?

831
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:41,339
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

832
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,022
Rules against goal tending
only apply to players.

833
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:49,485
He's the referee,
and he's disqualified as a referee.

834
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:53,791
But the point is - you lost!!

835
01:12:54,307 --> 01:12:56,291
Fire Ball won!

836
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,967
Everything in this world
is made of tiny particles.

837
01:14:10,058 --> 01:14:14,003
'Altering Universe'
dissembles those particles,

838
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,378
and rebuilds it.

839
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:21,459
In a split second, time is stopped.

840
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:24,492
You can even turn the clock back.

841
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:40,948
He's not throwing. He's passing the ball!

842
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,035
Now, I've finally understood

843
01:18:34,116 --> 01:18:36,691
basketball isn't all about dunking.

844
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,413
It's about teamwork.

845
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:56,983
Hello? What? They want Jie back?

846
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:01,076
What contract? It's just an agreement!

847
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,692
Okay, but we'll talk about the money later.

848
01:19:04,066 --> 01:19:05,913
I'm busy. I'm off to celebrate!

849
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:07,225
That's it, bye!

850
01:19:07,413 --> 01:19:08,918
What a snub!

851
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,155
What the hell is it?

852
01:19:12,366 --> 01:19:15,321
Boss, remember our bet, 5 million?

853
01:19:15,775 --> 01:19:17,145
Who asked you to bet...

854
01:19:17,146 --> 01:19:18,619
You won't get away with it.

855
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:24,295
Sonny is over there.

856
01:20:06,686 --> 01:20:07,876
Please sign it. Again, please.

857
01:20:08,438 --> 01:20:09,201
Thank you.

858
01:20:09,202 --> 01:20:10,610
You looked so cool in the match.

859
01:20:10,668 --> 01:20:11,631
Thank you.

860
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:13,926
Sorry, I ran out of ink.

861
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:14,683
Never mind.

862
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:17,016
The autograph looks exactly like his.

863
01:20:22,045 --> 01:20:23,095
Who are you?

864
01:20:23,096 --> 01:20:24,667
I'm a fan of yours!

865
01:20:27,749 --> 01:20:28,673
This handwriting looks very familiar.

866
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:29,984
Very neat.

867
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:32,783
I seem to have seen it somewhere before?

868
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:36,283
Sure, in the letter
your Masters gave you...

869
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:42,768
What's up?

870
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:46,270
You're not happy with it?

871
01:20:46,965 --> 01:20:48,335
Would your Masters have come
if I hadn't written the letter?

872
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:49,768
If they hadn't come,
would you have won the game?

873
01:20:49,769 --> 01:20:51,298
If you didn't win the game,
how would you become famous?

874
01:20:51,299 --> 01:20:53,022
Hey, are you leaving?

875
01:20:53,211 --> 01:20:55,883
Okay, anyway, sooner or later,
you'll be leaving...

876
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:57,480
- That's what people do to me
when they become famous. - Hey,

877
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:58,759
can't I just go for a pee?

878
01:21:01,879 --> 01:21:03,886
I knew it... you care about people.
You know what?

879
01:21:03,887 --> 01:21:05,574
I noticed that your ear lobe
was so thick the time I first met you.

880
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:07,874
So I knew... you care about people.

881
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:10,398
Excuse me. Which one is Fang Shijie?

882
01:21:16,601 --> 01:21:17,662
Wang Yiwuan!

883
01:21:19,023 --> 01:21:21,225
His birth father is the richest man
in Asia? Wang Yiwuan!

884
01:21:28,265 --> 01:21:30,151
Choose a nice suit. You look so shabby.

885
01:21:30,846 --> 01:21:32,091
How can you go to meet
your father like that?

886
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,012
How about this one?

887
01:21:34,925 --> 01:21:35,985
It looks pricey? How about this one?

888
01:21:36,263 --> 01:21:37,986
How pricey can it be? Just a suit.

889
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,618
Wow, so expensive, 26000 dollars!

890
01:21:44,102 --> 01:21:45,641
Never mind, count it as my gift to you.

891
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,208
A gift for me?

892
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,887
Yeah, the last one.

893
01:21:53,089 --> 01:21:54,809
Oh, you're a poor man now

894
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,116
but you'll be rich tomorrow.

895
01:21:56,117 --> 01:21:56,784
You'll have too much money to spend.

896
01:21:56,785 --> 01:21:58,324
Will you still need gifts by then?

897
01:22:01,055 --> 01:22:02,148
You're so good to me.

898
01:22:05,517 --> 01:22:06,990
Don't be so naive.

899
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:09,506
I always treat you as a cash cow.

900
01:22:10,011 --> 01:22:10,869
Moreover,

901
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:13,164
there are lots of greedy people
like me out there.

902
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:16,715
Never trust other people
when you're rich. Be smart!

903
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:19,608
Try it on, quick.

904
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:20,764
Do I look good?

905
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:22,866
Of course you do. Such a pricey suit.

906
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,122
I'll try it on then.

907
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,235
Why did we stop at this shop?

908
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,602
Should have gone further.

909
01:22:27,603 --> 01:22:30,288
This damned shop! This is extortion!

910
01:22:48,607 --> 01:22:50,697
I left this glass ball with you.

911
01:22:52,546 --> 01:22:57,470
So it would prove that you're my son.

912
01:23:01,736 --> 01:23:02,930
Sonny...

913
01:23:12,111 --> 01:23:13,458
Why did you abandon me?

914
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:17,402
I was bankrupt in those days.

915
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:21,131
My creditors were after me all the time.

916
01:23:23,027 --> 01:23:24,189
For your safety,

917
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:29,586
I had to leave you, my dearest son...

918
01:23:30,903 --> 01:23:32,730
I didn't want you to be dragged
into my problems.

919
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,102
Sonny,

920
01:23:45,949 --> 01:23:49,496
come over. Let me have a look of you.

921
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,513
Go, money is coming to you.

922
01:24:08,039 --> 01:24:10,162
I owed too much to you.

923
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:15,411
I plan to take you to London tomorrow.

924
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:21,801
I want to declare you as my heir

925
01:24:23,086 --> 01:24:25,656
in the Capital of Finance.

926
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,294
I have so much to tell you.

927
01:24:48,634 --> 01:24:50,527
So much to talk about.

928
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:56,510
Come to the study with me.

929
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,905
You look listless.

930
01:26:19,906 --> 01:26:21,996
If you're thinking of Jie,
why don't you go see him?

931
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,128
He's in a different world now.

932
01:26:27,302 --> 01:26:30,467
He has a new life and new friends.

933
01:26:32,681 --> 01:26:34,575
Don't greet him next time you see him.

934
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:36,086
He's very different now.

935
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:40,592
You didn't eat anything all day.

936
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:42,644
Let me get you something to eat.

937
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,524
Drinking alone?

938
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:22,987
A '92 mixed with a '94?

939
01:27:23,776 --> 01:27:28,382
Wrong! It's a '02 with a '82.
Really pricey stuff.

940
01:27:30,626 --> 01:27:32,716
I thought you'd gone to London
with your dad?

941
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,269
It suits me better here.

942
01:27:36,997 --> 01:27:38,312
Idiot!

943
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:42,192
Why didn't you leave?

944
01:27:47,466 --> 01:27:48,694
I'm waiting here for someone.

945
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:58,039
He coaxed me into playing basketball.

946
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,081
He wanted me to become famous
so I could be his cash cow.

947
01:28:05,074 --> 01:28:06,357
But I know he's not a bad guy.

948
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:11,200
He just pins all his hopes on me.

949
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:13,848
And that has changed me.

950
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:16,636
And that has changed me.

951
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:24,305
The guy you're talking about
is a born loser.

952
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:26,888
He loses in everything all his life.

953
01:28:28,925 --> 01:28:30,720
When he was about to give up his life,

954
01:28:31,998 --> 01:28:33,575
he came across a baby.

955
01:28:35,968 --> 01:28:39,450
This baby brought back not only his life

956
01:28:40,642 --> 01:28:42,153
but also his pride.

957
01:28:47,302 --> 01:28:48,530
Thank you.

958
01:29:07,982 --> 01:29:09,876
Can I keep playing basketball for you?

959
01:29:14,001 --> 01:29:17,068
Basketball?
Useless... get ready for the Olympics.

960
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,594
get ready for the Olympics.
I'll send the submission to the committee.

961
01:29:21,813 --> 01:29:24,749
High jump, long jump, javelin throw,

962
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,709
shot put, pole vault...

963
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:28,344
I think you can get at least
ten gold medals.

964
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:29,795
- Maybe archery as well.
- Really?

965
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:31,894
Of course. You're a Kung Fu kid!

966
01:29:31,895 --> 01:29:33,771
Yeah, I forgot I knew Kung Fu.

967
01:29:33,772 --> 01:29:34,961
I can swim as well.

968
01:29:35,999 --> 01:29:38,176
We can easily earn millions of dollars
just from advertising.

969
01:29:42,266 --> 01:29:45,314
Cheers! Here's to our grand plan.

970
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:46,794
Cheers!

971
01:29:47,865 --> 01:29:48,945
When you have earned tons of money,

972
01:29:48,946 --> 01:29:51,549
you can be a movie star or a singer.

973
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:52,986
Write some good songs and...

974
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,458
- make a lot of money!
- But I can't sing...

975
01:29:55,404 --> 01:29:57,025
I'll take you on a space trip.

976
01:29:57,026 --> 01:29:58,812
- Space?
- No paparazzi there.

977
01:29:59,031 --> 01:30:00,257
Paparazzi?

978
01:30:00,566 --> 01:30:01,140
That's it.

979
01:30:01,141 --> 01:30:03,295
The end of the story
of my search for my parents.

980
01:30:04,756 --> 01:30:06,582
My four Masters became famous
after the match.

981
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:07,761
But you've not heard of

982
01:30:07,762 --> 01:30:10,128
the history between them
and Headmaster Wang Biao

983
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:12,343
before the match

984
01:30:12,976 --> 01:30:16,204
So, you're the 'World No 1 Fist God'!

985
01:30:16,398 --> 01:30:18,764
No, no... that was long time ago...

986
01:30:18,765 --> 01:30:20,428
Not worth mentioning it at all...

987
01:30:20,429 --> 01:30:22,571
I'd like to take this chance

988
01:30:22,572 --> 01:30:25,287
to fight Headmaster Wang Biao

989
01:30:25,482 --> 01:30:28,034
If I lose, I'll join you immediately.

990
01:30:28,233 --> 01:30:30,599
Fantastic, it's so easy!

991
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:31,822
Headmaster Wang...

992
01:30:32,455 --> 01:30:34,373
No, no... I've sworn that

993
01:30:34,374 --> 01:30:36,548
I'd leave the world of martial arts
and never fight again.

994
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:38,987
Okay. See you at the basketball court.

995
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,807
- Come on.
- Come on.

996
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:44,792
Wang Biao, if you keep finding excuses,

997
01:30:44,993 --> 01:30:47,147
you'll be punished even more.

998
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:51,300
Stop!

999
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:57,947
Who comes first?
I'll finish him off as soon as possible.

1000
01:31:12,831 --> 01:31:16,041
We've been friends, right?
Please don't be too heavy-handed...

1001
01:31:16,526 --> 01:31:18,871
Don't worry, I won't be heavy-handed...

1002
01:31:19,805 --> 01:31:21,091
I'll just finish you off.

1003
01:31:27,453 --> 01:31:28,618
And Lily...

1004
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,318
She finally said to me:

1005
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:33,969
When are you going to treat me
to an ice cream?
