you talked about to win.

957
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,783
Now, go back and fight for it.

958
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,481
Go back and water your roses, Roper.

959
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:43,559
Be quiet. You'll talk yourself to death.

960
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:57,574
Now, you can get out of here
and take Carla with you...

961
01:29:57,742 --> 01:29:59,642
...or l'll kill you.

962
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:12,745
One more thing about Carla.

963
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:17,056
She had a job to do. She did it.

964
01:30:17,228 --> 01:30:21,028
What no one counted on
was her falling in love with you.

965
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,233
Well, she did.

966
01:30:28,906 --> 01:30:31,875
Now, take her and get out.

967
01:30:38,983 --> 01:30:40,473
ROPER:
Come on.

968
01:30:58,636 --> 01:31:00,866
Anything you want me
to tell Alice, Beecher?

969
01:31:03,574 --> 01:31:05,667
Tell her l love her.

970
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:07,941
You know what that is, Roper?

971
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:10,109
l've heard of it.

972
01:31:10,281 --> 01:31:12,715
MARSH:
All right, get out.

973
01:31:28,966 --> 01:31:31,332
l'm sorry, John.

974
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:33,265
l'm sorry.

975
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:30,087
There's only one chance.

976
01:32:30,261 --> 01:32:33,355
lf l can make them believe
that l'm the last one alive...

977
01:32:33,531 --> 01:32:35,931
...that the rest of you are all dead.

978
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,728
When they come out,
they may leave you to the buzzards...

979
01:32:38,903 --> 01:32:40,803
...and go ahead and join Cochise.

980
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:44,807
lt means Beecher's life and Marsh's....

981
01:32:46,911 --> 01:32:48,742
What about you?

982
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:55,844
ls this in the book too, Roper?
