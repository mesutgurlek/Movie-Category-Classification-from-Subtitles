1
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,911
This is the story of a land...

2
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,232
...and its people in
the year 1870...

3
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,389
...and of a man...

4
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,232
...whose name was Cochise.

5
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,515
He was an Indian...

6
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,069
...leader of the Chiricahua
Apache tribe.

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,631
I was involved in the story...

8
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,832
...and what I am telling happened
exactly as you"ll see it.

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,391
The only change will be that
when the Apaches speak...

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,631
...they will speak in our language.

11
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,474
What took place is part of
the history of Arizona...

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,673
...and it began for me here,
where you see me riding.

13
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,915
Since leaving the Army I had been
prospecting for gold off and...

14
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,154
...one day I heard the colonel
at Tucson wanted to see me.

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,074
The story started when I saw
Buzzards circling in the sky.

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,911
The buzzard"s a smart bird.

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,390
Something...

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,154
...or somebody, was
getting ready to die.

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,752
I figured it was a hurt deer
or a rabbit or a snake.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,989
Not a rabbit...

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,479
...not a deer.

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,074
His kind was more dangerous
than a snake.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,638
He was an Apache.

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,756
For ten years we"d been on a
savage war with his people...

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,388
...a bloody, no_give, no_take war.

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,230
Drink.

27
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,358
Better slow.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,752
I could have killed you before.

29
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,836
A fire was dangerous
in Apache country.

30
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,994
But his wounds were bad and
he was running a high fever.

31
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,475
He had eight pieces of buckshot
in his back and I dug them out.

32
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,915
He was in pain but he never
let out a sound.

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,154
For the next few days I panned
the stream for gold...

34
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,594
...and watched the boy.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,548
I wanted to be on the move, and
I was glad he was recovering.

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,352
Do your legs feel stronger today?

37
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,236
Little bit.

38
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,072
You've still got a limp.

39
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,719
Today I must leave.

40
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,151
No, I must go. Too soon for you.

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,232
For my legs, yes, but
for my family, no.

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,753
This is my novice time.

43
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,229
I am 14. So I learn to be a man.

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,152
I go on trips alone.

45
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,551
But I have been away too long.

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,309
In the wickiup my mother is crying.

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,478
My father looks for me, I think.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,638
I am their only one now.

49
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,788
My brother and my sister were
killed at Big Creek.

50
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,676
"My mother is crying", he said.

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,311
It never struck me that an Apache
woman would cry over her son...

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,833
...like any other woman.

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,629
"Apaches are wild animals",
we all said.

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,630
Do you pray to Killer of Enemies?

55
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,676
Not even to Life Giver?
_
The ones up there.

56
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,795
We have another name.

57
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,549
Apaches pray for all
white men to die.

58
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,993
But now I pray to keep you safe.

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,153
At sunset last night, I threw pollen
to the four winds for you.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,238
Thanks, boy.

61
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,159
This is very big...

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,151
...against headache and sickness.

63
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,833
Now it is yours.

64
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,994
They could have killed.
Put away you gun.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,549
My people are watching us.
They see I am unharmed.

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,908
This is clear talk.

67
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,911
It says they can still kill.

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,069
This white man is my friend.

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,755
This white man is my friend.

70
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,079
He must not be hurt.

71
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,515
When did my son become a tame Apache?

72
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,514
Father look! He gave me life again
when the soldiers wounded me.

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,238
Where did you meet soldiers?

74
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,239
It will shame us to say.

75
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,636
An Apache should not do what
others cannot know.

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,596
This one...

77
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,079
...he was with them?
No.
_

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,233
He found me later. He healed me.
It will be wrong to harm him.

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,833
You do no give orders.

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,479
You speak our tongue?

81
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,755
A little.

82
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,832
White men pay many dollars
for the scalp of an Apache.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,830
I know.

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,638
Then why did you not take his scalp?

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,232
If I kill an Apache it'll not
be for scalp or money.

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,994
Why not? My people and your
people are at war.

87
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,479
It is not my way to fight.

88
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,756
It is the way of all whites.
- It is not my way.

89
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,831
You are a woman maybe.

90
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,595
Apaches do not take scalps either.
And they are not women.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,513
He hides something.

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,751
Why are you here in our mountains?

93
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,479
I look for gold and silver.

94
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,595
For what?

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,675
For yellow iron.

96
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,833
You did not kill.

97
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,671
We will not kill this time.

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,559
But not again.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,399
Give him his gun.

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,154
They wanted to kill me all
right, but they let me go.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,752
I learned things that day.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
Apache mothers cried
about their sons.

103
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,559
Apache men had a sense
of fair play.

104
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,194
Ambush! Run!

105
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,633
Two men were killed, and for
the three wounded it was worse.

106
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,310
But this was war, and it was
cruelty in both sides.

107
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,754
On one of the men they
found a pouch...

108
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,070
...which held three Apache scalps.

109
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,236
So they dug a pit and they rubbed
his face with sweet juice...

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,070
...and made me watch the ants come.

111
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,150
Learn it...

112
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,915
...learn it well, this is Apache
land. You have no right here.

113
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,753
Where Cochise lives,
no white man can live.

114
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,834
Take your weapons. Go!

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,479
Let your face not be seen again!

116
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,909
Howdy, gents.

117
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,672
Hi, Tom.

118
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,470
Find yourself a gold mine?
No.
_

119
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,239
Howdy, Terry.

120
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,749
Just coffee for me.

121
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,309
We have smoked turkey today.
- No, just coffee, thanks.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,149
Wipe them all out...

123
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,992
...but cheer them.

124
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,072
Jeffords?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,912
I'm Colonel Bernall.

126
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,909
You received my message?

127
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,832
That's why I came.
What's on you mind?

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,592
I'm the new chief at Fort Grand.

129
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,556
Congratulations.

130
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,150
My orders are to clean out
Cochise and his Apaches.

131
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,238
A big order, sir.

132
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,836
Wipe them all out. Butcher
them like hogs, I say...

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,479
...like hogs.

134
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,151
This man was in a party of miners...

135
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,756
...ambushed yesterday by Apaches.

136
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,834
Where was the ambush?

137
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,910
Just south of here.

138
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,993
They wounded Cochise and killed
12 Apaches out of 50.

139
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,711
There weren't 50 only 5,
and not a one scratched.

140
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,399
How do you know, Jeffords?

141
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,470
I watched it.

142
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,717
Watched it? Seems to me most
men would have lent a hand.

143
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,640
I was tied. The Apaches
got me earlier.

144
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,512
You fought your way out?

145
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,069
They let me go.

146
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,392
I never heard of a thing like that
happening to a white man.

147
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,432
Did you, John?
No.
_

148
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,073
Did you, Milt?
No.
_

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,309
I ran across a wounded
Chiricahua boy.

150
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,517
I healed him up. They thought
they owed me something.

151
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,070
Apaches playing fair?
Yes.
_

152
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,559
I don't understand.

153
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,274
You mean you found a wounded
Apache and didn't kill him?

154
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,670
That's right.

155
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,478
I'd like to ask you why?

156
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,512
What do you want from me, Colonel?

157
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,239
Jeffords...

158
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,630
...I think I know how
we can stop Cochise.

159
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,993
I have 250 men from Pennsylvania
and New Jersey.

160
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,513
They're disciplined troopers.

161
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,910
Yes, I've seen them around.
- I have a good plan.

162
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,913
I want information from you and
I want you to do reconnoitering.

163
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,038
In six months the war will be over
and we'll have Cochise hanging.

164
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,635
No, you won't, Colonel.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,991
Jeffords, I'm an expert
on open warfare.

166
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,310
I have thirty...
- Cochise can't read a map...

167
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,235
...but he knows every gulley,
every mountain in Arizona.

168
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,393
His men and horses can go
twice as far as yours.

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,991
He can't write his name...

170
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,231
...but his intelligence
service knows when...

171
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,153
...you got to Fort Grant and
how many men you've got.

172
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,910
He's stopped the Butterfield
stage from running...

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,469
...he's stopped the U.S. mails
from going through.

174
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,998
For the first time he has all
the Apaches under one command.

175
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,390
You're not going to string
him up in six months.

176
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,152
Not in six years.

177
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,673
Good day, gents.

178
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,752
Terry.
Jeffords!
_

179
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,039
Will you scout for me?

180
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,391
You can find somebody else.
- Maybe...

181
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,472
...Captain Jeffords became too
friendly with the Apaches.

182
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,074
Maybe he doesn't know
what side he's on.

183
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,753
Easy, gents.

184
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,073
I'm not looking for trouble but if
you don't fight them...

185
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,071
...you're with them.
I've got to say that.

186
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,468
Who says so? Your name?

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,632
Ben Slade. I own a ranch only
a mile out from Fort Grant.

188
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,559
The Apaches burned my
house last month.

189
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,718
My wife was inside.

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,831
They almost got my boy too.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,560
A white man should hate that.

192
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,789
Right. Anybody would.

193
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,957
Why don't you join
the Colonel's staff?

194
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,993
That's private business, Slade.
- War ain't private business...

195
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,673
...when they kill women and kids.

196
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,831
At Big Creek we killed
Indian women and kids.

197
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,479
Cochise started this and any...

198
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,756
Hold on! Let's just get
the facts straight here.

199
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,558
Cochise didn't start this war.

200
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,638
A snooty little lieutenant fresh
out of the east started it.

201
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,070
He flew a flag of truce which
Cochise honored...

202
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,992
...then he hanged his brother and...

203
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,309
...others under the flag.

204
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,959
You hear all sorts of stories.

205
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,475
You want to know why I didn't
kill that Apache boy?

206
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,837
For the same reason I wouldn't kill
your boy or scout for the army.

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,831
I'm sick and tired of
all this killing.

208
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,911
And, who asked us out
here in first place?

209
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,513
I don't know, Tom.

210
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,159
I don't say we do right.

211
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,038
But we're bringing civilization here.

212
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,073
Clothes, carpets, hats,
boots, medicine.

213
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,152
Why I got a wagonload of whiskey...

214
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,514
...waiting in the east?

215
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,399
I could sell that if it
wasn't for Cochise.

216
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,515
It's an ambush!

217
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,999
Run!

218
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,558
Juan, come on in.

219
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,992
Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Milt.

220
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,549
After all this time, one
single freight wagon...

221
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,988
...squeezed through.

222
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,798
Cochise didn't show his ugly face.

223
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,435
Are you sending your mail riders
with the military?

224
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,398
It'd take the Army and Navy.

225
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,313
No eastern mail has gone out
or come in for seven weeks.

226
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,755
The Apaches are shooting my
job right from under me.

227
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,198
Maybe there's a way to
get your mail through.

228
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,349
A new route?

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,468
Could I use this office every
afternoon for a while?

230
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,551
What for?
Juan.
_

231
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,833
Juan, I've got work for you.

232
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,230
I want to hire you for
maybe almost a moon.

233
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,595
I want you to teach me
to speak Apache good.

234
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,557
I want to learn about Apache spirits.

235
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,877
I want to learn about the Apache
ways. Apache in here.

236
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,315
No white man asks to learn
these things. Why do you?

237
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,993
I want to speak to Cochise.

238
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,309
Are you crazy, Tom?

239
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,835
Milt, I'm sick and tired
of being in the middle.

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,309
I'm tired of people like Lowrie,
Terry, and you...

241
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,549
...asking my position.

242
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,995
I've been willing to go
into Cochise's territory...

243
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,628
...to look for gold.
I've risked before.

244
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,512
Cochise will not speak
with white men.

245
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,079
We'll send up smoke signals.

246
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,309
He will not come here.

247
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,391
No, I want to go and see him.

248
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,312
To his stronghold?
- That's right.

249
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,391
No white man's seen
Cochise in ten years...

250
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,472
...and lived to tell it.
- Once you could talk to him.

251
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,834
Don't try it, Tom.

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,558
The ants will eat your eyes.

253
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,239
That could happen any time.

254
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,958
Like the other day.

255
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,875
Juan, will you teach me?

256
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,514
I want to tell Cochise to
let the mail go through.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,749
Maybe even about peace.

258
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,230
Yes...

259
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,312
...I will teach you, and for this
I will not take any dollars.

260
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,552
But I think it will end bad.
I think Cochise will kill you.

261
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,954
Milt, can we use the office?

262
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,435
It's your eyes.

263
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,308
Good enough. Apache eyes quick.

264
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,232
This says you come in peace.

265
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,153
They will doubt it but it'll
make them want to find out.

266
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,912
You've speak our language well.

267
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,391
You do not yet think
like an Apache...

268
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,954
...but you are close to.

269
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,912
Juan, you've been a good guide.

270
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,913
If I see Cochise...

271
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,435
...what grows from our talks
will be from you too.

272
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,232
Last night I heard an owl...

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,833
...the worst of all signs.

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,309
It is not yet too late.
Come back with me.

275
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,993
They will kill you.

276
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,073
I didn't hear the owl, Juan,
but thank you anyway.

277
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,829
Remember then: . .

278
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,149
...lf you see him...

279
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,469
...do not lie to him.

280
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,073
Not in the smallest thing.

281
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,151
His eyes ill see into your heart.

282
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,311
He is greater than other men.

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,629
I started into the canyons that
let into Cochise"s country.

284
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,310
I never felt so lonely and
frightened in my life.

285
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,515
For three days I climbed
higher towards...

286
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,830
...the Apache stronghold.

287
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,072
On the third day...

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,549
...I was nearing the entrance
to the stronghold.

289
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,672
Juan had told me what to look for.

290
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,468
Cochise had given me
permission to enter.

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,558
I kept my hands visible...

292
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,239
...away from my weapons...

293
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,238
...and I tried to look at ease.

294
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,560
It is known that the chief
of Chiricahua Apaches...

295
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,398
...is the greatest Indian leader.

296
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,072
I have come to speak to him about
the welfare of his people.

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,558
It is known he respects truth...

298
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,398
...as he respects bravery.

299
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,398
You will hold these for me?

300
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,312
I will want them when I leave.

301
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,470
How do you know you will
leave here alive?

302
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,079
I am Cochise.

303
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,675
Speak.

304
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,516
When the Indian wishes to
signal his brother...

305
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,636
...he does so by smoke signs.

306
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,318
This is the white man's signal.

307
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,994
My brothers far away can look at
this and understand my meaning.

308
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,913
We call this mail.

309
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,070
The men who carry the
mail are like the air...

310
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,549
...that carries the Apache
smoke signals.

311
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,072
They seek no trouble.

312
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,232
Yet your warriors kill them.

313
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,072
I've come here ask you to let
these men travel in safety.

314
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,629
This mail carries war
signals against us.

315
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,754
No, this is used for other talk.

316
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,991
War signals are sent
by the military...

317
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,639
...by special ways.

318
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,069
How?

319
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,312
Sometimes by a thing we
call the telegraph.

320
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,717
Other times by men like me.

321
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,390
You have carried messages against us?

322
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,671
When I was a scout for
the military, yes.

323
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,354
You have fought us?

324
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,590
Yes.

325
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,599
In the battle of Apache Pass.

326
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,319
Come with me.

327
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,113
You are a brave man.

328
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,068
Now hear me.

329
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,151
I am the leader of my people.

330
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,393
They do not betray me and
I do not betray them.

331
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,756
We fight for out land against
Americans who try to take it.

332
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,309
You give me no reason why I should
not kill American mail riders...

333
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,629
...and kill you too.

334
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,551
You were not asked to come here.

335
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,559
Mail riders do you no harm.

336
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,309
Apaches who did your people
no harm were hanged.

337
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,311
One was my brother.

338
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,311
My people have done
yours great wrong.

339
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,471
I have always said this.

340
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,956
Do you think because I am
an Indian I am a fool?

341
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,030
You can trick me?

342
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,310
I would not have come here
if I thought that.

343
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,073
A fool sees only today.

344
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,550
Because I respect you and your
people I think of tomorrow.

345
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,319
What about tomorrow?

346
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,229
The Apaches are warriors
without equal.

347
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,797
But they are small in number...

348
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,473
...and tomorrow they'll be fewer.

349
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,356
I will not talk of that with you.

350
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,513
Is it not possible that your
people and mine...

351
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,636
...can some day live together
like brothers?

352
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,313
That is strange talk
from a white man.

353
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,234
Your people do not want peace.
They have taught me that.

354
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,631
This mail can be the first step.
I ask you to think on it.

355
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,990
Why should not the white
man act first?

356
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,752
Am I better than the white man?

357
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,638
A white man has come here.

358
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,311
I ask you to think of your people...

359
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,589
...and look at tomorrow.

360
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,071
My mind must work on it.

361
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,548
You will rest here tonight.

362
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,318
It is my strong wish.

363
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,150
Walk with me so they will
see us together...

364
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,832
...so you will be safe here.

365
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,637
What is the meaning of the dance?

366
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,990
The Spirits of Good and
Evil are dancing.

367
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,434
Not everyone can do it.

368
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,670
If it's done wrong they
will be angry up there.

369
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,550
This must be the dance preceding
the sunrise ceremony for a girl.

370
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,469
You know about it?

371
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,675
A little bit.

372
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,391
Without words it tells me things.

373
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,677
You are very different from
other whites, Tall One.

374
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,478
You learn to speak our tongue...

375
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,150
...try to understand our ways.

376
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,835
It is good to understand
the ways of others.

377
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,311
I respect your people, Cochise.

378
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,992
You know what I am thinking?

379
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,473
Maybe some day you will kill
me or I will kill you...

380
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,912
...but we will not spit
on each other.

381
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,193
That is how I feel.

382
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,230
The girl inside the wickiup is in
the holiest time of her live.

383
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,991
These four days she becomes White
Painted Lady, Mother of Life.

384
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,513
It is good luck to visit her now.

385
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,912
Would you like to visit her?
Yes.
_

386
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,833
Were you ever wounded?

387
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,228
In my arm.

388
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,628
We will tell her.

389
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,992
For this night only this girl is
more holy than most, maybe...

390
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,549
...because she has been away
from us for a long time.

391
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,151
She is very old for this ceremony.

392
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,833
It's very special.

393
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,239
White Painted Lady...

394
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,912
...I have old wounds.

395
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,468
Yes...

396
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,072
...but each scar is a mark
of love for your people.

397
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,638
The path of you people is
stretched long behind you...

398
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,072
...and you are the head...

399
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,639
...and you are the heart...

400
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,399
...and you are the blood.

401
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,550
Killer of Enemies is your
father and you are his son.

402
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,239
You will be well.

403
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,198
I have brought someone with me.

404
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,273
Then he is welcome.

405
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,752
He has an old arm wound.

406
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,673
Give me your arm.

407
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,114
Does it hurt you?

408
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,708
Sometimes.

409
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,232
It will never hurt again.

410
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,833
Your life will be long.

411
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,232
The good things will be yours.

412
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,231
The sun will shine for you.

413
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,068
What's her name?

414
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,639
Sonseeahray.

415
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,671
It means Morning Star.

416
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,992
Morning Star.

417
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,435
This is called shaving.

418
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,549
You...

419
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,678
...see white men have more hair on
their faces than Indians, so...

420
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,388
...they cut it of instead
of pulling the hairs out.

421
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,751
Maybe you'd like to come closer.

422
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,671
Don't be afraid, Sonseeahray.

423
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,834
See?

424
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,912
I'm not afraid.

425
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,550
I thought you were skinning yourself.

426
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,750
No.

427
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,672
Does it hurt?
No.
_

428
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,234
How did you know I was there?

429
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,549
I saw you through this.

430
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,628
This is much better than looking
in a pool of water.

431
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,398
And now I see you.

432
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,153
What a thing it is.

433
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,430
It's yours to keep.

434
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,310
Well...

435
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,677
...if you had it you could
see how beautiful you are.

436
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,830
Why do you leave? Stay, please.

437
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,479
It is not fitting. I...

438
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,596
...I should have run
away quick before.

439
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,749
Why?

440
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,070
I am not married.

441
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,910
Are you not allowed to
talk to Apache men?

442
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,754
Old men.

443
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,399
Never young men?

444
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,835
Only at ceremonies or in the dancing.

445
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,235
I thought that Apache boys and girls
pick those they wanted.

446
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,073
Well, how can they do that
if they do not meet?

447
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,832
They meet.

448
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,949
There are ways.
- What ways?

449
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,312
They meet by accident where
no one sees them.

450
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,470
Like my mother could see
me here with you.

451
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,993
I understand.

452
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,389
Now I must go. I have work
to pick juniper berries.

453
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,436
Where?

454
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,830
There.

455
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,231
I was going to walk up
that way myself...

456
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,229
...by accident.

457
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,913
Sonseeahray.

458
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,071
I walk this way because I don't
know when I may see you again.

459
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,628
When do you go?

460
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
I don't know. Cochise said
he would talk to me soon.

461
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,470
Will you come back?
- I hope so.

462
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,756
I want to. It's important to me.

463
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,869
Why?

464
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,033
May I speak truly...

465
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,348
...from my heart?

466
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,113
It will be all right.

467
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,272
All my life I've been mostly alone.
I wanted it that way...

468
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,113
...but when I saw you in the wickiup
and you touched me...

469
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,598
...and you prayed for me...

470
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,191
...I felt bad being alone...

471
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,753
...and I knew that I needed to
see you again before I left...

472
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,637
...so that I could find out if
it was the same as last night.

473
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,435
Is it the same?

474
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,359
Yes.

475
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,873
So now when I go away...

476
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,073
...l'll be lonely for someone for
the first time in my life.

477
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,032
I have decided about the mail.

478
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,955
If I let the riders go in safety,
but no one else...

479
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,033
...there will be no loss.

480
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,349
It will show the whites what
power the Apache has.

481
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,268
It makes me laugh.

482
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,193
A good step. The seed is small...

483
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,793
...maybe the tree will grow big.

484
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,598
I'll be happy to tell my people.

485
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,713
Is it straight, Captain?
You saw Cochise himself?

486
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,915
That's right.

487
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,515
Any lad who would go into
Cochise's camp alone...

488
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,874
...is some punkin of a man.

489
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,634
Or a blasted liar!

490
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,191
I believe Captain Jefford's word...

491
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,750
...but not the word of
and Apache murderer.

492
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,192
Cochise said the mail would ride
safe. I believe him.

493
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,192
While you were up there with him...

494
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,670
...his men attacked a wagon train
near here and killed every one.

495
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,510
Another band attacked Kliner's ranch
and killed three men and a boy.

496
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,511
Cochise never said anything
about calling off the war.

497
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,432
He said the mail was safe.

498
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,237
Are you willing to bet on
the word of an Indian?

499
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,510
You name it.

500
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,030
Will you lay three hundred dollars...

501
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,112
...that five riders in succession
leave here and five come back.

502
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,509
You've got a bet.

503
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,272
The mail's piled up...

504
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,433
...and the route's guaranteed safe
by Tom Jeffords and Cochise.

505
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,957
Three days of riding in
the sunshine at high pay.

506
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,033
Who's first?

507
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,428
Looks like you'll have to
go yourself, Jeffords.

508
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,472
Only that won't prove a thing.

509
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,033
I'll go.

510
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,758
That'll prove something.

511
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,599
Duffield's back!

512
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,028
It's Duffield.

513
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,189
He's back.

514
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,433
Good boy!

515
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,108
See any Apaches?

516
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,953
Saw a few some signals but
not one live Indian.

517
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,950
Hi, Milt.

518
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,156
It's all right, Tom.
- Why'd you take so long?

519
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,715
When I got there safe I got drunk.
Took time to sober up.

520
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,794
One made it but there's
still four more.

521
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,679
My bet's safe.

522
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,199
You want to double it?

523
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,672
After Duffield returned,
we sent out a second rider.

524
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,758
He saw some Apaches but
nothing happened.

525
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,670
The third rider, too, said it
was peaceful on the trail.

526
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,593
When the fourth rider went out I
was really proud of Cochise.

527
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,511
The days passed quietly and on
one of those quiet days...

528
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,877
...a wagon train left Messilla
Park for Tucson.

529
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,111
Colonel Bernall was in charge.

530
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,190
Spectacular country, isn't, General?

531
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,354
I wouldn't presume to tell and
Indian fighter his business...

532
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,751
...but we're inviting an ambush.

533
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,632
Apaches could be hiding over there.

534
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm not only inviting ambush,
I'm praying for it.

535
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,669
Why?

536
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,438
You've only got 75 men.

537
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,352
My mule drivers are armed...

538
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,432
...and I've got 50 riflemen hiding
under blankets in the wagons.

539
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,553
My eyes are getting old.

540
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,428
Nahilzay!

541
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,509
Halt!

542
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,591
Pistol attack!

543
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,519
No mister, no!

544
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,997
Goklia! Cut them off!

545
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,993
They're cutting off the cavalry!

546
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,950
Halt!

547
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,590
Nahilzay! Pionsenay!

548
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,715
The foot soldiers!

549
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,829
Seize the wagons!

550
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,589
Cut to pieces...

551
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,116
...fifty dead and a hundred wounded.
Colonel Bernall killed...

552
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,273
...five thousand pounds of grain,
every wagon, gun, and mule.

553
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,433
How did Cochise know we had
men hidden in the wagons?

554
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,196
He knows what goes on everywhere.

555
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,874
Who's the spy? I say, hang him.

556
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,678
I can tell you.

557
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,029
We all can.

558
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,030
Who?

559
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,872
Duffield in here?

560
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,950
Yeah.

561
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,189
What do you want?

562
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,432
Your last mail rider's just
come in, safe and sound.

563
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,110
Thanks.

564
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,190
Yeah...

565
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,793
...where's Lowrie?

566
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,191
You lost your bet, Lowrie.

567
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,078
It don't pay to bet
with Tom Jeffords.

568
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,033
He's a personal friend of
that murderer, Cochise.

569
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,350
It was all a plot.

570
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,190
How was it fixed?

571
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,510
I got both hands on the bar.
How was it fixed?
_

572
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,113
I'm a rancher, not a gunner.

573
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,759
Slade. You got friends here.

574
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,870
You want to plug me.

575
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,031
Cochise don't do favors for nothing.

576
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,031
He got something.
- What? What'd he get?

577
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,156
You tell us. Was it guns,
or was it whiskey?

578
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,757
Anybody else want to
call me a renegade?

579
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,433
You are not a renegade, Jeffords.

580
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,511
A man's a liar who says you are...

581
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,875
...but why is Cochise
so partial to you?

582
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,111
How does he let the
mail rider through...

583
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,316
...on the same day he wipes
out a wagon train?

584
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,030
Because he's a man of honor.

585
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,430
A man of honor? No Indian's
a man of honor.

586
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,433
The first peace move in ten years
and you're blind, all of you.

587
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,951
We'll have peace when every
Apache is hung from a tree!

588
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,913
Here's your 300 dollars, Jeffords.

589
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,193
The drinks are on me.

590
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,511
I don't drink on any Indian lover.

591
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,756
He's a copperhead. He sold us out.

592
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,791
String him up! What
are we waiting for?

593
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,029
Release that man.

594
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,394
Release that man.

595
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,399
I'm grateful to you, General.
- I don't want your gratitude.

596
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,109
I won't scout Indians for
you or anybody else.

597
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,510
I don't want you to.
What then?
_

598
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,796
I want you to take me to see Cochise.

599
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,431
If anybody can do it, you can.

600
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,194
I know you have reason to be angry.

601
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,192
But please hear me out.

602
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,512
You don't like Army
officers apparently.

603
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,872
Does this also prejudice
you against me?

604
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,553
That depends on how you read it.

605
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,919
The Bible I read preaches
brotherhood.

606
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,911
Suppose their skins aren't white.
Are they still God's children?

607
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,874
My Bible says nothing about
the pigmentation of the skin.

608
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,950
There was a General
served under Grant...

609
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,439
...the Christian General.

610
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,034
Yes, also Bible-Reading_Howard.

611
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,677
Why do you want to see Cochise?

612
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,678
To make a peace treaty with him.

613
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,029
Who sent you here?

614
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,349
The President of the U.S.

615
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,034
With what power?
- Full power to make a fair treaty.

616
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,158
To be changed later.

617
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,797
My treaty will stand. I have
the President's word.

618
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,270
I'll do nothing, General,
to betray Cochise.

619
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,954
Why all this change of
heart in Washington?

620
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,839
President Grant is eager for a
fair peace with the Apaches.

621
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,793
What is a fair peace?
- Suppose you tell me.

622
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,599
Equality.

623
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,440
The Apaches are a free.
They have a right to stay free...

624
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,716
...on their own land.
The whole southwest?
_

625
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,870
No.

626
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,952
No, even Cochise wouldn't ask
for that now. He's a realist.

627
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,350
But a clear territory
that's Apache...

628
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,272
...ruled by Apaches
that's what I mean.

629
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,875
No soldiers on it.

630
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,837
Yes, I'll agree to that. What else?

631
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,997
You can talk the rest
over the Cochise.

632
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,714
You'll take me to him alone?
Without soldiers?
_

633
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,871
Is that the best way?
- That's the only way.

634
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,870
I'll go alone.

635
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,395
I'll see Cochise.
I'll get in touch with you.

636
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,511
Read your Bible for me too.

637
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,112
I like the way you read it.

638
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,599
Welcome.

639
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,033
Your signals were seen and they
have been told to Cochise.

640
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,872
He is in the other stronghold.

641
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,996
He asks you to wait
and be comfortable.

642
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,395
He will return.

643
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,439
I will wait.

644
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,114
My feet are tired from trying
to find you by accident.

645
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,235
Waiting for you, I...

646
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,437
...I have washed my hair twice
and my clothes three times.

647
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,792
How is this soap made?

648
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,599
It comes from yucca root.
We grind it up.

649
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,193
Sonseeahray...

650
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,318
...there's something I need to know.

651
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,272
I've been away almost a moon.

652
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,193
Has anything changed with you?

653
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,749
No.

654
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,034
When you went away I...

655
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,519
...I became frightened.

656
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,189
I thought...

657
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,032
...he won't come back...

658
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,432
...and if he does, when he returns
from his own people...

659
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,795
...he will look at me with cool eyes.

660
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,669
But then I...

661
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,952
...I stopped being afraid...

662
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,795
...in here.

663
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,430
You're trembling.
You're not frightened of me?

664
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,916
No.

665
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,430
Only you put such new
feelings in my heart.

666
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,717
I am trembling inside too.
Should I hide it?

667
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,589
No.

668
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,270
Tom!

669
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,759
Here they come and he
rides before them.

670
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,351
It will be told at our campfires...

671
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,033
...how the Chiracahuas fought.

672
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,952
How the great Cochise led us.

673
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,951
A great wagon train destroyed.

674
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,033
Their wagons and horses taken.
Corn for the whole winter...

675
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,189
...blankets, guns!

676
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,872
In a battle there are losses.

677
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,600
Some of our men have gone to
live with their fathers.

678
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,759
They were brave.

679
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,554
They died honorably.

680
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,760
Now for the last time,
listen to their names.

681
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,559
They will be angry if their names
are ever mentioned again.

682
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,108
Ponce.

683
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,199
Victorio.

684
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,952
Pionsenay and his son Machogee.

685
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,872
Naratena.

686
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,910
Big Chee.

687
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,076
No, thank you.

688
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,152
If I make a peace with
this General...

689
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,594
...can other bigger break it?

690
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,035
No, he speaks for the Chief.
There's no one bigger.

691
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,592
Can I trust them?
- Will they trust you?

692
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,712
My word is my life.
I do not break it.

693
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,758
I know that. They do not.

694
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,951
There can be no peace
without good will.

695
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,189
Try it.

696
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,113
All Americans are not
like that lieutenant.

697
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,273
You trust me, Cochise. There
are Americans that I trust.

698
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,951
There are Indians that
I would not trust.

699
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,029
Me too.

700
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,519
After eating, wipe the
hands on the arms.

701
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,033
The grease is good for them.

702
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,111
Among white men we wash it off.

703
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,679
What a waste.

704
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,352
My friend, all evening your eyes
have gone to that same maiden.

705
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,034
You must understand...

706
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,877
...any man may be friendly with a
woman whose husband is dead...

707
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,589
...but not with a maiden
like Sonseeahray.

708
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,397
Cochise, I...

709
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,670
This girl has been asked for already.

710
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,951
I think she will be married soon.

711
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,874
You have been chosen.

712
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,553
It will be an insult not to go.

713
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,471
We should not be seen together, Tom.

714
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,313
If that is true, why did you
choose me to dance with?

715
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,273
I could not help it.

716
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,999
With me it's the same.

717
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,752
I'll speak to your parents tonight.

718
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,831
No, Tom. It will cause deep trouble.

719
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,355
You must not.
- It causes trouble already.

720
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,077
You have not acted like my brother.

721
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,757
I told you that she is a maiden,
and yet you came here.

722
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,717
I want her for my wife.

723
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,154
I will do all the things expected
of a husband here.

724
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,238
I refused Nahilzay once.
I will again.

725
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,953
I am glad it is the right way...

726
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,792
...but it will not be easy for you.

727
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,308
You are an American.

728
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,837
Where will you live? Here?

729
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,310
Apaches who have suffered from
white men will hate you.

730
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,274
Tucson, maybe?

731
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,194
Won't the whites hate your wife for
of the color of her skin?

732
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,831
You will go far away maybe...

733
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,679
...in new places...

734
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,551
...but your eyes will see nothing.

735
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,556
Always they will be
turned backwards...

736
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,754
...toward home.

737
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,799
And you, Sonseeahray...

738
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,794
...they will look at you as
at a strange animal...

739
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,075
...and make jokes.

740
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,793
Hear me, Tall One...

741
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,038
...I ask you to think on it.

742
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,631
Your way will be filled
with bitterness.

743
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,635
Think...

744
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,350
...is it not better to
live with your own?

745
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,997
Though you are my friend, Cochise,
nothing can change it.

746
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,072
I will marry Sonseeahray.

747
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,831
What he says does not have to be.

748
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,718
You are young. You do not know.

749
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,951
With him I do not tremble...

750
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,679
...even before you.

751
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,117
I cannot say more against it.

752
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,799
But it won't be easy.

753
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,799
Her parents. You will need
a strong go-between.

754
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,518
Will you be my go-between?

755
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,079
No other can do it.

756
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,235
I will speak for you tonight,
otherwise it will be worse.

757
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,751
Already everyone knows of this.

758
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,438
Your secret was as quiet
as the thunder.

759
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,751
Also I will speak to Nahilzay.

760
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,195
He has bad luck. It has happened
before to other men.

761
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,313
You wait in your wickiup maybe.

762
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,756
Walk up and down.

763
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,717
It is good for people in love.

764
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,428
Well?

765
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,232
You have no luck with women.

766
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,475
They refused.

767
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,475
I'll take her away from here!
She'll go with me too.

768
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,159
They did not refuse.

769
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,993
I make ajoke.
It is always a good joke.

770
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,358
It is all arranged. Three horses
and saddles to the parents.

771
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,353
I'll get them in Tucson.

772
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,829
No. You will let me
give them for you.

773
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,831
No.
- No, I want to.

774
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,878
They're almost yours anyway.

775
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,348
They come from your people.

776
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,432
I want to do this for you.

777
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,830
You marry next month.

778
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,115
Why the delay?

779
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,670
Her mother decided. It is her right.

780
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,628
Listen now.

781
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,234
Go to Tucson.

782
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,072
Look into the heart of this general.

783
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,958
Bring him back if you believe him.

784
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,588
I will send out runners, Apaches
from all tribes will come here.

785
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,992
To talk of peace is a big thing.
I cannot decide it alone.

786
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,478
My people may not want it.

787
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,389
I make no promises.

788
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,913
That is not expected.

789
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,319
Good sleep, my brother.

790
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,079
Remember, no promises.

791
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,513
I heard noise.

792
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,595
It is not your knife.
It is an Apache knife.

793
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,158
To attack someone who has been
given safety here is forbidden.

794
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,235
It is a terrible wrong.
It cannot be allowed.

795
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,673
Nothing's changed.

796
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,909
Go to Tucson.

797
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,308
Return in ten days.

798
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,877
I ask you to forgive me that one
of my people broke my word.

799
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,713
Nahilzay.

800
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,116
In battle I have had no one like you.

801
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,152
Our lives were often mixed.

802
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,991
It is ended. You have
betrayed our people.

803
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,833
I went back to Tucson and
studied General Howard.

804
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,156
Before our return I learned to
respect the Christian General.

805
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,516
I prayed that a decent peace
would come from this.

806
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,552
I wanted it for my country...

807
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,115
...for Cochise and his people...

808
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,755
...and I wanted it because
I loved a girl.

809
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,596
I am told it is permitted to visit.

810
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,918
For a short time only.

811
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,279
My mother is inside the wickiup.
You will sit there...

812
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,151
...and I will keep sitting here...

813
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,755
...for we must not even
touch our hands.

814
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,114
During the days I...

815
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,909
...I am very busy now. I prepare
my clothes for the wedding.

816
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,116
I must build a special wickiup
for our honeymoon...

817
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,439
...away from everybody.

818
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,312
Our honeymoon, Tom!

819
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,797
I must also build the wickiup
we will live in.

820
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,118
In all this my mother helps
me and teaches me...

821
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,672
...and I try to do as I...

822
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,149
...I think she did when
she was a girl.

823
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,272
And she couldn't have done it neater.

824
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,117
What is that? What does it mean?

825
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,511
That's something Americans say.

826
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,515
It means that I love you and
I'll honor your parents.

827
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,433
You understand, Cochise, about
the signing of this map.

828
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,557
I will place my name upon yours...

829
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,472
...you will place your
mark upon mine.

830
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,079
What is this signing?

831
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,869
This is proof for all people of
any agreement that is made.

832
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,951
It is as we agreed yesterday.

833
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,038
You will explain it to the others.

834
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,119
The peace conference had been
going on for four days...

835
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,636
...and we were asked to approach
the meeting place.

836
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,433
We finally met the most important
men of the Apache tribes.

837
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,515
They had come from Arizona
and New Mexico...

838
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,232
...they would decide with Cochise
whether there would be peace.

839
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,436
My white brother will
tell you something.

840
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,115
I have in my hand here a map.

841
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,396
This is a sort of picture writing.

842
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,070
It shows the Apache territory,
fifty thousand square miles...

843
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,593
...that you have agreed upon.

844
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,069
This map will go back
to Washington...

845
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,635
...were the Chief of all
the white men lives.

846
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,470
If you make a treaty of peace...

847
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,957
...this will be part of that treaty.

848
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,192
If we make peace with
the Americans...

849
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,873
...can we still raid the Mexicans?

850
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,390
There cannot be war against
the Mexicans either.

851
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,069
Let the white eyes...

852
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,390
Wait. We will talk of
this by ourselves.

853
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,471
Now is the time only for questions.

854
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,912
If the chief of the white men
dies, what will follow?

855
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,399
His word is a bond on
the chief who follows him.

856
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,999
Do others wish to speak?

857
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,113
I have a question.

858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,312
Suppose some white man wants yellow
iron and he comes into our land.

859
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,635
Can we kill him?

860
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,275
He should be captured and
given to our military.

861
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,357
Then he will be judged and punished.

862
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,195
What if he resists capture until
he has killed one of my men?

863
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,639
If a white man kills an Indian on
your territory we will hung him.

864
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,316
That will be something
for Cochise to see.

865
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,914
Who else?

866
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,677
You will go now.
I will bring you our decision.

867
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,273
I trust none of it.

868
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,193
Four days ago we were given our
territory on a piece of paper.

869
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,319
Today we cannot go into Mexico.
The American General says no.

870
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,955
Already our territory is smaller.

871
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:55,230
Where will we get horses if not by
taking them from the Mexican?

872
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,798
The government will give us cattle.
We will raise and trade them.

873
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,912
The answer of a woman.

874
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,356
I am not afraid.
I speak from my heart.

875
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,669
You speak well.

876
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,068
Speak more.

877
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,359
Apaches are not
grandmothers to cattle.

878
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,830
Cochise now fears battle and
is ready to surrender.

879
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:23,551
It is not this false peace
we need but a new chief.

880
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,158
Now I say this.

881
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,151
The American keep cattle but
they are not soft or weak.

882
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,598
Why should not the Apache be
able to learn new ways?

883
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,197
It is not easy to change but
sometimes it is required.

884
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,671
The Americans are growing stronger...

885
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,312
...while we are growing weaker.

886
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,874
If a big wind comes,
a tree must bend...

887
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,670
...or be lifted out by its roots.

888
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,755
I will make a test of
it for three moons.

889
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,433
I break the arrow.

890
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,718
I will try the way of peace.

891
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,074
I will give my word to the
American General tonight.

892
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,469
Those who stay with me
must keep my word.

893
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,796
Let all others walk away.
They are no longer my brothers.

894
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,990
If more walk away than stay...

895
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,511
...then I will no longer
be your chief.

896
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,593
I walk away.

897
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,072
I walk away.

898
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,353
I walk away.

899
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,993
I walk away.

900
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,399
I walk away.

901
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,079
I walk away.

902
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,599
Who else comes?

903
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,993
Who else comes?

904
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,599
Who else?

905
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,837
Take your women, your children...

906
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,117
...your horses, your weapons.

907
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,194
Leave our territory.

908
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,719
I leave you my name also.

909
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,520
Now I am ashamed to be a Chiricahua.

910
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,599
I will take the name Mexican
enemies have given me.

911
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,159
The Whites will learn it...

912
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,673
...and you will learn it.

913
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,274
From now on...

914
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,953
...I am Geronimo!

915
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,029
If Geronimo or his followers come
to this territory again...

916
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,997
...let them come with weapons.

917
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,956
I am worried.
They're taking a long time...

918
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,235
...too long.

919
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,155
I am worried too. This is
delicious. What is it?

920
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,036
Pony. In you honor, General.

921
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,710
Pony? What kind of meat's that?

922
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,434
A pony is a small horse, General.

923
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,798
We will try this peace.

924
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,918
But there must be a waiting time...

925
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,355
...a time for testing. Three moons.

926
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,669
Why is it needed?

927
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,593
The white man has not kept
a peace in the past.

928
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,909
Three month armistice.
_
It's a good idea.

929
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,953
The first stone.

930
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,310
For every day without war
there will be another.

931
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,275
When 3 moons have passed,
the pile will be high.

932
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,712
Then we will place a white flag
on it and there will be peace.

933
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,592
My heart is glad, Cochise.

934
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,599
I am not yet glad.

935
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,319
To talk a peace is not hard.
To live it is very hard.

936
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,871
I will wait three moons to be glad.

937
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,436
Not everyone was happy
about the treaty.

938
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,150
Some still thought Cochise
was a murderer...

939
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,269
...and peace impossible
until he was dead.

940
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,670
But the 90 days of
the armistice began.

941
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,193
I saw things that never
happened before.

942
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,509
Near Fort Grant...

943
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,796
...a cavalry patrol passed
some Apaches.

944
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,389
They didn"t talk...

945
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,755
...they didn"t pretend they"d
become friends.

946
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,308
But they didn"t shoot.

947
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,234
Two days later the first coach
in five years left Tucson.

948
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,389
I rode with it on my way
back to the Stronghold.

949
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,757
Where's that water you
said we came to?

950
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,956
Right down below.
That's where I'll leave you.

951
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,072
Time to stretch, gents.

952
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,592
I can believe a fellow
can ride here...

953
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,352
...with his liver not turned white.

954
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,956
Yeah. A fellow can even think about
settling down and getting married.

955
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,317
Take cover!

956
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,949
What are you shooting at?

957
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,269
I saw something move.

958
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,475
Save your ammunition!

959
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,509
Blast you and that murdering Cochise
both. We'll be slaughtered.

960
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,033
Shut up!

961
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,592
Keep down under cover, everybody!

962
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,988
Now listen to me.

963
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,434
This isn't Cochise.

964
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,158
It's a band of renegade Indians.

965
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,630
There're a few of them or
they'd be rushing us.

966
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,752
They're very badly armed too.
What they want is our guns.

967
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,798
Well, we're pinned here.
They're waiting for night.

968
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,995
So what do we do?

969
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,673
Wait to be butchered in the dark?

970
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,273
Shut up!

971
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,829
Who's a good shot?

972
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,514
I'm not bad. Here.

973
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,913
When I yell, you and this fellow
start firing into the hill.

974
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,836
Lonergan, you cover the bank.

975
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,069
I'm coming upstream.

976
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,832
What do you do?
- Send smoke signals.

977
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,194
All right, start shooting!

978
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,433
How many rounds you got left?

979
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,669
Two.

980
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,716
One.

981
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,235
Those signal of Jeffords
did us a lot of good...

982
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,079
...a lot of good.

983
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,355
Listen!

984
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,236
Apaches protecting Americans!

985
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,758
I lived to see it!

986
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,073
Remember to talk about
it back in Tucson.

987
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,434
Twelve days.

988
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,319
I think it goes well. There
are many good signals.

989
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,069
It has gone well for twelve days.
I still wait to be glad.

990
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,151
Now you will forget about
peace and war.

991
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,199
Think only of your bride.

992
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,158
Is the ceremony a long one?

993
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,355
No...

994
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,875
...with us the ceremony of
love takes place here.

995
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,839
The rest is small.

996
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,275
Let the bride come here.

997
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,668
The time has come.

998
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,118
Let the groom take his
place beside her.

999
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,875
Your left hand.

1000
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,753
Your right hand.

1001
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,316
Kneel down upon the earth.

1002
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,591
Now your blood mixes.

1003
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,791
Now for you there is no rain...

1004
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,150
...for one is shelter to the other.

1005
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,115
Now for you there is no cold...

1006
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,239
...for one is warmth to the other.

1007
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,029
Now there is no loneliness...

1008
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,035
...now forever, there
is no loneliness.

1009
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,157
There are two bodies but now there
is but one blood in both.

1010
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,033
Go now. Ride the white horses
to your secret place.

1011
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,110
Look.

1012
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,989
The evening is full and happy for us.

1013
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,832
We will listen to the brook...

1014
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,228
...all through the night.

1015
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,278
And listen to the bells.

1016
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,910
It's as though they are
singing in my heart.

1017
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,033
Sixteen stones.

1018
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,394
I know of the attack
on the stage coach.

1019
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,754
It was Geronimo.

1020
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,559
We trailed him two days but
he crossed into Mexico.

1021
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,913
You did not follow?

1022
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,514
We wanted to, but we did not.

1023
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,909
Good...

1024
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,189
...we will protect all the whites
leaving Tucson and Fort Bowie.

1025
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,477
Also we will guard Apache Pass.

1026
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,712
Let the whites break the peace.

1027
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,752
It must not be Indians...

1028
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,158
...not even bad Indians.

1029
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,672
You are asleep?
No.
_

1030
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,238
I'm quiet because I'm happy.

1031
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,319
I'm afraid if I open my mouth,
my happiness will...

1032
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,950
...will rush out in a
funny noise like...

1033
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,109
...Yahoo!

1034
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,912
What does that mean?
It is an American word?

1035
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,073
I think Adam said it when he
opened his eyes and saw Eve.

1036
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,515
Who are they?

1037
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,910
Don't you know?

1038
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,993
The world is so big and
I know so little.

1039
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,399
Sometime...

1040
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,034
...will you grow tired of me
and go back to your people?

1041
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,430
That is a bad thought, Sonseeahray.

1042
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,709
Never think it again.

1043
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,558
You are my people.

1044
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,438
Will you tell me that often?

1045
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,799
Each day of our life together
I'll tell it to you.

1046
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,194
I'll always remember the
moments of these days.

1047
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,910
We will remember them together.

1048
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,549
In the quiet of the nights we
will talk of them a little.

1049
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:23,239
We will see our children ride
white horses, maybe.

1050
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,358
I can do better myself.

1051
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,718
By the time he is a grown
man, he will know how.

1052
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,149
What is it?

1053
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,995
I found this one up the
canyon. He had this.

1054
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,838
I know this boy, Cochise.

1055
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,596
Hello. You're Ben Slade's boy,
aren't you?

1056
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,436
Yeah, Captain Jeffords. I've been
praying you'd be up here.

1057
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,309
Keep calm. No one will hurt
you. Did you lose your way?

1058
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,674
Not exactly.

1059
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,555
You're the one who said these
Apaches wanted peace.

1060
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,435
It's not peaceful when they steal.

1061
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,679
What got stolen?

1062
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,277
Two young colts of mine. Beauties.

1063
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,751
Swiped night before last by Apaches.

1064
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,753
I tracked them all day...

1065
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,272
...followed their tracks
up the canyon.

1066
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,317
I ended up out there
at dark last night.

1067
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,591
Then that redskin jumped
me in the morning.

1068
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,792
None of my people took
them. The boy lies.

1069
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,915
Cochise.

1070
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,316
I know this boy's father
hates the Apaches.

1071
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,995
We have to show that he's wrong.

1072
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,953
Maybe you have men like Geronimo
who would betray you.

1073
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,470
You speak wisely.
I will see these horse signs.

1074
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,955
All right, bub. We'll mosey
down and take a look.

1075
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,069
See them yet, bub?

1076
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,639
Right around here, Captain.

1077
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,791
You call the boy 'bub'.
Is it his name?

1078
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,234
No, it's just to be friendly.

1079
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,833
Here they are, Captain.

1080
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,393
Don't shoot till my boy
gets out of the way.

1081
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,830
Cochise, they'll kill you. Run!

1082
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,909
Get Cochise!

1083
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,557
Run! Sonseeahray, run!

1084
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,439
The big one is Cochise.
Somebody give me a gun.

1085
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,431
Watch out, son, you
stay clear of this.

1086
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,799
Slade stay out of line.
We can't shoot.

1087
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,313
He's out of arrows!

1088
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,837
He got away! It's a bust!

1089
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,319
Our whole plan's a bust!

1090
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,597
I'm heading for Mexico. The military
will be after us, too.

1091
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,718
What are you standing there for?

1092
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,668
Come on.

1093
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,313
Sonseeahray.

1094
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,633
Sonsee...

1095
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,993
No!

1096
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,758
God!

1097
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,833
Are you bad hurt?

1098
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,238
She's dead, Cochise.

1099
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,877
There is one who still lives.

1100
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,477
Give me a knife and bring him to me.

1101
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,590
It will not be done.

1102
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,159
Bring him to me!
No.
_

1103
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,309
It will not be done.

1104
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,196
There are some things
a man cannot bear.

1105
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,075
Do you hear me?

1106
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,636
This peace is a lie!
They don't want peace!

1107
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,508
It is not a lie. I will not
let you make it a lie.

1108
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,912
Did you think peace would come easy?
You, who taught me so well.

1109
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,870
Is it my brother who asks
me to spit on my word?

1110
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,753
Why do you speak to me?

1111
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,599
Speak to her!

1112
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,197
When she hears, I'll hear.

1113
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,476
You will hear me now!
You'll bear this.

1114
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,271
This was not done by the military.

1115
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,239
Geronimo broke the peace no
less than these whites.

1116
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,354
As I bear the murder of my people,
so you will bear...

1117
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,078
...the murder of your wife.

1118
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,196
I am Cochise! I do not betray
my people or their children.

1119
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,388
No none on my territory
will open war again.

1120
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,715
Not even you.

1121
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,672
I have given my permission.
They wanted to see you.

1122
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,594
Tom...

1123
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,958
...we've come to pay
our respects, Tom.

1124
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,635
Thank you, Milt.

1125
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,991
We rounded up ever man
connected with the ambush.

1126
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,674
They're going to pay
the full penalty.

1127
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,668
Jeffords...

1128
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,512
...nothing can compensate you for
the terrible thing that happened.

1129
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,436
But your loss has brought our people
together in the will to peace.

1130
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,673
Without that will, treaties are
worth little or nothing.

1131
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,155
His words meant very little to
me then, but as time passed...

1132
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,278
...I came to know that the
death of Sonseeahray...

1133
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,317
...put a seal upon the peace.

1134
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,475
From that day on,
wherever I went...

1135
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,712
...in cities, among the Apaches,
in the mountains...

1136
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,197
...I always remembered...

1137
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,398
...my wife was with me.

1139
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:30,400
END
