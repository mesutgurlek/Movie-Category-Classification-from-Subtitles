1
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:23,918
Sergeant. Hey, Sergeant!

2
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:27,709
Prisoner no. 15 has got himself a gun.

3
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,793
- How long have you been with us?
- Two days, sir.

4
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:36,168
Figures.
Well, don't worry about it.

5
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,561
A piece of wood sure ain't
gonna hurt anyone.

6
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:41,376
That's all it is.

7
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,793
He's spent over a year
carving it.

8
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,793
It wasn't easy, but he
did it well.

9
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:53,751
Four years in his cell
just drawing that gun.

10
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,084
Practicing all day and night.

11
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,709
I wouldn't wanna be the man
he's after.

12
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:04,876
Tomorrow he's out.

13
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,918
- Number 15, sir.
- Bring him in.

14
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:24,168
Well, you're now a free man.

15
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,251
Isn't it a waste that anyone should spend
so many years alone in a jail cell?

16
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,959
I sincerely hope I never see
you back here again.

17
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:37,793
Oh, I'm sure as hell fed up with
this speech you guys get.

18
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,291
The more that I have to say it,
the more I'm beginning to realize I'm just...

19
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:44,451
...wasting my breath on a totally useless
cause. You always come back.

20
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:55,751
No, Bill. We can't let
you have that.

21
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,501
It's the law.

22
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,418
Bill!

23
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,318
No hard feelings.

24
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:41,409
I don't have any feelings,
except maybe hate.

25
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,626
Bill Kiowa.

26
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,943
A friend sends his regards!

27
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,876
Excellent gun!

28
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:30,459
I'll have to order
some more.

29
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,251
Welcome back, Bill.
After five years.

30
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:13,543
It's over.
Five years, but it's over.

31
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:25,459
Place is kind of dirty.
It's been years since anyone visited.

32
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:32,876
Do you still have it?

33
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:44,584
When I got out to your place,
they'd already taken you in.

34
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:49,918
It's all here,
I saved it for you.

35
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,418
I guess you're looking for Elfego.

36
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,001
I've already heard about him.

37
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:14,542
I don't suppose there's much good in
my telling you to forget about him.

38
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:20,193
Just take your money and leave the
state. Well, maybe you're right.

39
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:24,334
But you won't find it easy, that's a fact.
Things have changed.

40
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,126
I heard, Elfego's now in Nevada.
He deserted his old band...

41
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:33,934
...and joined a group of Comancheros that've
been running from Federal Troops for years.

42
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:40,043
He collected rebels, half-beats and deserters
till he had the scum of the earth all together.

43
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,143
A powerful mob.
Mighty powerful!

44
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,959
Tell you the vigilantes
tried to smash that gang and...

45
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,818
...they didn't get anywhere near him.

46
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:58,459
- And Sheriff Bannister?
- Dead, caught a bullet two years ago.

47
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,959
I'll be looking for...
Four gunmen.

48
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:11,876
- Four real gunmen.
- Well...

49
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:15,418
...there's always Morales.
Black Morales.

50
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:21,626
I don't think you understand.
I'm looking for men who know how to kill.

51
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,998
Listen, Bill, since the end of the war,
There've been some changes.

52
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,793
Most of the fellas never returned.

53
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,918
They died or went elsewhere.
With such poor land,

54
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:38,459
...who'd want to stay here?

55
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:49,909
Those who didn't die in the fight
went out west. I just don't know.

56
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:56,043
Wait a minute! How about Francis
Colt Moran? He's in Abilene.

57
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,334
And Jeff Milton. I think he's
working as a sheriff in Montana.

58
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,429
Bunny Fox, there's one you don't know.
He's young but...

59
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:08,376
...he's a good fighter.
And O'Banion.

60
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,834
Finished, sir.

61
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:55,459
Razors make me nervous.

62
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,043
Bravo, my friend!

63
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,751
- Now, where's the bath?
- Ah yes. Certainly, sir.

64
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,584
Good day sir.

65
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:08,418
I'm looking for a man with a beard.
A big man.

66
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:13,334
- I don't understand, sir.
- Don't cause trouble!

67
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,876
A big guy.

68
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:18,959
How large, sir?

69
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,418
Barbers know everything.

70
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:28,293
- I understand, sir.
- Bravo! So, where is he?

71
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:36,409
Lower your hand slowly.
Very slowly.

72
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,001
Took you long enough to see my fire.

73
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:44,334
I'm cold. That tends to
make me nervous.

74
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:49,543
So don't make any foolish moves.

75
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:58,376
I don't wanna kill you because
I'm the curious kind.

76
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,959
- Why are you following me?
- Can I move my hand?

77
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:07,251
Just a little.
Slowly.

78
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:19,334
This here is $ 5,000.

79
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,876
I've got a job for you.

80
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:28,418
There's 5,000 more when it's done.

81
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:43,459
Hungry?

82
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,234
- Where's the sheriff?
- He is upstairs.

83
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,293
Making coffee.

84
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:50,834
I don't recognize you two.
Who are you?

85
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:57,918
Yes? How can I help you?

86
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:05,501
Here are $ 5,000.

87
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:10,209
And 5,000 more when the job's done.

88
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,084
A lot of money!

89
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,459
It can mean only two things:

90
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:25,126
Either it's very dangerous
or very bad.

91
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:31,126
I've got a nice, quiet life here.

92
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:36,043
- No more gunplay.
- Dangerous, maybe...

93
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,751
...but not so bad.

94
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:50,293
So you're the man who challenged
Jeffrys in El Paso...

95
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:54,126
...and took on the Getty band
single-handed.

96
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:59,334
Let's get going, Kiowa!
You can see he ain't the one.

97
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,418
Alright!

98
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:52,958
Anyway, it'll be good
to stretch my legs.

99
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:56,084
I was getting a bit rusty.

100
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,918
You packing that thing?

101
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:22,709
This "thing" as you call it,
has kept me alive for 20 years.

102
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,334
And I hope it'll let me
know my grandchildren.

103
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,626
Be right with you.

104
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,584
Come on out here.

105
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,043
Raise your right hand.

106
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:53,293
I hereby appoint you sheriff
by the power invested in me.

107
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:28,293
I always wanted to be...
To be sheriff.

108
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:59,834
- Do you really like me, darling?
- Sure, very much.

109
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:16,209
- I'm glad you do.
- Good.

110
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:14,168
- Bunny Fox?
- Why?

111
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,959
That there is $ 5,000.
There's 5000 more when the job's done.

112
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:32,918
- Bye!
- Darling! Don't leave!

113
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:37,668
- I thought that you liked me.
- I do, and...

114
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,084
...don't you forget it.

115
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:48,134
- Wanna know what you have to do?
- $ 10,000 don't need...

116
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:52,084
...any explanation.

117
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,709
What's the trouble?

118
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:48,709
I'm looking for
Francis Colt Moran.

119
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:54,043
Gambling...
Gambling and he doesn't like to lose.

120
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,876
And when he loses, he cheats.

121
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:01,959
When he cheats,
sometimes people get wise.

122
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:05,626
Then all hell breaks loose,
and when all hell breaks loose...

123
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:08,626
Sheriff! Just what is this?

124
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:11,751
- A speech? Is that it?
- He's in there,

125
00:28:11,918 --> 00:28:14,626
...and he'll stay
there for 5 months.

126
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,543
5... 10...

127
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:27,084
15... 20...

128
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,501
$100.

129
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:39,001
The trouble is the jail.
It's not safe!

130
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:44,334
I've told the mayor 100 times now, haven't I?
They don't wanna get a new jail.

131
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:49,168
I've told them over and over again.

132
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:53,043
Whole place is falling apart,
but he won't listen.

133
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:57,459
Nothing to be done when
folks don't listen.

134
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,126
Colt Moran.

135
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,043
Want out?

136
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:18,084
Why not?

137
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,959
I sure wanna thank you fellas
for springing me loose.

138
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:08,351
Now would you just hold
still like good boys?

139
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:13,543
- Let's go after him.
- No, let him go!

140
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:16,168
I know where to find him.

141
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,501
Aces, full.

142
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,293
Deal'em!

143
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,376
20!

144
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:04,334
- 50!
- Pass!

145
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:09,084
- I double.
- I'm out of here.

146
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:14,334
- Alright.
- It's too much for me.

147
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:21,459
- I think you better get out of here, M'am.
- Why?

148
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:25,000
<i>Two cards.</i>

149
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:27,418
There is electricity
in the atmosphere.

150
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:29,126
<i>I trade three.</i>

151
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:32,793
I understand.

152
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,659
Alright now. Take it easy boys.

153
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:37,501
You'll never make it.
We're too many.

154
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:42,709
How are you gonna get out
of this one, Moran?

155
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:46,334
Funny, I was just wondering
the same thing.

156
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:04,084
You must've seen it all.
How the hell did it begin?

157
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:07,959
Damned if I know.
It was too sudden.

158
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:14,459
But I'll tell you this,
I thank god for letting an old man see it.

159
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:19,376
- Maybe you know these guys?
- Sure I do.

160
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:21,543
That one here is Jeff Milton.

161
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:26,168
Next one is Colt Moran.

162
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,459
He is Bunny Fox.

163
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:35,293
Last one is O'Banion.

164
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:40,418
Well, I think you're in the clear, men.
You were acting according to your rights.

165
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:44,668
Come on, Frank.
We better be going.

166
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,084
Well...

167
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:59,043
What can I say?
Thank you.

168
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:04,376
You're welcome.
But that's not why we came.

169
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,543
This here's $ 5,000.

170
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:14,334
I want you to come with us.

171
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:40,376
Forward, men!

172
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:46,501
Elfego can't be far now.

173
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:58,751
The rain's washed out
most of their tracks.

174
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:04,543
If you pulled off a job like this and you wanted
to hide out, which direction would you take?

175
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:10,584
Well I... I guess I'd go...
North, to the hills!

176
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:15,168
- And you?
- I'd go east.

177
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:18,918
I guess I'd cross the
border into Utah.

178
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:30,709
O'Banion, you and me will make for the Cope
River. The rest of you head for Carson City.

179
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:35,001
We'll meet up again at...
Madigan Post, in three days.

180
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,834
I don't get it. Carson City is out to
the west and the Cope River is south.

181
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:42,626
Sure.

182
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:47,543
How do you reckon Elfego's managed
never to get caught all these years?

183
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:53,293
It's not because he's stronger.
He's got it up here.

184
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,793
You'd go to the North,
and you'd go to the South.

185
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:02,709
The first place our friend's going to be
is either to the East or the West.

186
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:17,918
Hey Kiowa! Look at this.
Around 20 horses have crossed here.

187
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:21,084
No, these are the tracks.

188
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:30,417
They're the same as the ones back there.
So 20 horses rode this way too.

189
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:34,376
What makes these our Comancheros?

190
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:39,168
Those are faint, set close together.
Walking pace.

191
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:45,626
These are deep, set wide apart.

192
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:52,025
These are horses galloping.
Those others are just folks out walking.

193
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,534
These are the Comancheros!

194
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:59,126
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go after them.

195
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:02,709
There's 30 of them and two of us.

196
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,668
We'll go on to Madigan and
wait for the others.

197
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,251
Let's go!

198
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:28,501
Where is Elfego?

199
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:35,126
What is it?

200
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,459
We saw two men down by the river.

201
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:49,793
They were following our tracks.

202
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:54,209
But they didn't follow us here, though.
They just left off.

203
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:58,751
- And they rode down toward Madigan's.
- Have you seen them before?

204
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:03,043
No. One was a very tall man,
very large.

205
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:07,751
The other one, sort of dark.
Black clothes.

206
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:27,251
You three, ride to Madigan
and try to find out who they are!

207
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,334
I want a haircut and a shave.

208
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:41,168
No barbers around here.

209
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:45,709
- Well, how about a room?
- Got no rooms.

210
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:50,501
- What about something to eat, then?
- Got nothin' to eat.

211
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:55,000
I'll be damned.
Out there, the sign says...

212
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:57,626
- ...restaurant, supplies, rooms...!
- I forgot...

213
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,909
...to take down the sign!

214
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:11,501
It's all I got.
It'll cost you two dollars.

215
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,001
Whiskey!

216
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,501
Comancheros!

217
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:52,293
I reckon something in here stinks!

218
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:56,543
Yeah.
One hell of a big stink.

219
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,250
So that's true then.
I've always heard that fat men...

220
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:06,251
- ...really smell bad!
- Yeah!

221
00:48:06,834 --> 00:48:10,668
Really bad!

222
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:48,334
Listen fat pig.
You have spilled my whiskey!

223
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:54,959
Now fill it!

224
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:56,918
- Where's Elfego?
- Tell us where.

225
00:49:58,543 --> 00:50:00,751
You will not?

226
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:04,834
Have a nice trip!

227
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:55,251
Look who's here?
Bill Kiowa?

228
00:51:31,043 --> 00:51:32,384
That's enough!

229
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:42,543
That's enough.
Don't kill them.

230
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:47,959
I need those two alive.
I've got a job for them.

231
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:51,334
Get out!

232
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:03,126
Map.

233
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:18,376
Tomorrow morning at 10, that's where the
coach with the soldiers' pay is going to pass.

234
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:24,126
You and your lot will attack
from the mountains.

235
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:29,376
You cut off any retreat.
I attack from the right.

236
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:33,293
And remember:

237
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:37,501
I don't want any of these
soldiers left alive.

238
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:41,459
No one!
Is it clear?

239
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,543
You've done it wrong again, Kiowa.

240
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:39,793
You always do it wrong.

241
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:46,751
Tomorrow, we're attacking
a military escort,

242
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:51,418
...and we're going to
pick up $ 100,000,

243
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,834
...and guess who's fault
it's going to turn out to be.

244
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:02,834
It's all going to be yours
and your pal's.

245
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:08,918
Because what they're going to find near
the escort is going to be your tracks.

246
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:14,418
Then they'll catch you, and
find the money bags on you.

247
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:18,584
You go to jail, and...

248
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:22,001
...there'll be nobody around
to bear witness that...

249
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,418
...you weren't the only one who
dreamed up the robbery.

250
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:35,376
So put your mind to
something, eh, Kiowa?

251
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:40,668
Jog your memory, does it?
Does it ring a bell?

252
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:42,793
Remember?

253
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,793
Do you remember?

254
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,293
Maria!

255
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,626
It says here that Jefferson should
be here tomorrow with the money.

256
00:55:13,584 --> 00:55:15,959
I didn't know your father
was so rich.

257
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:20,209
I didn't either. Not until
I'd already heard he was dead.

258
00:55:27,084 --> 00:55:28,584
James?

259
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:35,458
- Good to see you. How are you?
- What are you doing here?

260
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:39,209
- I thought they were looking for you.
- That's right, but don't worry.

261
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:43,251
I just dropped in to say
goodbye before I left.

262
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:48,043
Looks like I arrived
just in time for coffee.

263
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:51,876
Certainly.
There's some on the stove.

264
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:20,084
Look, James.
You've got enough money.

265
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:24,959
Why don't you buy a ranch some place
and settle down before it's too late?

266
00:56:25,668 --> 00:56:29,668
No, I'm not like you.
I've got none of that...

267
00:56:29,876 --> 00:56:32,709
...pioneer spirit.

268
00:56:38,418 --> 00:56:40,751
Friends.

269
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:09,293
Well.
Not bad for an Indian.

270
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:17,834
Be careful what you say, Moreno.

271
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:29,251
Maybe you're right after all. I've
always liked the look of her myself.

272
00:57:30,043 --> 00:57:32,959
Dirty Indian squaw!

273
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:36,418
No!

274
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:40,626
No!

275
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:53,293
No!
No!

276
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:58,209
No!

277
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:04,876
No!

278
00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:20,626
I told you, he could
never make you happy.

279
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:45,751
Get it.
You don't marry Indian girls.

280
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,751
You take them, then kill them!

281
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:57,998
Kill me too!

282
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,668
Kill me too!

283
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:04,959
Don't get upset.
I need you alive.

284
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,376
I have plans for you.

285
00:59:30,876 --> 00:59:34,376
- Come with us, Kiowa.
- Sheriff Bannister!

286
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:37,209
Take him out!

287
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:55,209
When I get back, I want to find
both of them alive.

288
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,376
Understand?

289
01:00:46,668 --> 01:00:49,376
Still alive, fat pig?

290
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:57,084
What about yourself?
Hand still sore?

291
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:56,334
Hold it!
The boss said "no killing".

292
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:02,543
I won't kill him.

293
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:24,043
Comancheros!

294
01:02:54,793 --> 01:02:56,834
Looks like we got here just in time.

295
01:02:57,418 --> 01:03:00,334
- Where's the rest of 'em?
- A long way from here.

296
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:05,293
They'll be back tomorrow but,
we're not going to wait for them.

297
01:03:06,293 --> 01:03:07,584
Why not?

298
01:03:10,001 --> 01:03:12,918
There's two ways to trap game.

299
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:17,751
Either you follow it,
or you get it to follow you.

300
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:23,918
The second way's better.

301
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:26,774
That way you know...

302
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,474
...when and where you're gonna meet.

303
01:03:38,043 --> 01:03:39,918
The Comancheros...

304
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:44,084
...are Indians and half-breeds.

305
01:03:44,709 --> 01:03:46,876
And they fight like Indians.

306
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:50,709
I know the Indian ways.

307
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:54,126
I know their essence and I know
how they fight.

308
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:59,834
I used to live with them.
My wife was a Kiowa.

309
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:06,668
That's how I got my name,
Bill Kiowa. Let's go!

310
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:18,084
They've been dead for a while.
They're cold.

311
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:55,793
Go on ahead.
Find out which way they're riding.

312
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,043
This time...

313
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:07,293
...I'll kill you!

314
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:42,293
- There! They passed through here.
- Five horses.

315
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,418
They're about two hours ahead.

316
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:52,293
Get after them!

317
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:11,126
They went this way.
Another broken branch.

318
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:39,584
We'll spread out.
You can start earning your $ 10,000.

319
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:44,043
We'll meet back here at nightfall.
Good luck.

320
01:13:06,418 --> 01:13:09,168
Hold it!

321
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:11,959
We are missing three men!

322
01:13:23,168 --> 01:13:26,751
You'll die hard, bastard.

323
01:13:30,584 --> 01:13:33,251
You two, dismount
and cover that side!

324
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:39,501
You, you and you, make a wide
circle. Find them and kill them!

325
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:41,409
I want their heads!

326
01:14:37,668 --> 01:14:40,043
Comancheros!

327
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:50,918
Get back!
Retreat!

328
01:15:13,418 --> 01:15:17,459
- How did it go?
- I only got two. I'm out of shape.

329
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:35,584
It'll be dark soon.

330
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:39,251
This is just the beginning.

331
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:46,584
Elfego is now wise to our game.
Now it will be more difficult.

332
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:54,168
We are now face to face.

333
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:03,001
Good luck!

334
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:41,918
- That was far away.
- No.

335
01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:46,501
Those bastards know the tricks.
They've muffled their rifles.

336
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:52,376
It wasn't more than 50 meters.

337
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:56,251
What are the others doing?

338
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:00,668
They are massacring us.

339
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:12,293
We won't stay together.
We will separate.

340
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:06,251
- You alright?
- Yeah.

341
01:20:06,543 --> 01:20:10,709
I've paid 5 dollars for this shirt,
and wore it only two years.

342
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,376
Moreno.

343
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:21,418
I wanted to kill him myself.

344
01:20:21,709 --> 01:20:25,376
Gee, I'm terribly sorry.

345
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:39,334
We are so few now.

346
01:23:43,126 --> 01:23:44,918
We won't give up!

347
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:53,918
- The bullet didn't hit you?
- Yeah! It hit me alright.

348
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:15,501
Well.

349
01:27:16,834 --> 01:27:19,584
That's about it.

350
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:29,043
- Where is Kiowa?
- Gone after Elfego.

351
01:29:58,876 --> 01:30:01,418
Five against one!

352
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:04,043
Your job's over!

353
01:30:04,918 --> 01:30:08,126
If he kills me,
let him go.

354
01:30:09,209 --> 01:30:11,293
That how you want it?

355
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:17,709
Wrong again, Bill.
You couldn't be more wrong.

356
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:23,459
Still a hero, huh?
The generous Kiowa.

357
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:27,168
You've never been
able to shoot like me.

358
01:30:27,418 --> 01:30:30,459
You haven't got a chance.

359
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:35,543
Don't talk, shoot!
And shoot to kill!

360
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:21,043
You've forgotten that you sent
me to jail for five years, James!

361
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:25,668
What do you think I was
doing all those years?

362
01:31:26,209 --> 01:31:28,293
Day and night.

363
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,043
I was dreaming of this moment, James.

364
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:37,834
Day and night!

365
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:53,918
This is for that...
"dirty, Indian squaw"...

366
01:31:54,126 --> 01:31:55,834
...that you killed!

367
01:33:14,376 --> 01:33:15,668
Where are you going?

368
01:33:18,543 --> 01:33:20,168
South.

369
01:33:25,793 --> 01:33:28,918
That's our direction too.

370
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:36,876
THE END
