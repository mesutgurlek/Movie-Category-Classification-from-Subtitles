And Jim, Charlie Crocker
found you five years ago.

211
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,266
You were digging ditches in
San Jose for pennies a day,

212
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,770
and you make $125 a month
as construction manager

213
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,372
for the greatest enterprise
in the history of America.

214
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,877
All I'm saying is, $15 a day means
a whole lot more to those men

215
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,809
than it does to this enterprise.

216
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,152
Back in Sacramento, during the rush of '49,

217
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:57,190
every jackanape with a dollar and a dream
wanted to turn up his fortune in gold.

218
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,493
Now, the thing about gold is,
it's buried in the ground.

219

If you wanna get it out,
you gotta dig it up.

220
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,595
In order to dig it up, you need one thing.

221
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:11,732
At that time, a shovel cost $15.

222
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,070
A plot of land, $75.

223
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:18,874
I had $90 to my name, exactly $90.

224
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,679
Just enough to buy a plot
of land and a shovel.

225
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,715
Or enough to buy six shovels.

226
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:27,919
The first six sold by Huntington
Hardware Incorporated.

227

And Jim, uh, you can be a man
with a shovel in your hand

228

to the man with a shovel in his hand.

in wild and miserable country,

478
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:59,854
and have cheated me of the
money I need to succeed.

479
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,693
You've made sure that I'd fail, always.

480
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:06,298
But this time, I have the proof.

481
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:07,967
Stop, stop.

482
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:12,473
You must not do this. You must not.

483
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:18,110
To address the Lord's servant in this
way, His sainted presence on earth...

484
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:20,680
By "whom," you mean my
cruel, unjust father?

485
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,015
Please, Brother.

486
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,420
Who has ignored me my whole life?

487
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:26,754
Who has undermined my every effort?

488
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,753
Control yourself.

489
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:33,494
For your own good.

490
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:36,495
Let me have that, and go.

491
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,709
One of my brothers.

492
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:53,313
- You don't understand.
- Shh.

493
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:01,857
Have you asked yourself what...
What will be the consequence of...

494
00:40:01,891 --> 00:40:03,456
Of this letter?

495
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:11,936
- I have...
- You have said what is in your heart,

496
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:14,941
and what is true.

497
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:20,576
But truth... Truth does
not always serve us.

498
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:22,912
When it is...

499
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:27,618
When it is so naked and hot,

500
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,453
it will not allow us to...

501
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,623
To enact God's will.

502
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:45,769
You must learn this.

503
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,738
Then you must teach me, Brother.

504
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,076
You must tell me what to do.

505
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:58,846
Uh, now that we have the evidence...

506
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:02,848
But no.

507
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:08,022
No, you will see for yourself, when
anger no longer clouds your eyes.

508
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,190
No.

509
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,296
You must show me.

510
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,369
I have no one to trust but you.

511
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:26,912
All right, my son.

512
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,482
All right.

513
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:36,074
(JAMES SPEAKING CANTONESE)

514
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,893
Spoken like a native.

515
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,661
Native of Vermont. Come on!

516
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,367
All right.

517
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:46,833
All right what?

518
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,600
All right, the railroad comes first.

519
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:53,208
It's all we got. You and me.

520
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,509
Actually, boss,

521
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:58,678
I have a wife.

522
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:04,783
Five sons, a daughter, two dogs, eight
hens, a couple of cats, and a canary.

523
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:06,485
I liked you better quiet.

524
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,893
Fong ready for work.

525
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:25,230
- Get to it then.
- Mmm.

526
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,976
Mr. Bohannon, from Stanford.

527
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:44,593
All right.

528
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:48,163
I'll talk to him.

529
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:57,036
There won't be a trial.
That'd be a waste of time.

530
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:02,741
And they wouldn't be convicted, 'cause
the only witnesses is you and Tao.

531
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:07,878
And Chinamen ain't allowed to testify
against white men under California law.

532
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,986
So this is America.

533
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,853
(ABACUS BEAD CLACKING)

534
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,491
It may be the law, Mr. Bohannon,
but it is not justice.

535
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,059
No, it ain't.

536
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,667
Them men will leave Truckee,

537
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,238
and you're gonna let 'em.

538
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,076
Do we understand each another?

539
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,312
I think we understand each other very well.
