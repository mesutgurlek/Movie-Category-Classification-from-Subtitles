1
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,596
The events of this film
are based on confessions

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,974
... of Irish convict Alexander
Pearce, transported for stealing shoes

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,478
... executed in Hobart
Town in 1824 for murder.

4
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,780
Even before he hung
Pearce to murder,

5
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,616
... his story was told
all the colonies.

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,203
But in the months of
death was reported in London.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,874
What has been said and
continues on,

8
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,584
... this is the truth.

9
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,129
Alexander Pearce, an Irish convict,

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,798
... imprisoned on the Isle of Sarah,

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,093
... achieved the unthinkable,
the unforgivable,

12
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,803
... and ran away.

13
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,473
On the first occasion
made with other convicts 7.

14
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,226
In the second with a single partner.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,104
There were two escapes in the cannibalism

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,232
... and both times, Pearce
was the only survivor.

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,112
He was executed for murder in Hobart,

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,866
... on July 19, 1824.

19
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,370
But before he died confessed.

20
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,041
First his captor, the
Lieutenant John Cuthbertson.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,713
And finally my Phillip Conolly,

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,049
the priest who ...
followed until the end.

23
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,428
These are the events.

24
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:40,517
THE LAST OF ALEXANDER PEARCE CONFECIÓN

25
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,191
Hobart Town, Earth
Van Diemen 1824.

26
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,067
Judge Knopwood room.

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,486
They can not read, you know?

28
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:57,534
I think the pass
midnight is required here.

29
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,912
It is one of the rare
beauties of this island.

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,333
Clear.

31
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,423
You are becoming
in old Mr. Conolly.

32
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,635
Lately it is a parade
which goes to the barracks.

33
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,637
Yeah.

34
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,726
Is business, one of the servants
Her Majesty a cannibal.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,270
Wild Europe.

36
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,314
Hung.

37
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,067
I was told that Alexander
Pearce asked to see it.

38
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,444
Hear his confession.

39
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,905
Now if.

40
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,409
Remember that your evil
form and the correct ideas,

41
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,162
... return to the
lord and this will have mercy.

42
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,124
Verse 557.

43
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,462
Let me know how to react Pearce
the verses of the Bible.

44
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,172
Please?

45
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,845
How do you think Conolly
Take a thing like this?

46
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,430
He and Pearce come from
Catholic won it.

47
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,432
Want to hang it.

48
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,478
It is normal that we are all
attracted to blood.

49
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,607
The two sons of hunger and misery.

50
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,277
¿Hunger and misery?

51
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,446
You see a lot of opportunity, I tell you that

52
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,408
... there is two different things
where the wheat wine,

53
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,743
... Pearce and Connolly.

54
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,039
My name Conolly.

55
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,918
The Judge said
which called for a priest.

56
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,506
¿Alexander Pearce is his name, no?

57
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,135
Pearce was hung,
repent and confessed.

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,058
As desired.

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,751
So ...?

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,588
Have you come to see the devil?

61
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,138
The theft, by and before anything else.

62
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,935
I am here so you can
Mr Pearce confess.

63
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,107
I know, me hung.

64
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,035
We deceive and the truth is not ...

65
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,081
Back permission, born Monahu,

66
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,959
... only 6 miles
where I was born.

67
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,588
Child beggars by fighting
in life from the beginning.

68
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,758
Several thefts took him to Australia.

69
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,720
In doing so many times, was
sent to Sarah Island.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,680
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

71
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,600
Governor Sorell
is not good sir.

72
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,149
I repent.

73
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,492
I suggest you turn your back on this,

74
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,536
... unless you hurt.

75
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,213
Welcome to Sarah Island.

76
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,217
Have been sent here
for the remainder of his sentence.

77
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,553
No errors in it.

78
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,016
If you die trying to escape.

79
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,938
Beyond this post
terrain is wild,

80
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:39,983
... where no man survived.

81
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,779
Those who tried
been bitten by hunger,

82
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,075
... and have fallen into the
hands of the savage.

83
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,704
Will be eliminated,

84
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:56,083
... until the last.

85
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,211
While they are here to work.

86
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,297
If they work hard, not
will have problems.

87
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,094
Better not want to anger him.

88
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,806
Walking.

89
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,499
On the island of all Sarah
were willing to betray.

90
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,171
They spoke of redemption,

91
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,467
... but all that
knew was suffering.

92
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,934
If trying to kill, or
died or caused a fight.

93
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,730
This is how it is, that was what happened.

94
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,171
We can go.

95
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,048
His boat is full of oil.

96
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,008
They can come with me.

97
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,136
- How long you plan this?
- One time.

98
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,972
- In fact chest.
- We need 6 for the boat.

99
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,098
- I'm going.
- Me too.

100
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,319
- It's time to go.
- We must hurry.

101
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,655
- Quick before sunset.
- Quick.

102
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,370
Christ.

103
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,789
- Who is the musket?
- The guard of the island.

104
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,874
Be here in an hour.

105
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,377
Do not run away at that.
- Let go.

106
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,672
Quick, quick.

107
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,263
We are going to Jericho, we have friends there.

108
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,349
¿Jericho, why not swim to China?

109
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,769
Damn, we can sail
As on earth.

110
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,604
Accomplished nothing.

111
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,280
I had been told to take a boat.

112
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,494
The Travers and fought all night.

113
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,331
What were the provisions?

114
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,795
- None.
- Nothing?

115
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,591
When the time comes
just had a panic.

116
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,968
Take a pan but it was bad.

117
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,140
I had the idea that we could
find food there.

118
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,227
There were no animals, nothing to eat.

119
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,317
It is a desert land,
and we got there.

120
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,279
Greenhill, the browser.

121
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,031
Travers, the butcher.

122
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,074
The French and Everbright Kennerly.

123
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,368
Dalton.

124
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,787
Bodenham.

125
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,874
I joined all south

126
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,001
... only had for 4 days.

127
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,012
Traveled per day, and
acampábamos at night.

128
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,307
First some valleys
surrounded by trees.

129
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,976
And trees.

130
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,104
We stayed hidden
so that we see.

131
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,192
Grenhil, guided
the sun and stars.

132
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,903
He said he traveled to the east.

133
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,949
Every day we expected
to reach Jericho.

134
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,285
And on the fourth day we
ran out of supplies.

135
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,706
On the eighth day, we arrived
to a great mountain.

136
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,710
We think finding
something to hunt or eat.

137
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,631
Across the road we saw no
animals or wild.

138
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,301
The place was empty.

139
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,223
We were dead of starvation.

140
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,477
All we had
was eating leather.

141
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,147
So I boiled some pieces.

142
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,249
The pain of hunger was fierce.

143
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,879
Edward Brown was
wrong, it was always slow,

144
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
... but in the morning
he could barely walk.

145
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,091
Keep the pace.

146
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,801
Can not.

147
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,804
Jesus, are very hungry.

148
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,931
We delayed.

149
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,726
Okay, I know.

150
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,609
It was all green.

151
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,991
Why did not return,

152
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,910
... took 9 days, and
knew they had no sense?

153
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,371
Travers and Greenhil wanted
walking at night.

154
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,917
Where are they now?

155
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,969
The next morning, 4
We went to the front.

156
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,059
- Come late.
- Yes, but there is another.

157
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,026
I went south with a friend.

158
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,782
The told me about a trip to Africa,
walked for weeks without food.

159
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,330
The girls were 6 and others.

160
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,249
What happened?

161
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,168
Ate to
others live.

162
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,170
That is murder.

163
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,425
Is better than all die.

164
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,511
But it is still murder.

165
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,348
- That's it.
- Do I want to stain my conscience?

166
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,187
They did the easy part.

167
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,106
What does ...

168
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,942
To kill the other by slow.

169
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,279
No, I propose to Dalton.

170
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,744
He offered to come
when none wanted.

171
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,459
I suggest that we kill for meat.

172
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,630
One dies so that others may live.

173
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,098
It was true, we dragged Dalton,

174
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,936
... and once Greenhill said that.

175
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:15,105
The idea we are all full.

176
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,900
We wanted to eat.

177
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,027
That is horrible Pearce.

178
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,654
We're both Irish.

179
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,865
Born hungry.

180
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,578
Famous Irish famine.

181
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,748
Throughout the country with crops lost,

182
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,084
... Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

183
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,755
But hunger has not
been reason to kill

184
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,173
... and eating a man.

185
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,257
I do not idee.

186
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,592
No matter what I thought ...

187
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,387
It is a mortal sin, I will not lie.

188
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,932
O Hell awaits you.

189
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,350
I do not ...

190
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,602
... I would not go as murderer.

191
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,527
What have you done?

192
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,630
Greenhill made all
take part in it.

193
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,718
He did so no one left out.

194
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,554
After that Kennerly
and Brown did,

195
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,097
... but did not know his plan.

196
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,350
It was a tough spot.

197
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,395
For the rest of the way these

198
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:22,191
... took the parts of Dalton.

199
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,528
Step when no one miles were gone.

200
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,909
Greenhill call
but did not respond.

201
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,079
We went south, they needed to return,

202
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,333
... perhaps feared that hung.

203
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,171
Greenhill said he did not
be followed,

204
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,048
... never.

205
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,011
But listen they did.

206
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,431
Arrived at the station
the island of Sarah,

207
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,601
... but died after 3 days

208
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,729
... due to the trip.

209
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,191
What they said about us?

210
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:11,573
Nothing, could not speak.

211
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,283
They returned quite well.

212
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,371
But they took their sides.

213
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,249
They took part of his demise.

214
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,253
Ate the same as us.

215
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,839
Jailer.

216
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,226
Can you read Mr Pearce?

217
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,236
We have eternity, you'll see tomorrow.

218
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,975
The circumstances
including crime,

219
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,729
... is considered a heinous crime.

220
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,523
Is associated with the prisoner cannibals,

221
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,652
... as the same legends
vampire of Greece.

222
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,698
We confess that this
when our eyes,

223
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,409
... were filled with fear of the
that was in front the judge,

224
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,914
... and believed to have
sated by human flesh ...

225
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,750
This is bad for the neighborhood.

226
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,669
I hope you will repent
before being hanged.

227
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,880
Your salvation depends on it.

228
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,550
It was very sour on the court.

229
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,346
Not serve well if you follow this very badly.

230
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,973
Looks like a monster.

231
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,769
Mr. Pearce continued.

232
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,232
Then continue down 4
days for a very bad spot.

233
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:12,027
But we reached a large river,
stopped for a day or two,

234
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,697
... looking for a place to cross.

235
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,536
It would be better if you could swim.

236
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,247
Everything would be easier.

237
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,877
If you surrender Bodenham,
lose for us?

238
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,632
By God.

239
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,240
It's normal.

240
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,555
We were sick.

241
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,893
We stayed two nights there because of that.

242
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,189
After that we started walking.

243
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:36,904
We clean the river, in our
way it was all hell.

244
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,075
We believe a village or see
something from the mountain.

245
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,912
Was difficult.

246
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,915
We spent all day climbing.

247
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:52,628
At the top we could see
was the vast land for miles.

248
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,798
It was sad but not
was more to follow.

249
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,429
Walked the entire day.

250
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,183
Hunger and cold we invaded.

251
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,728
Give me that.

252
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,537
If I kill you right here
lost the lighter.

253
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,457
Jesus.

254
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,673
Here, see?

255
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,843
Do not miss.

256
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,988
Continue walking for another
3 or 4 days, I do not remember.

257
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,075
I remember sitting at
principle of a valley,

258
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,911
... Mather approached me.

259
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,998
Come on, move.

260
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,459
Get up.

261
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,114
Here there is nothing.

262
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,991
Keep looking.

263
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,767
You sent me.

264
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,727
What?

265
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,731
- Not here.
- Do not die, not here.

266
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,858
- I do not want to die here.
- Do not die.

267
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,447
But when we return
Bodenham be dead.

268
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,910
- See?
- Jesus.

269
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,038
Better him than us.

270
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,371
The heart and the liver was
everything we use that night.

271
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,167
Now we had many provisions.

272
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:50,365
Subtitles by Kosh Inc.

273
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,749
After a day, divided
the body and continue walking.

274
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,168
We walked for 3 days ...

275
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,841
When we cross the first crossing
west we could see for miles.

276
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,179
On the other side had a
River where there were trees.

277
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:18,519
We stopped there at night and
continue down the river for 3 days.

278
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:23,273
We saw many animals, kangaroos, emus ...

279
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:28,320
We said we would die before
to kill one of us.

280
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,406
Were in love now.

281
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,787
We could not catch them, they were very fast.

282
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,959
And almost just supplies.

283
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,302
Vayámonos alone.

284
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,851
You know what you are capable
the bastard of Greenhill.

285
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,939
Kill his mother
before you get hungry.

286
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,195
So?

287
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,240
What?

288
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,745
Tomorrow?

289
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,125
I was hungry again.

290
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,420
And the love of brothers no longer existed.

291
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,342
We ate the last of Bodenham,

292
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,263
... was not enough to satiate.

293
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,808
Mather did not accompany us,

294
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,395
... idea was to boil some roots.

295
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,085
Alto, said that does not kill more.

296
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,378
Tell him.

297
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,507
Keep away from the ax.

298
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,218
Damn.

299
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:24,144
It was getting worse, cruelty.

300
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:30,692
It was obvious to Mather
that their time was counted.

301
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,785
And he clung to his life
Although we knew the lost.

302
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,211
Let his soul rest in peace.

303
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:15,881
If.

304
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,100
We stayed there for
few days and continue.

305
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,272
Each took a
Mather of them.

306
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,903
I was the next era
just a matter of time.

307
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,501
God!

308
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:10,006
I just slipped, I'm fine.

309
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,008
Are you sure?

310
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,267
We stayed there for a few days while
Traver's foot was wrong.

311
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,521
I thought it would die,
Greenhill but embraced it.

312
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:29,194
An improved time.

313
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:33,073
Travers was not yet well
but when it was enough ...

314
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,534
well enough to walk, we continue.

315
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,997
That was a week after
Mather's murder.

316
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,838
After crossing the slope,
reached a large river.

317
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,428
Travers could not swim so during
vagamos three days by the shore ...

318
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,847
looking for a place to cross.

319
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,690
Then the walk began Travers
to become black.

320
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:08,154
It hurt, so I loaded it Greenhill.

321
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:27,592
I'm just slowing down,
Bob, let me here.

322
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,555
- I'm just a burden.
- You will get well, you'll fine.

323
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,393
Things went well for two days.

324
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,063
Continue without me, he said.

325
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,026
So you can die in peace, he said.

326
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,073
It would be good for him and for us,
damn unhappy.

327
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,997
Greenhill decided to stop at a
clearly illuminated by the moon.

328
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,666
And Travers was worse.

329
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,253
Smelled of death.

330
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,015
Kill me, kill me at once.

331
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,688
You continue.

332
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,850
Just let me die, please.

333
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:16,006
As I was sacrificed to a
man for the good of the majority.

334
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:17,674
Tell them to repent,
But what is the point?

335
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:20,135
Hunger is a real attack
against brotherly love.

336
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,221
- It's a fickle feeling.
- Well, it seems to me that ...

337
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,807
a full stomach is a prerequisite
for good manners.

338
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,314
Without that, no man knows
that may require you to make hunger.

339
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,027
You must repent, Alexander Pearce.

340
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:38,363
Without that there will be no forgiveness.

341
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,454
We ate at Travers and others.

342
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,084
When continued our way, we get
everything we could carry.

343
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:55,049
But Travers was wrong.

344
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,927
There was nothing on the other side of the mountain.

345
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:25,708
Why the hell are we as
toys for a living?

346
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,588
You hear me?

347
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,468
Why I had to pass
Travors to that in the leg?

348
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,309
The devil.

349
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,861
Greenhill became a threat.

350
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:54,324
I started to watch after that.

351
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:59,663
I tried to encourage thinking that soon
come to the inhabited part of the country.

352
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:03,251
We walked a long way.

353
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:09,132
Helped me more than usual and always
carried the ax to the back while walking.

354
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:12,428
She was put under the head when
is sleeping.

355
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,473
Survive on the remains of Travers.

356
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,395
When finished, walk
with empty stomachs.

357
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,484
After four days,
hunger again ...

358
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,487
worse than before.

359
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:32,742
Clearly, one of the two die.

360
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,894
Greenhill tried to catch
unprepared and kill me.

361
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:01,232
Since then neither
could hardly sleep.

362
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:27,113
After killing Greenhill
wandered over three days.

363
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:34,079
Then I took my rope and tried to hang himself.

364
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,801
Could not, the Lord
I was watching from the other side.

365
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:52,474
Nothing should have been.
Should have been on the island ...

366
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:54,394
all we should be.

367
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:59,065
But it was not.

368
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:10,078
I found a camp of natives.

369
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:33,020
Have considered a blessing
I nailed a spear into his back.

370
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:35,774
But they were not approached.

371
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:39,694
They lurk hidden.

372
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:42,489
Never again see another.

373
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:54,669
From there the road
became more hospitals.

374
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:58,882
I walked a few more days by a swamp.

375
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:00,927
There were ducks.

376
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:04,847
I could not get to be thrown
to fly, but some small.

377
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,435
From the top of the hill vi
a great mountain.

378
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:11,063
Follow the river towards her.

379
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:16,736
A few days later I met
a flock of sheep.

380
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:19,489
Sheep.

381
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:27,206
This is how it came from the bay
until Jerry Town.

382
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:29,375
A journey that no man
had done before.

383
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,752
It took almost three months.

384
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:33,380
- Impressive.
- Really?

385
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:37,092
Reached the settlement in
very poor condition.

386
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:40,303
I was so famished that people
thought it was a ghost.

387
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:43,891
He recovered with their help and
path between pastoralists continued ...

388
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,769
huts and caves, as inhospitable.

389
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:50,357
When crossed with other convicts
it recognized ...

390
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:53,235
said that the Government
he had forgiven.

391
00:42:55,863 --> 00:43:00,952
Over time, when recovered force
joined two other former prisoners, ...

392
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:04,038
Davis and Sheffield.

393
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:07,668
They walked from the west
for a couple of months ...

394
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,754
making mischief and stealing.

395
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,758
The three were captured
after a shooting.

396
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,803
Davis was shot in the leg.

397
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,930
Courts.

398
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:22,851
Knopwood attended the event, decided mandar
Pearce again at the Sarah Island.

399
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:25,897
Why is he there again?

400
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:27,440
Ask directly.

401
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,157
I did not believe it, I thought that was
covering the other convicts.

402
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:40,288
He confessed all the crimes,
murder, cannibalism.

403
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,124
I thought I was trying
take the hair ...

404
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,586
for others, and Greenhill
others continue to run.

405
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:52,676
Who would believe that a
type so little ...

406
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:55,596
would cross the island, much less
that was the only survivor ...

407
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,516
such a ridiculous question?

408
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:00,769
It's a thief.

409
00:44:01,061 --> 00:44:03,480
It is a phoney, an Irish
recalcitrant, ...

410
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,025
as indomitable as any.

411
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,985
But even so, the citizen king.

412
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:10,905
But I could not believe
it was a savage.

413
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:17,621
Anyway, even if
Indeed, there is no body.

414
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:23,503
And for a death penalty for murder
the court requires the corpus delicti, ...

415
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,464
not only the word of a
known liar.

416
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:29,300
How are you responding?

417
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:34,473
- I am not your judge.
- No, but I do what I was.

418
00:44:34,682 --> 00:44:37,101
And Pedder, and received a fair trial.

419
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,104
What happened when he was sentenced
to return there?

420
00:44:39,438 --> 00:44:41,398
When he was sent to Sarah Island, ...

421
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:44,443
I dare say that I
did not agree.

422
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:48,281
Its reputation precedes it
and the rest of the prison population ...

423
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:51,951
what looked like a hero instead
than as a depraved criminal.

424
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:56,790
Auction was crazy.

425
00:44:57,332 --> 00:45:01,295
He spent most of the time
tied to a pole on the island Grommit.

426
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,800
Pearce was very crazy.

427
00:45:06,134 --> 00:45:09,763
I think what prompted Cox
to escape the second time.

428
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:11,891
¿Cox was the man he killed?

429
00:45:12,224 --> 00:45:14,018
Thomas Cox.

430
00:45:14,268 --> 00:45:18,731
Cox Pearce killed and eight days
flight, when they still had supplies.

431
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,942
Did not show any remorse
when he taught us ...

432
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,652
where were the remains of Cox.

433
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:24,696
The corpus delicti.

434
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,783
- And here we are.
- Here we are.

435
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,703
Fellow or not, man
is a monster.

436
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:34,457
Opened to this young man in half
and we ate.

437
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:38,545
And if all that still had
bread and cheese in their pockets.

438
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:43,592
Then changed the belief that
was a hero when Pearce took ...

439
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:46,721
back to camp with
The remains of Cox.

440
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:51,142
Cox was sacrificed because
it was more sensible for him.

441
00:45:52,685 --> 00:45:54,021
I have an invitation.

442
00:45:55,898 --> 00:45:57,358
Sorell ...

443
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:00,736
kindly asked to
honored him with their presence ...

444
00:46:00,986 --> 00:46:02,656
for dinner tonight.

445
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:04,783
That's new, Philip.

446
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:15,253
It was the same story I had
Pearce counted.

447
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:21,009
Submerged in itself, Pearce was
sent back to Sarah Island.

448
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,727
Marked as a liar and a hero,
his return was a cruel twist.

449
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:37,486
Once he had escaped and now
was the "choice" of Sarah Island.

450
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:42,158
As such, it became
in lesson.

451
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:47,205
The punishment was accumulated on the punishment.

452
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:54,255
I wonder what would cause minimal
left to chance.

453
00:46:56,591 --> 00:47:00,637
Determined to escape their torment,
Thomas Cox invited the young ...

454
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:03,056
Pearce to flee to him.

455
00:47:03,515 --> 00:47:07,728
Pearce escaped a second time,
moved north along the coast.

456
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:14,736
Outside of himself, Pearce killed Cox
when he discovered that they could not swim.

457
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,826
With food still in your pocket,
Pearce butchered the boy.

458
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:29,169
He signals to the first boat that passed
and confessed his crime for the second time.

459
00:47:30,128 --> 00:47:32,255
This time successfully.

460
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:37,929
The corpus delicti.

461
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:52,821
Residence of the Governor Sorell

462
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,448
Pearce's story, in brief:

463
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,992
He escaped twice from Sarah Island.

464
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:00,621
On both occasions he ate
their peers.

465
00:48:01,163 --> 00:48:03,958
The reports of the newsletter have
had a record audience.

466
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,460
Tomorrow it will hang for murder.

467
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:09,881
I was among those who tried.

468
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:14,010
The chief judge has ruled that Pedder
Pearce's body will be stuffed ...

469
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,264
after they die.

470
00:48:17,014 --> 00:48:19,100
What irony, I guess ...

471
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,726
that disequen a cannibal.

472
00:48:20,768 --> 00:48:22,562
For the good of society
and science.

473
00:48:22,728 --> 00:48:26,108
And a lot to preserve
this savagery.

474
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,611
He is Catholic, is not it, Mr. Connolly?

475
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:32,490
Yes, this is Governor Sorell.

476
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:35,368
Already acquitted of their sins?

477
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:38,079
No, it's a sad case and
I have no problems ...

478
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:39,706
the lovely table by Mrs. Brown.

479
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,794
- I heard his confession.
- The prisoner gave details ...

480
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:46,172
I have stopped cold.

481
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,676
It is an uncomfortable topic, inappropriate
to discuss at the table.

482
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,387
So we have to eat
soon to discuss it in the room.

483
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,181
No, no, no.

484
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,391
And why is confesarlo
with a priest?

485
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,312
Not to die in sin.

486
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,231
Swift described an island that
people kept eating.

487
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,650
I believe that dominated
by the British.

488
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,403
What savageness.

489
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,697
It makes no sense,
Is not it, Mr. Connolly?

490
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,951
I think what he meant is that
to deny the Irish people ...

491
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:15,914
rights in their own country ...
- Sure, it's a satire.

492
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,544
Only one would dream of Irish ...

493
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:23,631
eating another man, ...

494
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,341
even a savage.

495
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:29,887
Ireland has suffered a lot.

496
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:36,561
As I understand, Mr. Conolly,
you will address the convicted.

497
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:38,815
Yes, it is.

498
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,026
How can you give peace of mind
a monster like him?

499
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:48,659
The ignominious results ...

500
00:49:48,992 --> 00:49:52,663
disobedience of the law
and humanity ...

501
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,373
can not be ignored.

502
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:58,336
The blood must atone for blood,
society demands it.

503
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,340
Pearce crimes have been
checked and systematic.

504
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,345
You can not be lenient with him and
really need to get revenge ...

505
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:08,931
with his death.

506
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:14,729
But this man witnessed shocking
pain and suffering.

507
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:21,154
The man that I am prepared
to the gallows, came here ...

508
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,910
already inclined to commit
criminal acts, but here ...

509
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:30,289
Van Diemens Land ...

510
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:34,042
shared suffering with some
the most despicable human beings in the universe.

511
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:40,508
A perverse generation addicted
adultery, blasphemy, ...

512
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,305
malice, laziness,
deception and drunk ...

513
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:50,519
extremely recalcitrant
reprehensible.

514
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:54,941
Sent him to Sarah Island,
place for secondary punishment.

515
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:00,906
If the whip could be amended to
a man, Pearce should be ...

516
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:05,203
because he was very competent
more lashes on the back ...

517
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:10,959
as any other man and
Even so, he ran away.

518
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,923
He witnessed the murder and killed
himself, escaped and killed again y. ..

519
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:18,217
have eaten human flesh,
is a beast.

520
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,932
The beatings became so crazy.

521
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:30,397
And die here alone in this
strange island where the boys ...

522
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:33,526
do not learn anything other than pain,
anger, blood and death.

523
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:38,281
Should a complete human being
in a place so corrupt?

524
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:42,160
But yes, I will ...

525
00:51:43,078 --> 00:51:44,831
peace of mind ...

526
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:47,458
while waiting for death,
according to the will of His Majesty.

527
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,919
I do so for fear, Ms. Brown.

528
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:53,882
- I fear, Mr. Connolly?
- For fear ...

529
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:57,261
to what we could all become.

530
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:04,352
Here, at the end of the world.

531
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:15,656
So I propose a toast.

532
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,411
For ...

533
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:20,871
progress.

534
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:22,497
For progress.

535
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:34,803
Alexander Pearce, this is the last
day that you spend on earth.

536
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:39,141
When dawn comes, it will
among the dead.

537
00:52:40,476 --> 00:52:43,229
Your soul will be saved or be lost ...

538
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,774
Christian in Paradise
or infinite torment.

539
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:51,530
Has been found guilty of murder
and there is no doubt that whoever ...

540
00:52:51,697 --> 00:52:56,327
to spill human blood by
human hand will have their blood ...

541
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:00,040
because God made man
his image and likeness.

542
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:04,503
I ask solemnly, Alexander,
to pray for his soul and ask ...

543
00:53:04,669 --> 00:53:09,300
salvation in his final hours as
so he asked the thief and found ...

544
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:12,428
which tied to die
crucified beside our Lord, ...

545
00:53:12,637 --> 00:53:14,889
can also ask and
find you.

546
00:53:16,016 --> 00:53:19,728
Condemned to die on Earth
but acceptable in the eyes of the Lord.

547
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:24,526
No other way has been opened
for life insurance before you.

548
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:29,572
This is your only salvation
is not time to delay or hesitation.

549
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:41,878
Gallows, Hobart Town, July 19, 1824

550
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,926
Huge crowd.

551
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:52,181
Hopefully not
way.

552
00:53:59,398 --> 00:54:00,816
¡Cuélguenlo!

553
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,292
Die!

554
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:23,258
"It killed hundreds of souls in their wake ...

555
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:27,095
"And decided
publicly their fault ...

556
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:29,306
I think we will be here forever.

557
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:32,810
Conolly is not what one says
synthetic example.

558
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,107
Look who is there.

559
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,778
That damn tracatán Philip.

560
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:48,369
I think we all know that this man
escaped last year from Sarah Island.

561
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,918
Come on over!

562
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,675
¡Ahórquenlo!

563
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:25,160
Go to Hell, Alexander Pearce!

564
00:55:37,716 --> 00:55:40,594
This the body of Christ,
who gave his life for you.

565
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:37,700
Well ...

566
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:39,702
and ended up with that.

567
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:49,254
Even before he hung
to Pearce for the crime of murder, ...

568
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:51,381
The story spread all
colonies, ...

569
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,802
and months after it was hung,
made headlines in London.

570
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:59,057
A few were imported, if there was
some, this was just a man ...

571
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,936
possibly evil, but more
likely a belligerent thief ...

572
00:57:02,144 --> 00:57:04,480
entangled in a skein of
extreme circumstances.

573
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:10,529
The world is always more
easily from a distance ...

574
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:13,698
and stories of monsters and
things like that.

575
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:18,079
So remember to Alexander,
not as a man.

576
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:23,793
But they have said little truths
as big as this:

577
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:28,966
A full stomach is a prerequisite
for good manners.

578
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:36,057
Without that, no man knows
that may require you to make hunger.
