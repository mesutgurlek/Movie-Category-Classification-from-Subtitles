1
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,302
Watch out. That gang's around here.

2
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:50,380
With what we've got
in the cart, 200,000 dollars,

3
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:53,038
we'd better keep our eyes open.

4
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:56,990
- Here, this will warm you up.
- Great. We can use it.

5
00:00:57,168 --> 00:01:01,452
- I'm going back. You stay on guard.
- Don't worry.

6
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,049
- He goes to his warm house while we...
- Shut up.

7
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,760
- I wish it was tomorrow already.
- Let's have a drink.

8
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:20,377
- Did you hear anything?
- Yeah, you gurgling down that bottle.

9
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:41,556
I heard it. Let's go take a look.

10
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,783
Jack? Pat?

11
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,004
No!

12
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,578
John? John!

13
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:41,202
That's all. Let's go.

14
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,575
Well, let's get going.

15
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:49,426
Yah! Yah!

16
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:56,954
15 years, ain't nobody seen you laugh.

17
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,654
I understand.
Ain't no laughing matter to be in jail.

18
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,060
But you can laugh today
because today is a big day for you.

19
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:11,387
But you go out of here with that face,
you're gonna be right back again.

20
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,507
Come in.

21
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,288
Come in, Ryan.

22
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:10,427
It doesn't seem
so many years have gone by.

23
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,840
At least, not for you.

24
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:19,831
It seems only yesterday
that we met for the first time.

25
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,234
Here's the 83 dollars
you had in your pocket 15 years ago.

26
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,486
Yeah. I hope it helps you get started again.

27
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,671
My gun.

28
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,773
Thank you.

29
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:12,345
- Now the bullets.
- The bullets?

30
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,880
27.

31
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:19,122
15 years ago, you put 'em
in one of those bottom drawers.

32
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,934
27.

33
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,506
You have a good memory.

34
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,586
Well, sometimes it's not difficult.

35
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,796
I still had 6 in my gun and 21 in my belt.

36
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:55,782
If they hadn't double-crossed me,
the count would be a little bit different.

37
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,835
Here. Beautiful horse, isn't he?
Take it from me, he's worth the 60 dollars.

38
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,434
Hey! Come back here! Hey!

39
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,467
What can I do for you?

40
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:09,153
I haven't been around here in quite a while.
Everything's changed.

41
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,897
Your parents?

42
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,226
That was my entire family.

43
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,764
I'm sorry.

44
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,763
I heard about it some time ago.

45
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:34,370
Ah. Hi, Bill.

46
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,189
I'm glad you're in town.
I wanted to speak with you.

47
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:47,469
I've just been talking to the judge.
How would you like to be deputy sheriff?

48
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:52,510
The job doesn't pay much,
but I'm gonna retire before long

49
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,834
and you'll move up a step.

50
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:00,418
It's time you settled down. I've noticed
something between you and Betsy.

51
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:06,235
I've got other things on my mind, Sheriff,
for the time being.

52
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:09,653
Bill, no one knows you better than me.

53
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:13,976
I was a good friend
of your mother and father.

54
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:19,722
I know what's on your mind,
but don't you think it's time to forget it?

55
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,410
Thanks anyway, Sheriff.

56
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,526
Over here.

57
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,377
<i>What's going on?
Who's doing that shooting? Open up!</i>

58
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,063
Come on in.

59
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:03,061
- What's going on? Night target practice?
- Oh!

60
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:18,661
Somebody tries to shoot me in the back,
I defend myself.

61
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,994
You defend yourself almost too well, mister.

62
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,072
They're both dead as doornails.

63
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,808
They came in the window.
It wasn't to wish me pleasant dreams.

64
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,847
OK, OK, self-defence, I guess.

65
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:36,766
But in this town we don't like violence.

66
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:41,051
I'm asking you to get out of town
as quickly as possible.

67
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:53,034
Good morning, Bill.
How many glasses have you got?

68
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,278
- A couple.
- Can we dirty them?

69
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:59,523
I want to have a little talk with you.

70
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:26,561
What brings you all the way out here?

71
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:34,214
What's on your mind?

72
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:44,782
This.

73
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:51,775
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That my memory is pretty good.

74
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:57,558
I've thought all night about whether
what I'm about to do is the right thing.

75
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:02,099
But I've known you
for too many years to keep quiet.

76
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,616
Where'd you find them?

77
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:22,768
On a dead man's feet.

78
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,560
Who?

79
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:30,300
Last night, two men were killed.
Those were on one of them.

80
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:34,712
- Who killed them?
- A stranger.

81
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:40,661
A certain Ryan. He went west.

82
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:55,600
<i>All right, stand up. Don't turn around.</i>

83
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:08,949
Keep your hand away from your gun.

84
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:22,098
If you're gonna follow somebody,
do a better job of it.

85
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:26,014
This world is full of nervous characters.

86
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:30,419
They shoot you in the back first
and then introduce themselves.

87
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:33,255
Tell me what you're after.

88
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,865
15 years, there's been no new track.

89
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:45,815
Only a spur.

90
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:51,685
Then you come along
and there's three spurs.

91
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:57,426
If you know the story, then you can
figure out what I'm looking for.

92
00:28:57,595 --> 00:29:01,453
We've both got an account
to settle with the same people.

93
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:06,613
- Only I want to take first crack at them.
- We can go on together.

94
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:12,363
No, son, you got too much hate in you.
That's gonna get you in trouble.

95
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:15,442
Hate's hate. There's no two ways.

96
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:23,176
Somebody once wrote that revenge
is a dish that has to be eaten cold.

97
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:29,081
Hot as you are,
you're liable to end up with indigestion.

98
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:31,292
No, I'm going on alone.

99
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:37,119
- You better shoot me.
- Do I have to?

100
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:41,938
If you don't, I'm gonna end up
on your heels again.

101
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,776
Yeah, I suppose so.

102
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:48,019
Important thing is to get there first.

103
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:57,050
That's why I'm gonna leave your horse
at Red Rock, ten miles from here.

104
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:02,199
An advantage you're gonna
have to give me. Good luck, son.

105
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:15,137
You might need that.

106
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,932
Whiskey and water.

107
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,071
Where do I find Cavanaugh?

108
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:33,317
Another drink?

109
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:40,437
I'm looking for Burt Cavanaugh.

110
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,678
Look, friend...

111
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:46,296
...I'm selling whiskey.

112
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,530
Thanks for the information.

113
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:09,515
Hold it. What do you want up here?

114
00:32:32,823 --> 00:32:34,858
Ryan.

115
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:44,431
Well, this certainly is a surprise.

116
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:48,833
Was it a good surprise or a bad surprise?

117
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,868
Why? Did you think
I wasn't happy to see you?

118
00:32:57,121 --> 00:33:01,239
How much did you give those two
to get rid of me?

119
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't understand.

120
00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:09,263
It doesn't make much difference. Whatever
you paid, it was a bad investment.

121
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:32,267
I should kill you.

122
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:43,594
Or maybe I have learned something
after all these years.

123
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:47,039
As an example, even a rat like you

124
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:50,078
can be worth more alive than dead.

125
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:56,736
I know it was not a nice trick
walking out on you at the trial, but...

126
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,943
No, no, no.

127
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:04,557
You didn't walk out on me, you sold me.
You turned me in. There's a big difference.

128
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:08,008
It was a long time ago.
Why don't we drop it?

129
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:12,337
Here. Here's 100 dollars.

130
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:18,121
I know it's not much,
but business hasn't been good lately.

131
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:21,453
- 100 dollars?
- Yes.

132
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:24,700
100 dollars for 15 years in jail?

133
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:29,734
Maybe I was right in the beginning.

134
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:37,801
- Maybe a rat like you is better dead.
- All right, don't get excited, Ryan.

135
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:40,009
- What do you want?
- 15,000.

136
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,463
- What?
- 1,000 for every year in jail. Cash.

137
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:49,198
Where am I going to get my hands
on that kind of money?

138
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:52,318
Oh, you'll find it.

139
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:01,470
I'm sure you'll find it.

140
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:06,512
I'm not in a hurry.
Tomorrow morning will be all right.

141
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:14,494
It warms my heart
to see all my old friends doing so well.

142
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:18,741
You're all pretty well established,
aren't you?

143
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:21,825
I'm gonna visit our friend in Lyndon City.

144
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:25,401
See what the first citizen
has to say for himself.

145
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,938
Till tomorrow. Oh...

146
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:34,171
Watch out for these things.
Wouldn't want you to get hurt.

147
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,673
Not yet.

148
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:04,217
- Bad luck at the table, friend?
- Not bad luck, mister.

149
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:10,663
It was robbery.
They took everything I had.

150
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,502
You look like you need a drink.

151
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:16,863
You don't understand.
That was just a warning.

152
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:20,612
They got all my money,
but I wanna keep my skin.

153
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:23,646
Sure you do. Who said anything different?

154
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,897
- I can't go back in there.
- Come on.

155
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,426
No. I don't want to. No, no, no.

156
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,548
I don't wanna get killed.

157
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:42,368
Listen, they'll kill me. Do you hear?

158
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:53,730
Two whiskeys.

159
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,223
- How much did you lose?
- 30 dollars.

160
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:08,378
What are you doing? Are you joking?

161
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,568
Drink.

162
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:23,638
Thanks.

163
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:32,793
Well, take the dough. And beat it.

164
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,703
I never leave without finishing my drink.

165
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,405
That should take care of it.

166
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:20,767
Stranger, I'm putting you under arrest,
charged with attempted homicide.

167
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:24,266
Means you can be put in prison
for ten years.

168
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,595
- When can we try this man, Judge?
- Tomorrow.

169
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,917
Take him to jail.

170
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:33,123
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

171
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,700
<i>Hold it!</i>

172
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:47,352
If I'm worth anything as a witness,
I'd say this is a case of self-defence.

173
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,591
More than anything I've seen in my life.

174
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:04,582
Based on the personality of the witness,
the charge is withdrawn. Cards.

175
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:11,110
You were lucky. Get out of here now.
I want to talk with our friend here.

176
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:15,485
Young man, you're a faster draw
than all those stupid idiots.

177
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:22,304
If you're looking for a job, I may
be able to help. Come up to my office.

178
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:35,821
Hands behind your head, son.

179
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:48,260
Now let that hammer down. Slow.

180
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,821
At ease.

181
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:06,442
You still got a lot to learn, son.

182
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:11,559
This time you got something to learn, too.

183
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:14,392
Oh?

184
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:17,346
What?

185
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:21,798
Cavanaugh's paying me 500 dollars
to kill you.

186
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:28,539
- Another bad investment.
- You think so?

187
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:33,525
- Maybe I didn't take him seriously.
- If you didn't, you'd have been right.

188
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:38,518
But tell me, why does he want you killed?
And who is Cavanaugh?

189
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,311
You ask too many questions.

190
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:46,591
I can pay for the information with his 500.

191
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:51,296
He's worth more than that to me. 15,000.

192
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:55,744
So I suggest you keep your distance.

193
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,781
'Cause if you don't,

194
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:01,655
I might get mad.

195
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,818
That's a warning.

196
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:22,542
I'll find out who he is.
And if he's who I think he is...

197
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,619
...get ready to get mad.

198
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:41,721
Hey! Hey, wait a second.

199
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:45,633
Wait. I wanna thank you. Yes, sir.

200
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:50,917
I ain't worth much and it's been a real spell
since anybody's done anything for me.

201
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:55,621
But if you asked me to walk on fire,
I'd just started walking.

202
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,784
I might ask you a lot less.

203
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,395
Like what you know about Burt Cavanaugh.

204
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:08,054
- How long's he lived here?
- When I got here, he was already boss.

205
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:12,549
But if you want to know more about him,
I know the right man.

206
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,469
Get a good, strong bottle of rum,

207
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:19,754
'cause the more this man drinks,
the more he talks.

208
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,566
<i>All the sheep are gone,
and the pastor lies sleeping alone.</i>

209
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:32,101
The bottle. The bottle!

210
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,639
Better drunk than dead. Here's to you.

211
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:41,181
Bottoms up.
Now tell me about Burt Cavanaugh.

212
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:46,041
<i>That's my drunken wife. Shh!</i>

213
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:50,075
If there's any alcohol a mile away,
she smells it.

214
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,784
<i>The bottle. Where's the bottle?</i>

215
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:56,034
- There isn't any bottle.
- Where is the bottle?

216
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:59,113
I know you've got some.

217
00:43:59,281 --> 00:44:03,104
- There it is.
- But it isn't ours. It's his.

218
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:08,601
My good man, forgive the impression you're
getting of us. It's just that she's my wife.

219
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,045
She's a bit... The poor woman's a drunk.

220
00:44:12,637 --> 00:44:16,459
Uh... Before you finish that off,
tell me about Cavanaugh.

221
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:22,204
Cavanaugh. I'll tell you.
He's a scorpion, he's a snake, a beast!

222
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,153
All right, let me tell it.

223
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:29,149
When I arrived here,
the church was in good order.

224
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:31,392
I was an upright preacher then.

225
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,396
- But what about him?
- What about who?

226
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:37,048
- Cavanaugh.
- Oh, Cavanaugh.

227
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:40,717
All he had was
a pistol and a pack of cards.

228
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,957
You know, now he's called... Four Aces.

229
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,566
- Full house. Queens.
- Not enough. Full house, aces.

230
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:01,856
<i>Poor man. The ladies love you
but not Lady Luck.</i>

231
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:10,501
- Give me another chance.
- What security have you got?

232
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:14,251
You know I've lost it all.
You've taken everything.

233
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:18,705
My farm, my cattle, everything.
You know that.

234
00:45:18,874 --> 00:45:22,281
Then get out of here. You're using space.

235
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,688
Only 500 dollars.

236
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:30,433
Just give me a chance, that's all I ask.
Just 500 dollars.

237
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,749
- Who wants to come in the game?
- I do.

238
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,729
My employees don't play.

239
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:05,510
Deal the cards.

240
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,260
How many?

241
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,473
I stand.

242
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:05,708
I'm happy to take your 500.

243
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:10,747
Four aces.

244
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,407
Me, too. Four aces.

245
00:47:18,907 --> 00:47:23,357
Look, young man,
I'm afraid I don't feel like joking.

246
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:25,808
Neither do I.

247
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:44,032
Remember, Cavanaugh,
15 years ago at the Mesita ranch?

248
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:49,351
You and your friends killed everybody.
But you forgot one thing:

249
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:52,014
To kill me.

250
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:04,709
Give him a gun.

251
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:09,621
Get up!

252
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:19,348
Piano player, hit three notes.

253
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:34,416
Two lessons, my son.

254
00:49:34,584 --> 00:49:38,702
First, watch behind you.
Second, count your shots.

255
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,947
Four bullets for one man, that's a waste.

256
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,518
<i>I'll go and drive away his horse.</i>

257
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,746
Hey!

258
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,135
Damn.

259
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:33,203
Hey!

260
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:39,487
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, sir. What is it?

261
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:43,810
- What time's the train for Lyndon City?
- It left 15 minutes ago.

262
00:50:43,983 --> 00:50:47,225
- What time's the next one?
- The day after tomorrow.

263
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:50,673
Keep calm.
Your pal left your horse with me.

264
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:54,458
- He took the train, huh?
- Sure. But that's not all.

265
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,711
He said a pal of his would be coming along.

266
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,577
He said I should give you the horse
and a kiss. The horse is there.

267
00:51:02,748 --> 00:51:05,860
Now, where do you want that kiss?

268
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,815
No, thanks. I'll settle for the horse.

269
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:14,018
I am proud indeed to be here today,
and I consider it a great honour

270
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:18,923
to introduce to you
our leading banker, Mr Walcott.

271
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,307
There is more.
Senator Carlyle has kindly agreed

272
00:52:12,479 --> 00:52:17,627
to have the Atchison-Santa Fe line
pass through our growing little town!

273
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:26,412
Which augurs a fine,
prosperous, up-and-coming future...

274
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:34,317
While I'd be delighted
to continue to address you,

275
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,690
I must go because duty calls me.

276
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:40,434
Hooray for Senator Carlyle!
Hooray for Lyndon City!

277
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:04,483
One is here and
the other will be here very soon.

278
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:07,730
That's the one who killed Cavanaugh.

279
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:13,047
Go and get Pedro and Paco and the others.

280
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,754
Just say that I decided
the party is for nine. Hello.

281
00:53:18,924 --> 00:53:22,001
Nothing else. The boys'll get it.

282
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:27,115
Walcott, a stranger's asking for you.

283
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:30,361
Show him in, then.

284
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,215
Easy, friend.

285
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:45,417
You're all alike.

286
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:52,821
Years go by and you all do the same things.

287
00:53:53,748 --> 00:53:57,819
Gun in the drawer, knife in the back. Lies.

288
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:02,981
You were afraid that I wouldn't receive you?

289
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,346
Quite the contrary.

290
00:54:06,522 --> 00:54:09,847
I expected you to receive me too well.

291
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:13,377
So I figured it's safer
to come in from behind.

292
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,705
Walcott, that stranger's gone.

293
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:23,286
I'm already here, friend.
So you can go on out.

294
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:27,692
Close the door behind you.
This is a private talk.

295
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,900
The door!

296
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:38,261
Well... looks like we've become important.

297
00:54:42,428 --> 00:54:44,711
And rich.

298
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:48,657
You've changed your old clothes,
haven't you?

299
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:52,526
But you still haven't been able
to change your face.

300
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:57,154
You still got the meanest-looking face
I ever did see.

301
00:54:57,323 --> 00:55:00,435
- Now listen, Ryan...
- Shut up.

302
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:05,639
And I can tell you where I've been
all these years, because of you.

303
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,840
I've seen some mean faces. Plenty of them.

304
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:14,088
Things aren't the same as they used to be.

305
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:17,167
Because I can pay now.

306
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:20,447
Just sit down. We'll talk about it.

307
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:27,359
There isn't that much talking to do.

308
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:29,563
Just five words.

309
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:33,768
Fifteen thousand plus fifteen thousand.

310
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:36,922
15,000 bucks doubled?

311
00:55:38,096 --> 00:55:42,877
A lot of money, Ryan.
It's a pretty high figure.

312
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:48,195
But not for 15 years in jail.
And you'll have to pay Cavanaugh's share.

313
00:55:48,373 --> 00:55:54,148
He was killed right under my nose and
I didn't get a chance to collect the money.

314
00:55:56,403 --> 00:56:02,427
I'll give you an advance now.
How about... 10,000 bucks?

315
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:06,546
All right.

316
00:56:08,552 --> 00:56:10,587
The rest tomorrow.

317
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,538
Now it's my turn.

318
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:05,913
All right?

319
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:09,247
Hold it.

320
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,653
Don't kill him yet.

321
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:15,906
He's useful to us for the time being.

322
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:27,217
We could finish you off now.
But that would be too simple.

323
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:29,426
Let me tell you this, boys.

324
00:58:29,597 --> 00:58:32,839
<i>Ryan was sent to us by heaven.</i>

325
00:58:33,008 --> 00:58:38,451
Good old Ryan is going to be helpful to us
like in the good old days.

326
00:58:41,038 --> 00:58:43,073
Wait.

327
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:02,374
I've been working at this for years,
building their confidence in me,

328
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:06,205
the citizens as well as
the governor of this state.

329
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:12,565
But the most important thing is I have
in my bank more than a million dollars now.

330
00:59:14,073 --> 00:59:19,517
The funds the state deposited with me
in view of our future public works.

331
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:23,639
What do you think?

332
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:28,211
Should I build
their stupid old public works

333
00:59:28,386 --> 00:59:31,049
with this mountain of dollars?

334
00:59:33,795 --> 00:59:35,912
They don't think I should.

335
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:39,325
I guess I'll have to go along with their idea.

336
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:03,789
Whoa.

337
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:14,478
You make sure you don't lose him.

338
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,026
- Mr Walcott.
- Yes. Good evening, Frank.

339
01:00:39,713 --> 01:00:44,778
- Some extra work?
- Open that door while I close this one.

340
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:20,400
<i>- Who's there?
- Me. Mr Walcott.</i>

341
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,585
Good evening, Mr Walcott.

342
01:01:39,805 --> 01:01:43,077
- My God, look at that.
- A million dollars.
