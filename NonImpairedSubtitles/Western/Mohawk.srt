1
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:26,786
Auntie.

2
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,497
- My, aren't they handsome!
- Aunt Agatha!

3
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:38,941
At my age a lady no longer
has to hide...

4
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,804
her admiration for handsome men.

5
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:43,707
- What are they?
- Iroquois.

6
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:46,210
- Are they friendly?
- I don't call them poisonous snakes...

7
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:49,013
They're my friend on account
that they don't bite me.

8
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,607
Jonathan said they are so peaceful.

9
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:54,420
Oh, he is an artist.
He prefers not to see things.

10
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:57,490
Snakes is snakes.

11
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,800
Do they mean to make trouble?

12
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:08,803
They never tell what they mean, ma'am.

13
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,206
Especially them Tuscaroras from the south.

14
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,509
They are the ones to look out for.

15
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,312
I thought you said they were Iroquois?

16
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,214
They are all Iroquois, miss.

17
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,367
The French give them names
to the Mohawks, Oneidas...

18
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:24,223
Tuscaroras, Cayugas and the Senecas
when they joined up together.

19
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,525
This is all Mohawk country.

20
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,293
The ones with the shaved heads
is Mohawks...

21
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,198
The long hairs are Tuscaroras.

22
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,230
They are first grade fighters
them Mohawks.

23
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:36,884
There ain't nobody, not even the French or
the British have ever beat them in a battle.

24
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,408
How soon do we reach Fort Auldin?

25
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:43,212
About midday,
if we don't have no trouble.

26
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,727
There is the Fort.

27
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,597
How do I look, Aunt Agatha?

28
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:03,804
Like a lady going to tea.

29
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,807
Uncle, you don't approve.

30
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,709
When a woman puts on her war paint...

31
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,712
she's more dangerous than any Mohawk.

32
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,815
Except that we like our scalps
with something under them.

33
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:53,732
Sergeant.

34
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,567
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,869
Have them drive that wagon
back to the arsenal.

36
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,809
Keep a guard posted until
it is unloaded.

37
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:04,811
Yes, sir.

38
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:13,071
- Something precious?
- Muskets and gunpowder.

39
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,825
But there is something really precious.

40
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,055
She appears already
be well guarded.

41
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,138
The chaperone may need relieve.

42
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,110
Excuse me.

43
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,702
May I present myself, ma'am?

44
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:35,715
I'm Captain Langley.
commander at Fort Auldin.

45
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,516
How do you do?

46
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,658
My niece, Cynthia Stanhope.

47
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,521
I'm Agatha Stanhope.

48
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:43,524
We've come to visit mister
Jonathan Adams, the painter.

49
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,327
- Do you know him?
- Yes, ma'am.

50
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:47,329
Where does he live?

51
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:53,837
You don't need that frosty look.
My niece is his fiancee.

52
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,140
Is he expecting you?

53
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:59,143
- No, I wanted to surprise him.
- You will.

54
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,146
Do you know where I might find him?

55
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,114
Uh, just a moment.

56
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:08,521
Clem. Clem Jones.
Come over here, please.

57
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,624
Yes, Captain?

58
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,686
Clem, these ladies look for
Jonathan Adams.

59
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:15,529
So are all the other ladies.

60
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:20,835
Clem, Miss. Cynthia Stanhope
is Jonathan's fiancee.

61
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:25,741
No, this is not so funny.

62
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,473
He knows about this?

63
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,017
My good man we did not come here to
discuss our personal affairs with you.

64
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,816
We simply want to know where
Mr. Jonathan Adams lives...

65
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:36,821
And where he is at this moment.
And that is all. Thank you.

66
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,824
- You're very welcome.
- Captain Langley?

67
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,628
- Clem, where is Adams?
- Out there, some place.

68
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,832
With all those frightening Indians?

69
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,524
There is nothing to
be afraid of, ma'am.

70
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,557
The Indians are about
our friends right now.

71
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,840
I will certainly consider your
lacks in your responsibilities...

72
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,843
if you allowed him to go out there
without an adequate escort.

73
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,035
Oh, he's not alone.

74
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,248
He took a cow along and
my daughter Greta.

75
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,550
Jonathan...
I'm hurting all over.

76
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:23,444
Oh, I'm sorry, Greta.
Rest a while.

77
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,455
- I'm very beautiful.
- And the cow?

78
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,624
It is a cow.

79
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,827
Why are you laughing?

80
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,830
I always laugh when someone else laughs.

81
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,732
It is my disposition.

82
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,436
And if someone should cry?

83
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,841
A woman enjoys to cry almost
as much as she does to laugh.

84
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,686
That feels wonderful.

85
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,689
I know. I do it for
my father all the time.

86
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,166
You know how to do everything
to make a man happy.

87
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,568
That too is my disposation.

88
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:21,178
- When a man kisses you?
- I kiss him.

89
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:48,356
- You have a lot of disposations, Greta.
- I am happy with them.

90
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:51,480
You know I should marry
a girl like you.

91
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,382
You're so very sweet to say that.

92
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,772
You should not marry me.

93
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,086
I am too stupid for you.

94
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,638
May the Lord protect me
from a brainy women.

95
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:00,391
Not as if she's as brainy as you.

96
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,195
10 years from now I will be fat
like my father.

97
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:07,165
I'll marry a farmer. Stupid like me.

98
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:10,250
We'll have many children and we'll
be always together until we die.

99
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,973
I'm beginning to think you're the
smartest woman I've ever known.

100
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,406
I feel happy to be smart.

101
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,335
Who will lead me to the chief Kowanen?

102
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,762
Rabbits do not talk, men do.

103
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,734
And the crow screams from
the highest branch...

104
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,604
because it is afraid to
touch its feet to the ground.

105
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,391
Now will you answer me?

106
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,294
I will answer when you tell me
why you must see him.

107
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,701
Since when does the Great Kowanen...

108
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,704
permit boys to decide who will
and who will not see him?

109
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,710
- Your tongue is too long.
- You will not shorten it.

110
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:38,712
I'm in your village as a friend.
Your laws protect me.

111
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,383
I am Keoga, son of Kowanen.

112
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,186
I will carry your message.

113
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,089
Then tell your father that
I've come to give him warning.

114
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:47,891
Of what?

115
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:51,094
More settlers and more muskets.

116
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,707
White Man Butler says
he brings you warning...

117
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,710
of new settlers and more muskets.

118
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,697
Greetings, Kowanen.

119
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:24,701
My son says you bring a warning.

120
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,703
Numbers tell more than words.

121
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:31,710
Today 61 settlers and a wagon load
of muskets arrived at Fort Auldin.

122
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,712
Why is this a warning?

123
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:37,717
Whose land will the settlers
turn into plowed fields?

124
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,719
There is plenty of land.

125
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,588
Against whom will the
muskets be used?

126
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:46,394
It is wise to be strong for this
keeps your enemies peaceful.

127
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,397
It is talked that
many more soldiers will come.

128
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:51,700
The eagle is not afraid of the mole.

129
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,703
Those were my father's words.

130
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:56,706
And he is dead.

131
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,710
And we, the once proud Tuscaroras...

132
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,713
are driven from our land by whites...

133
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,896
And come like beggars to
our friends the Mohawks...

134
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,888
For a handful of corn...

135
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:10,724
And a piece of earth on which
to spread our blankets.

136
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,591
He was advised not to make war.

137
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,594
There was no peace without surrender.

138
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,701
They came one by one until they
swarmed like ants all over us.

139
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,706
And left us nothing but
a choice of how to die.

140
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,708
What is happening here...

141
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,710
...is I saw it happen there.

142
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:31,616
The Great Spirit brought the
Iroquois to the Tree of Peace...

143
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:35,621
And taught us to listen to
the eagle that sees far.

144
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:38,623
And the wise men told us we must...

145
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,629
bind ourselves together by holding
each other hands so strongly...

146
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,597
nothing could break them apart.

147
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,701
White men can not destroy us
unless we forget...

148
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:51,607
The Great Laws and so
destroy ourselves first.

149
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:54,460
I will make no war on the white man.

150
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,117
Why do you want us to
fight your own people?

151
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,119
They are not my people!

152
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:13,552
Once there was no greater
warrior then your father.

153
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:16,702
- He is getting old.
- His spirit is gone.

154
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,705
I do not understand him.

155
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,710
Let us take the muskets so they
will not be used against us.

156
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:23,711
Onida.

157
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:30,910
Will you help us get those muskets?

158
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:32,723
But if you are caught,
there will be killing.

159
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,125
A Mohawk is not afraid
to die for his land.

160
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,927
Nor a Tuscarora.

161
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,911
Make us a fire and change
this peaceful words...

162
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,734
Until it's too late to die.

163
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,737
The muskets will make us stronger.

164
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,706
You heard what our father said.

165
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:50,510
I take our father's advice when
I take the muskets.

166
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,312
With my own ears I heard him say...

167
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:55,316
"It is wise to be strong for
this keeps your enemies peaceful."

168
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,708
Please, Mr. Jones.

169
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,712
The fattest woman of the Fort
will buy this.

170
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,714
She will never try to wear it.

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,518
But it will make her happy to
pretend that it is her size.

172
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:39,736
- When do they close the gates?
- At sunset.

173
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,738
The sun is setting now.

174
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,742
Can anyone get into the Fort...

175
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,744
after the gates are closed?

176
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,604
The gates do not open again
until sunrise.

177
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,416
Aren't you worried about your daughter?

178
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,629
They always get back just
as the gates are closing...

179
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:56,221
Always...?

180
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:14,745
It's sunset.
All the Indians outside the wall.

181
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,715
I left my blanket back there.
I do not want to lose it.

182
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,718
Go get it, and hurry up.

183
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:33,735
Close the gates.

184
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:40,743
Wagon coming, sir.

185
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,722
Open the gates.

186
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,738
My cow.
Thank you.

187
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:05,739
Welcome.

188
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,743
I'm gettingtired of keeping
the gates open for you.

189
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:12,548
Now, don't be too hard on her, Captain.
She does everything to have her portrait.

190
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:17,454
Close the gates.

191
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:25,130
Cynthia.

192
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:28,534
Here.

193
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:37,045
Cynthia, I wonder on what cloud
did you fly here on?

194
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,147
I gave her a ride on my broom.

195
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,549
Dear Aunt Agatha,
as frightening as ever.

196
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,742
Dear Jonathan,
as flattering as usual...

197
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,554
even in the wilderness.

198
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:49,759
Oh, that is Greta.
She models for me.

199
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:51,927
But you were commissioned by
the Massachusetts Associate...

200
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,731
to do 20 landscapes.

201
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:56,734
And I have not a single painting
without at least...

202
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,737
- one tree in the background.
- Show them to me, Jonathan.

203
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,740
Oh, naturally, naturally. But first you
must get here settled, and talk about...

204
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,444
you, Boston, family and friends.
The paintings can wait.

205
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,246
I'd like to see them now.

206
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,450
If you insist.
Are you coming, Aunt Agatha?

207
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,353
I am not interested in your paintings.

208
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,056
Only in your character.

209
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,958
But you know me better through my work.

210
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,961
I'll will know you with more
pleasure when you're engaging a...

211
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,393
more profitable work instead of...

212
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,432
Painting is my work.
If you made this long journey...

213
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:22,834
to say the same things
you've been saying...

214
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,517
Please, Jonathan. I do so badly
want to see your pictures.

215
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,940
We won't be gone long.

216
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,943
All these miles, days and days
in a wagon and you...

217
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:35,747
can't even say
"how do you do" before...

218
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,350
Where are we going anyway?

219
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,533
- To see your pictures.
- Oh, they're over there.

220
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,160
Greta, take care of
the wagon, please.

221
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,241
So, you are his model?

222
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:01,997
Yes, he works very hard, ma'am.
And very good too.

223
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:04,549
Look. I'll show you.

224
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,366
- Is that all you?
- I'm very beautiful.

225
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,689
Yes, all together too obviously.

226
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,753
Very interesting.

227
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,756
Really, Jonathan.
How can you live in this dungeon?

228
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,759
Not at all. I just sleep here.

229
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,761
I keep my belongings here.

230
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,764
Otherwise I'd get outdoors
as long as there is light.

231
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,766
You would have been home
two months ago.

232
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,768
One loses track of time out here.

233
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,773
There are the four seasons,
Easter, Christmas, and...

234
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,776
The days don't seem to count
as calendar days.

235
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:27,749
Come home with me now
before the winter sets in.

236
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:29,752
And get involved with politics? No.

237
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,754
I'm a painter, not a politician.

238
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,757
All I wanna do is paint.

239
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,759
You act like
an irresponsible child.

240
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,762
You need someone to take care of you.

241
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,264
You made this long hard journey
to tell me this because...

242
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,076
Because I love you.

243
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:56,350
- What am I to do about you, Cynthia?
- Marry me.

244
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,754
- Oh, you've already decided?
- Yes.

245
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,756
We have a lovely home in Boston.

246
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,763
And you'll do wonderful portraits
of important people.

247
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:03,752
And you'll do wonderful portraits
of important people.

248
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,552
Shades of Aunt Agatha.

249
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:08,366
- That's not very kind.
- Forgive me.

250
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:10,768
I'm hungry.

251
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,772
How can you think of
food at a time like this?

252
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:18,778
Cynthia, can you think of
anything more accelerating?

253
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,781
- I just can't understand you.
- And you mustn't.

254
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,785
You see, you risk
propriety if you do.

255
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,757
And where would a gentle woman
be without her precious propriety?

256
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,759
In any event, a man with full
stomach is much easier to handle.

257
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:46,737
- That's from a gentle woman
and propriety... - Cynthia.

258
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:45,417
Good appetite.

259
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,621
The belle of Fort Auldin.

260
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:52,625
- She should be rung every hour as a warning
to all decent young people. - Madam...

261
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:57,912
Miss, sir. Because my wit
made me laugh...

262
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:00,635
every time a man proposed.

263
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,606
In due time, the joke was on me.

264
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,611
Oh, there you are, Cynthia.

265
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,614
- This is Mr. Butler.
- How do you do?

266
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,617
You have already met Captain Langley.

267
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,620
I presume you two gentlemen
know each other.

268
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,423
You can hardly avoid
knowing each other...

269
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,429
in a community as small as this.

270
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:23,194
Have you done anything worth
looking at, Cynthia?

271
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,637
There're some very interesting things.

272
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:29,641
Mr. Adams has not thought
to show us any of his work.

273
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,644
I didn't think you were
interested, Mr. Butler.

274
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:34,613
Anything that happens in the
Mohawk valley is of interest to me.

275
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,616
Have you been here very long?

276
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:38,618
I was born here, Miss. Stanhope.

277
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:41,621
My family was the only white family
in this area.

278
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:44,625
Then settlers began coming in.

279
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:48,631
I used to think of this entire
valley as my personal property.

280
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,632
Well, weren't the Indians
here before you?

281
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,816
The Indians are savages and have
no more rights than animals.

282
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:55,738
The Spaniards knew
what they were doing...

283
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:57,641
when they made slaves of them.

284
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:59,643
No one will ever make
a slave of an Iroquoi.

285
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:02,647
Then they should be slaughtered
or they'll slaughter us.

286
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:04,615
No one will listen to me.

287
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:08,622
They will plow their fields and dig
their graves at the same time.

288
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:11,624
Settlers will come,
then the preachers...

289
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,630
...soldiers and even painters.

290
00:24:15,835 --> 00:24:19,635
Squeeze the great valley
into a small frame.

291
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,638
And that's the end of
freedom to breathe.

292
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:25,042
Idiots.

293
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:30,307
What a frightening man!

294
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,651
I never can decide
which he hates more.

295
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,519
The Indians or the settlers?

296
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,622
I'm not sure he's quite sane.

297
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:39,624
He is wrong about the Indians,
I know that.

298
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,628
If we leave them alone,
they leave us alone.

299
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:18,643
Why don't you go out?
Do something!

300
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,646
They'll get along
fine without me.

301
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:27,654
Hold your fire.

302
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:31,659
Stop shooting at shadows before
you slaughter each other.

303
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,664
They're most likely gone by now.

304
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:39,535
Form a detail and search the
Fort from one end to the other.

305
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:42,489
- How did they get in here?
- A fine bunch of soldiers!

306
00:26:42,844 --> 00:26:45,642
I'll find out how they got in here.

307
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,654
Well, come on, sit down.
Finish your supper.

308
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,657
Eat? At a time like this?

309
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:59,660
Maybe you'd rather go to
your room and go to sleep.

310
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:02,664
Who could sleep with all this
commotion going on?

311
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:05,067
By the time you're ready
for bed, it all will be over.

312
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,870
I'm a rather tired, Aunt Agatha.

313
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,138
Somebody better make certain
there are no Indians...

314
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:11,142
in our room ready to scalp us.

315
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:12,143
Come along.

316
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,566
Any Indians in here?

317
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:34,881
You, fool.

318
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:40,242
You've got a long journey.
Sleep late tomorrow morning.

319
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:42,245
- What will you be doing?
- Working.

320
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,647
With that girl?

321
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:47,551
With that girl and the cow too.
The picture isn't finished yet.

322
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:49,553
Sleep, my dear.

323
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:54,358
Good night, Aunt Agatha.

324
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:08,677
A long face doesn't stand a chance
against ammunition in the right place.

325
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,576
Beautiful.

326
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,658
- Let me go.
- No.

327
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:51,661
Then kill me.

328
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,663
I like beautiful things.
I like them alive.

329
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,666
I'd rather paint you.

330
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:59,551
Magnificent.

331
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:02,674
Your eyes are like lightning.

332
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,476
I know it is in that painters
fellow's room.

333
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:05,378
All right. Let's go.

334
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:10,684
Hide over there, hurry up.

335
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:25,669
There she is.

336
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:28,672
I built this tunnel 10 years ago...

337
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:33,026
So we can get the Indians from behind.
If they were attacking us.

338
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:35,980
Someone must have opened
it from inside.

339
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:38,784
You've been entertaining
any Indians lately?

340
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,687
No more than usual.

341
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,689
Fetch a can of gunpowder.

342
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:45,659
Everything has been peaceful so long,
I plumb forgot about that tunnel.

343
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:48,663
What kind of Indians got in
tonight, Captain?

344
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:49,565
I don't know.

345
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,667
Mean, just plain mean.

346
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:53,469
They kill for the love of killing.

347
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:56,273
They should be skinned alive
every one of them.

348
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:59,076
That dirty, mean, ignorant Indians.

349
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,179
While letting you have take
their land from them?

350
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,681
Whose side you're on?

351
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,484
Nobody's. I'm a painter.

352
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:07,666
You sound like an Indian-lover,
Mister painter.

353
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,689
I have no reason to hate them.

354
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,841
You seem to think of tonight:
Maybe it was our fault.

355
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:15,662
If you don't like how we do
around here, you can get off.

356
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:18,665
Messing around with pictures ain't
certainly gonna help this valley.

357
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,668
Put it in the tunnel.

358
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:05,690
Sorry.

359
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:08,693
We'll double the guards
and keep on searching.

360
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,684
- You're all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

361
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,837
I guess you have to stay here
until tomorrow morning.

362
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,690
And then I'll smuggle you out
in my wagon.

363
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:34,492
Why?

364
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:36,694
Maybe because I have no idea.

365
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,696
You're not like the others.

366
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:41,700
People have been telling me
that since I was 6...

367
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:44,703
- The trouble is they don't like me.
- That's too bad.

368
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,373
Don't be so timid.

369
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:49,476
I only want to see
the other side of your face.

370
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,083
Magnificent.
You must let me paint you.

371
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,316
I'm a bit sorry but
it's the best I have to offer.

372
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:07,697
Good night.

373
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:03,698
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

374
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:07,703
Jonathan is gonna fetch the cow.

375
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:10,707
I wonder why he bothers
to paint the cow when...

376
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,710
he has already you in the picture.

377
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,516
The cow is expected by
the Massachusetts Associate.

378
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:19,284
I am surprised.

379
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,858
Is it true that men in England
carry hot water jugs...

380
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:50,516
when they go courting a lady?

381
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,896
Good morning, Greta.
Good morning, Cynthia.

382
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,529
Good morning, Jonathan.

383
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,531
Ah, perfect light today.
I don't want to lose it.

384
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,534
- I'd like to come along, Jonathan.
- After last night?

385
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,238
I wouldn't think of it. There's no telling
what those Mohawks might be up to today.

386
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:09,241
You shouldn't go either.

387
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,544
I carry a beautiful amulet.
It will protect me.

388
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:15,098
Oh, I didn't mean you, Greta.
You can't go along either.

389
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,750
I'm only painting the cow today.

390
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,552
See you at sundown.

391
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:24,345
- Who will get your lunch?
- I will milk the cow.

392
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:34,609
Open the gates.

393
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,243
Anyone leaving the Fort today
does so at his own risk.

394
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:42,447
All right. Open the gates.

395
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:45,551
Open the gates.

396
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,552
You can come out now.

397
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,113
- They're angry with you.
- They'll get over it.

398
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:19,829
Which is in love with you?

399
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:20,459
Neither one.

400
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,729
- And yet they kiss you?
- It amuses them.

401
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:27,635
An Indian woman does not kiss,
not even for amusement.

402
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:29,538
Come up here next to me.

403
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:40,451
Onida, I'm gonna kiss you.

404
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:51,234
And just why are you laughing?

405
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,835
You look so long-faced and
your mouth became little.

406
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,508
You're supposed to close your eyes
when you are kissed.

407
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,141
Do I close my eyes to watch the sunset?

408
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:02,143
What does that have to do with it?

409
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,147
The sunset is as beautiful as
the spring flowers...

410
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:07,469
Or silvery trail that leaves
the light on the water.

411
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:10,153
The eyes open to welcome beauty.

412
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,839
They close only to
shut out ugliness.

413
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,663
So kissing must be ugly.

414
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,266
The way you put it,
it sounds logical.

415
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,169
Only it isn't.

416
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:26,142
- Are you married, Onida?
- No, not yet.

417
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:27,485
Why not?
I'm sure there are many...

418
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,448
There are many and there
are none, but I'm afraid.

419
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,451
Afraid of what?

420
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:36,254
The white man.
What he will do to us.

421
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:40,559
I heard you talk to that man
in your room.

422
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,561
There was no hate in your words.

423
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,564
Your heart was good.

424
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,706
Come to our village.
Learn about us.

425
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,619
So that you may tell
your people that...

426
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,571
you were shown that
we can live in peace.

427
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,573
And let me paint what I see?

428
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:03,553
- Get in the back.
- I will not, I...

429
00:37:07,764 --> 00:37:09,081
Why are you with the white man?

430
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:12,564
Because you, my half grown brother,
and the brave Tuscarora warrior...

431
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,568
- left me behind.
- We had no chance.

432
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:18,571
You will have plenty of chance
to explain to our father.

433
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:21,575
You may come back to
your place, white man.

434
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:24,479
The fire is out and even the
smoke crawls on the ground...

435
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:26,347
like a frightened dog.

436
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:27,960
Come out.

437
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:48,574
Must they always talk so much?

438
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,716
They're wasting their breath
if they talk about me.

439
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:52,578
I'm no Mohawk.

440
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:56,550
You are an Iroquoi and my father
is chief of all the Iroquois.

441
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:02,706
When a young fire burns so thirstily,
that it's plain it reach for a tree...

442
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:05,552
It must be put out before
it burns down the park.

443
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,365
Not put out, but made to 
burn where it should.

444
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,169
They broke the peace when
I told them not to.

445
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:13,192
Bowhawah, the Tuscarora
led them to it.

446
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:16,275
A guest must respect
the house of his host.

447
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:18,508
Youth and hate make dangerous thoughts.

448
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:20,580
He has nothing left but revenge.

449
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:22,582
We must try to understand.

450
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,586
It hurts.

451
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,588
Be more gentle, Onida.

452
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:29,558
The white man is tender...

453
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:33,563
Like a young pig
cries at the smallest pain.

454
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:35,565
Bokhawah, you talk like a fool.

455
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,467
A man would not say that and live.

456
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:40,371
Now you talk like a forceful fool.

457
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:42,473
Stand up, Keoga.

458
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,580
How brave you are, to
fight a half grown boy.

459
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:59,599
Are you all right?

460
00:39:59,804 --> 00:40:01,567
You have good legs, Keoga.

461
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:03,262
But you better put on 
some more size...

462
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,073
before you challenge
a man that big.

463
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:07,626
- Will you teach me how to...
- Sure, I'll teach you.

464
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,586
A good guest does not create
disturbances in his host's house...

465
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,589
I beg you to forgive me.

466
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:22,594
And please do not be too hard.

467
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:26,599
- I told you he was our friend, father.
- I believe it.

468
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:31,605
You'll be welcome always
where ever there is a Mohawk.

469
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:36,596
I'll paint pictures of you,
Kowanen, and your ways.

470
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:40,582
I'll show them to my people.
So that they'll know you better.

471
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,590
He who fills his mouth with
big words ends by eating dirt.

472
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,004
- Any sign of the wagon
yet, sergeant? - No, sir.

473
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,606
Alright, close the gates.

474
00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:07,581
Has he ever stayed out
this late before?

475
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:09,583
No, miss.
It is very disturbing.

476
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:11,585
Most likely he was killed
by the Indians.

477
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:16,091
What a horrible man!

478
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,644
He should not say those bad
things, unless it's true.

479
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,596
What else can it be?

480
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:22,960
There aren't any pretty women
out there. Or are there?

481
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:24,902
I insist that you and 
your soldiers make an...

482
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,905
immediate search for that man.

483
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,908
- And where do we search for him?
- I'd start with the Mohawk village.

484
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:33,588
- But he may not be agreeing.
- In any doubt.

485
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,581
We don't happen to be
at war with the Mohawks.

486
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,614
What was that last night?
A social visit?

487
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:40,486
If you won't send your soldiers...

488
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:42,170
I'll gather the settlers
and we will go ourselves.

489
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:43,992
The gates are closed, Mr. Butler.

490
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:47,095
Neither you nor anyone else 
goes out of this fort tonight.

491
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,299
There is no reason yet to believe
Jonathan has trouble...

492
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:51,221
with the Mohawks.

493
00:41:51,406 --> 00:41:54,204
Maybe he lost his cow
and is still looking for it.

494
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,289
What are they singing?

495
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,592
They tell of Dekaniwida
who brought love, and laughter...

496
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,596
and the Tree of Peace to the Iroquois.

497
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:19,902
I didn't know any Indian
could laugh like you.

498
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:24,408
There is a small bird seen and
a hawk circles its nest.

499
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,800
That is for love and peace. You might
as well have told me that the Indians...

500
00:42:27,816 --> 00:42:30,214
have wings and fly among the angels.

501
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,156
They do.

502
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:36,387
Why has the white man
never learned to love?

503
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:40,594
Does the hawk love when he
circles the small bird's nest?

504
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,596
Then you do know love.

505
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,599
As you know peace and laughter.

506
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:47,372
I'm glad.

507
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,607
And from Ontario...

508
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:57,614
came Dekaniwida,
father of the Iroquois...

509
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:02,620
to plant peace beside the lake...

510
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:07,592
Peace with roots from the heaven.

511
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:06,309
- Throw it back.
- Come on and get it.

512
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:10,600
- Throw it back.
- Come and get it.

513
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:27,622
Now you get it.

514
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,142
But it has been days.

515
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,145
How can you stand by and
do nothing all this time?

516
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:11,114
He knew it was not a good time
to leave the Fort.

517
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,617
He is city bred,
he doesn't understand these things.

518
00:46:14,823 --> 00:46:17,621
He didn't realize how
dangerous it was.

519
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,623
He should have.

520
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:21,526
He has been here long enough.

521
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:23,678
He has most likely found
out the truth by now.

522
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,233
How can you laugh?

523
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:29,495
They laugh because they are men
and try to hide with laughter...

524
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,748
that they are afraid to go
and look for Jonathan.

525
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:33,470
That is why they laugh.

526
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:36,273
I ain't fighting no Indians
for that painter fellow.

527
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:39,477
My crops needs more 
care than he does.

528
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:43,218
Let this go unpunished and you'll
lose your lives as well as crops.

529
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:46,853
Butler, I will not have you
start a war against the Mohawks.

530
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:48,956
The war has started, Captain.

531
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:51,960
That senseless little raid several
nights ago. And now this.

532
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:59,188
If you don't have got any courage they'll come
in one night and slaughter every one of you.

533
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:02,772
- He's right.
- He is a stupid.

534
00:47:02,847 --> 00:47:06,446
The Iroquois are thousands and
we are maybe two hundred.

535
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:07,819
How can we punish them?

536
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:10,351
Well, that's your problem and you
have to solve it without us.

537
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:14,052
- We're going back to Boston.
- Yes, that is very wise.

538
00:47:14,428 --> 00:47:18,057
I'm not leaving until I know
what happened to Jonathan.

539
00:47:18,832 --> 00:47:21,460
I always knew I'd die a spinster.

540
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,463
Now, where is he going?

541
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:51,965
- The Captain from the fort.
- Nothing matter.

542
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:07,073
Is this the white friend's
greeting to Kowanen?

543
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:12,489
I beg your forgiveness, Kowanen.

544
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:15,458
This man has gone for days.

545
00:48:15,735 --> 00:48:17,362
We thought him dead or lost.

546
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:20,365
After all my worrying,
it struck me funny...

547
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:22,368
to find him peaceful employing
painting your portrait.

548
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:24,470
You'd do better
not to be angry with him.

549
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:27,474
That comes now, with your permission.

550
00:48:30,753 --> 00:48:33,381
I should beat your brains in for
all the troubles you've caused.

551
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:36,384
- What has he done?
- About driven me crazy, that's all.

552
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,488
The settlers don't understand
the Iroquois, Kowanen.

553
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:42,492
They listen to
this madman, Butler.

554
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:45,461
who frightens them with predictions
of massacres by painted redskins.

555
00:48:45,837 --> 00:48:47,464
When Jonathan failed to return...

556
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,466
he said that the Indians
killed him and started...

557
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,469
agitating for a war against you...

558
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:54,472
as punishment for your crime.
He's got the people all stirred up.

559
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,476
I guess I better get back to
Fort as quickly as possible.

560
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:59,248
Show myself alive and happy.

561
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:01,882
- Will you be back?
- Quickly as a horse can run.

562
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:05,189
Keoga, you will go with them.

563
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,492
He who plans war does not send...

564
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,494
his own son into the enemy camp.

565
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:13,501
They'll understand that better
than ten thousand words.

566
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:17,471
It's time to look upon Kowanen
and his wife, Minikah.

567
00:49:17,676 --> 00:49:20,474
I thank my guard for them,
their wisdom and their goodness.

568
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,477
Long live to you.

569
00:49:22,682 --> 00:49:24,479
And to you, long life.

570
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,482
How soon will be it?

571
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:29,285
I have got some paintings to take
and bring back some more supplies.

572
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,628
I'll take the wagon.
We'd better take back that cow too.

573
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:33,490
Then I won't wait for you.

574
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,492
And try to get in before sundown.

575
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,497
We'll be back with tomorrow's sun.

576
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:44,503
- Keoga.
- Yes.

577
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,473
Be careful of your manners
among the white people.

578
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:48,475
Yes, mother.

579
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:01,496
I don't understand.

580
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:03,498
He promised to be here by sundown.

581
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:06,502
Could something have happened?

582
00:51:06,707 --> 00:51:08,504
I can't think of anything.

583
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,508
Everything was certainly 
peaceful enough when I left.

584
00:51:11,713 --> 00:51:14,511
It is Jonathan. When he's
painting he forgets time.

585
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:17,515
You might as well get some sleep.

586
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:25,492
Good evening.

587
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:32,501
You should know better than to
hide in shadows as a Indian warrior.

588
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:33,501
An Indian warrior?

589
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:35,504
I thought the Indians were peaceful.

590
00:51:35,709 --> 00:51:37,506
You said so yourself, Captain.

591
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:40,509
And you know better than anyone
how to read the Indian mind.

592
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:42,512
Evacuate the fort. Get out of the valley.

593
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:44,514
Or you'll all be dead within 24 hours.

594
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,520
You worry too much Mr. Butler,
you will get bad stomach trouble.

595
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,497
On this day we are met together.

596
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:02,503
The Great Spirit has appointed this day.

597
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:08,509
Now this day we are met
because of this death.

598
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:18,322
Now into the ground will he
be born, the young Keoga.

599
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:24,295
Now then wipe away
the falling tears.

600
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:28,500
So that peacefully we may look around.

601
00:52:28,706 --> 00:52:31,504
And then something stops your ears.

602
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:35,509
With care we remove whatever it is...

603
00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:38,512
So you will hear the words to be said.

604
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:44,419
There is a stoppage in your throat.

605
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:48,525
And we take it away that
you may speak your hearts.

606
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:56,500
Every day we are losing our men
into the earth they are born.

607
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,505
Also our women and children.

608
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:01,508
And our grandchildren.

609
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:05,513
So that you are sitting
in the midst of blood.

610
00:53:08,722 --> 00:53:13,523
I see the ghosts of the Tuscaroras
walking through the woods.

611
00:53:13,728 --> 00:53:16,526
And with them, I see
the ghosts of the Mohawks.

612
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,528
For you are dead.

613
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,532
Dead as Keoga is dead.

614
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:24,501
Killed, as Keoga was killed...

615
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:26,504
by the white men.

616
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,510
And the ghosts must walk 
the earth until the last day...

617
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,513
Because the white man has
plowed the burial ground.

618
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,519
And there is no place
for the dead to rest.

619
00:53:38,524 --> 00:53:43,325
This is what I see, as I see
Keoga dead before me.

620
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,528
And no man saying the blood
of 100 white men...

621
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:49,531
for each drop of young Keoga's blood.

622
00:53:49,737 --> 00:53:53,537
You grieve because you have
not the courage to fight.

623
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:56,506
You are dead! Dead!

624
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:57,508
No! No!

625
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,216
Bokhawah speaks angry words.

626
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:05,418
And maybe with reason.

627
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:08,701
But not he nor I,
no matter what is in our hearts...

628
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:10,524
can make war.

629
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:13,527
That only the Council can decide.

630
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:17,533
And you will talk for peace because
your woman owns your mind...

631
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,535
And the white man owns
your daughter.

632
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:24,540
I've seen it with my own eyes.

633
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:25,552
No!

634
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:29,312
Onida, go to the house.

635
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,520
The white man killed my son...

636
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,522
You will not kill my daughter.

637
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:39,525
I love your daughter.

638
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,328
The white man does not know love.
Only conquest.

639
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:49,537
Let the runners go to all the chiefs
of the clans for a war council.

640
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,227
Why did they kill my brother?

641
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,230
I don't know, Onida.

642
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,663
I can't even begin to understand.

643
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:19,540
- They must have known they'd start a war.
- The madness about this thing.

644
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:22,703
If the moon would make
ugly faces at the sun...

645
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:26,549
The stars would chasing
each other like mad dogs.

646
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,647
For they are mad dogs these white men

647
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,720
that would make war to
destroy each other.

648
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:33,683
What are they made of?
They who deny their own people.

649
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:35,526
What white man has done that?

650
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:39,531
This man, Butler, who came to tell
my father of the new muskets.

651
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,893
Butler. Why?

652
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,736
To make my father war 
against the settlers.

653
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,542
Jonathan, you must leave
while there is still time.

654
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:52,546
If the council decides for war,
and they will...

655
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:54,549
they will kill you first.

656
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:57,652
- But why would Butler...
- It doesn't matter now.

657
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,792
Jonathan, think of yourself.
You are a white man.

658
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:03,795
Blood for blood.
Jonathan for Keoga.

659
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,009
They will kill you and throw
your body to the gate of the fort.

660
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,901
And that would be
the declaration of war.

661
00:56:10,939 --> 00:56:14,739
- They decided the war.
- I will try to stop them.

662
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:17,642
No, Jonathan, they will kill you.
Go now!

663
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:45,644
- Kowanen, I'm your friend.
- You're a white man.

664
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:47,646
Regardless I'm still your friend.

665
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:50,650
You must not blame all 
white men for this murder.

666
00:56:50,855 --> 00:56:52,652
Let me find out first what
mad man who did this thing.

667
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:55,656
We offered peace,
they gave us death.

668
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:57,758
Now they will have war.

669
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:00,728
Let his body carry the
flaming war arrows...

670
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:03,732
- to the white men.
- So be it.

671
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:15,647
Mother, mother.
They have taken Jonathan.

672
00:57:16,052 --> 00:57:18,399
- He is our enemy.
- You know he isn't.

673
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:21,855
I know his skin is white.
I do not know the color of his heart...

674
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,736
Because I can not see it.

675
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:26,660
You do not sound like my mother.

676
00:57:26,865 --> 00:57:30,665
- I am also Keoga's mother.
- I loved Keoga.

677
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:32,633
You also love the white man.

678
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:34,636
And I will hate those who hate him.

679
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:36,638
And I will kill those who kill him.

680
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:38,640
Even if it would be my own father.

681
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:41,644
If the law is blood for blood,
then I too must obey this law.

682
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,546
It is a man made law.

683
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,550
For men do nothing they enjoy
so much as dying...

684
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:50,555
Knowing that women would
go on making new lives...

685
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,558
to take the place of all deaths.

686
00:57:53,764 --> 00:57:58,672
What are you waiting for?
Go, free this man before...

687
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:01,534
they cut him up into pieces,
the blood thirsty fools.

688
00:58:49,064 --> 00:58:50,020
Don't move.

689
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:14,036
It will not be so quick,
white man, there will be fire.

690
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:19,531
And the tearing of the skin...
No, you will not die fast.

691
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:21,594
You will die piece by piece.

692
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,817
And I shall take the first.

693
00:59:36,053 --> 00:59:37,680
Onida, cut me loose.

694
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:40,684
Onida hurry, somebody
might have heard him.

695
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,594
Climb this wall and jump.

696
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:51,697
- On the other side there will be so much
brush you will not be heard. - Come with me.

697
00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:53,400
I belong with my people
and you with yours.

698
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:55,302
I'm not leaving without you.

699
00:59:55,577 --> 00:59:59,195
Would it do any good if you stay here
and die instead of warn your people?

700
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:10,386
You see Jonathan, I keep my 
eyes closed when I kiss you.

701
01:00:10,661 --> 01:00:12,788
- Now I know why.
- Tell me.

702
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:15,812
To love is to close ones eyes
to everything...

703
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:17,494
Except the beauty of love.

704
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,498
Now go, while my eyes are still closed.

705
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,402
Someone is coming here.
He looks hurt.

706
01:02:18,616 --> 01:02:19,412
Give him a hand.

707
01:04:14,823 --> 01:04:16,620
Tell the colonel we
have had warnings.

708
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:20,426
We should be able to hold them off a while.
But you better get help as fast as you can.

709
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,426
Yes, sir.

710
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,930
Close the gates.

711
01:04:27,038 --> 01:04:28,835
Open those gates again.

712
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,637
No one else leaves the fort.

713
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:33,720
I am not a prisoner. I will
not be detained like a prisoner.

714
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:35,543
We need every men here.

715
01:04:36,048 --> 01:04:38,205
I gave you warning but you
wouldn't listen to me.

716
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,198
Now you expect me to die
with the rest of you.

717
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:44,019
But I'm not such a fool.
Open those gates.

718
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:56,003
Why did you give them warning?
What information did you have?

719
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:58,036
It is enough that I warned them.

720
01:04:58,141 --> 01:04:59,938
You said they would attack
within 24 hours.

721
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:01,940
That was a good prediction,
wasn't it?

722
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:05,746
Kowanen's son, Keoga, was murdered
approximately 24 hours ago.

723
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,748
Did you know that, Butler?

724
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:09,650
What is one Indian to me?

725
01:05:09,855 --> 01:05:11,652
How did you know Keoga was murdered?

726
01:05:11,858 --> 01:05:13,655
It came to me in a vision.

727
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,624
How many shots were in your vision?

728
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,627
As many as it take to kill an Indian.

729
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:19,629
One is enough for a man
who knows how to shoot.

730
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:21,631
But there is twice as
much pleasure in two.

731
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:25,637
And what pleasure was there in going to
Kowanen and tell him about the new muskets?

732
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,640
- That's a lie.
- A Mohawk told me.

733
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:31,643
You take the word of a Mohawk
against that of a white man?

734
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,646
Mohawks don't lie, Butler.
You know that.

735
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,652
- You killed Keoga because...
- They are coming!

736
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:47,027
Mister Butler, since you insist...

737
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,031
Open the gates.

738
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,034
Tell the Mohawks we use the
new muskets most regretful...

739
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,037
If you have the chance.

740
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:09,656
Open. Let me in.

741
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:12,660
Brace the gates.

742
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:14,662
Open up. Let me in.

743
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:16,630
Greta, catch my muskets.

744
01:06:17,637 --> 01:06:20,435
Open up. In mercy's name.

745
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:37,355
Go inside and get ready to help the
wounded. It will be better for you.

746
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:39,363
Wait.

747
01:07:47,578 --> 01:07:48,340
Wait.

748
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,356
Fire!

749
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,380
- They are leaving.
- They'll be back.

750
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:19,485
Greta, bring wine.
Free wine for everybody.

751
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,454
And brandy too.
It's too good for the Indians.

752
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,457
They won't appreciate it.

753
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:30,764
It's not really as painful.

754
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,768
And how would you know, Miss?

755
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:37,973
They have run.

756
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:41,978
- Will they come back?
- With more men.

757
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:44,981
What if help doesn't arrive in time?

758
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:46,984
We don't think that way.

759
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:48,986
We say that we will hold
them up until help arrives.

760
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:50,988
Jonathan shouldn't be
allowed to fight.

761
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:53,958
He might be blind or
have his hands wounded.

762
01:09:54,164 --> 01:09:56,962
He mustn't be wasted this way.
He is an artist.

763
01:09:57,168 --> 01:09:59,966
He would not even be a good artist
if he was not first a man.

764
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:02,970
Today is fighting day.
Even for us women.

765
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:08,977
I said some nasty things
about you and I'm sorry.

766
01:10:10,184 --> 01:10:12,982
I did not even hear them.
It is my disposition.

767
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:13,983
Greta.

768
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:18,989
Do you love Jonathan?

769
01:10:19,194 --> 01:10:20,991
Jonathan does not love me.

770
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:22,994
Nothing else matters.

771
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,062
It is that way many times.

772
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:27,966
Love commands but never obeys.

773
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:31,971
I must bring wine to the men.
They are thirsty.

774
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:38,479
What are you standing there for?

775
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:40,481
These people needs tending to.

776
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:22,799
If we let to live,
come back to Boston.

777
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:26,769
Not to marry me.
I have no hope anymore.

778
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:30,776
But to work or at least to live.

779
01:11:30,981 --> 01:11:33,779
I don't know, Cynthia.
I've lots to think about.

780
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:23,336
We can't hold them off
no longer. Retire!

781
01:12:42,701 --> 01:12:44,328
Get them out.

782
01:13:18,109 --> 01:13:19,736
Block off the windows.

783
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:36,328
The dead are like leaves 
of grass under foot.

784
01:14:36,804 --> 01:14:38,431
And yet they died for nothing.

785
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,665
For who has won this battle?

786
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,618
Neither white men nor Indian.

787
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,541
We hold your prisoner, Kowanen.

788
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,548
But not the great nations
of the Iroquois.

789
01:14:49,754 --> 01:14:53,555
For now the Iroquois will listen
to the warnings of the Tuscaroras.

790
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,657
And the war fires will burn from
the salt ocean till the Great River.

791
01:14:58,062 --> 01:15:00,860
And the white men will be driven
from the lands of the Iroquois

792
01:15:01,066 --> 01:15:02,580
as the French 100 years ago.

793
01:15:11,446 --> 01:15:13,243
Here is the man who killed your son.

794
01:15:13,549 --> 01:15:15,456
He was no men's friend,
not yours nor ours.

795
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:17,348
He would have us 
destroy each other...

796
01:15:17,553 --> 01:15:19,971
to have this valley for his own.

797
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:22,015
Is it for this man we must
set our world on fire?

798
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,597
Do we give him what he wanted
even now he is dead?

799
01:15:29,769 --> 01:15:32,533
Too many have died 
already because of him.

800
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:43,547
That's all of them.
Take good care of them now.

801
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:46,551
If you ever come to Boston,
do come and visit us.

802
01:15:47,356 --> 01:15:50,154
You too, Greta. It was really
been wonderful knowing you.

803
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,158
I must say I'll certainly be glad
to get back to Boston...

804
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:57,063
and civilization, and away from
all these disgusting Indians.

805
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:01,569
Take my paintings to the
Massachusetts Associate.

806
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:03,537
There are 11 more than they ordered.

807
01:16:03,543 --> 01:16:05,340
Aren't you coming with us?

808
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:08,343
No, dear Aunt Agatha.
I'm staying right here.

809
01:16:13,655 --> 01:16:16,453
Goodbye, Cynthia.
Have a good trip.

810
01:16:17,759 --> 01:16:20,557
Love commands but it never obeys.

811
01:16:21,764 --> 01:16:23,561
Greta taught me that.

812
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:25,364
You always knew that, Cynthia.

813
01:16:25,569 --> 01:16:27,366
You are also a woman.

814
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:32,973
Greta, I still think you are
the smartest woman I've ever known.

815
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:43,652
Now we can truly dry our tears.

816
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:47,658
For the Great Spirit has sent us
a son in the place of...

817
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:49,659
he who was taken away.

818
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:52,563
For this reason, we give you
the name of Keoga.

819
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,568
May you be happy
until your spirit leaves us.

820
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:00,912
Now... go to Onida.

821
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:07,448
Why are you closing your eyes?

822
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:10,561
- I'm waiting to be kissed.
- In front of all these people?

823
01:17:10,657 --> 01:17:13,455
Oh, there is something worth
learning from the white man.
