1
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:40,659
ELEGY

2
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,020
Mr. Ramazan.

3
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,600
Mr. Ramazan.

4
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,720
Did this man bring us
to a wrong place?

5
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,520
Sari Veli knows
smuggler's place better than us.

6
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,240
Rocks are falling.

7
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,520
Mr. Ramazan.

8
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,860
I give up, Ramazan.
Let's go.

9
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Don't push me. We don't harm you.
Use your mind.

10
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,820
Selamun Aleykum, Coban Agha.

11
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,200
Hello, Coban Agha.
Your men don't know us.

12
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,180
We're here for business.

13
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,640
- What business?
- There are 4 cans of stuff.

14
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,480
They must be in Incesu on Friday.
We need to deliver them on time.

15
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,960
Mr. Nizamettin is a respectable
trade man.

16
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,360
- Sari Veli told us your place.
- Bread money.

17
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,480
You won't sell us for money?

18
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,081
We worked long time together.

19
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,840
Have I ever betrayed you?

20
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,360
How much will you pay?

21
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,161
I don't know.

22
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,380
- We'll think something.
- If you think, we won't do it.

23
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,440
- Why is that? - We haven't
forgotten the last time.

24
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,420
It wasn't my fault.
I'm only the commision trader.

25
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,960
Comission traders
sell their father for money.

26
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,860
100 lira for each of you.

27
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,360
You don't risk your life for 100 lira.

28
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,620
How much do you want?

29
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,860
200 lira each.

30
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,460
And trousers, a shirt, 2 kilo soap,

31
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,961
50 bullets, 10 packs tobacco.

32
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
The shirt will be striped.

33
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,480
Agreed. You get what you want
at the delivery of goods.

34
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,460
We get 500 lira in advance.

35
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,840
Mothers, sisters. The basis of
our health is being clean.

36
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,320
In the water you drink and use,
live harmful micro-organisms.

37
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,780
Typhoid, cholera, polio are
contaminated by water.

38
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,860
By boiling the water we kill
the germs.

39
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,460
To dig wells near toilets is very
dangerous. We have to...

40
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,960
be careful about child-care.
In our country, 162 children...

41
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,780
out of 1000 die as sauglings.
Children must be vaccinated.

42
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,980
They say you don't waccinate for
measles. This is wrong.

43
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,940
Thousands of children die
because of this mistake.

44
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,320
Doctor, hurry up.
Ismail fall from a tree.

45
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
Make way for the doctor.

46
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,540
- What happened?
- Villagers are having fun.

47
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,680
Nobody has fallen.
It's better if they don't do it.

48
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm here for them,
they're not aware of it.

49
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,600
They've caught another one.
There won't be anybody left soon.

50
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,460
Use your head.
If there's no man on mountains...

51
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,820
...what will become of our business?
Talk to smuggler Osman.

52
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,280
Three cans for them,
we share the other one.

53
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,720
Use your head. There
are 4 cans, that's a fortune.

54
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,440
- What about you?
- One can is enough for me.

55
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,600
- Where do they pass?
- This is a river bed.

56
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,100
Here's Kepez mountain.
Most probably they'll go through here.

57
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,480
You've to kill Cobanoglu with
the first bullet.

58
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,780
- What if we don't benefit?
- Are you scared?

59
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,100
A coward is always hungry.

60
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,001
Ismail, over the hill.
Tefik, over here

61
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,540
Look, you get a chance
like that once.

62
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,620
If we succeed you save your life
with your share.

63
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
If you're still scared,
you may go.

64
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,780
You can't stand
Gendarme bullet by this heat.

65
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,960
- Osman, if I die.
- Don't think bad things.

66
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,960
If we get shot, what will happen
to our shares?

67
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,660
Spread around!

68
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,640
Mehmet Emin, Sivasli.

69
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,341
Don't kill them.
Let's catch them alive.

70
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,140
You got it.

71
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,200
Cobanoglu, Jackal of fields.
Leave the donkeys.

72
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,080
Don't make me shed blood.
I'm the lion of these mountains.

73
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,700
You jackal.

74
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,080
- Sivasli, back me up.
- Alright, brother.

75
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,000
- I'm really worried.
- Why? You're fond of us?

76
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,140
- Aren't we brothers?
- Brother like you is fit for the grave.

77
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,140
- We were surrounded.
- By Gendarme?

78
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,280
You know it better than us.

79
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,360
Bring him here.

80
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,340
We were stopped.
Who was the cause of it?

81
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,240
Sari Veli could do it.

82
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,680
Sari Veli!

83
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,780
Why do you cry?
What do you want?

84
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,540
Cows are in your fields.

85
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,020
What cow, whose field?

86
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,960
Welcome, Coban Agha.

87
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,460
Help, they're killing people.

88
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,260
Sari Veli is your friend.
You did business together.

89
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,300
We were friends,
but we didn't work together.

90
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,940
Don't lie.
We know everything.

91
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:46,941
Aren't you commision trader
for smugglers?

92
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,940
That was in the past.
I'm a honorable trader now.

93
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,160
Honorable, huh?

94
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,700
You'll tell us smugglers' places
that you know.

95
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,300
If you're helpful,
it'll be to you interest.

96
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
Really? My interest?

97
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Nothing left on the tree.
The owner could kill us.

98
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,060
Potatoes, make fire.

99
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You know what I think,
we should be in my village.

100
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,120
By the Cam Stream.
We should drink cold water.

101
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,720
Then we'd let you on the pasture.
That would be great fun.

102
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,520
I wouln't mind, if I were there.

103
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,420
I feel uneasy.
I have bad dreams.

104
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:53,221
I worry about my family.

105
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,200
It's dangerous now.
There's a right time for everything.

106
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,640
- What the family will eat?
- Nobody dies of hunger.

107
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,160
If they're lucky,
when we get a sum of money...

108
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,840
I hope it won't be too late.

109
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,480
- Gendarme!
- Run for your life!

110
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,420
Wait! Surrender!

111
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,500
Keep the Gendarme away.

112
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,120
That must be the Gendarme
and the smugglers.

113
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,300
White Pants for sure.
Cobanoglu is fighting.

114
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,680
- Shootings are over.
- Shooting is none of my business.

115
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,680
Let them kill each other.

116
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,600
This man is going to die.

117
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,540
That will be our end.

118
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,560
- Where's Mehmet Emin?
- He'll fetch the doctor.

119
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,040
Could the doctor be remedy
for Gendarme bullets.

120
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,740
- Who is it?
- Open up. Someone is sick.

121
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,180
- Who are you?
- A villager.

122
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,660
There's a wounded man.
We need a doctor.

123
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,220
- What is it, Ahmet?
- A man is wounded.

124
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,100
- Is she the doctor?
- What kind of wound?

125
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,880
Wounded by a bullet.

126
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,460
Don't go at night. It's risky.
Look at the man.

127
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,620
He'll die, if you don't come.
This man has to live!

128
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,120
- Who is wounded?
- Cobanoglu.

129
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,520
- Cobanoglu?
- Yes, Cobanoglu.

130
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,960
They're coming.

131
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,540
- How is Cobanoglu?
- He's about to die.

132
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,680
Boil some water.

133
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,480
<i>Don't blame us
We utter your name</i>

134
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,400
<i>Don't think it's a legend
We reach to God</i>

135
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,520
<i>We're too many to count</i>

136
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:45,721
<i>We don't be finished by killing</i>

137
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,040
<i>Nobody knows how
we are inquiring in the province</i>

138
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,460
<i>People think we're insane</i>

139
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:02,261
<i>Our insane is wiser than sane</i>

140
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,540
It's over.

141
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,520
I'm worried about them.
Shall we call the Gendarme?

142
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,700
We'll wait till evening
then we call the Gendarme.

143
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,900
God bless you, sister.
You're free to go.

144
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,980
Thank you.

145
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,980
- Won't you take the donkey?
- It's a gift.

146
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,340
I've never seen anything
like that.

147
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,800
The man we dreamed of for years
was lying on a straw bed...

148
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,820
with a bullet in his lung,
unconscious and bleeding.

149
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,420
I didn't know what to do.
But the look in the men's eyes....

150
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,820
They believed that I'd save him.
That gave me strength.

151
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,280
It was my first surgery,
on difficult conditions.

152
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,580
He didn't look like the remarkable man
whom story you're writing.

153
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,400
The Gendarme bullet takes
remarkableness away.

154
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,040
He was a brave man.

155
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,800
No more business for us.
The mountains are cleared of men.

156
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,460
Our last hope
is that Cobanoglu gets caught.

157
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,480
Shut up. I am talking.

158
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,900
I wish I could get Cobanoglu entrapped.
It'll be to my benefit.

159
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,440
Because Cobanoglu is the last man
on mountains.

160
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,000
You were unconscious for three
whole days. We were hopeless.

161
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,060
The Lady Doctor saved you.

162
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,020
Take a breath.
Take a deep breath.

163
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,300
- Selamun aleykum.
- Aleykümüs selam.

164
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,900
- Who's next?
- Me.

165
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,220
- You look well today.
- I feel fine.

166
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,320
Doctor said, you should rest.

167
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,680
You were alone at home
all day long.

168
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm worried about him.

169
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,360
They would let us know
if anything was wrong.

170
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,780
- If they couldn't?
- We'll visit him tomorow.

171
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,360
- I finished the story.
- What did you name it?

172
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,500
I'm not sure yet.
Maybe 'Cobanoglu' or 'Hor Earth'.

173
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,900
- I'd call it 'Elegy'.
- Elegy?

174
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,620
How do I look? In jail
I had pants and high boots.

175
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,860
When I walked, the earth shook.

176
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,020
If I hadn't escaped, I'd be
free by now, and with my family.

177
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,840
Do you think
Cobanoglu would let us go home?

178
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,180
The doctor is coming.

179
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,860
- She saved your life.
- Who is she with?

180
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,540
They live in the same house.

181
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,760
Welcome doctor, welcome brother.

182
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,300
- I'm glad to see you well.
- I'm fine thanks to you.

183
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,540
Don't fear. This old snake
is the guard of our village.

184
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,280
He couldn't go away
as we couldn't.

185
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,620
This was our home.

186
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,120
What's happening?

187
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,100
The rocks will fall down again.

188
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,760
- You like Cobanoglu?
- More than my own life.

189
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,340
Is Cobanoglu well off?

190
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,220
- What do you mean?
- I mean money.

191
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,600
We're starving, brother.
We had a job the other day.

192
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,760
Our share was 200 lira each.
Any news about amnesty?

193
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,820
- What amnesty?
- The amnesty.

194
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,740
Once there was a large village here.
The rocks and feud destroyed us.

195
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,400
The graves weren't enough
for dead.

196
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,680
Sometimes three deaths on one day.
The rocks were our enemies.

197
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,860
- You know rock fear?
- No, I don't.

198
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,480
One has to live it. Rocks
came down like rain falls.

199
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,140
Rocks killed my mother.
Feud killed father.

200
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,640
- Feud didn't make you fugitive.
- How do you know it?

201
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,400
Everybody around here knows you.
I was 14 then.

202
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,720
As a teenager, we were experiencing
exciting days.

203
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,060
Young people told your story
and Hatice's beauty.

204
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,540
- Are you from Balözü?
- Yes. I'm hunter Halil's daughter.

205
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,480
He was good to us.
That's why you're so kind.

206
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,720
- I'm not that kind.
- You are. You're very kind.

207
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,820
You saved my life.
You could go to Gendarme.

208
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,880
I waited till you get well.
I have to tell them.

209
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,200
My duty is to help people.
I must respect the law too.

210
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,380
You're right, we respect the law
but to die is hard.

211
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,880
We're all waiting for the amnesty.

212
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,280
Ten years on the mountains
we lead a miserable life.

213
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,040
Being poor, being a sheppard
made me fugitive.

214
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,080
We became the jackal
on the mountains.

215
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,540
If we were considered a human being,
things wouldn't be like this.

216
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,740
Cobanoglu is the most feared
smuggler on the mountains.

217
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,960
He can always get away.
He's the chief of White Pants.

218
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,900
You find him either in
desolatad village or in cemetery.

219
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,580
The cemetery?

220
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,140
He had a beloved once,
she has died.

221
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,360
I took out Cobanoglu's bullet
I'm a doctor.

222
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,160
I'm concerned about people's health,
not about what they are.

223
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,880
I also do my best to help law.

224
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,860
I saw him in the desolated village.
His wound was serious.

225
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,100
Now he must be well.
But I don't know where he is.

226
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,940
Sivasli missed his family
very much.

227
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,160
I suppose the earth is calling him.

228
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:31,700
- Haven't you slept, Sivasli?
- I can't forget my family.

229
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,440
God help you.

230
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,560
Sivasli has gone!

231
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:19,161
Get up, brother.
Sivasli has gone.

232
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,340
The earth called Sivasli.
Who was on guard?

233
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,320
Forgive me, I've fallen asleep.
And Sivasli has gone.

234
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,640
We've entrusted you our lives.
Get lost.

235
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,740
You're on your own now.

236
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,760
Wait!

237
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,160
Four packs of tobacco,
two white one green soap, linen...

238
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:12,600
...a rosary, a gun,
bracelets and a doll.

239
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,480
They must be around here.
This is their place.

240
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,080
- We searched every place.
- Let's wait. They'll come back.

241
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,660
Don't follow us! How can a man who
sleeps on guard be trusted?

242
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,800
Forgive me. It won't happen again.
I have never done it before.

243
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,260
I've suddenly fallen asleep.
I dreamed Sivasli going.

244
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,240
If you follow us, I'll kill you.

245
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,960
Coban Agha, forgive me!
What can I do by myself?

246
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,740
I swear I won't do it again!

247
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,680
Coban Agha!

248
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,240
Coban Agha!
Don't leave me here!

249
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,080
Don't come. Don't.

250
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,560
- Don't come!
- I will!

251
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,960
Don't come or
I will blow your head!

252
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,360
- Don't come!
- I will!

253
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,160
I will come! I will come!

254
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,920
You're my family!

255
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,020
We have been sharing the same salt
and bread for years.

256
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,640
- You can't leave me alone!
- Don't come, I said!

257
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,380
I will.
I will even if you kill me.

258
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,980
- I swear I'll shoot you.
- You can't, Mehmet Emin.

259
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,760
- I said, don't come!
- I will.

260
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,920
I will. I will!

261
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,900
- Don't come!
- I will!

262
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,420
We're waiting in vain.
They won't come back.

263
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,860
Don't talk like that.
I hope they do come back.

264
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,180
Let's wait a little longer.
Cobanoglu comes here for sure.

265
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,640
I beg you, they'll come here.
Let's wait till dark.

266
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,900
Please don't go.

267
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,880
Come on, hurry up.
Come here.

268
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,480
What a bad luck.

269
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,600
You watch the Gendarme.

270
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,980
Mehmet Emin,
give me a mirror.

271
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:22,040
- Gendarme is coming this way.
- Keep them away.

272
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,480
Wait! Don't run away!

273
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,840
Don't run! Surrender!

274
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,460
I'm sorry, I came to say goodbye.
Don't take me wrong.

275
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,880
I'm not after your beauty.

276
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,060
You're the only person
who cared for me.

277
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,320
- Are you leaving?
- All my friends are dead.

278
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,840
I can't stay here anymore.

279
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,180
- Where?
- I don't know.

280
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,620
I owe you a humble life but
I don't have time to pay it back.

281
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,120
I'm sorry.
God bless you.

282
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,060
God is on our side, woman.
I'm right, it's Cobanoglu.

283
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,160
You wait here,
I'll call the Gendarme.

284
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,540
God. Our lives are saved.

285
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:32,241
THE END
