1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:02,952
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:04,782
Payroll train's been robbed again.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,456
Seems we'll be needing your services.

4
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,436
You ain't gonna believe this boy.

5
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:10,642
What are you doin' here?

6
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,388
Tryin' to keep you
from gettin' yourself killed.

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,950
You don't believe in me anymore.

8
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:17,110
Nobody's gonna care about
the killing of a prostitute.

9
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,027
Would you like to join us for supper?

10
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:20,903
Look how far I've fallen.

11
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,198
The Sioux believe this land is scared.

12
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,632
I call the shots here,
not you.

13
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:27,643
Wake up cause you're next.

14
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:53,206
Here, Jenny.

15
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:55,040
Got some feed.

16
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,577
Bessie.

17
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,478
Mr. Toole!

18
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,614
Rise and shine!

19
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:20,906
Morning, Samuel.

20
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,443
Ehh.

21
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,675
Samuel!

22
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,447
Samuel, did you hear that?

23
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:13,413
I don't want to. Put me down!

24
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,763
Aaigh!

25
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,000

26
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,736
Now, Mr. Bohannon,

27
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,506
you are guilty of armed
robbery and sedition,

28
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,640
a capital offense.

29
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:47,407
I may be able to get that commuted to life

30
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:50,511
if you give me the names of your cohorts.

31
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,412
Yeah. I might just fly my ass out of here

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,415
if I sprout me some wings. Heh heh.

33
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,557
Now, let's try this again.

34
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:21,057
The names of the
confederates you rode with.

35
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,858
You think they wouldn't
give you up in a heartbeat

36
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,558
if they were in your spot?

37
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

38
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:37,704
I'll tell you. I'll tell you
their names, all right?

39
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,511
Wise decision.

40
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:51,362
Their... their names were...

41
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,597
Robert...

42
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:56,900
E...Lee,

43
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,371
Stonewall Jackson,

44
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,741
Jeb Stuart,

45
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,713
Nathan Bedford forr...

46
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,620
leave him!

47
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:09,528
Mitt herredømme?

48
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,565
What in God's name is...

49
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,906
sorry to disturb your
slumber, mitt herredømme,

50
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,642
but I was passing the railroad office.

51
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,449
An important, urgent message has arrived.

52
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,755
You may retrieve my chamber pot

53
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,558
at a more reasonable hour, Gundersen.

54
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:37,227
Of course.

55
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,169
Good day.

56
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,741
Thomas, what is it?

57
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:57,520
Indians. Attacked Durant.

58
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:02,360
Apparently burned the place to the ground.

59
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,713
Let's go! We got to get moving!

60
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,086
Everybody!

61
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,692
Mr. Ferguson!

62
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,896
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,564
Thought you might need my help, sir.

64
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:34,101
No, I need you here to protect my railroad.

65
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:40,008
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant, sir.

66
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:48,920
Potatoes, meat, what's left of the cheese.

67
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:52,261
This blanket is thin, so keep
your coat buttoned tight.

68
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,861
Ruth, I'm only gonna be gone a day.

69
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,336
To keep you safe.

70
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,839
Child.

71
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,609
You have forsaken me.

72
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:06,679
Father!

73
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,804
Why did you not come to me when you heard?

74
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,654
Because we have no use for you.

75
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:14,794
But I... I can help stop the bloodshed.

76
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,176
Jesus... Jesus said...

77
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:20,300
that Bible means nothing to them, reverend.

78
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,737
I know you view our relations
with these savages

79
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,480
as some kind of divine mission.

80
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:28,745
Trust me, God has forsaken all of us.

81
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:32,481
Your services are not necessary.

82
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,415
Father, sorry.

83
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,749
I'll be home soon.

84
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,855
Sit down.

85
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,709
What happened, Mr. Toole?

86
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:12,137
A band of braves rode in from the west,

87
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,338
attacked at daybreak,

88
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,810
scorched the very earth.

89
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,269
Ying

90
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,139
did they damage the track?

91
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:21,143
Not as I can tell, sir.

92
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,910
Steal anything?

93
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:24,144
No, sir.

94
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,778
How many killed?

95
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:29,015
7 men and 2 women.

96
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:32,952
Bleedin' savages.

97
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,654
What tribe?

98
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:35,855
You even know how to tell?

99
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,732
Sorry. I was too busy
saving me lily-white arse,

100
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,593
if you know what I mean.

101
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:42,722
They didn't look like Cheyenne to me,

102
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,193
if that's what you're wondering.

103
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,700
There they are!

104
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:05,149
They're Santee Sioux.

105
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:06,617
Sioux?

106
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,851
But this is Cheyenne territory.

107
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,988
Why are they attacking so far from home?

108
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,794
This was a murder raid.

109
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:18,398
They're sending you a message.

110
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,630
What message?

111
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,363
That you're now at war
with the Sioux nation.

112
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:33,194
Ying

113
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:51,773
ying

114
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,514
you got a visitor.

115
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,619
Visitor?

116
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,822
Make it fast.

117
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,460
What in the hell are you doing here?

118
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,500
Don't worry. Paid them guards a nice stack

119
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,087
of yankee bills.

120
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,975
Stupid ass.

121
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:21,412
They, uh...

122
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,313
They tell you when yet?

123
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,493
It's bound to be soon.

124
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:27,418
They're running out of people to shoot.

125
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:33,491
I'm sorry, Cullen.

126
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,599
Don't start, doc.

127
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,229
I got you caught up in this
nonsense to begin with.

128
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,097
I, uh...

129
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:41,332
I should have never dragged you into it.

130
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,532
You and me's square.

131
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,768
Now get the hell on out of here.

132
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,580
You make your peace yet, son?

133
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,390
What you suppose the lord's gonna think

134
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,718
about a man like me, huh?

135
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,486
He knows what's in your heart.

136
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,850
I murdered a man.

137
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:33,460
He was innocent.

138
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,328
I wrapped my hands around his throat,

139
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:36,438
and I looked him in the eyes,

140
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:41,602
and I choked the life right out of him.

141
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:46,904
I know you must feel... you
must feel bad about that, son.

142
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,608
That's just the thing.

143
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:53,143
I don't feel nothing about that.

144
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,049
Not a damn thing.

145
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,332
It's time. Come on, now.

146
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,620
I'll pray for you, son.

147
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,116
If you're gonna pray,

148
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,825
pray for me to die well, doc.

149
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,956
That's all I got left.

150
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,666
A small deposit will secure a lot

151
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,534
fit for tent accommodations.

152
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:37,871
However, the tents themselves
are for sale, not rent,

153
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:40,738
but for a slightly larger deposit,

154
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,074
you can pitch your flag closer to town.

155
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:45,076
Mr. McGinnes. Yeah?

156
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:47,078
These people lost everything.

157
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:48,713
They need shelter.

158
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,956
What size lot can they afford?

159
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:56,065
Really, Mr. McGinnes. We'll not profit

160
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:59,896
or further people's misery.

161
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:01,530
Bloody good that,

162
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:03,329
coming from an englishwoman.

163
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,731
I bet your pardon?

164
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,870
Ah, you people built an empire of misery

165
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,685
on the backs of the Irish
and everyone else,

166
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,367
haven't you?

167
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,932
The point is, Mr. McGinnes,

168
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,441
that these people need a place to live,

169
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,511
and we have land here, for everyone.

170
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,513
Mr. Durant, with whom I have an agreement,

171
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,581
has land.

172
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:21,117
Do you speak for him?

173
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,653
As a matter of fact, I do.

174
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:29,362
My agreement with Mr. Durant

175
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,897
states my percentage for
brokering his land,

176
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,502
plus a stake in all tents I provide.

177
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,971
Then we'll negotiate a settlement.

178
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,540
How's that, Mr. McGinnes?

179
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:38,874
And my brokerage fee.

180
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,097
Of course.

181
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,212
After all,

182
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,087
this is not England or Ireland, is it?

183
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:49,756
It is, in fact, America, Mrs. Bell.

184
00:17:49,824 --> 00:17:53,393
Yes, and welcome to it.

185
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,764
Good day, Mr. McGinnes.

186
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,064
As I was saying...

187
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:00,599
Ready...

188
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,305
Fire!

189
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:25,757
Afternoon, boys.

190
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:29,494
Going out to play in the water again?

191
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:34,798
Hold him tight. I got to get the...
hang on.

192
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:35,966
Take him out.

193
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,534
Thought you liked me, boys.

194
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,268
Give it a go.

195
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,705
Hold him!

196
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,374
Come on. It takes 3 of y'all

197
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,674
to kill one confederate?

198
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,108
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

199
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,343
Keep moving.

200
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,214
You sons of bitches gonna answer me?

201
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,231
Just do it. Get it over with.

202
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,901
You still there?

203
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:22,747
Where the hell did y'all go?

204
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,380
I was ready.

205
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,288
Get back in here.

206
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:31,890
I'll skin your asses alive

207
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,861
and run you back across the bull run!

208
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,866
Come on and finish this job right now!

209
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:42,941
What's the rush, Mr. Bohannon?

210
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,903
I just heard about, um...

211
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:08,903
The girl who died here a few days ago.

212
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,977
Yes. Um, the whore who was murdered.

213
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:18,213
She was my friend.

214
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:24,047
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:29,720
You should know, Eva, I... I did
secure her a proper burial.

216
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,724
Yeah. All due respect,

217
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,104
a burial don't do nothing

218
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,894
for the girls still there,

219
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:42,697
and I want the man responsible
to pay for what he did.

220
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,466
Eva, the situation...

221
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:57,005
It would be difficult to convince
people to do the right thing.

222
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:57,811
Because she was as whore?

223
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,341
No. I didn't say that.

224
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,577
She didn't deserve what she got.

225
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,849
I understand.

226
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,605
What the hell you doing here, anyway?

227
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:23,076
This is a warrant for your execution.

228
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,512
Yeah. No shit.

229
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,534
And this...

230
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,400
Is a pardon...

231
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,357
Signed by my friend Edwin Stanton,

232
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,064
secretary of war.

233
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,813
Playing God comes natural to you, don't it?

234
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:47,539
Well, yes, it does.

235
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:52,160
But like any benevolent God...

236
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,749
I'm here to help you.

237
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,964
I'm supposed to believe you
don't want nothing out of this?

238
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,347
On the contrary.

239
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,773
My motives are purely selfish.

240
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:06,116
But that is not to say that
you can't benefit as well.

241
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,489
You have a lot of unfinished business

242
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,610
on this earth, Mr. Bohannon.

243
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:15,873
What will it be...

244
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:18,672
life...

245
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,024
Or death?

246
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:43,029
I hope it's first-class.

247
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,440
All right.

248
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,584
Thank you.

249
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,562
You sure you got to do that?

250
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,673
That's for robbing my railroad.

251
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,194
It takes a tragedy to fill our church.

252
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,647
God is at work.

253
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:08,311
His ways are mysterious.

254
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:10,992
Maybe your God works too hard.

255
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,629
He is our God, Joseph.

256
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,729
Father. You should be in bed.

257
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,776
How sharper than a serpent's tooth.

258
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,300
And he maketh...

259
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,215
His angels to the wind

260
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,739
and his minister into the flame of fire.

261
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,810
Father, stop.

262
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,150
These people have lost their homes.

263
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,211
This isn't the time.

264
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:43,616
Go...

265
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:45,643
Please?

266
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,087
Don't judge, or you, too, will be judged.

267
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:54,305
You, too.

268
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,512
Reverend...

269
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,612
Please, father.

270
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:00,323
No.

271
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:07,017
This is my church.

272
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:09,547
It's best you go.

273
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:33,831
Welcome back.

274
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,517
Well, if it ain't Mr. Ferguson.

275
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,388
Sad state of affairs right here.

276
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:51,874
You come here to gloat?

277
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,896
No. No, no.

278
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:57,030
I come to give you this.

279
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:02,492
Something to see you through
till you get back on your feet.

280
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,580
I don't think so.

281
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,903
Your husband ain't gonna approve?

282
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,399
No. I don't approve.

283
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,275
And why don't you save that money

284
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,234
for one of them fancy suits?

285
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:20,726
I was just trying to help.

286
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,043
A whole race of people will be wiped off

287
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:42,986
the face of the earth by this iron beast.

288
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:44,364
Perhaps.

289
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,270
Then again...

290
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,672
Maybe the sioux have a beast of their own.

291
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:57,022
Have you heard of the white
spirit, reverend Cole?

292
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,365
It's an old Indian legend.

293
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:04,331
Aye. Oh, it's more than a legend.

294
00:27:06,202 --> 00:27:09,005
Now is his season...

295
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,302
For the white spirit comes with the cold,

296
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:16,504
feasting on blood and human flesh,

297
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:20,542
leaving nothing but famine and
pestilence for his enemies.

298
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:23,657
And I look...

299
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,761
And behold the pale horse.

300
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:27,907
Nej.

301
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:30,773
Whose name...

302
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:35,529
It's his name that sat on him

303
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,702
was death.

304
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,499
And hell will follow with him.

305
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,263
"Revelation"?

306
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,678
Yeah.

307
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,674
Yes...

308
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:54,424
It will be apocalyptic.

309
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,606
Yeah.

310
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:59,558
Where a tide of blood will be unleashed.

311
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:01,130
Indian blood, no doubt.

312
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,381
Nej, nej, nej.

313
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:04,740
The white spirit will prevail.

314
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,442
I don't believe such things, Swede.

315
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:13,441
Ahh. All right.

316
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:17,486
May I show you something, then?

317
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:19,369
Heh.

318
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,535
What the...

319
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:37,143
I dug this up by the river side.

320
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,598
What in...

321
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,255
what in God's name is this?

322
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:48,084
There are more things in heaven and earth

323
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:52,406
than are dreamt of in your
philosophy, reverend Cole.

324
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:07,693

00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:24,322
I have a job for you.

340
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,360
I already got a job.

341
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,708
Have a drink.

342
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,146
I ain't drunk out of it if
that's what you're wondering.

343
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:05,630
What can I do for you?

344
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,871
I want you to...

345
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:24,728
Deal with the man who
killed the prostitute.

346
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,630
What you mean, "deal with"?

347
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:33,759
I want to be sure he never does it again.

348
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:37,115
Oh. You want me to give
him a good talking to.

349
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,273
You know that's not what I mean.

350
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,369
Then say it.

351
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,217
Mr. Ferguson.

352
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:47,314
Say it.

353
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:50,650
I want him punished.

354
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,038
I'm afraid I can't oblige
you on that, ma'am.

355
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:56,900
Fine.

356
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:04,184
I'll tell Eva that's what you said.

357
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,342
Eva?

358
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:07,806
Who do you think asked me to come here?

359
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:42,133
♪your iron horse is running ♪

360
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:49,131

362
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:57,942
I can't help wondering...

363
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:03,314
I haven't made a grave mistake.

364
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:08,237
I'm beginning to come around
to the same conclusion.

365
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:13,933
I think you should thank me.

366
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:19,625
I tell you what...

367
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:23,671
I'll say you're welcome.

368
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,739
I could always make you.

369
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:33,034
Nah, I don't think so.

370
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:52,713
You don't know a thing about me, Bohannon.

371
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:55,682
Well, I know...

372
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,076
I know you're the type of man

373
00:33:59,077 --> 00:34:01,601
that likes to do his dirty
work from a distance.

374
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,314
Not up close like this.

375
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,371
Who's the executioner now, huh?

376
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:17,725
Why don't you ask me for a stay, huh?

377
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:22,805
No.

378
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,345
Sometimes it seems...

379
00:35:00,784 --> 00:35:03,682
One has to make a deal with the devil.

380
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:21,548
Who's the devil in this deal, huh?

381
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:34,843
Oh.

382
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,041
Here you go.

383
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:10,896
Mornin'.

384
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,667
Something I can do for you?

385
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:15,900
Don't know.

386
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,656
Is there?

387
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:24,199
Maybe there is something you can do for me.

388
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,831
And what would that be?

389
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:30,585
I got me a whore that needs killing.

390
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,250
I can't help you.

391
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,498
I heard you can.

392
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,509
Heard you the last customer
that poor girl had

393
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,451
the night before she got beat to death.

394
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,605
You better watch yourself, boy.

395
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,510
The only thing worth less in
this town than a dead whore,

396
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:50,476
a nigger don't know his place.

397
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:54,752
So will you do it for me?

398
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,343
You know who I am?

399
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:00,385
Yes, sir.

400
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,902
Mr. schmidt, foreman of the railroad...

401
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:07,856
And whore killer.

402
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:13,431
I just need you to tell me you did it

403
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,065
before I shoot you in the gut.

404
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,255
You're not gonna shoot me.

405
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,000
Everybody would hear.

406
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,159
Yes, I killed the bitch.

407
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,044
You right.

408
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,221
I ain't gonna shoot you right now.

409
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:48,612
I like what you done with the place.

410
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:51,767
Like I said,

411
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:55,230
you have your work cut
out for you, Bohannon.

412
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:57,020
What's to keep me from lighting out of here

413
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:58,749
first chance I get, huh?

414
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,069
For a man like you,

415
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,767
his word is stronger than
any set of shackles.

416
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,476
But if I'm wrong,

417
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:11,407
I could always get him to shoot you.
