THE WILD WEST - S01E01

3
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,110
"THE NIGHT OF THE INFERNO"

4
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:16,937
<i>Gid' up, now, you!</i>

5
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,806
<i>Come on!</i>

6
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,502
You got somebody important
coming in, Lieutenant?

7
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,512
I wouldn't know.

8
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:37,152
It must be an important fellow
to get all this.

9
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,162
I wouldn't know!

10
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,779
You wouldn't know,
now, would you.

11
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,860
Hey, do you know...
Hey, watch that jug.

12
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,580
People around here
don't know nothing.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
Evenin'.

14
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:03,610
Well, what's your big secret?
You got a dead body coming?

15
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,722
You might call it that.

16
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,350
Yeah? Who is it?

17
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,750
Prisoner coming in on the train
is Captain James T. West.

18
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:22,560
That name mean anything to you?

19
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,960
<i>Nope.</i>

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,810
He's a renegade,
deserted the army.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,170
And, the army catched him
and killed him?

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,300
No, he ain't dead yet.

23
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,675
But he's sure going to be...

24
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,610
right after they hang him.

25
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,039
Move!

26
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,100
<i>You know what they're going
to do to you, mister?</i>

27
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,310
Hey, how about them boots?

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,750
You ain't going
to be needing them no more.

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,630
Open.

30
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
<i>Follow me.</i>

31
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,540
<i>Sir,</i>

32
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,290
<i>this is the man
we call Jim West.</i>

33
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,550
Good morning, President Grant.

34
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,660
It's good to see you, West.

35
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,290
I'm sorry we had
to rough you up a little.

36
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,090
It's all right, sir.
It was an effective cover.

37
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,220
<i>Good...</i>

38
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,530
because we need you again.

39
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,150
You're the finest underground
intelligence officer we have,

40
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,520
and I'm going to lay it right
on the line with you, boy.

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,600
This nation's
in a pot of trouble.

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,810
Inflation eating
the South alive.

43
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,680
Washington...

44
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,550
Washington crawling
with carpetbaggers,

45
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,050
jackals just gathering
for the kill.

46
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,560
And now...

47
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,770
...now new trouble.

48
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,750
Colonel Shear will brief you.

49
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,830
<i>Southwest Territory,</i>

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,790
<i>Santa Fe.</i>

51
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:19,580
Sangre de Cristos.

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,830
The Adelanto Valley.

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,490
It's a good 2,500 miles.

54
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,010
We're going to get you there
right away.

55
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:26,920
<i>How?</i>

56
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,729
Well, we brought you
back to Washington

57
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:32,070
disguised as a deserter headed
for the gallows.

58
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,090
So I leave in a pine box?

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
Nothing like that, Jim.

60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,436
We're taking you out of the
capital in the grand manner

61
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,980
to which you have
become accustomed.

62
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,320
- The train.
- Right.

63
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,810
You're posing as the dandiest dude
that ever crossed the Mississippi

64
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,110
in his private railroad car.

65
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,490
You're going to give me
the train?

66
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,800
Now, let's say
it's a long-term government loan,

67
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,230
<i>but as far as the outside world
is concerned,</i>

68
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,930
it's the sole property
of Jim West,

69
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,150
big spender from the East.

70
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,810
You know, Colonel,
I like the sound of that.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,340
About six months ago,

72
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,280
a series of guerrilla raids
broke out in this area here.

73
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:17,700
Now, this is new territory
we can hardly hold by a thread.

74
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,070
The guerrillas are organized,
methodical, ruthless.

75
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,620
But you can't send
the army in.

76
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,618
That's true, Jim...

77
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,230
Now, that would
precipitate a war,

78
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,590
but an undercover man
might be able to get in there.

79
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,841
A fancy dude with, um...
a private car?

80
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,680
That's right, Jim.

81
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:42,380
Now, there's a certain pattern
to these raids,

82
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,140
starting here, then
here, then here,

83
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,010
like the spokes
on a wheel.

84
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,260
And the hub of that wheel
is a town called Quemada.

85
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:54,650
Quemada?

86
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,890
Who's leading the guerrillas?

87
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:00,400
A vicious, sadistic, very
clever predatory beast

88
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,430
<i>named Juan Manolo.</i>

89
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,400
Don't leave anyone alive!

90
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,730
Let nobody live in this town!

91
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,120
Yeah, that's right,
burn their houses!

92
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,570
They will remember Manolo!

93
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,670
Yes, they will, yes, they will!

94
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,530
Hey, how about them boots?
You still got them boots?

95
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,520
Funny, Artie,
real funny.

96
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,960
Well, I got
a little bit carried away.

97
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,370
I got word to put myself,
the wagon and your horse

98
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:32,871
on a freight get out here,
and you'd brief me.

99
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:34,370
Now, what is
it this time?

100
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:35,910
Not it he...

101
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:38,400
Juan Manolo.
Ever hear of him?

102
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,870
Yeah, the name
gets bandied about

103
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,720
at funerals and such.

104
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:45,450
How about a town
called Quemada?

105
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,240
That's where they
usually hold the funerals.

106
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:51,320
Manolo sent word to the settlers
to leave in a week.

107
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,350
They didn't, so he sent his men in,
burned them out, hit and run.

108
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,560
They got the message.
They're leaving.

109
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,980
What's his hurry?

110
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,289
He's moving guns and supplies

111
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,702
out to his men
the day after tomorrow.

112
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,093
He's planning a revolution.

113
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:06,450
Now there are enough arms in
Quemada to start a war, a big war,

114
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:09,068
and we could lose most
of our western territories.

115
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,000
What's the job?

116
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,470
You find the supplies,
I find him

117
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,530
and bring him back to Washington
before the day after tomorrow.

118
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,330
And if you can't?

119
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,230
Then I'll have to kill him.

120
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:21,840
In Quemada?

121
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,510
I think I'll turn
this one down.

122
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,802
Artie, you can't
turn this one down.

123
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,280
You're under orders,
just like me.

124
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,780
Thank you, James.

125
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,720
Artie...

126
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,080
I wouldn't hit that one.

127
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:55,280
That's beautiful.

128
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,610
And this?

129
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,036
Not bad,
not bad at all,

130
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,610
but a gun barrel
would have been better.

131
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:08,870
The gun barrel's
in that one.

132
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll never learn.

133
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,630
- We'll go in town separately.
- Fine.

134
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:18,531
Thanks.

135
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:22,330
<i>Well, James...</i>

136
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,880
Quemada's a bad place, James.

137
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,840
Watch yourself.

138
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,920
You, too, Artemus.

139
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,590
Bye, Henry, Henrietta.

140
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:09,290
There is a band of color
which begins at your shoulders

141
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,800
and progressively repeats itself
layer after layer.

142
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,540
It is infinitely varied

143
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,360
and infinitely beautiful.

144
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,501
Take what you will
from the shelves,

145
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,240
the prices of the merchandise
are marked.

146
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,106
Perhaps there is something
I want to buy.

147
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,130
Information.

148
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,220
Let us go in.

149
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,027
My office is
more comfortable.

150
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,030
Something?

151
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,030
You're the biggest Chinese
I've ever seen.

152
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,050
We are a remarkably
versatile race.

153
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,440
A terrible weakness.

154
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,510
Would you care for a pipe?

155
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
No, no,
no thank you.

156
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,570
It is filled with joy.
A comfort in the face of disaster.

157
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,230
What happened here?

158
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:30,650
Someone seems to
have paid us a visit.

159
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,370
A Juan Manolo, perhaps?

160
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,120
Perhaps.

161
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,990
And now, Mister...

162
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,210
West.
James West.

163
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,540
I have a proposition for Mr. Manolo
which I think might interest him.

164
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,941
Should it interest him,
there would be

165
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,341
a generous percentage for you.

166
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,420
That is, if you take me to him.

167
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,988
It is said that the owner
of the Casa Estrella,

168
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,410
our local palais de chance,

169
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,080
is a friend of Mr. Manolo's.

170
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:56,380
She might be able to arrange
a meeting if you were very...

171
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:57,750
persuasive.

172
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:58,880
She?

173
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:01,180
Miss Lydia Monteran.

174
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,390
You know her.

175
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,810
I've had the pleasure.

176
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:09,000
Fortunately, the Casa Estrella
was also undamaged

177
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,650
in the recent raid.

178
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:13,920
- Fortunately.
- Should the meeting be arranged,

179
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:18,121
please give this to Mr. Manolo
with my compliments.

180
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,400
Why don't you take me to him?

181
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,930
Unfortunately, Mr. West, I am a
coward as well as a philosopher.

182
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,640
I will be satisfied
with a generous percentage.

183
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,630
Miss Monteran is considered
extremely beautiful...

184
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,768
although, I must confess
that, to the Oriental eye,

185
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:39,570
all Occidental women
tend to look alike.

186
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,630
I shall be at
the Casa Estrella, Mei Mei.

187
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:47,170
- My... housekeeper.
- Of course.

188
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,640
¿Con permiso, señor.

189
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Mr. West, do you by any chance
have a coin for this poor man?

190
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,020
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

191
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,520
Mr. Wing.

192
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,240
Come in, come in, sir.

193
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,884
We're not expecting
any patrons today, Mr. Wing,

194
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,220
but the salon
is always open to you.

195
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,350
Thank you, Paul, thank you.

196
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:04,560
I would first appreciate a word
with the lady of the house.

197
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,510
Be seated, gentlemen.
I will see what I can do.

198
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,229
Gambling is a passion
with me,

199
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:16,659
any kind... of gambling.

200
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,705
<i>Quite an establishment.</i>

201
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,450
<i>Watch the feather.
Watch the feather.</i>

202
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,959
I am told that every stone
in this building

203
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,730
was brought here
by freight wagon from Mexico.

204
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,010
It used to stand
in the plaza in Mexico City.

205
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,640
This way, gentlemen.

206
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,940
- About that little game, Paul?
- I will arrange it, Mr. Wing.

207
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,880
This way, please.

208
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,880
Mr. Wing, how pleasant
to see you again.

209
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,690
Miss Monteran.

210
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,494
I understand you know my friend,
Mr. James West.

211
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,930
He has a favor to ask of you.

212
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,640
Your servant, Miss Monteran.

213
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,450
Poor Mr. Wing.

214
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,350
I'm afraid we're not open for
business today, but perhaps...

215
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,440
Paul is arranging a little game,

216
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,290
gracious lady.

217
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,370
If you will excuse me.

218
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,840
You're looking
well, Jim.

219
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,860
And you as magnificent
as ever.

220
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,561
You may go, Bedford.

221
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,780
- I've missed you.
- And I missed you...

222
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,930
at the station in New Orleans.

223
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,940
I waited on that hard bench
for hours all alone.

224
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,380
That is, until the police came.

225
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,772
And I'd hoped you'd
forgotten about that.

226
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:46,916
No, I haven't forgotten
about that.

227
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,850
$22,512

228
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,120
that's what that little affair
in New Orleans cost me.

229
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,370
But it wasn't
your money.

230
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,352
But it was... till you
made me give it back.

231
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,090
This a business call?

232
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,350
That's what I thought.
What do you want this time?

233
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,570
I want to meet Juan Manolo.

234
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,305
- I never heard of him.
- You sure?

235
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,040
You can have this money
if I meet him.

236
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,194
You know what I think?

237
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:19,830
I think you'd better
leave my house.

238
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,220
Your house?

239
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:24,370
Some people think
it's Juan Manolo's house.

240
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,953
I'm going to count to three.

241
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:28,951
Is that thing loaded?

242
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,890
- One...
- Give me that.

243
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:32,900
Two...

244
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,620
You wouldn't shoot me.

245
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,421
Just you try me.

246
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,120
Three.

247
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,741
Colonel Shear, what
are you doing here?

248
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,940
President Grant
is worried about you.

249
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:18,920
Things are worse ten times bigger
than we thought they were.

250
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,060
The President is offering you
a chance to quit now

251
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,170
if you want to.

252
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,430
Sorry, Colonel. I'm staying.
I'm getting closer to the jackal.

253
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,680
Besides, there's a girl involved.
She used to be a friend.

254
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,927
The odds are
against you, West.

255
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:38,904
That's your choice,
you're on your own.

256
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,813
One thing more,
we never met here.

257
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,760
Any luck?

258
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,566
They're too frightened
to talk.

259
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,070
I can't say that I blame them.

260
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,178
You find out anything?

261
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:07,844
No, I've been through
the remains of every...

262
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,720
burned-out barn
and warehouse in the area, nothing.

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,082
Freight wagons keep coming in
and... going out.

264
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,460
<i>Come in where
and go out where?</i>

265
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:20,958
Come in the main road
and go out the... cemetery.

266
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,030
In the main road
and go out the cemetery?

267
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,140
Right.

268
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,400
- I'll meet you in an hour.
- Where?

269
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:30,100
At the cemetery,
it's out behind Lydia's place.

270
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,219
Bring an extra horse
in case we have

271
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,720
- to make a run for it.
- Yeah, right.

272
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,170
Jim?

273
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,405
What are you doing?

274
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:42,473
Trying to find out
why freight wagons

275
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,509
<i>are lighter after they pass
through the cemetery.</i>

276
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,277
A lot of wagons are lighter
after they pass through a cemetery.

277
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,413
Yeah, I know, Artie,
but freight wagons shouldn't be.

278
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:50,881
Well, how do you
know these are?

279
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:54,949
Wheel tracks. They're deeper coming
in than going out.

280
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,950
<i>You like this kind of work?
What are you looking for?</i>

281
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,390
<i>What are you
looking for now?</i>

282
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,100
<i>This.</i>

283
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,960
<i>There's oil
on these hinges.</i>

284
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,680
See anyone you know?

285
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,730
Yeah, the one with
the blue eyes looks familiar.

286
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,110
Cozy little place,
isn't it?

287
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,620
<i>Bring the lamp.</i>

288
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,600
Whiskey, whiskey
everywhere?

289
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,490
Gunpowder.

290
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,040
<i>Gunpowder, grenades.
Every barrel is loaded with them.</i>

291
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,790
Artie, later.

292
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,860
<i>Watch the feather.</i>

293
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,190
This one's all mine.

294
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:09,230
Fine. I'll see you
at the wagon.

295
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,550
What are you doing here?
Where is he?

296
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,265
You know, all I have to do
is pull that cord...

297
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,301
And Juan Manolo appears
or maybe he doesn't appear.

298
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:47,511
Maybe he's
here already.

299
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:49,677
If he were, you wouldn't
live very long.

300
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,881
- Now, will you get out of here?
- No.

301
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,407
I warned you.

302
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,768
Lydia, you surprise me.

303
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,378
I knew you'd do a lot for money,

304
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,276
but I'd thought you'd
draw the line at murder.

305
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:03,201
What do you mean,
murder?

306
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:06,318
These innocent people,
the town you helped destroy.

307
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,477
I don't know what
you're talking about.

308
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:09,787
You're a liar.

309
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,543
- Is there a Juan Manolo?
- Yes.

310
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:14,248
- Are you his partner?
- No.

311
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,239
Tell me why his supplies
are in your cellar

312
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:17,517
with your name on them.

313
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,813
I don't know what
you're talking about.

314
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:21,609
There's nothing in
my cellar but wine.

315
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:26,276
Tell me that when you see
his hidden munitions.

316
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:32,070
Are you going to walk
or do I drag you?

317
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:43,030
See? I told you,
nothing but wine.

318
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:46,020
Jim! Jim!
What...

319
00:29:47,238 --> 00:29:50,065
<i>Must be convenient to live
right above your own arsenal.</i>

320
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,130
Now, tell me
you didn't know about this.

321
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,930
No, señor.

322
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,160
She didn't.

323
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,440
<i>¿No entiende, amigo?
You don't understand?</i>

324
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,631
This is a private wine cellar.

325
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,270
Private stock.

326
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,200
Perhaps you would like
a sample of this wine?

327
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,359
It's nice, rich
red wine.

328
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,730
You know, you have
a friend in this pueblo.

329
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:56,220
A most uncooperative man...

330
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,450
and very dead one.

331
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,425
Perhaps you will
be more cooperative

332
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,100
and tell us just what
it is you want here.

333
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,742
What are you going
to do with the girl?

334
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,720
When you talk,
I will decide!

335
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:09,790
When you decide, I'll talk.

336
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:12,750
You like some
more wine?!

337
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,950
Search him!

338
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,930
Something.
You have something else?

339
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,602
That's a good exchange, gringo...
weapons for wine.

340
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,870
Something else?

341
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:37,950
What do you have?
Something else? What is it...

342
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,510
What is this?
Look at what the gringo have.

343
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,100
All right,
loosen his tongue!

344
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:52,678
<i>I regret this incident.</i>

345
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:57,616
It was a pleasant diversion

346
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:00,998
from this serious business
of war, you know?

347
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:05,729
Move the queen three blocks
that way.

348
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,935
Good...

349
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,950
For that is what it is
going to be, American, war.

350
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,090
Not a revolution.

351
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,530
This territory was taken
by the Americans by force,

352
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,219
and I propose to take it back
the same way.

353
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,450
And when I am finished,

354
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,220
- I have plans.
- What plans?

355
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:28,220
What plans?

356
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,536
What plans?
Big ones!

357
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:36,531
When I get through,
the whole world will know my name.

358
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,140
I will have the world
in the palm of my hand!

359
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:41,110
I will be number one!

360
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,250
You stand at attention
when I get up!

361
00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:59,350
Good.

362
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,440
You come with me,

363
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,020
and you two remain
with our guest.

364
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:13,021
It will take me some time to decide
what is to be done with him.

365
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,910
Let the girl stay where she is.
She can wait...

366
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,270
until I decide
what is to be done with him.

367
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,740
It might be, poetic justice
to have a double execution.

368
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,090
You might as well
give up the game, señor.

369
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:41,790
I have you checkmated
in 14 moves.

370
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:55,820
- Jim?
- Lydia, I'm sorry for this.

371
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,650
Forget it.
How do we get out of here?

372
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,450
Where are the guards?

373
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
One's on the other
side of the room,

374
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,070
the other one's
on the steps.

375
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,770
Keep watching them.

376
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,990
Tell me if they move.

377
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:52,750
Are the guards
in the same place?

378
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,970
Come here.

379
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,460
- What's that?
- It's a smoke bomb.

380
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:22,790
Just stay right there.

381
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,610
Excuse me.

382
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,818
<i>Downstairs, move!</i>

383
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,959
Artie, the handcuffs
are in the cell.

384
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,920
I underestimated you,
Mr. West.

385
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,650
So you did.

386
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,840
I have men up there!

387
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:26,280
If you hurt me,
it will take you a week to die.

388
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,480
Yeah, sure,
sure, sure.

389
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,350
- Can you handle him?
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

390
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,135
Maybe I ought to throw
him in the pit

391
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:33,890
with some of his little friends.

392
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:36,090
<i>He'd probably
poison them.</i>

393
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,080
Hey, do you have to do that?

394
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,320
<i>By some unhappy
coincidence,</i>

395
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,320
every time I run into you
I lose something.

396
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:14,733
Last time it was money, now it's
the only house I ever owned.

397
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,668
Get him out of here.
Put him on a horse.

398
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:19,594
Move!

399
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,130
- Artie, take care of her.
- Right.

400
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,630
<i>I got to get him out of here
before his friends come looking.</i>

401
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:37,890
They will,
and when they do...

402
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,000
See you on the train.
Let's move.

403
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,585
In your country, this is
how you treat an officer?

404
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,294
You wanted the world?
Here.

405
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,181
Good evening, Mr. West.

406
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:51,310
Take these off.
In good time.

407
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:54,460
I want to...!
In good time.

408
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,580
I've been expecting you,
Mr. Manolo.

409
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,989
Fascinating.

410
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,695
- How?
- The cards.

411
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:07,339
The one you gave me,
the one you sent him.

412
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:08,680
There was only one man

413
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:12,501
important enough to send for him
when he was... busy.

414
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,750
Perhaps an introduction
is in order.

415
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:21,330
Mr. James West, General Andreas
de la Torres Cassinello,

416
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,070
<i>an ex-employee
of mine.</i>

417
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,850
What do you mean?

418
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,810
<i>I fear you have been
very stupid, General</i>

419
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,310
very stupid, indeed

420
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,934
and you are
no longer useful

421
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:34,768
now that our little
masquerade has ended.

422
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,600
<i>And see that the engine crew
is well taken care of.</i>

423
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,190
It is true, I am Juan Manolo.

424
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,946
Or Huan Man-Lo, to use
the Mandarin pronunciation.

425
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:53,070
I fear the general
has fallen from the train.

426
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,810
- All right, sit down!
- You better do it, Kelly.

427
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:02,050
Mr. West, I must confess, I am
impressed with your ability.

428
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,056
For this reason I am reluctant
to remove you

429
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,788
before we conclude
the conversation

430
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,524
which you intended
to have with me originally.

431
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,960
I came to Quemada
to make a deal with you.

432
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,521
I still want to make that deal.

433
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,792
What did you intend
to get from me?

434
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,470
<i>Partnership.</i>

435
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:22,410
Not an equal partnership.
I just want 25%.

436
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,981
And what did you intend to give
for this share?

437
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,770
May I?

438
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:32,666
Make no sudden movement
of any kind.

439
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,220
This is just a sample.

440
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,129
<i>I know where
there's $250,000 more,</i>

441
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:54,830
and I'm prepared

442
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,570
to turn it over to you
on one condition.

443
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,370
You're hardly in a position
to make conditions.

444
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:01,661
I can make a condition about this.
If you want the money,

445
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,442
you do business on my terms
or not at all,

446
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:04,718
and I won't talk
in front of them.

447
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:09,021
We talk, we talk privately
or you can go ahead and kill me.

448
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:15,380
I find you very amusing,
Mr. West.

449
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,980
<i>Wait on the platform.</i>

450
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,480
When Mr. West's friend,
Mr. Gordon, arrives,

451
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:30,480
kill him.

452
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,880
And the girl.

453
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,002
It's all right, Joseph,
I am armed.

454
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,280
This is quite a useful
base of operations.

455
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,828
I will enjoy it
after you are gone.

456
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:46,280
A week after we sign
our partnership,

457
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,767
I'll deliver $250,000 to you.

458
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:52,598
If you kill me, you won't get it.
Now, you've lost your general.

459
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:54,723
You need a front man,
a second in command.

460
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:56,133
That's the job I want.

461
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:59,819
I'm a trained cavalry officer
with ten years of top experience.

462
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,690
Mr. West,
I admire you very much.

463
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,490
You are a true gambler.

464
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,944
Perhaps I should
wait a little

465
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,490
and see if you can deliver
what you say you can.

466
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:15,626
What about Gordon and the girl?

467
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:20,830
Sorry, they have already caused
me a great deal of difficulty,

468
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:22,531
and they must pay for that.

469
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,600
As must you, if you...
fail in your commitment.

470
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,411
Quite an ingenious
arrangement.

471
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,684
- And do you play?
- I enjoy it.

472
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,259
Do you bet when you play?

473
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,600
Always.
A terrible, terrible weakness.

474
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:45,500
You are very good indeed,
unless that was an accident.

475
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:49,211
- I'll make a bet with you.
- Have you anything left to risk?

476
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,800
I own the title to this car.
I'll sign it over to you if I lose.

477
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,400
If I win, you don't kill Gordon
and the girl.

478
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,390
Why do I need the title
to this car?

479
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,776
I could simply take it.

480
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:01,090
You might be able to take it,
but you couldn't use it.

481
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,599
Not on any railroad line
in the United States.

482
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,990
Without the title,
they won't let you on the track.

483
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,210
I will say this
for you, Mr. West

484
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,338
you have considerable style.

485
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,113
Shall we say a short game?

486
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,810
13 points.

487
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:23,915
My car against Gordon
and the girl.

488
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,610
Trouble.

489
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:48,460
How do you know?

490
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,962
The light at the end of the car
it isn't lit,

491
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:51,063
and it should be.

492
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:52,762
It's a signal.

493
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,943
Something wrong, Mr. West?

494
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,410
No.

495
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,010
Don't bother, Mr. West.

496
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,320
I concede.

497
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,435
I may miss.

498
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:42,020
You may.

499
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,220
But I won't.

500
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:52,920
<i>Ahora... sabe usted
la verdad de mi, señor.</i>

501
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:55,420
Why, Manolo? Why?

502
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,020
Our revolution

503
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,520
must spring unexpectedly.

504
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,106
Who would suspect
a Chinese merchant

505
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:06,208
of being a leader of armies

506
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:10,681
Like I said before, one would
suspect such a big Chinese.

507
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,256
So you did... so you did.

508
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,976
What about the girl?
What does she know about this?

509
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,030
Nothing.

510
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,719
She was permitted to operate
the gambling palace, no more.

511
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:32,911
And... so I die,
and an invasion dies with me.

512
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,810
For you, West, you get nothing.

513
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,379
You're a fool!

514
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,128
Well, let's say I'm buying a stake
in the future for a lot of people.

515
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,140
You're a hero, señor.

516
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,823
But who will know that?

517
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,443
What's it matter?

518
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,440
Artie, is this
the best you can do?

519
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,640
That's the best $1.98 gown
made in Chicago.

520
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,350
Lydia.

521
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,970
Come here.

522
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,740
You know what?
You're perfect.

523
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,850
Takes talent. Some people have it,
some people don't.

524
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,340
- Champagne?
- Yes, indeed.

525
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:41,540
Why didn't you tell me
you'd owned one of these?

526
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:43,850
We don't.
It belongs to a friend.

527
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,450
- What's your friend's name?
- Sam.

528
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,908
- Sam?
- Sam.

529
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,281
I'd like to meet Sam.
He must be very rich.

530
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:55,927
He is, but he's got
a lot of expenses.

531
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,850
Poor Sam.

532
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:19,216
