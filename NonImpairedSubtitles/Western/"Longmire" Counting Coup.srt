00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,707
We have to go to the courthouse.

165
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,907
- They're trying to advance our trial date.
- To when?

166
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,846
To two weeks from today, and
we are nowhere near ready.

167
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:01,908
I've never heard of a trial
date being advanced that much.

168
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,940
Hey. Hey.

169
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,174
It's gonna be okay.

170
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,174
We're gonna get a continuance.

171
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,408
I know you will.

172
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,007
Walter.

173
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:30,273
Just... please don't say it.

174
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:34,141
I understand I, uh... I overreacted.

175
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,107
I'm angry with myself.

176
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,873
All the signs were there

177
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:43,140
that, uh... Branch wasn't okay.

178
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,040
He wasn't ready to come back.

179
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,873
I should've forced him
to take some time off,

180
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:52,107
but, uh... instead,

181
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,306
I gave him just enough
rope to hang himself.

182
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,673
All you did was treat Branch

183
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,140
the way you would want to be treated.

184
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,573
Problem is, he's not you.

185
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,840
What's that?

186
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,575
Well, it's something to
take your mind off Branch.

187
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:10,807
It's from Vic's husband.

188
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,807
From Sean?

189
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:15,707
Yep.

190
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,375
[Sighs]

191
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:22,389
Why would he send these to me?

192
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,174
Why do you think? [Chuckles]

193
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:30,296
He wants you to deliver
divorce papers to his wife.

194
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:33,873
Branch: Walt! Walt!

195
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,958
Where's Walt?!

196
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,339
Walt! Walt!

197
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,306
I found Ridges. He's alive.

198
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,040
He's alive. He called my phone.

199
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,647
Just... just slow down. Where you been?

200
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,907
He... he was on Pike's Bridge.

201
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,640
I-I tried to bring him in,
but he jumped in the river.

202
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,273
I followed him on the
road as long as I could,

203
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,707
but then the river, you know,

204
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,815
it turns away from the road into the woods.

205
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:53,875
Walt: Just stop, Branch.

206
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,540
Came back here for ammunition and backup.

207
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,494
I figure Ferg and me could lock down...

208
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,534
one side of the river bank.

209
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,809
Vic could cover the other.

210
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,477
First, we need to talk about
what you did to Sam Poteet.

211
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,567
You just couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

212
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,063
Don't you dare put this on me.

213
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,634
I'm not the one who decided
to go bat-shit crazy.

214
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,067
[Shouts]

215
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:18,801
- Hey, get off her!
- Get off her!

216
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,901
Get off her!

217

[Both grunting]

00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,435
Get the key, Ferg!

219
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,768
- Quick!
- [Shouts]

220
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,101
What are you doing?

221
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:42,035
Ridges. He's alive.

222
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,772
I'm gonna head over to see Nighthorse.

223
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,339
When he hears that, uh,
Ridges has been spotted,

224
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,005
he, uh... he might be ready to talk.

225
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,239
You really believe what Branch was saying?

226
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,872
Take a look at him, Walt.
The guy is messed up.

227
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,172
Maybe so.

228
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:14,272
But just because Branch
isn't right in the head

229
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:17,073
doesn't mean he's not right.

230
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,061
- So, what are we supposed to do with him?
- I don't know.

231
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,502
Walt just went to go see Nighthorse.

232
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,938
You don't have to whisper.

233
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,039
Some of us are trying to work.

234
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,786
I understand why you had to tell Walt.

235
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,786
I want you to know there
are no hard feelings.

236
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:45,053
[Laughs] Speak for yourself.

237
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,553
Look, Vic, Ridges is still out there.

238
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,052
His car's on the bridge.

239
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,706
If you would just go out there, please.

240
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,482
Look, I don't know what your deal is,

241
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,966
but I know that I am not driving
all the way out to Pike's Bridge

242
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,727
just to find out that
the car has disappeared

243
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,754
like every other piece
of evidence about Ridges!

244
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,921
[Keys jingling]

245
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,252
The car's still there.

246
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,152
I took his keys out of the ignition.

247
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:23,319
Now, you can stand there
and just say that I'm crazy,

248
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,286
but later, you'll have to explain to Walt

249
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:31,386
how you could have caught
the guy who shot me,

250
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:34,820
but you just... let him go.

251
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,386
I can go check it out.

252
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:41,086
No, I'll go.

253
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,320
Anything to get me out of here.

254
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:52,453
Let me out and I'll come with you.

255
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,453
We can track him down together.

256
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,554
Not a chance.

[Echoing] Nighthorse!

260
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:13,952
We need to talk.

261
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,320
You'll have to come up here, then.

262
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,686
Nighthorse: Very busy day today.

263
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,419
We're about to finish phase
three of our construction.

264
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,186
Walt: I'll make this quick, then.

265
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,753
It's time you admitted you
lied to me about David Ridges.

266
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:30,753
Seriously, again with this?

267
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,619
It's getting boring, Walt.

268
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,885
I got hard evidence that Ridges is alive.

269
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,453
One of my deputies saw
him, even talked to him.

270
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,053
Really?

271
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,086
This wouldn't be the same Deputy

272
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,720
who recently kidnapped a good Cheyenne man

273
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,219
and force-fed him peyote?

274
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,619
Where did you hear that?

275
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,554
Word gets around.

276
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,252
So it looks like

277
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,619
all you really have to
prove that David is alive

278
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,286
is the word of an obviously
unstable criminal, really.

279
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,386
I wouldn't call that hard evidence, Walt.

280
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,919
Now, this game you're playing
with discrediting Branch...

281
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,653
having him drugged with peyote,

282
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,152
sending Ridges in to mess with his head...

283
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,186
this ain't gonna work much longer.

284
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,519
I know you lied to me about Ridges.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,252
He is alive.

286
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:31,120
And it's only a matter
of time before I prove it.

Open that cell. Release my son.

until Walt gives the okay.

that roofing business?

Because I swear to you, if
you don't open that cell,

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,653
your father will never get
another construction job

- You can't do that.
- Try me.

00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,386
Your honor, the state's request
to advance our trial date

303
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,319
is completely out of line. This is nothing

304
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,419
but the Prosecution's
attempt to derail our case.

305
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,852
You don't need to get
emotional, Miss Longmire.

306
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,486
The state has a valid reason

307
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,686
for requesting that the date be moved.

308
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,353
- Which is?
- Witness availability.

309
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,952
Our key witness, Detective Fales,

310
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,754
leaves the state in a month's time.

311
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,219
We need to hold the trial before
then in order to get his testimony.

312
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,553
Your honor, the D.A.'s office

313
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:43,386
could easily record Fales' testimony.

314
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,686
Well, you might find it hard

315
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,553
to cross-examine a video, Counselor.

316
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:51,619
Well, the state's request for
an earlier trial date is granted.

317
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,919
Well, in that case, we'd like to
formally file for a continuance.

318
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,353
There's no reason this case
even needs to go to trial.

319
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,319
We'd be more than happy to make a deal.

320
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,353
Under what terms?

321
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:00,619
Your client pleads guilty,

322
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,353
we take the death penalty off the table.

323
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,252
We can offer a life sentence

324

There is nothing to discuss.

328
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,885
That deal is not an option.

329

It is an option. Your only one, actually.

planning on presenting in court?</i>

332
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,391
What we talked about...

333
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,893
that Malachi hired Darius
Burns to kill Miller Beck.

334
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:25,941
No, you have no proof

335
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,026
that Darius even has
a connection with Beck.

I hate to say it, Cady,
but you've got nothing.

Where's Branch?

341
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:08,060
I got him a burrito.

342
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,161
His dad came and picked him up.

343
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:15,527
How did Barlow even know he was here?

344
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,527
Well, everyone we arrest is
allowed to make a phone call,

345
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:21,060
and technically, we never arrested Branch.

346
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,588
And Vic didn't file a complaint,

347
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,893
and you said that Sam Poteet guy

348
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,117
wasn't pressing charges,

349
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:26,627
so we had nothing to hold him on.

350
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:27,660
He assaulted an officer.

351
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,761
So did you.

352
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:32,660
I'm sorry.

00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,494
I'm sorry.

- What?

Barlow threatened my dad, Walt.

358
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,026
Where was Vic during all this?

359
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,060
She left before it all happened.

360
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,694
She went to check out that car

361
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,962
that Ridges' abandoned on Pike's Bridge.

362
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:11,560
We have an unstable, violent cop

363
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,960
and the person who told on him,

364
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:17,193
both out there right now.

365
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,962
Does Vic know Branch is out?

366
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,962
No.

367
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,254
Walt, what's wrong?

368
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:57,121
Barlow managed to get Branch
released while I was out.

369
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:59,787
I thought, uh...

370
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,588
I thought Branch may come after you, so...

371
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,820
You get rid of one stalker,
here comes another one.

372
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,254
I wouldn't let that happen.

373
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,987
But, uh, still, with Branch out,

stayed home with you, so...

376
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:22,688
Well, I didn't know if
he was traveling, so...

377
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,621
- No, he's around.
- Okay.

Okay, good.

So, how did it go with Nighthorse?

381
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:36,087
Well, he's sticking with his story.

382
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,854
Well, a ghost didn't drive this car, so...

383

Walt: Huh.

384

Even though I know he's lying,

385
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,920
we still can't prove that Ridges is alive

The history on this phone

389
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:52,288
says that Ridges did call Branch.

390

But he also called someone else.

but frankly, I don't care.

The way I see it, there
are two possibilities.

410
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,721
Either you're imagining all this,

411
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,087
in which case your
judgment can't be trusted,

412
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,154
or this David Ridges is still alive

you good money for it.

David stole some blood that
he'd donated at the Res Clinic

501

After it was done, he promised
me that he would leave Wyoming.

But David didn't go.

the... the... the crazy

I thought all of that was him
just trying to sell his story.

But after he killed Hector,

508
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:11,576
I realized that David actually
believes in it... all of it.

509
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:14,909
He's convinced that he's
a time-traveling spirit,

enough to touch a living enemy

it, but David no longer listens.

You didn't think Ridges
was capable of all this?

00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,313
I got some time on my hands.

651
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,046
[Voice breaking] Okay.

652
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,046
I warned you what would happen

653
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,313
if Walt found out about Sam Poteet.

654
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:08,146
Look, I... I'm sorry. I had to tell Walt.

655
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:12,380
I-I-I can't take that back.
Think about this, Branch.

656
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,680
If I turn up murdered,

657
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:17,779
you're the first person
that Walt's gonna suspect.

658
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,313
I don't care what Walt thinks anymore.

659
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:22,313
Please don't kill me, Branch.

660
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:25,413
It's not much fun when the
barrel's pointed at you, is it?

661
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,213
Don't worry, Travis.

662
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:30,463
I'm not gonna waste a shell on you.

663
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:31,944
But you're gonna have to do something

664
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:34,313
- to make this all up to me.
- What?

665
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:36,347
Give me the keys to your car.

666
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,648
Okay.

667
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:42,980
Here.

00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:05,447
What is it, Ferg?

672
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,647
<i>Looks like Branch took
off from his dad's house.</i>

673
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:09,013
Travis Murphy just called

674
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:10,813
and said Branch held him up with a shotgun

675
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:12,547
at the gas station and took his car.

676
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:14,746
<i>Travis says he has no
idea where Branch went.</i>

677
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:16,247
Where's Vic?

678
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:18,447
She locked herself inside of your office.

679
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:19,614
Well, keep her there.

680
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:21,080
Where are you right now?

681
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:23,547
I'm heading out to Horse Creek.

682
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:26,080
There's a medicine woman
who's got a trailer there.

According to Nighthorse,

684
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:30,146
Ridges' got pretty banged up
when he jumped in the river.

685
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:31,547
He went there to get patched up.

686
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,714
You want some backup?

687
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:35,879
Yeah, but under the circumstances,

688
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,447
you should stay there, watch out for Vic.

689
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:41,180
Lock all the doors in case Branch shows up.

Turn towards me slowly.

What do you want?

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,822
I'm looking for David Ridges.
