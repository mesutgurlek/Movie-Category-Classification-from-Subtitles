Why do you stop me?

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,994
Because I do not want to pay
for the stupidity of my brother.

Only you think it is stupid
to kill the white man.

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,001
I know that if you scalp
a white man,

13
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,903
the Bannocks will be blamed.

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,571
But we must kill them.

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,872
And drive them out.

16
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,541
No, Lagos.

17
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,776
They are too many and too wise.

18
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,145
We'll never drive them out.

19
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,448
I don't like them
any better than you do.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,050
But we have to learn
to live with them.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,042
You talk like a woman.

22
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:33,059
All right, brother,
soon-to-be chief of my people,

23
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,564
you handle the white man
your way, I'll handle him mine.

24
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,557
You make me ashamed
to call you brother.

(theme song playing)

26
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,570
I'm glad you brought him here.

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,506
You remembered what I read to
you about "love thy neighbor."

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,840
I had to, when I found
he was still alive.

29
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,404
I couldn't let even a white man
to die in the sun.

30
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,319
I'm glad he lives.

31
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,921
I'm not sure I am.

32
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,480
(horse approaching, neighing)

33
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,069
So, you would rather
leave our village

34
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,071
and live here like an outcast.

35
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,173
What are you doing here, Lagos?

36
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,477
You should never have taken that
Shoshone woman as your wife.

37
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,146
You, too, are
the son of a chief.

38
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,814
Your place is with your people.

39
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,816
My people turned me away.

40
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,618
This is my home now.

41
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,587
Did you move the body
of the white man

42
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,588
I killed this afternoon?

43
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,089
No.

44
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,091
I did not move him.

45
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,292
Why?

46
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,994
I went back to take the scalp

47
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,963
so I could give it
to our father.

48
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,698
This one would
have made him proud.

49
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,101
You would say the same
about any white man's scalp.

50
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,937
LAGOS:
That was not <i>any</i> white man.

51
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,906
That was the owner
of all this land

52
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,397
that once belonged
to our people.

53
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,947
You mean, the white man
whose scalp I saved

54
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,984
is the owner of the range
called the Ponderosa?

55
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,714
That is what I mean.

56
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,923
I left the white man
where he fell.

57
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,731
I know this kind of woman.

58
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,500
If the white man lived,
she would have you take him.

59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,833
You might even
have brought him here.

60
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,934
I will look inside,
to make sure.

61
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,976
This is my place.

62
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,812
I say there is
no white man inside.

63
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,414
You will not look.

64
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,583
HATOYA:
I'm sorry you visit our home

65
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,184
only on such an errand.

66
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,253
There is no white man here.

67
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,057
I believe you even less
than I believe my brother.

68
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,958
You'd better leave.

69
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,930
Now, Lagos.

70
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,907
(hoofbeats receding)

71
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,912
He is still bleeding.

72
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,915
Will you change the bandage
while I get some fresh water?

73
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,583
No.

74
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,916
I can't touch him now.

75
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,092
Stop that.

76
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,084
You've done enough.

77
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,043
Our father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

78
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,745
That's enough!

79
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,448
...thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

80
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,950
on earth as it is in Heaven.

81
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,653
Well, Pa ain't setting traps
at <i>this</i> hour.

82
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,589
Don't worry about Pa--
he can take care of himself.

83
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,058
Yeah, well, he's gone
awful close to Bannock country.

84
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,228
Yeah, and them Indians have been
acting up out there lately, too.

85
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,030
Well, they're
getting hungry, Hoss.

86
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,065
Can't hardly grow anything
up in those mountains.

87
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,700
Hunting gets worse every year.

88
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,336
Pa doesn't go into
Bannock country by himself.

89
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,105
Yeah, but...
Adam, our property runs

90
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,674
right up there in them
foothills--that's pretty close.

91
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,876
Well, he took
his blankets with him.

92
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,544
Maybe he's gonna
sleep overnight.

93
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,536
(horse approaching)

94
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,553
Hi, Ike.

95
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,155
Howdy, boys.
Where's your pa?

96
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,257
HOSS: You're up sort of late,
ain't you, Ike?

97
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,658
What do you want with Pa?

98
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,293
I, uh, I brung him a present.

99
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,162
I've got something
to talk to him about

100
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,498
that I figure won't keep
much longer--where is he?

101
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,000
ADAM: Well, you must have just
missed him on the way over.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,236
He, uh, he's been out setting
traps in that foothill country

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,538
right near your place--
we expect him back any minute.

104
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,975
Dad-gumit! If I'd have known
he was going out that way,

105
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,843
I could've saved
myself the trip.

106
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,945
Yeah, what'd you bring him?

107
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,347
Well, uh... let me show you boys
while we're waiting here.

108
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,721
Where'd you get that?

109
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,290
Turned it up with my plow
just yesterday.

110
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,292
It's an Injun skull.

111
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,294
That must be 200 years old.

112
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,730
Yeah. They show up
every once in a while

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,598
all over the valley.

114
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,600
Guess there's
no question about...

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,069
who originally
lived on this land.

116
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,572
That was then, not now.

117
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,474
How come you'd bring it to Pa?

118
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,110
I can't figure him wanting
a human skull around the place.

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,078
Who said anything
about a <i>human</i> skull.

120
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,713
That's an Injun skull!

121
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,915
(laughs)

122
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,384
Ike, I wouldn't, uh,
use those words with Pa.

123
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,020
You, uh, you know how
he feels on the subject.

124
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,456
Yeah, well, he knows
how I feel about it, too!

125
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,158
I got no kick about Injuns
rolling around under my land,

126
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,293
but I'll be dad-burned

127
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,962
if I want any live ones
squatting on top of it!

128
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,664
Your land?

129
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,299
Yeah, my land!

130
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,668
Your pa give it to me
to homestead.

131
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,870
Now, Ike, I don't think
there are any Indians

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,605
living on your land.

133
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,642
Well, they're...
awful durn close to it, anyhow!

134
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,778
Your pa's got to do
something about it.

135
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,780
(sighs) We'll give him
your message, Ike.

136
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,249
No, Hoss, I'll give it
to him myself.

137
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,751
I'll, uh, set with you fellas
for a while

138
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,953
and, uh, wait for him.

139
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,454
All right, you can set a while,

140
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,156
but no more talk
about Indians, all right?

141
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,682
Suit yourself.

142
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,028
Now, Ike, it's liable
to be a long wait.

143
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,131
As a matter of fact,
it may be all night.

144
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,429
(quietly):
Oh.

145
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,698
If it is, you can sleep
in the bunkhouse. (sighs)

146
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,140
And I think
we can do without this.

00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,446
But I did not try to kill you.

163
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,448
- Perhaps I should have.
- Matsou.

164
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,318
(panting):
I... I didn't...

165
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,289
I didn't mean to accuse you.

166
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,825
I know you've...

167
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,161
you've cared for me.

168
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,664
I'm grateful for your help.

169
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,501
You would have died if he
had left you where you fell.

170
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,470
What is this place?

171
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,938
Where are we?

172
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,307
This place is on your land.

173
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,243
No villages or settlements...

174
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,479
Indian villages on my land.

175
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,514
This is not a village.

176
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,616
Hatoya and I live here alone.

177
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,285
Why are you not
with your village?

178
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,956
I am a Bannock;
she's a Shoshone.

179
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,859
When we married,
neither tribe would accept us.

180
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,962
Where did you find out
about the Bible?

181
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,432
I lived with a man of God
and his wife for three years,

182
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,535
in a white man's town
to the west.

183
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,804
Then I met Matsou.

184
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,372
And we will stay together,

185
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,142
no matter how many times
we have to move.

186
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,910
Who said...

187
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,146
said anything about moving?

188
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,649
We do not stay
where we are not welcome.

189
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,251
BEN:
You are...

190
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,920
you are welcome.

191
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,323
We would still be intruders
on white man's land.

192
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,660
You'd not be intruders...

193
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,630
if I gave you land.

194
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,369
You would give land
to a Bannock?

195
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,964
If you came in peace.

196
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,502
Our people have not signed
a white man's peace treaty.

197
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,082
Put me on my horse, and...

198
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,485
I'll... I'll try
to find my way home.

199
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,512
You are not
well enough yet to travel.

200
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,948
I must, I must,
I must get to a doctor.

201
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,463
We will get him home.

202
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,003
It will take all of God's help.

203
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:22,441
All right, Hatoya,
I'll hold him on his horse.

204
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,069
You pray.

205
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,854
LITTLE JOE:
Pa!

206
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,322
- What happened?
- Where'd you find him?

207
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,190
MATSOU:
He will need a doctor quickly.

208
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,852
He's badly hurt.

209
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,728
Come inside, both of you.

210
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,061
I'd like to know more
about what happened.

211
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,170
Don't let them red devils
go in the house

212
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,972
after what they done to your pa.

213
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,174
They probably tried
to kill him theirselves.

214
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,642
They brought him home,
didn't they?

215
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,201
Now, shut up.

216
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,282
How did it happen?

217
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,384
We found him wounded
in a clearing.

218
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,754
We tried to care for him,
but the fever is very bad.

219
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,689
He recovered enough
to tell us where he lived.

220
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,891
We brought him here.

221
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,260
Do you mean my father
was in Bannock country?

222
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,062
No.

223
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,131
No, he was on his own land.

224
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,633
That's where we found him.

225
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,634
You see? I told you.

226
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,768
I told you them heathen devils

227
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,503
was sneaking around
on your land.

228
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,738
ADAM: It's a lucky thing
they were there.

229
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,263
Now, keep your mouth shut, Ike.

230
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,212
Thank you very much
for what you did.

231
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,447
You'll need rest and food.

232
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,316
You ain't asking them to stay?

233
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,518
It would be better if we leave.

234
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,854
Your father is a strong man
and very brave.

235
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,190
We both hope he is better soon.

236
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,694
No, please, please, I...
I want you to stay.

237
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,129
Well, I ain't staying
in no house

238
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,399
where they ask Injuns in
and they make 'em welcome.

239
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,534
Why don't you leave?

240
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,604
All right, but don't you forget
that I got a big bone to pick

241
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,699
with your pa when he gets
better, if he ever does.

242
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,768
(door closes)

243
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,987
It's a very, very poor way
to say thank you.

244
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,290
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,361
If you will just make yourselves
comfortable here, I...

246
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,728
I'll be right back.

247
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,448
We shouldn't have come here.

248
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,016
It was a mistake.

249
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,186
No, Matsou, it was God's will.

250
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,222
If we hadn't brought the white
man home, he would have died.

251
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,790
He's a good man.

252
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,193
He's promised to let us live
on this land.

253
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,229
I never believed
in any white man's promises.

254
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,532
(footsteps approaching)

255
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,902
He's resting more easily now.

256
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,638
How long did you have
to pack him?

257
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,206
Pa's a pretty heavy fellow.

258
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,841
Not far.

259
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,709
We had to take him
from his horse.

260
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,711
The wound was opening again.

261
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,780
Why don't the two of you
get some sleep

262
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,982
while we wait
for the doctor to get here?

263
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,419
I am sure my father would like
to see you before you leave.

264
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,416
Thank you.

265
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,064
How you feeling, Pa?

266
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,339
A lot better than I did.

267
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,741
That's all we can do
for him for now, boys.

268
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,276
I want you three to take turns

269
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,412
making sure
that he stays in bed.

270
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,149
Don't you worry, Doc,
I'll make sure he takes orders.

271
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,243
He'll stay in bed, Doc,
I'll see to that.

272
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,355
Look, I'm sorry about
that wild ride coming over, Doc.

273
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,790
You can take it easy going back.

274
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,850
Yes, indeed, I certainly will.

275
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,965
I don't know how Mr. Cartwright
got hurt or why you helped him,

276
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,367
but one thing
I do know for sure--

277
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,736
if you hadn't helped him
when you did,

278
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,806
he'd be far beyond all help now.

279
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,401
We can't spare men
like Ben Cartwright.

280
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,646
Thanks, Adam.

281
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,482
I'll see you tomorrow, Ben.

282
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,584
Now, you rest, you hear? Hmm?

283
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,852
That's an order.

284
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,287
Thank you, Doctor.

285
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,922
LITTLE JOE:
See you in a little while.

286
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,158
Boys, you mind if I have a...

287
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,595
few minutes alone
with my friends?

288
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,130
Not at all.

289
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,264
You stay in bed, Pa.

290
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,500
I'll be back in a minute.

291
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,135
(door closes)

292
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,471
I don't even know your names.

293
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,241
You have heard them before,
but in your fever.

294
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,878
My name is Hatoya,
and my husband is Matsou.

295
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,040
I'll remember them.

296
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,484
And I haven't forgotten
what I told you

297
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,886
about that piece of land.

298
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,389
We didn't ask for it.

299
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,025
I know you didn't.

300
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,328
I've been thinking about it.

301
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,097
I want you to have
a big piece of land,

302
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,400
enough for a farm.

303
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,668
What would we do
with such a piece of land?

304
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,871
You'd farm it,

305
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,874
raise crops, animals...

306
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,342
live off the land.

307
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,311
(whispers):
How?

308
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,614
I know nothing of such things.

309
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,350
The red man knows more
about hunting and fishing,

310
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,819
the white man knows
more about farming.

311
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,789
If we put what we know together,

312
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,849
there will be more than enough
for us all.

313
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,556
This will never be.

314
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,328
There is no way to begin.

315
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,839
You offer us a farm...

316
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,776
but I know nothing
of such things.

317
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,547
So I say... keep your farm.

318
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,016
Let me ask you a question.

319
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:12,458
Would you come
to live as a farmer

320
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:17,162
on your own land
if I and my sons

321
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:21,100
and the... the settlers in the
valley would teach you,

322
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,002
help you with the things
you do not now know?

323
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,338
It would be so wonderful,
Matsou.

324
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,707
It would also be difficult.

325
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,211
It might not work.

326
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,942
I might not learn.

327
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,322
I've... I've talked too much.

328
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,860
I never believed
such an offer could be made.

329
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,262
The white man always takes.

330
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,427
We will talk and pray
and let you know our decision.

331
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,070
(door opens and closes)

332
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,557
HATOYA: But I have lived among
them in the white man's town.

333
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,659
I know them better than you do.

334
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,428
Perhaps you do not know me
well enough.

335
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,264
I know you very well, beloved,

336
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,734
and I believe we can do
this thing together.

337
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,903
Why can't we stay here?

338
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,841
I could stay here, anywhere,
alone with you forever, Matsou.

339
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,543
But what of our sons
and daughters

340
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,345
who will be coming
if God wills it?

341
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,381
Would you keep them alone, too?

342
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,651
We can go back
to the tribe someday.

343
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:50,389
They won't always be at war,
and I am a son of a chief.

344
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,958
The youngest son,

345
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,826
and with no great love
for his brother Lagos,

346
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,226
who will be the next chief.

347
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,765
That is true.

348
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,367
This is a chance to have
a better way of life

349
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,671
than we have ever known,
for us and for our children.

350
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,440
I don't know
that it will be better.

351
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,375
I only know that it will
be very different,

352
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,346
and it is this difference
that frightens me.

353
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,648
Frightens you, Matsou?

354
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,418
You have told me
that nothing frightens you.

355
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,854
I spoke those words
as a warrior and a hunter,

356
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,423
and they were true.

357
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,727
And I was raised to be
these things and not a farmer.

358
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,862
You have also told me
that our people

359
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,732
and the white man must learn
to live together in peace.

360
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,635
But you are asking
much more than that.

361
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,038
You are asking me
to put down my bow and arrow

362
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,375
and pick up an ax and a plow.

363
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,245
You are asking me to eat bread
instead of meat,

364
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,814
to wear cloth
instead of leather,

365
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,849
to live in a house
instead of a wickiup.

366
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,377
You are asking me
to stop being an Indian.

367
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,887
And I don't know if I can do it.

I do not know

But I will try, my dearest love,

if you will stand beside me.

No, can't do it, I tell you.

I couldn't hardly believe my own
two ears when I first heard it.

Can't believe it now.

Well, you might as well believe
it, Ike, 'cause it's true.

379
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,973
Well, then, I, I think
you're going out of your mind,

380
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,242
or else that Injun banged you
real good on the head

his knife into you.

Well, whichever way it is,

384
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,751
I ain't going to have
no Injun for a neighbor

385

and you ain't got
no right to make me.

386

Now, look, let's just simmer
down and talk some sense, Ike.

387
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,791
I don't want to simmer down!

388
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,126
Now, you listen to me.

389
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,161
The night that you was hurt,
I come down here to get you

390
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,931
to run off two savages
that sneaked on to your land,

391
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,066
and they was squatting
in a stinking tent

392
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,534
right next to my boundary.

393
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,572
Now I find out those same two
savages has been given a farm

394
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,576
by you right next to my land,
and you ask me to simmer down.

395
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,213
Now, those two "savages" saved
my life.

396
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,249
Yeah, more like they stuck
their knife into you first.

397
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,019
A-All right, now, if you have
to give 'em a reward,

398
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,255
give 'em whiskey or money.

399
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,590
Don't give 'em land.

400
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,459
Well, don't you think
that Indians

401
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,764
at least have a, a call to share
the land in this valley?

402
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,899
No, not next-door to me.

403
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,801
What have you got
against Indians?

404
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,403
I sure would like to know.

405
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,072
Well, I sure would like
to tell you.

406
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,941
I don't like 'em because
they're bloodthirsty savages.

407
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,543
They're worse than wild animals.

408
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,378
They're twice as dangerous.

409
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,113
And I don't like 'em
'cause they're heathens.

410
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,249
And I don't like 'em
'cause they won't work,

411
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,218
and they can't work,
and because they're dirty,

412
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,187
and they stink,
and they're sneaky,

413
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,422
and they're drunks,
and they're thieves,

414
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,756
and God knows what else.

415
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,058
Most of all, I don't like 'em
'cause they scare me.

416
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,093
I hate 'em.

417
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,829
What is it about them
that scares you?

418
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,997
They got long, black hair...

419
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,498
And red skins.

420
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,866
Yep.

421
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,469
Yeah.

422
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,672
I'm not going to try
to answer you, Ike, not now,

423
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,407
but someday somebody's going
to have to answer

424
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,142
for people
who think like you do.

425

There's nothing wrong
with the way I think.

426
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,148
Well, I'm not going
to argue that point either,

427
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,618
but neither am I going to back
down from what's my right to do.

428
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,455
Now, I promised Matsou
and Hatoya that piece of land,

429
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,190
and I mean for them to have it.

430
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,859
Yeah, well,
why put 'em next to me?

431
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,994
It's not just
a piece of land, Ike.

432
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,663
It's-It's treating them
like people.

433
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,097
I have no intention
of giving them

434
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,133
some worthless scrap
up around the rocks.

435
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,468
They've already got that.

436
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,536
I want to give 'em a piece
of land that they can work,

437
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,205
a piece of land
that they can farm.

438
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,074
And that land next to yours
is the best I have,

439
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,310
and it's my intention
to give it to them.

440
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,646
If you put 'em
on that piece, I move out!

441
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:46,318
Well, that's a decision that
you're gonna have to make, Ike.

442
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,346
I'd think about it a long time
before I made the move.

443
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,527
Now, look, all... all I'm
asking you to do is...

444
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,096
is give those two a chance.

445
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,866
I don't want you to...
be a friend,

just be a decent neighbor.

Well, I'll tell you what kind
of neighbor I'll be.

448
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,273
I'll treat 'em
just like they wasn't there.

I won't talk to 'em.
I won't answer 'em.

I won't help 'em.
I won't let them help me.

I won't go on their land,

on my land, I'll kill 'em.

You do anything out of line...

you'll answer to me.

00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,635
The feather of the chief--

477
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,837
why do you wear it?

478
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,341
Our father died two days ago,
full of hatred for the white man

479
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,140
and scorn for his youngest son.

480
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,749
I am sorry.

481
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,118
I loved him.

482
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,887
And I've had no love for you,

483
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,323
but I hope you will be
a better chief than he was.

484
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,526
I tell you one thing, Matsou,

485
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,995
we no longer will sit
in the mountains and starve

486
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,030
while this valley
is full of plenty.

487
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,166
We no longer
will sit in the mountains

488
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,834
and talk about peace treaties.

489
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,103
Tomorrow, the Bannock braves
go on the warpath,

490
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,272
and this valley
will be full of death.

491
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,908
I have known you would do this.

492
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,711
I also know that you are wrong.

493
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,246
You are the one who is wrong.

494
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,650
You do not belong here
and never will.

495
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,253
As chief of our tribe,
I ask you to come back.

496
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,556
The day of the lance is upon us.

497
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
You were once a great warrior,

498
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,728
until this woman
turned you soft.

499
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,698
Come back to the tribe;
you are needed.

500
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,607
I am needed here, Lagos.

501
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,769
Hatoya is with child.

502
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,416
And I rejoice
for the both of you.

503
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,017
Bring her with you.

504
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,286
The ban will be lifted--
if she carries your child

505
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,488
she will be welcome.

506
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,549
It is mostly for the child
that I will stay.

507
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,594
If you stay,
then you will die here

508
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,996
like the white men
you are trying to imitate.

509
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,800
I give you till tomorrow
to think on it.

510
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,632
I wait no longer.

511
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,587
Are you sorry now
about the child?

512
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,424
You know I prayed
for that child...

513
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,628
to your god, as well as to mine.

514
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,622
But would you go back
if it were not for that?

515
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,904
If it comes to dying...

516
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:11,242
I'd rather die as a warrior
fighting with my people than...

517
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,779
then as a farmer
living among strangers.

518
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,548
Then you <i>would</i> go back.

519
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,816
I might.

520
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,120
But the child is
not only important for us,

521
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,954
but for the future
of our people.

522
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,726
I will stay,

523
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:32,096
for my little wife...

524
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,327
and for my child.

525
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,407
What will you do
about your brother?

526
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,376
In the morning,
I'll ride to Ben Cartwright.

527
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,545
The settlers have to be warned.

528
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,037
Even though he's your brother?

529
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:56,387
I still remember the teachings
of my father, Hatoya.

530
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,557
When a decision is made,

531
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,627
it must be kept...

532
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,994
even against a brother.

533
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,938
Hey, Mat!
(laughing)

534
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:14,939
Congratulations!

535
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,674
I just heard the wonderful
news about Hatoya.

536
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,643
I only heard about it myself
three days ago.

537
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,145
Oh, you know the way that kind
of news travels--women talk.

538
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,146
Wonderful to see you.

539
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,581
You don't get over
this way often enough.

540
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,250
Yeah, why don't you bring
your pretty wife with you?

541
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,684
Yeah, I'm-I'm digging her
up a present.

542
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,685
It's-It's a cradle.

543
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,488
Ain't been slept in since
Little Joe jumped out of it.

544
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,224
Save your welcome until you
hear the rest of my news.

545
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,793
The Bannocks are going
on the warpath.

546
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,729
Oh, how do you know that, Mat?

547
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,399
Because my brother is now chief
of the Bannocks, and he told me.

548
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,234
You mean they're
planning a raid?

549
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,703
No, more than a raid.
It will be war.

550
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,538
How soon is this to start?

551
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,673
MATSOU:
Any moment.

552
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,575
Maybe we ought to get word
to Fort Bradley.

553
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,943
You know the way they are.

554
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,978
They're not going to do anything
until after there's an incident.

555
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,346
You'd better warn the settlers.

556
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,081
Get ready to ride
into the valley.

557
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,116
All right, Pa.

558
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,051
It is good to warn the settlers,

559
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,054
but, uh,
I came to warn you first.

560
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,290
- That's very good of you.
- No, no, no, no.

561
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,693
My brother has two people
he hates.

562
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,796
One of them's me because I won't
go back and join him.

563
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,699
The other one is you, Ben.

564
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,261
Well, why should
your brother hate me?

565
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,007
It was my brother
who tried to kill you

566
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,407
that time we brought you home.

567
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,917
The people of this valley
are getting to owe you

568
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,785
more and more, Mat,
especially me.

569
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,925
Why don't you
and Hatoya stay with us here,

570
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,493
till this thing blows over?

571
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,096
Oh, thank you.

572
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,367
I would like to bring Hatoya
here, for the sake of the child.

573
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,303
I...

574
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,636
I will stay on my land.

575
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,610
Good. You do that.

576
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,380
Adam, better get word
to Ike Daggert.

577
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,381
Right.

578
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,516
Ike Daggert is my neighbor, Ben.

579
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,218
I will take care of warning him.

580
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,620
Mat, I don't want
you to take that chance.

581
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,389
Don't step foot on his land.

582
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:16,394
I don't like Ike Daggert, Ben,
but I am not afraid of him.

583
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,030
You have enough country
to cover.

584
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,761
I will warn the Daggerts
on the way home.

585
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,218
(chanting war cries)

586
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:08,946
(chanting continues)

587
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,348
(speaking native language)

588
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,702
Why don't you bring that danged
gun right into bed with us?

589
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,572
You pay it more mind
than you do me.

590
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,407
Martha, I told you
a hundred times.

591
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,943
When you got red Injuns
for next-door neighbors,

592
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,245
got to be ready for trouble,
especially at night.

593
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,346
Bah!

594
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,115
You've been saying
that for months.

595
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,617
Staying up late, sneaking around
with your danged gun,

596
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,387
and they haven't so much as set
foot on your danged place.

597
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,523
That's 'cause I scared them good
and proper to begin with,

598
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,058
and I kept them scared
every chance...

599
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,460
(rustling)

600
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,258
(mutters):
What's that...?

601
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,271
I heard something out there.

602
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,208
Yep, you certainly got
them scared, all right.

603
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,871
I'm going to go see
what that is.

604
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,351
(rustling)

605
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,553
Ike Daggert.

606
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,957
- Daggert.
- (rifle cocking)

607
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,949
Ike Daggert.

608
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,298
(screaming)

609
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,735
(speaking native language)

610
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,545
(groans)

611
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,481
(yelling in native language)

612
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,077
(horse whinnying)

613
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,660
The Lord maketh His face
to shine upon thee

614
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,129
and be gracious unto thee.

615
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,600
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon thee

616
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,069
and give thee peace.

617
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,070
Amen.

618
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,071
HOSS:
Amen.

619
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,972
WOMAN:
Amen.

620
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,502
Thanks, Ben.

621
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,315
Quit it!

622
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,358
You quit that, I said!

623
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,093
Quit it!

624
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,828
What is it, Ike?
What's the matter?

625
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,096
I won't stand it.

626
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,399
I won't stand for no heathen

627
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,034
saying prayers
at my wife's grave.

628
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,035
Now, you quit it!

629
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,236
- Ike!
- Stop, now...

630
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,671
She ain't no heathen.

631
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,372
She knows as much
about the Bible as you do.

632
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,907
IKE: What are they doing here,
anyway?

633
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,609
- They're trying... -It was
Injuns that killed my Marthy.

634
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,610
They're trying
to pay their respects,

635
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,045
just like the rest of us now.

636
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,614
Ain't got no more respect
for the dead than a coyote.

637
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,809
Quit it!

638
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,896
I want to tell you
how deeply sorry I am

639
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,065
that my people killed your wife.

640
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,634
I tried to warn you.

641
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,264
Don't you talk to me, you Injun.

642
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,578
I understand how you feel.

643
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,913
I am sorry.

644
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,251
You dirty, rotten, lousy,
stinking savage!

645
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,118
Ike!

646
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,153
- Ike! -Ike, come on!
- Come on, Ike.

647
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,822
LITTLE JOE:
Stop it.

648
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,857
MAN:
Here.

649
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,058
BEN:
Ike!

650
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,059
(screams)

651
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,460
(onlookers murmuring)

652
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,532
There, you savage.

653
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,768
You killed my wife,
I killed yours.

654
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,371
An eye for an eye.

655
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,672
An eye for an eye, Ben,

656
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,107
an eye for an eye.

657
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,441
That's in the book.

658
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,602
BEN:
Ike!

659
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,579
An eye for an eye.

660
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,105
It's in the book.

661
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,460
♪♪

662
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,152
It's Ike Daggert.

663
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,660
You can hardly recognize him.

664
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,721
Pa, Pa, come out here.

665
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,927
What's the matter?

666
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,943
That's Injun work, Pa.

667
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,435
You don't reckon,
you don't reckon Mat...

668
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,209
Let's get him into the house.

669
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,754
He sure done a job on him.

670
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,755
Yeah.

671
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,224
Wonder why he didn't finish it.

672
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,927
He didn't want him to die.

673
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,962
IKE:
Help me.

674
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,231
(Ike mumbling)

675
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,223
Help me.

676
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,703
Aah!

677
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,474
(groaning)

678
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,742
- It's all right, Ike.
- (Ike shouts)

679
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,577
It's all right, Ike.

680
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,812
You're with me.

681
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,147
Ben?

682
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,281
Ben Cartwright?

683
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,349
It's me, Ike.

684
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,341
(Ike panting)

685
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,157
Ain't, ain't so easy
to kill Ike Daggert, you...

686
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,149
(groans)

687
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,331
He left me...
left me alive on purpose,

688
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,323
so's I could suffer.

689
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,738
Who, Ike, who?

690
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,933
(Ike groans)

691
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,949
Who, Ike, who?

692
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,318
The... the Injun...

693
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,821
your friend...

694
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,950
the one you tried to make
into a white man--Matsou.

695
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,635
Know why... why he left me...

696
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,637
left me alive, Ben?

697
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,841
He wants you, wants you to meet
him in the cave, north fork.

698
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,444
He wants Ben Cartwright or...

699
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,447
or otherwise...

700
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,650
every settler in the valley
will get what... what I got.

701
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,142
(mumbles)

702
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,929
Just didn't understand
what we were trying to do.

703
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,891
What are you gonna do now, Pa?

704
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,960
Mat wants to see me,
I'll go to him.

705
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,028
I've got to try
to bring him to his senses.

706
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,463
I owe him that.

707
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,298
He's gone too far now.

708
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,068
Ike Daggert killed his wife.

709
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,803
Pa, we can't let you
take the risk.

710
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,706
Anything I've ever done has had
some risk attached to it.

711
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,241
I'll go up by the north trail.

712
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,744
If I'm not back by morning,
you come for me.

713
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,313
Pa...

714
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,315
Here, you forgot this.

715
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,752
Eh, that won't bring me back,
or Mat either.

716
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,722
Mat!

717
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,694
Matsou, it's Ben Cartwright.

718
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,164
I didn't think you would come.

719
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,776
I got your message
from Ike Daggert.

720
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,079
He said you wanted to see me.

721
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,215
I'm here.

722
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:35,419
Then you saw what I did
to Ike Daggert?

723
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,411
I saw.

724
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,427
Aren't you afraid?

725
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,864
No, Mat, I'm not afraid.

726
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,856
(grunting)

727
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,138
You know about rawhide.

728
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,850
It shrinks in the sun,

729
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,752
it gets tighter and tighter.

730
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,824
I know.

731
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,225
Why did you come here
last night?

732
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,758
To see if I could help you.

733
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:26,136
All right, go ahead, help me.

734
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:30,007
Give me back the wife that I
loved and the child she carried.

735
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,678
Will tying me like this...
bring her back?

736
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,581
No...

737
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,150
but I think
that making you suffer enough

738
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,953
will ease some of my pain.

739
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,513
I guess you're right.

740
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,294
I just wanted to help you,
not hurt you.

741
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,763
Help me?

742
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,566
You held my arms, Ben.

743
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:59,136
You let that madman shoot Hatoya
right before my eyes.

744
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,972
Do you think
if you hadn't held my arms, Ben,

745
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,032
he could have done that?

746
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,778
I say you killed Hatoya

747
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:11,180
just as surely as if you had
pulled the trigger.

748
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,147
Does it hurt?

749
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,325
Yes, it hurts.

750
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,663
Good... good.

751
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,655
It will get worse.

752
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,649
(Ben panting quietly)

753
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,460
Is it bad?

754
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,208
It's bad.

755
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,201
You're a strong man, Ben.

756
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,177
I thought you would be
screaming by now.

757
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,784
Our Father who art in Heaven...

758
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,463
What did you say?

759
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,199
...hallowed be Thy name.

760
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,800
Stop that.

761
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,435
Thy kingdom come...

762
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,670
Stop that, Ben!

763
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,438
(mumbling prayer)

764
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,941
Stop it!

765
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,375
Ben!

766
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,831
You shouldn't have
done that, Ben.

767
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,959
You shouldn't have prayed.

768
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,395
(groans)

769
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:23,138
Is that what made you let me go?

770
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,986
I meant to kill you.

771
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,955
But I fail here, too.

772
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,515
I failed at everything.

773
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:41,765
I lost my wife.

774
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:45,502
My brother, Lagos, is dead.

775
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,199
I failed being a white man.

776
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,571
I failed being an Indian.

777
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,372
No, Mat.

778
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,122
You didn't fail.

779
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:11,028
I don't think
you could ever fail.

780
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:14,198
I wanted to kill you, Ben.

781
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,867
It was important for me
to kill you,

782
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,268
and I couldn't do it.

783
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,575
If I couldn't torture you
into hating me,

784
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,669
then I couldn't kill you.

785
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,783
Can you forgive me
for hurting you?

786
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,691
I did that
before you cut me loose.

787
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,773
I will help you home, Ben.

788
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,979
No, I'll be all right.

789
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,811
Mat...

790
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,584
Are you going home...

791
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,786
to your people?

792
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,516
Yes.

793
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,891
Now, you'll be back?

794
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,365
Yes, we will be back.

795
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,801
There he is.

796
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,218
Pa, you all right?

797
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,819
Yeah.

798
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,721
Pa, did he do this to you?

799
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,722
Yeah.

800
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:46,723
I'll get him.

801
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,625
No, no.

802
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,627
