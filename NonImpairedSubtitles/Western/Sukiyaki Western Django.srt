1
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,450
Ringo...

2
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,690
They're looking for you. Its the end of the world for you.

3
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,870
What's that sound?

4
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,480
Thats the sound of the Gion Shoja temple bells.

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,700
What?

6
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,030
You know, them Heike and Genji boys?

7
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,860
On a distant island, these two clans split into the Reds and the Whites.

8
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,350
To wage a war...

9
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,050
Sorta like that a "War of the Roses," you know? In England...

10
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,630
Who won?

11
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,670
The Whites?

12
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,030
This high noon battle, was waged in Dannoura.

13
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,500
Near the Heike Clan and Red...

14
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,650
Got themselves hog-tied by the Genji Clan and White...

15
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,900
Their story, it goes a little something like this...

16
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,570
The sound of the Gion Shoja temple bells,

17
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,170
echoes the impermanence of all things.

18
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,220
What bells you say?

19
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:19,620
The color of the sala flowers reveals the truth that, "to flourish is to fall."

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,510
You okay fella?

21
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,590
The proud do not endure, like a passing dream.

22
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,110
On a night in Spring.

23
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,480
The mighty fall at last...

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,840
See you in hell!

25
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,870
To be no more than dust before the wind.

26
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,480
Ringo! That's why I love you!

27
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:28,430
Presented by Elementxstyle.com

28
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,400
Hey! Nothing back there!

29
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,450
You ain't heard me?

30
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,550
It's a nothing town!

31
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,100
Bet you came for the gold too!

32
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,180
Well, there ain't none!

33
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,100
Which are you? White or Red?

34
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,880
You Genji or Heike?

35
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,110
Which of you is gonna buy it?

36
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,950
My reward's one third...

37
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,590
If there is no treasure, no pay!

38
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,390
Benkei! Show him...

39
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,400
No doubt about who is going to be left standing.

40
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,740
But best not get any ideas about playing Yojimbo!

41
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,800
You gotta be alive to defend your money...

42
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,350
Stranger!

43
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,820
Kid's got a heart, and balls to match.

44
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,640
No! Join us!

45
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,400
We'll do better than a third! We'll give you half!

46
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Half?

47
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,430
We'll give you everything.

48
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,790
But with us, its a lifetime contract.

49
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,190
Don't know about that, I don't stay long...in one place.

50
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,580
Suits us fine!

51
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,460
We'll give you half for this one time deal!

52
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,290
How 'bout it?!

53
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,810
Not too shabby.

54
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,990
Hey! Boy!

55
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,790
Hey hey...

56
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,990
If you're such a quickdraw, you don't need them!

57
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,960
Take it all, and tell them to shove their lifetime contract.

58
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,030
Stay out of it! You old bitty!

59
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,670
Us grannies can't help but meddle!

60
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,820
Boy, don't rush yourself!

61
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,810
Make your choice after cooling your heels.

62
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,680
This town can't offer you food, but I can offer you some Soba.

63
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,470
At my place...

64
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,420
Come with me!

65
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,120
Hey hey hey hey!

66
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,160
Hey!

67
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,850
Follow him!

68
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,060
Bah! Forget that! Bring him here...

69
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,950
I'll teach her good.

70
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,790
So the Reds rolled in first, eh?

71
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,310
Yeah, how'd you figure that?

72
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,420
Simple, the Sheriff.

73
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,660
They say the law hitched with the weakest side.

74
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,940
Must mean, they made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

75
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,130
Of course not.

76
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,800
Maybe he's looking for a chance to switch sides.

77
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,470
How long's it been like this?

78
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,170
Two months, since the Heikes rolled in.

79
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,970
And before that, gold prospectors started coming around.

80
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,900
(Idiotically) What're you doing here?!

81
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,060
(Idiotically) What?! What the hell?

82
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,800
But what they couldn't figure out was,

83
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,860
why so many people and why now?

84
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,730
At the end of last month, a town with the same legend!

85
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,150
From the motherload, the country's gone crazy!

86
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,470
Those Heike gold terrorizers!

87
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,770
Every nook and cranny of every town with the same treasure legend,

88
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,380
is swarming with prospectors!

89
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,360
Its genuine gold rush!

90
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,780
You can't touch this land, you'll be cursed.

91
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,230
Ha! We'll take that curse off your hands!

92
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,500
No!

93
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,210
You see?! We're raised hearing the legends all our lives!

94
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,190
And we can't fight which is why, as you lay waste to our land!

95
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,350
In the beginning, we expected them to be a Godsend.

96
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,800
Because they were Heike, like us.

97
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,340
But so soon they started.

98
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,240
The Heikes ran off the prospectors and started digging!

99
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,830
Look!

100
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,960
Kiyomori!

101
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,400
Boss Kiyomori! We found this!

102
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,840
Instead of that wood marker that read, "Fear the Curse!"

103
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,120
I knew it!

104
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,190
So they figured the treasure must be somewhere,

105
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,670
and the Heike have been here since.

106
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,910
From today, you're one of us.

107
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,540
Think of it as being on vacation.

108
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,810
Yes, I've been meaning to take some time off.

109
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,650
Get a little sun myself.

110
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,580
Akira!

111
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,980
Stop, stop! Don't do anything stupid!

112
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,760
Daddy, I'm scared!

113
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,180
Stop!

114
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,570
Heihachi, son...

115
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,380
Men need courage and resolution.

116
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,460
I'm scared daddy! Let's go home!

117
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,310
Let's go...let's go!

118
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,000
They ransacked the resting place of our ancestors.

119
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,400
I go and get help.

120
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,590
Daddy!

121
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,000
...daddy!

122
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,720
Boss Kiyomori.

123
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,000
But his reign of power didn't last long.

124
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,490
Dang, you boys are a day late and a dollar short!

125
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,390
This is our town!

126
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
Dang!

127
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,470
Genji's...

128
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,400
Shigemori, you got too fat when you were a boy.

129
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,120
Huh?

130
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,210
Boss Yoshitsune

131
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,330
The Genji's didn't make a move against the Heike's.

132
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,310
They left the gold digging to them.

133
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,730
Sat back and waited for their chance to steal the wheat.

134
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,010
Finders, keepers.

135
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,130
After that, people began to leave.

136
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,780
Just a few families are left.

137
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,590
On the way here, I met a guy leaving town.

138
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,840
He said there wasn't any gold.

139
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,590
Ah, we might as well hire you.

140
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,910
But all the town can offer you is this.

141
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,490
Something.

142
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,910
Hey, try this.

143
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,960
Hey, hey! Welcome back!

144
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,700
This is my grandson, Heihachi.

145
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,550
So, you boys got it yet?

146
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,990
Give it a go.

147
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,120
Death, isn't to be feared.

148
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,930
Don't watch the blade!

149
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,110
How many times do I have to tell you?

150
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,320
Don't follow the blade with your eyes! Don't see it!

151
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,860
Feel it!

152
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,050
Thats the essence of Mononofu training.

153
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,610
Mononofu training ain't somewhat ancient.

154
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,610
Being a Samurai is a philosophical way of life.

155
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,860
But the life of Mononofu means a life of fighting!

156
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,130
If you ask me, Samurai are still wearing their skippies?

157
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,800
They're vein, they're still concerned about their looks.

158
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,160
That's tits on the pool thinking! ^_^

159
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:50,810
But if you peel away that last layer. So you...are naked.

160
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,570
This and a real fighting spirit is,

161
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,170
Warriors luck in life.

162
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,080
This realm...

163
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,210
Our realm!

164
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,160
Is deeper than the Samurai's.

165
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,570
Now...

166
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,490
You will come at me, or whistle dixie.

167
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,150
Why...?

168
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,920
Why were we born in this spineless age!

169
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,200
What's it gonna be?

170
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,300
Take this handsome man to the Reds,

171
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,150
or hand him over to the Whites.

172
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,440
You know?

173
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,690
I must say...

174
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,960
I don't know.

175
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,850
Depends on him.

176
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:42,600
Today's special is the Whites, with a side of mashed potatoes and soup!

177
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,790
Forget about the Heike gang!

178
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,010
They're boss Kiyomori smells like a dead dog on a hot day!

179
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,190
He's lost so much he's getting dumber.

180
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,340
Goddamnit! Sheriff's late.

181
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,350
The sound, of the...Gion Shoja temple bells.

182
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,440
Echoes the impermanence of all things.

183
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:41,930
You follow?

184
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,380
Yes, I...uh...

185
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,200
It means, everything in this old world changes.

186
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,720
It means we can never call ourselves out.

187
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,370
We'll finally restore the glory of our family name, and then ride in high.

188
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,310
The Genji gang will be left in ruins.

189
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:17,180
The color of the sala flowers reveals the truth,

190
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,540
that to flourish is to fall.

191
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,440
Thats it.

192
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,860
Its a law of nature, the Genji's are going down!

193
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,250
From today...

194
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,760
I read this.

195
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,130
What's that?

196
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Shakespeare...Henry the VI.

197
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,160
The War of the Roses.

198
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,360
War of the...Roses?

199
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,220
Camel boy, don't you know your Shakespeare?

200
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,490
Its a story about the Reds winning the war.

201
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,200
The Reds...win?

202
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,930
Yes, we'll win!

203
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,190
Yea! Kiyomori!

204
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,750
What?!

205
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,900
Kiyomori...

206
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,690
Don't ever call me Kiyomori again!

207
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,550
From today...

208
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,420
The name's...Henry.

209
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,830
Mwahaha!

210
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,140
Hey quit that shit!

211
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,210
Okay, you got it!

212
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,590
From today you are Henry! ...Boss.

213
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,160
Henry! Henry!

214
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,040
Now?

215
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,960
Side with the Genji's!

216
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,890
They got a lady, a young fine ass cream gravy!

217
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,210
That lady used to be a dancer!

218
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,650
She's the kid's mama, but still mighty fine.

219
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,430
Hasn't aged a bit.

220
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,150
A woman of true Genji lineage.

221
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,760
He's Genji and Heike?

222
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,250
Huh?

223
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,820
Oh...the kid?

224
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,990
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

225
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,840
And his father?

226
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,360
Got himself killed.

227
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,240
You of the same stock...boy?

228
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,020
F-F-F...Fine, fine!

229
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,080
Nani?!

230
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,980
He can't talk no more.

231
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,260
How do you, after seeing your dad murdered.

232
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,590
What's his mother doing on the Genji side?

233
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,500
To begin with, that granny's boy went to work in the city.

234
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,910
Then one day that boy, her son Akira.

235
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,050
Brought a Genji woman home.

236
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:48,410
Mama, the days of being Genji or Heike...are done with.

237
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,490
I don't know how or where the two met.

238
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
But his mother blessed their marriage.

239
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,150
So Red and White got hitched.

240
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,190
And they figured crossing roses, literally with both colors...was romantic.

241
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,370
And they raised Heihachi.

242
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,160
Their Red and White treasure.

243
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,350
But then the fighting started again.

244
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,200
Finders keepers...

245
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,910
Kiyomori!

246
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,490
Get out!

247
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,840
There ain't no gold here!

248
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,780
That's it?

249
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,460
Take it all!

250
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,830
If you want it? Take it!

251
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,680
And get out!

252
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,130
Daddy!

253
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,270
Heihachi!

254
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,040
Daddy!

255
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,050
Red rose...

256
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,180
My favorite color looks good on you.

257
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,380
Folks say a Genji woman painted Red,

258
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,650
was a flaming hymn.

259
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,370
I teach you well!

260
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,400
I show you!

261
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,810
A good time!

262
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,680
I know! I know!

263
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,420
So she ran to the hideout of her own flesh and blood.

264
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,850
Was it to protect her son, or get vengeance for her husband?

265
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,870
You too, Sheriff.

266
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,770
Sure! Don't mind if I do.

267
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
How much for the lady?

268
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,820
Say what?!

269
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,250
How much you got?

270
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,010
Depends on how much you're payin' me.

271
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,580
Keep it in your pants, little liver.

272
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,820
The tougher man gets the girl.

273
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,280
Do what you like.

274
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,270
Do it here, or upstairs.

275
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,300
Wherever and however you please.

276
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,750
You're the second calling wolf I ever really wanted to draw iron at.

277
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,290
Who was the first?

278
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,200
A legend...

279
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,740
One I heard, when I was a kid.

280
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,690
Oh yeah?

281
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,400
The bloody...

282
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,250
Benten...

283
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,480
Bloody Benten

284
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,790
The Fighting Goddess...legend.

285
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,360
Shit!

286
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,750
Now I really want to draw iron at you!

287
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,660
Nice...huh?

288
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,910
Ain't fine, but it hits you deep down.

289
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,530
The Anasazi play that music.

290
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,870
They were here before any of us.

291
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,700
They still keep, the old ways.

292
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,070
You'll do fine.

293
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,260
I want Kiyomori dead.

294
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,880
You've sold away your body...everything.

295
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,810
All for revenge.

296
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,780
So what?!

297
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,260
Don't pity me, I don't need useless compassion from you.

298
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,390
Good, I just mumbled something you don't understand.

299
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,120
Do you want me?

300
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,700
Yes.

301
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,210
I want you...very much.

302
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:11,630
But be careful, Yoshitsune's men left town to get that powerful weapon.

303
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,370
Yoichi wants you dead.

304
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,790
They'll likely be here by sun up.

305
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,790
When the shooting starts,

306
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,390
take Heihachi and escape to the mountains.

307
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:32,660
You're not gonna run?

308
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,660
Oh, you got something against them too?

309
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,060
I got my reasons.

310
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,660
Have the roses bloomed yet?

311
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,890
What are they named?

312
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,640
Love.

313
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,690
They're cold.

314
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:04,270
Here in my scabbard, meditating that.

315
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:04,270
(They are reciting lines from Henry VI; Act 2, Scene IV)

316
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,580
Shall dye your white roses in a bloody red.

317
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,260
Here...

318
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,130
Meantime, your cheeks do...count-

319
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:28,110
Counterfeit our roses, for pale they look with fear...

320
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,650
as witnessing the truth on our side.

321
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:42,210
No, Plantagenet, not for fear but anger

322
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,120
that thy cheeks blush for pure shame

323
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,020
to counterfeit our roses. And yet!

324
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,150
Thy tongue will not confess thy error.

325
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,260
That Sheriff's late! Bring him here you idiot!

326
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,290
Somethings you gotta see through.

327
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,490
What're you gonna do now?

328
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,810
I bet Kiyomori is going nuts.

329
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,740
Maybe he hasn't figured out he's been betrayed yet.

330
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,650
He may be dense, but he ain't stupid.

331
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,850
No, no no no...He hasn't got a clue.

332
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,510
As long as we...

333
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,580
So you want go back to their side?

334
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,830
Too late for that.

335
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,500
You said it!

336
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,340
So what do we do now?!

337
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,690
Don't get impatient.

338
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,260
He ain't going nowhere for awhile.

339
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,720
You reckon?

340
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,480
You just watch.

341
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,030
At least, as long as we stay here, we're safe.

342
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:54,970
We got time.

343
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,870
Why don't you take a dump?

344
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,120
And have a think?

345
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,270
Howdy Sheriff...

346
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,840
A special weapon will be here soon.

347
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,700
Can't let the Genji's get it.

348
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,260
Tell the Heike to obstruct their wagons,

349
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,090
if you don't we'll all be killed.

350
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,030
Sorry...

351
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,110
What are you doing boy?!

352
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,830
Shit, well get off your butt!

353
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,080
Hold your horses.

354
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,870
Instead of telling the god awful truth,

355
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,670
don't you reckon we'd better high tail it?

356
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,780
I ain't listening to you no more!

357
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,240
Kiyomori!

358
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,090
Boss Kiyomori!

359
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,910
Name's Henry!

360
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,660
Where have you been?!

361
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,240
I was spying on the Genji's.

362
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,260
And things are getting really out of hand.

363
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,850
Excuse me...

364
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,250
Come again?

365
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,220
Stupid cow!

366
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,800
I told you we should've skipped town...

367
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,740
I told you.

368
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,390
Shit!

369
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:28,960
Go!

370
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,370
Fear nothing!

371
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,710
Watch it!

372
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:44,450
Thats dangerous!

373
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:47,460
Shigemori!

374
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,600
What?!

375
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,230
You did this!

376
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,460
Fire boys, he's climbing out the window!

377
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,620
How'd he pull that off?

378
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,500
Come!

379
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,120
Ichiro, Matsui!

380
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,250
Follow me.

381
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:02,850
What happened?

382
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,730
I'll tell you later, we're going to the old man's place!

383
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,930
Heihachi! Come on hurry!

384
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,270
This way!

385
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,190
Watch your step.

386
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,800
Take Heihachi and go without me!

387
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,900
What did you forget?!

388
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,000
Something important!

389
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,590
What...who?!

390
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,680
Forget them you don't need them!

391
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,510
No! They're-!

392
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,300
They're...

393
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:51,440
They're...my...ours!

394
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,500
No matter what, one of you's gonna die!

395
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:28,480
Heihachi!

396
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:33,660
Please, please, please!

397
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,310
If you want them to live...

398
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,490
Drop...your...guns!

399
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,400
No more!

400
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,300
Quit your bitchin'!

401
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,990
The time is now!

402
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,580
Hey, hey!

403
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,220
Die!

404
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,220
Lucky me...

405
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,940
Henry!

406
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,740
Henry!

407
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:42,750
Shigemori...I won't die until we win.

408
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,860
Payback's a bitch!

409
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,830
A she's the shit!

410
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:11,830
Before you die...

411
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,570
I have something sweet to show you!

412
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,110
You want some bitch?

413
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,200
You animal...

414
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,210
Toshio! Throw it here!

415
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,790
Can't be...

416
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:32,790
Bloody....B-

417
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,870
Heihachi!

418
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,820
What are you doing?

419
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,920
Open your eyes!

420
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,150
See for yourself!

421
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,870
You can't close them!

422
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,220
Open your eyes!

423
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,400
Heihachi!

424
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,040
Heihachi! Open your eyes!

425
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,450
What were you doing acting alone?!

426
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:08,990
You got balls, but no brain!

427
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:29,110
Ruriko, why did you hide this from me?

428
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,180
I thought we were friends.

429
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,310
Sorry but...

430
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:49,070
Could you visit this address? And stock up on these.

431
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,690
If he is still alive.

432
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:59,560
My signature here, should help you out.

433
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:05,760
I wish I could go, but I can't leave the boy alone.

434
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,310
Ruriko...

435
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,840
But these are guns?

436
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:18,850
Tell him, I need help and he owes me.

437
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,410
You are the only one I can depend on.

438
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:38,000
So she's still kickin' eh?

439
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,810
What's BB?

440
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:19,420
When this devily talented goddess, used to played music...

441
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:23,750
she would hold her instruments in both hands.

442
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,940
But when she was on the warpath,

443
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,070
she held her weapons in eight hands.

444
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:43,380
When the fire of her vengeance twittled in her eyes

445
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:47,190
this smothering goddess was wide awake

446
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:50,220
and everything in her way got stained blood red.

447
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,390
The Bloody Benten

448
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:11,030
Nickname...double B for short.

449
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:15,560
I was the one who educated her in killing.

450
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,780
And it was tough going.

451
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,730
You like it?

452
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:28,840
Too sweet.

453
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,000
There's too much sugar.

454
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,190
This is Sukiyaki not a damn pot!

455
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,460
I-I-I'm so sorry!

456
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:41,510
How many times do I gotta tell you,

457
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:46,120
before it sinks into that thick skull of yours...

458
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,370
That you draw the sweetness out of the Chinese cabbage.

459
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:54,970
And this Tofu...its not authentic!

460
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,770
B-But the Tofu was sold out!

461
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:00,550
Excuses!

462
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:03,750
Go on!

463
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:06,970
Darn excuses!

464
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:14,070
Dang useless woman, why I ever thought I could make a gun fighter out of-

465
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:38,200
Listen up girl.

466
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,720
If this were a gun fight.

467
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,180
You wouldn't be sayin you got bullets that shoot beans instead, now could ya?

468
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,150
That'd mean dud to me and you wouldn't it?

469
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:51,740
Hmm? Wouldn't it?

470
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,670
That's my girl, there you go.

471
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,920
Never let your guard down.

472
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,130
The Grim Reaper hisself grows in that pot, don't forget that.

473
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,450
I-I...

474
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,430
The sugar!

475
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,420
Sugar helps me.

476
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:25,820
Lordy lord...

477
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,350
You ain't pregnant is you?

478
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:37,520
I reckon it will be a bouncing boy.

479
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,470
*Sigh*

480
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,350
Aw heck!

481
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,570
You mean Akira?

482
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:59,020
Akira, how the lovely sound of that name brings me back.

483
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,190
What can I say.

484
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,790
At the end, I am an enemy of the cold dagger.

485
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:09,480
What?

486
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,190
How's my boy?

487
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:31,320
I saw...

488
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,880
That's why you've come for them irons eh?

489
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:50,840
You tell her this for me.

490
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:07,440
"Sayonara dake ga jin sei da"

491
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,700
Life is all about goodbyes.

492
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:56,420
We are in your debt!

493
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:43,620
I'm surprised.

494
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,780
He's still alive.

495
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,410
I guess.

496
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:55,900
Every man's got his own reasons.

497
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:59,700
For why he had to keep on living.

498
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,220
Got a cold?

499
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,260
Don't you have one too?!

500
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:46,060
Amazing...

501
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,750
You are some freak of nature.

502
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,070
The old man's medicine did the trick.

503
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:57,520
Thank ya.

504
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:05,000
You going, huh?

505
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:07,170
Yeah.

506
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,730
Going...where to?

507
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,000
To settle a score.

508
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,400
What score?

509
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,140
The town's got nothing to do with you!

510
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,520
Shit just happens, thats all.

511
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,080
So the meaning of rivalry is shit happens, heh?

512
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:37,490
Well I don't wanna run from..."The Shit" anymore.

513
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,010
Shit...

514
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:51,360
If you don't take the cake, sorry but could you fetch the treasure for me?

515
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,040
There is one?

516
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,520
Ruriko...what about the town law?

517
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,280
As anyone who has been getting around here knows,

518
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,950
he was chosen to guard it.

519
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,850
That's the town law.

520
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,630
I thought Heihahi would be the next chosen one.

521
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:21,130
But he is too weak.

522
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:25,460
I reckon he was born at the wrong time,

523
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,220
and in the wrong place.

524
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,690
He does have a gift for music though.

525
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,360
But tenderness alone won't get you far in life.

526
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,450
What're you going to do with the treasure?

527
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,730
Settle this, once and for all!

528
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,660
If we lose, they can have it.

529
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:52,800
If we win, you can have half...how about it? You game?

530
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:55,260
Suits me fine.

531
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,230
Okay then.

532
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:48,060
This way!

533
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,020
No! This way!

534
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,270
I ain't gonna listen to you no more!

535
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,240
That's my line! I kill you!

536
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:30,160
Smells like victory.

537
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:35,090
Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun.

538
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:38,580
And now a shield.

539
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,420
A shield?

540
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:46,970
If you won't fight, it would be perfect.

541
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:52,180
Mwahaha!

542
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,420
Hey hey! Hold on!

543
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,140
Come on now!

544
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:00,270
Hey! No!

545
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:07,000
Shit!

546
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:18,240
If I get taken down...will you get this to Heihachi for me?

547
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:20,240
I'll think about it.

548
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:22,690
If and when you die.

549
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,500
Hey! Hey!

550
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,670
I'll carry the treasure for you.

551
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:32,690
I carried the gun, and if the end carries you!

552
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,280
Then let me do it!

553
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:40,820
If you weren't the most stubborn man I ever did meet.

554
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,300
Let him take it.

555
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,730
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

556
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,300
Go, go!

557
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:13,020
We get shot, and you are the one thats gonna get smoked. Not me!

558
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:15,630
You die first!

559
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,560
No! You die first!

560
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:21,680
We die!

561
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:29,980
Ok we die, we die...I die, you die, he dies, she dies, we die!

562
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,790
Everybody dies!

563
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:37,670
It takes truly something for people to finally learn.

564
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:45,610
The way to your loyal heart, with love.

565
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,620
Yoshitsune...

566
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,580
I'll make you...

567
01:34:58,860 --> 01:34:59,880
Notice me.

568
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,420
Here is...!

569
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,610
The treasure!

570
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:45,010
How about it boys?!

571
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,850
Winner takes all!

572
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,120
Hey look!

573
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:00,640
Gold!

574
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:35,970
Spread out!

575
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,410
Yoshitsune!

576
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:34,670
B-Benkei?

577
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,490
So re!

578
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,970
Yoshitsune!

579
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:27,280
I think I sprained my ankle!

580
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,080
Where're those Heike boys?!

581
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:40,660
Here we go!

582
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:42,350
Yeah!

583
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,140
No!

584
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,980
Get down!

585
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,840
You've got a new toy?

586
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:55,290
Yoshitsune!

587
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:00,970
This time, we win!

588
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,700
This time, we win!

589
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:08,050
This time...

590
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,110
That's for the mayor.

591
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:57,210
I win...

592
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,480
I win!

593
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,030
I ain't dead.

594
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,620
'Til I beat you.

595
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:28,400
This is for Akira.

596
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,450
Its all mine!

597
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,160
Its mine!

598
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,980
Its all ours!

599
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:19,430
I...always...

600
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,780
Don't say it...

601
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:43,150
No one in the world ever saved Benten's life.

602
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,570
Except for you.

603
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,080
You...

604
01:46:58,570 --> 01:47:03,020
You're Ruriko.

605
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:09,100
My...Ruriko.

606
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:08,180
Now this...

607
01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:15,560
Is what I call class.

608
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:31,910
So that old granny, was Bloody Benten..eh?

609
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,180
I'm glad I came here.

610
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,500
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

611
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:44,700
Finally, with a worthy opponent.

612
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:48,600
I can risk my life to the death.

613
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:26,040
Victory...

614
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,810
...or death!

615
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,810
That's plenty for me.

616
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,140
You keep the rest.

617
01:53:58,270 --> 01:53:59,470
Just do me one thing.

618
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:02,950
Tend to the roses for me.

619
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:14,730
But when it doesn't feel right, you can stop.

620
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:25,100
Now you've got money, you got the gun, and the roses too.

621
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:30,780
Heihachi...

622
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:38,780
Son, no matter what the times may be.

623
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,740
No matter where you are.

624
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:48,650
What matters is you, and how you deal with this world.

625
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:56,540
And there ain't no running from it.

626
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:09,000
Don't run.

627
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:15,500
Decide for yourself what tomorrow's gonna be.

628
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,090
Love.

629
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,340
Your mother was a mighty fine lady.
