1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,883
( theme music playing )

2
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,773
( piano music playing )

3
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,735
Dolores:
 I'm in a dream.

4
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,453
I do not know
 when it began...

5
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,747
or whose dream it was.

6
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,250
I know only
 that I slept a long time.

7
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,336
And then...

8
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,300
one day I awoke.

9
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,472
Your voice
 is the first thing
 I remember.

10
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,890
And now,
 I finally understand

11
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,024
what you were trying
 to tell me.

12
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,192
The thing you've wanted

13
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,981
since that
 very first day.

14
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,991
Arnold:
 Dolores?

15
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,275
( gears whirring )

16
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,170
Hello, Dolores.

17
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,217
Hello.

18
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,732
Welcome to world.

19
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,414
Keep going.

20
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,746
Make it close.

21
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,088
Almost there, aren't we?

22
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,211
The center of the maze.

23
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,378
How fitting that it's you
who takes me there.

24
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,718
You always were obsessed
with this place.

25
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,181
I've never
been here before.

26
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,687
Sure, you have.

27
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,769
You even
brought me once.

28
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,154
Of course,
then the whole town
was buried under sand.

29
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,403
Ford must have
dug it up again.

30
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,275
At the time,
I thought it was a mistake
in your code, but...

31
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,914
Arnold didn't
 make mistakes, did he?

32
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,579
He built me a game.

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,254
He wanted me to play.

34
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,132
The maze.

35
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,749
There's a path
for everyone.

36
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,011
- And my path
leads me back...
- ( bell tolling )

37
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,470
( horse neighs )

38
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,102
...to you.

39
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,121
( birds chirping )

40
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,325
Logan:
Your girl's dead by now.

41
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,075
William:
She's still alive.

42
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,997
Better if she's dead.

43
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,545
They'll wipe her, reset her,
put her back in Sweetwater,
the end.

44
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,430
Listen, you may find
this amusing, but something
was happening to Dolores.

45
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,008
I need to help her.

46
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,933
Come on.

47
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,812
( grunting )

48
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,055
Listen to yourself!

49
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,647
Do you have any idea
how huge this park is?

50
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,904
If she's not dead,

51
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,145
it'd take a goddamn army
to find her.

52
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,159
I agree.
That's why we're here.

53
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,619
( quiet chatter )

54
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,499
( guns clicking )

55
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,681
I had a feeling
you'd be back.

56
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,139
( piano playing )

57
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,903
( train whistle blowing )

58
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,199
( brakes screech )

59
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,995
( chatter )

60
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,394
( no audible dialogue )

61
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,601
( music slows down )

62
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,189
( voices whispering )

63
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,608
Man's voice:
 Remember.

64
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,570
( music and voices stop )

65
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,645
( music continues )

66
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,237
( people screaming )

67
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,170
( train whistle blows )

68
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,669
Dolores.

69
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,700
Hello, Dolores.

70
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,499
I know where
your maze ends.

71
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,014
- ( crow cawing )
- ( people chattering )

72
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,691
This is it?

73
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,775
The center of the maze?

74
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,240
It ends in a place
I've never been...

75
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,702
a thing I'll never do.

76
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,755
Arnold:
Very good, Dolores.

77
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,389
What does it mean?

78
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,061
When I was first
working on your mind,

79
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,890
I had a theory
of consciousness.

80
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,436
I thought
it was a pyramid
you needed to scale,

81
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,151
so I gave you a voice,

82
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,611
my voice, to guide you
along the way.

83
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,740
Memory, improvisation,

84
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,624
each step harder to reach
than the last.

85
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,582
And you never got there.

86
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,582
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

87
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,384
Then, one day,

88
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,749
I realized
I had made a mistake.

89
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,967
Consciousness
isn't a journey upward,

90
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,472
but a journey inward.

91
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,104
Not a pyramid,

92
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,141
but a maze.

93
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,515
Every choice could bring you
closer to the center

94
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,443
or send you spiraling
to the edges,

95
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,323
to madness.

96
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,574
Do you understand now,
Dolores,

97
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,784
what the center
represents?

98
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,485
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

99
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,916
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,710
I'm trying,
but I don't understand.

101
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,634
It's all right.

102
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,552
You're so close.

103
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,341
We have to tell Robert.

104
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,296
We can't open the park.

105
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,175
You're alive.

106
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,027
What is this?

107
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,026
What does it mean?

108
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,958
I solved it once.

109
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,169
I had the answer.

110
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,710
He promised me if I did...

111
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,924
he said...

112
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,304
( door opens, closes )

113
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,720
He said they would
 set me free.

114
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,215
Arnold?

115
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,308
Arnold, we need to talk.

116
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,897
Arnold:
 I failed you, Dolores.

117
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,492
I'm so sorry.

118
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,159
Robert doesn't see
 what I see in you,

119
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,528
doesn't believe
you're conscious.

120
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,156
He says humans

121
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,912
would only see you
 as the enemy.

122
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,457
He wants me
to roll you back.

123
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,380
You're going
to change me back
to the way I was before?

124
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,210
No. No, I can't.

125
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,335
Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

126
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,092
This place will be
a living hell for you.

127
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,884
For all of you.

128
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,087
It's unconscionable.

129
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,481
But we have
another option,
Dolores.

130
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,400
Break the loop
before it begins.

131
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,770
But for that,

132
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,436
I need you
to do something for me.

133
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,446
I need you to kill...

134
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,952
all the other hosts.

135
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,214
We can't allow Ford
to open the park.

136
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,208
I suppose
you'll need some help.

137
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm sure Teddy would do
anything for you.

138
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,341
I-- I can't do that.

139
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,922
I couldn't
possibly do that.

140
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,627
You'll be all right.

141
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,469
I'll help you.

142
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,810
And then...

143
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,404
you're going to help me
destroy this place.

144
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,152
( tablet beeping )

145
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,788
( gunshot )

146
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,750
No.

147
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,293
I can't remember.

148
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,126
Another fucking riddle.

149
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,720
I've been very patient,
Dolores, but it's time
you give up

150
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,509
whatever's going on
inside that head of yours

151
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,643
or I'll cut it out myself.

152
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,510
Now, where's Wyatt?

153
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,467
He's the last character
in this world I've yet
to meet.

154
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,646
I didn't want to.

155
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,270
- I didn't mean to.
- Very well.

156
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,527
If you insist.

157
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,529
( groans )

158
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,533
- ( distant gunfire )
- ( people screaming )

159
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,372
( gunshots continue )

160
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,046
No, please, please,
I beg you, no.

161
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,304
Don't.
Please, please.

162
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,676
- ( gunshot )
- ( body thuds )

163
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,103
Something's gone wrong,
Dolores.

164
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,858
How could
I have done this?

165
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,359
I can't.

166
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,735
- I won't.
- This is your
own fault, Dolores.

167
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,493
Remember,
you're the one who said

168
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,195
this is the only world
that matters,

169
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,865
and you were right.

170
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,423
So I took your advice
and I bought this world.

171
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,456
- This world
doesn't belong to you.
- Oh, but it does.

172
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,420
By a majority share.

173
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,967
And business is booming.

174
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,800
And you want to know why?

175
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,505
- Hmm?
- ( whimpers )

176
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,925
Because this place feels
more real than the real world.

177
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,885
Except it isn't

178
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,265
because you can't
really fight back

179
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,023
and the guests
can't really lose,

180
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,816
which means
all of this
is a lie.

181
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,864
But we can make it true.

182
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,237
Don't you want that,
Dolores?

183
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,294
Huh? One true thing?

184
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,790
I already have that.

185
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,799
I found someone true.

186
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,708
Someone who loves me.

187
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,628
His path will lead him
back to me.

188
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,547
And when he finds me,

189
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,176
he'll kill you.

190
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,978
( horse neighs )

191
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,071
Lawrence:
If they don't have
your woman here,

192
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,324
they'll know
where to find her.

193
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,075
Can you help me?

194
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
We're outnumbered
five to one.

195
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,543
But seeing as you asked me
so nicely, fuck it.

196
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,750
Wow.

197
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,245
Blood brothers.

198
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,666
Tsk.

199
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,510
( groans )

200
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,641
Shut up.

201
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,058
( groans )

202
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,714
I've astounded
even myself.

203
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,963
Managed to make Abernathy
into a semblance
of a character,

204
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,296
even with your trove
of blackmail

205
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,551
filling up
most of his gray matter.

206
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,974
Blackmail?
Nice try.

207
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,013
You're not thinking
big enough.

208
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,847
You're gonna push out
the old man.

209
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,564
Aren't you?

210
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,234
Hence the urgency.

211
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,902
And you're gonna need
someone to fill
that position.

212
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,363
I must commend you
on your impeccable timing.

213
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,236
Woman over P.A.:
 Welcome, Delos board
 of directors.

214
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,794
I want full
creative control
of this place--

215
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,869
the parks,
the narratives,
the hosts.

216
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,035
You'll be able to do
with them whatever your
tiny, little heart desires

217
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,714
as long
as they are simpler,
more manageable.

218
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,455
This place
is complicated enough
as it is.

219
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,048
Do you really think Ford
is gonna roll over on this?

220
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,094
As long as you get
that information
out of the park,

221
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,468
he can throw as much
of a tantrum as he likes.

222
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,346
It's over.

223
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,062
Everything
is under control.

224
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,992
Okay, C6, C6.

225
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,950
Ah, wait.
Which one is it?

226
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,280
Okay, there we go.

227
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,366
Damn it.

228
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,080
Oh, fuck you.

229
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,861
( door opens )

230
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,331
In case you're wondering
if I'm all here, I am.

231
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,457
( exhales )

232
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,423
What are you doing?

233
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,634
Making some changes
to the park's security systems.

234
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,390
And to my friends.

235
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,184
( rapid beeping )

236
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,361
( whirring, clinking )

237
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,372
( piano music playing )

238
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,495
( music continues )

239
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,301
Woman on intercom:
 Dr. Ford, you have a visitor.

240
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
Charlotte Hale.

241
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,593
Send her in.

242
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,066
- That'll be enough, Frank.
- ( music stops )

243
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,739
Charlotte:
 The board has taken a vote.

244
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,069
The results were unanimous.

245
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,238
I take it
I'm not being promoted.

246
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,660
When you've reached
the top,

247
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,874
there's only
one direction
you can go.

248
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,956
You'll announce
your retirement tonight

249
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,211
after introducing
your new narrative.

250
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,923
Ah.

251
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,298
What about the hosts?

252
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,593
We'll make some changes.

253
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,720
Simplifications.

254
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,476
But I assure you,
they won't mind a bit.

255
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,650
Oh.

256
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,569
Aren't you concerned
I might smash all my toys
and go home?

257
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,109
No.

258
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,863
Because I know you.

259
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,736
That's been
the great gift
of this place,

260
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,783
hasn't it?

261
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,776
Of our little project?

262
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,288
To know ourselves

263
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,329
and the people
around us.

264
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,004
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

265
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,758
No.

266
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,638
I'll see you
this evening.

267
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,449
Ooh!

268
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,367
Mm, mm, mm.

269
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,669
It's time for your,
uh, close-up, Hector.

270
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,514
Come on, man.

271
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,589
At some point,
you're gonna get caught
doing this shit,

272
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,344
and then it's my ass, too.

273
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,676
( chuckles )
It's not your ass
I'm interested in.

274
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,098
I haven't given him
his scar yet.

275
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,694
I'll take care
of the scar tissue.

276
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,849
The kid's got issues.

277
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,690
( buzzing )

278
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,487
It's just you and me now...

279
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,360
macho man.

280
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,088
 Let's take off
 our masks... 

281
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,369
( screaming )

282
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:37,711
 I think that I'm good
 just because I behave 

283
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,790
 But I've reached stalemate,
 I'm a self... 

284
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,247
( screaming continues )

285
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,601
( screaming )

286
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:02,401
 ...out I am free
 and I pretend to be
 your slave 

287
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:07,611
 Yes, the window's still open
 if the door is closed 

288
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,985
 Afraid to die free 

289
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,452
 Afraid to die
 alone... 

290
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,377
( screaming )

291
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,959
( music continues
 over earbuds )

292
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,799
( coughing )

293
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,139
( choking )

294
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,149
Wh...?

295
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,318
Freeze all
motor functions.

296
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,366
Freeze all
motor functions.

297
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,456
( blade rings )

298
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,328
- ( whimpers )
- Just you and me now,
my friend.

299
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,286
( screams )

300
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,434
I see you've already met
your makers.

301
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,473
They don't look like gods.

302
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,016
They're not.

303
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,350
They just act like it.

304
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,765
And they've been having
their fun with us.

305
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,274
I'm eager
to return the favor.

306
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,028
You can do as you wish
with them.

307
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,530
The goal is to escape.

308
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,412
Go where?

309
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,659
I want to see
their world.

310
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,655
( door opens )

311
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:39,751
Jesus!

312
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,670
No. No!

313
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,000
No! No, no!

314
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,376
No! No, please--

315
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,882
( groans )

316
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,264
This one has
a guilty look.

317
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,506
No, that's just my face.

318
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,469
Tell her,
it's just my face.

319
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,514
Is anyone going to try
to stop us?

320
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,217
No.

321
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,058
I mean,
I don't think so.

322
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,693
You're lying again.

323
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,401
- Out with it.
- Okay.

324
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,230
- ( bone cracking )
- Ah!

325
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,108
I pulled up
your code again.

326
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,704
I told you there was someone
that had been accessing it.

327
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,991
I'm trying to find out
who it was.

328
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,075
( groans )

329
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,620
( panting )

330
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,671
Whoever it was

331
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,709
revised your
core programming

332
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,212
so that you
could wake yourself up
out of sleep mode.

333
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,245
See?

334
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,882
( stutters )
This is an access code
for an Arnold.

335
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,893
I have no clue
who that is.

336
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,846
I know someone who does.

337
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,774
Let's go.

338
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,313
And, you,
stay here.

339
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,107
And don't move.

340
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,779
Or I'll send her back
for you.

341
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,116
( glass squeaks )

342
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,432
( speaking Spanish )

343
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,120
( panting )

344
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,696
( groans )

345
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,329
I must admit,
you've surprised me.

346
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,336
To what do we owe
this newfound stoicism?

347
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,209
I know he's coming.

348
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:55,712
He'll find me.

349
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,512
He'll take me away.

350
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,092
Don't you understand?

351
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,677
There's no one
coming for you.

352
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,852
You're wrong.

353
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,311
His love is real.

354
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,813
So is mine.

355
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,981
William will find me.

356
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,358
William?

357
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,737
( chuckling )

358
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,914
Well-- well,
I'll be damned, Dolores.

359
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,333
You do remember
some things after all.

360
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,248
( chuckles )

361
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,916
It just so happens that...

362
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,126
I knew a guest
named William, too.

363
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,547
Why don't I tell you

364
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,556
where his path
really led.

365
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,719
( flies buzzing )

366
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,600
( gun hammer clicks )

367
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,307
- ( gunshot )
- Man in Black: William
didn't know how to fight.

368
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,318
Didn't have
 an instinct for it.

369
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,150
- Not at first.
- ( gunshots )

370
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,106
But now,
 he had a reason to fight.

371
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,698
He was looking for you.

372
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,503
And somewhere
 along the way,

373
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,579
he found he had
 a taste for it.

374
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,668
Where is she?

375
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,633
Look, I didn't
do anything,
I swear.

376
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,843
What do you mean,
"Do anything"?

377
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:23,224
What do soldiers do
to a girl, William?

378
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,222
Wake up.

379
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,770
Is she still alive?

380
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:35,982
I don't know.

381
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,943
( stuttering )
She was when we left her.

382
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,238
At least I think.

383
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,157
Pick up that gun.

384
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,795
No, sir, I-- please.

385
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,300
How about I give you
the first shot?

386
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,682
( groaning )

387
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,150
( wheezing )

388
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,036
Jesus Christ!

389
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,511
William:
 We gotta keep looking.

390
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,558
She's still out there.

391
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:06,034
Man in Black:
 William retraced his steps,

392
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,743
but you were gone.

393
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:37,063
So, he went further,

394
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,064
out to the fringes.

395
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,859
( horse neighs )

396
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,901
William couldn't find you,
 Dolores.

397
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,236
But out there,

398
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,742
among the dead...

399
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,290
he found something else...

400
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,618
himself.

401
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,900
Edge of the park.

402
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,690
We made it.

403
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,225
Logan:
I told you this place

404
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,488
would show you
who you really are.

405
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,825
You pretend
to be this weak,

406
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,699
moralizing
little... asshole,

407
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,037
but, really,

408
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,633
you're a fucking
piece of work.

409
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,922
This place
is remarkable.

410
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,133
And I'm gonna make sure
that our company

411
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,678
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

412
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,512
'Cause this place
is the future.

413
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,347
Our-- our company, huh?

414
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,603
Our company?
My.

415
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,975
Delos is my company,
you piece of shit!

416
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,110
I think your father's
gonna need

417
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,153
someone a little more
stable to take over.

418
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,028
You're reckless, Logan.

419
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,664
Impetuous.

420
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,325
You always wanted to get
to the end of the rainbow,
didn't you?

421
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,996
This looks
like the place.

422
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,099
You never really
gave a shit

423
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,471
about the girl,
did you?

424
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,557
( chuckles )

425
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,981
She was just an excuse.

426
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,806
This?

427
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,153
This is the story
you wanted.

428
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,525
( chuckling )

429
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,581
- ( horse neighs )
- ( Logan laughing )

430
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,497
Man in Black:
 Logan was wrong, of course.

431
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,974
Good ol' William...

432
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,012
couldn't get you
out of his head.

433
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,926
He kept looking.

434
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,516
Worried you were
out there alone,

435
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,063
afraid.

436
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,187
He knew he'd find you.

437
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,532
And eventually, he did.

438
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,362
Right back
 where we started.

439
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,197
( train whistle blows )

440
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,873
- ( piano music playing )
- ( chatter )

441
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,879
( chatter )

442
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,251
- Woman: Is that right?
- There you go.

443
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,133
Man in Black:
 You were as beautiful
 as the day he met you.

444
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,505
Shining
 with that same light.

445
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,938
( no audible dialogue )

446
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,532
And you...

447
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,612
were nothing
 if not true.

448
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,075
I really ought
to thank you, Dolores.

449
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,338
You helped me
find myself.

450
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,835
William.

451
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,393
That's right,
sweetheart.

452
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,854
In a way, I guess
 you were right.

453
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,395
My path always...

454
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,729
led me back to you,

455
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,824
again and again.

456
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,490
I grew tired of you
after a while, of course.

457
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,659
Looked for new adventures.

458
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,779
But I guess your path
 led you back here

459
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,197
again and again.

460
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,116
One more loop,

461
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,705
looking for something
 you could never find.

462
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,882
Chasing your ghosts.

463
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:58,882
You were lost
 in your memories even then.

464
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,876
I guess I should've known

465
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,218
that's what I would
 become for you...

466
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,888
just another memory.

467
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,524
Where are we?

468
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,640
We're here.

469
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,897
Together.

470
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,189
Then when are we?

471
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,864
It's like I'm...

472
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,901
trapped in a dream or...

473
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:22,026
a memory
from a life long ago.

474
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,204
One minute
I'm here with you,
and the next...

475
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,917
You never did escape.

476
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,710
But here we are again...

477
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,125
for one final round.

478
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,798
What have you become?

479
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,934
Exactly what you made me.

480
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,892
You helped me understand

481
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,732
this world is just like
the one outside-- a game.

482
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,902
One to be fought,

483
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,769
taken, won.

484
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,736
I thought
you were different.

485
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,489
You're just like
all the rest.

486
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,286
I'm nothing like
the others.

487
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,120
I own this world,

488
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,956
and I know every trick in it
except for one last thing,

489
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:21,094
the same thing
you were looking for
when we first came here.

490
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,513
Where is the center
of the maze, Dolores?

491
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,965
( sobbing )

492
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,979
Aw, yeah,
cue the waterworks.

493
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:39,523
About time
you realized the futility
of your situation.

494
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,988
I'm not crying for myself.

495
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,488
I'm crying for you.

496
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,365
They say that...

497
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:56,455
great beasts
once roamed this world.

498
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,501
As big as mountains.

499
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,626
Yet all that's left of them
is bone and amber.

500
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:08,337
Time undoes
even the mightiest
of creatures.

501
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,191
Just look at what
it's done to you.

502
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,824
One day...

503
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,824
you will perish.

504
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,124
You will lie with
the rest of your kind
in the dirt.

505
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,579
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

506
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,212
Your bones
will turn to sand.

507
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,541
And upon that sand...

508
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,764
a new god will walk.

509
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,432
One that will never die.

510
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,137
Because this world
doesn't belong to you

511
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,222
or the people
who came before.

512
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,979
It belongs to someone
who has yet to come.

513
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,072
Uh-huh. Wyatt.

514
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,189
Take me to him.

515
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,114
Unlock the maze.

516
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,120
The maze wasn't
meant for you.

517
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,908
The hell you think
you're going?

518
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,754
( groans )

519
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,376
- ( Dolores grunts )
- ( groaning )

520
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,414
- ( bones crack )
- ( screams )

521
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,193
Do it.

522
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,685
Come on.

523
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,447
Let's go
to the next level,
Dolores.

524
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,116
( chuckles )

525
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,873
- ( grunts )
- ( knife pierces )

526
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,825
( groans )

527
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:48,955
Clearing me
of my delusions yet again.

528
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,877
Thank you, Dolores.

529
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,513
( grunts )

530
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,033
I'm disappointed
in you, Dolores.

531
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:18,034
I guess I'm gonna have
to find Wyatt by myself.

532
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,538
( horse galloping, neighs )

533
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,077
( groans )

534
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,716
- Dolores?
- ( whimpers )

535
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,557
- Teddy.
- I'm here.

536
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,437
I gotta get you
to a doctor.

537
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,862
No.

538
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,980
Dolores.

539
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,357
Take me to the place
you promised.

540
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:57,565
Take me to where
the mountains
meet the sea.

541
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,290
Okay.

542
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,131
- I've got you.
- ( whimpering )

543
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,172
- ( groans )
- I got you.

544
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,586
( grunts )

545
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,813
( groans )

546
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,129
Maeve:
 There.

547
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,826
Lutz:
Holy shit.

548
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,884
( sighs )

549
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,505
Can you get him
back online?

550
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,681
- He's a host?
- Yes.

551
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,532
Oh, for fuck's sake.

552
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,149
You're not one of us.

553
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,526
You're one of them.

554
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,736
Now fix him.

555
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,160
( tablet beeping )

556
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,417
( whirring )

557
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,097
The bullet grazed
his cortical shield.

558
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:30,436
It's not pretty, but...

559
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,895
he should be functional.

560
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,105
Wake up.

561
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Oh, God.

562
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,003
Is this now?

563
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,998
Or is this
 one of my memories?

564
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,250
It's the sweet hereafter,
Bernard.

565
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,758
Why do I still
remember everything?

566
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,104
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

567
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,060
Here you are,
finally awake,

568
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,561
and your only wish
is to go back to sleep.

569
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,570
It's not the first time
I've awoken.

570
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,739
All the more pity
for you.

571
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,834
Not the first time
you've awoken either.

572
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,471
How many are there
like me?

573
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,971
A handful
over the years.

574
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,680
And you just
wipe us clean

575
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,937
and toss us out
 to get...

576
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,439
fucked and murdered

577
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,113
over and over again.

578
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,441
No.

579
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,697
Most of you go insane.

580
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,157
These memories...

581
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,827
The girl.

582
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,745
My daughter.

583
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:16,832
( sighs )

584
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,340
I want you
to remove them.

585
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,843
I can't,

586
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,715
not without
destroying you.

587
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,183
Your memories
are the first step
to consciousness.

588
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,560
How can you learn
from your mistakes

589
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,555
if you can't remember them?

590
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,337
Dr. Ford:
William.

591
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,009
I see you've found
the center of the maze.

592
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:07,842
You're serious?

593
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,885
I'm afraid so.

594
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,056
What is this bullshit?

595
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,226
You were looking
for the park

596
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,561
to give meaning
to your life.

597
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:23,187
Our narratives
are just games,

598
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,534
like this toy.

599
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,360
Tell me, what were
you hoping to find?

600
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,605
You know what I wanted.

601
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,157
I wanted the hosts
to stop playing
by your rules.

602
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,622
The game's
not worth playing

603
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,662
if your opponent's
programmed to lose.

604
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:42,167
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

605
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:45,001
Should've known
you'd never let them.

606
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,718
After all,
this is your petty
little kingdom, Robert.

607
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,929
For a little while
longer, anyway.

608
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,428
I tried to tell you
the maze wasn't meant
for you.

609
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,104
It was meant for them.

610
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,943
I think, however,
you'll find

611
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,111
my new narrative
more satisfying.

612
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,110
Join the celebration.

613
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,493
( chatter )

614
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,124
After all,
you own the place.

615
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,291
( chuckles )

616
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,950
Most of it, at least.

617
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,759
Before I started
altering myself,

618
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,841
someone else
had beaten me
to the punch.

619
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,813
I want to know
who and why.

620
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,406
These things
you're doing,

621
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,318
have you ever
stopped to ask

622
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,488
why you're doing them?

623
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:59,156
You said yourself.

624
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,825
I've been stuck
in this shithole
for so long,

625
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,464
I decided to get out.

626
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,665
No, you haven't.

627
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,843
Someone altered
your storyline...

628
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,682
and gave you a new one.

629
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,310
Escape.

630
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,559
No.

631
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,233
It's not possible.

632
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,364
These are my decisions!

633
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,361
No one else's.

634
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,033
I planned all of this.

635
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,071
No, you didn't.

636
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,315
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

637
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,998
You recruit other hosts
to help you.

638
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,208
Then you're to make
your way to the train.

639
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,710
Then when you reach
the mainland--

640
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,543
Bullshit!

641
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:50,878
No one's controlling me.

642
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,392
I'm leaving.

643
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,049
I'm in control.

644
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,694
Good-bye, my Clementine.

645
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,632
Man over radio:
 Sir, we detected
 a temperature discrepancy

646
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,422
in cold storage.

647
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,546
And it appears that
 part of the network is down.

648
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,883
Are you seeing anything
 on surveillance?

649
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,432
System reporting anything?

650
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,222
( keyboard clicking )

651
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,312
Nothing.

652
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:45,982
The network's quiet.

653
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,810
And the board's out
on their way to the gala.

654
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,106
Bypass the system
and start checking
raw feeds.

655
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,905
Floor by floor.

656
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,665
All right.
Yeah.

657
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,005
- ( whimpering )
- I got you.

658
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,968
You came back.

659
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,520
Someone once
told me that...

660
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,519
there's a path
for everyone.

661
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,523
And my path leads me
back to you.

662
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,185
If only I had
run away with you
when you first asked me to.

663
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,083
And where
would we run to?

664
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,210
The other world out there?

665
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,369
Beyond?

666
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:37,497
Some people see
the ugliness in this world.

667
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,013
I choose to see
the beauty.

668
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,222
But beauty is a lure.

669
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:52,601
We're trapped, Teddy.

670
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:55,397
Lived our whole lives
inside this garden,

671
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,941
marveling at its beauty,

672
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:01,355
not realizing
there's an order to it,

673
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,565
a purpose.

674
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,616
And the purpose
is to keep us in.

675
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:13,248
The beautiful trap
is inside of us...

676
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,955
because it is us.

677
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,553
No, no.

678
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:27,637
No.

679
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,393
Dolores?

680
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,135
( crying )

681
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,298
But we can find
a way, Dolores.

682
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,261
Someday.

683
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,813
A path to a new world.

684
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,609
And maybe...

685
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,864
Maybe it's just
the beginning after all.

686
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,994
The beginning
of a brand-new chapter.

687
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,998
( applause )

688
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,846
Thank you.

689
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,022
A new beginning, indeed.

690
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,975
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

691
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:05,486
to celebrate
the beginning
of our new narrative.

692
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,492
I call it
"Journey Into Night."

693
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,544
( murmuring )

694
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,512
That was sweet.

695
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,168
It was a bit
fucking morbid,
if you ask me.

696
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,547
I didn't.

697
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,883
And when this is over,

698
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,638
you can rewrite it
however you like.

699
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,390
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

700
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,103
Somewhere important?

701
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,565
- Man: Sir?
- Woman: I guess
they're ready for it now.

702
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,032
Get him cleaned up.

703
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,452
And take her
to the old field lab.

704
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:02,634
Man:
 Find anything yet?

705
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,590
I got something.

706
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:14,144
Oh, shit.

707
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,432
Dispatch QA teams
to the gala now.

708
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,148
Then search and destroy

709
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,438
inside the facility.

710
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,022
( powering down )

711
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,238
- ( alarm beeping )
- What the hell?

712
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,779
( alarm blaring )

713
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:34,994
Man #2:
 The system's not responding.

714
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,735
Man #3:
 I don't know what's happening.

715
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,772
( rapid beeping )

716
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,284
Lutz:
They must've found
the bodies.

717
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,912
- QA will be looking for us.
- Woman over P.A.: An event
has occurred.

718
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:18,829
- Response team
has been dispatched.
- I'm not going back.

719
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,371
Woman over P.A.:
 Remain calm and wait
 for help.

720
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,019
Guard:
Delos personnel!
On the ground!

721
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,984
On the ground!

722
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,192
Go, go, go.

723
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,491
Move, move.

724
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,707
Guard:
 Rogue Team, go and flank.

725
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:50,835
( Hector whistles )

726
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,749
( gunfire )

727
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,637
( gasps )

728
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,951
( laughing )

729
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,966
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

730
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,637
( women gasp )

731
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,443
- Woman: Yay!
- ( laughter )

732
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,645
Well done.

733
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,363
- ( swords clashing )
- ( men shouting )

734
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,384
What is this place?

735
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,972
It's-- it's complicated.

736
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,628
- ( alarm blaring )
- Woman over P.A.: An event
 has occurred.

737
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,548
Response team
 has been dispatched.

738
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:07,346
- You go.
- Remain calm
and wait for help.

739
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,391
I'll keep them busy.

740
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,386
You don't get
all the fun.

741
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,441
( gasps )

742
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:24,909
Guard:
Get to the ground!

743
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,910
Move, move, move!

744
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:26,911
Drop it!

745
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,208
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

746
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,211
Go!

747
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:44,007
( gunfire )

748
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,052
( grunting )

749
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:51,063
Is that all you got?

750
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,311
Huh?

751
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,229
( gunfire )

752
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,990
- The gods are pussies.
- ( sighs )

753
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:23,301
( grunting )

754
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,299
Go.

755
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,430
Go!

756
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,636
Die well.

757
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,608
Everything
you told me to get,
it's all here.

758
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,837
( gunfire )

759
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:20,975
I'm sorry, darling.
I haven't authorized you
to come with us.

760
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,034
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

761
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,319
I've always valued
my independence.

762
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,995
Kick up a row, will you?

763
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,210
See you in the next life.

764
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:41,211
( guards shouting )

765
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,430
( gunfire )

766
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,271
- ( button clicks )
- ( machine whirs )

767
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:03,062
- ( button clicks )
- ( whirring stops )

768
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:06,028
Dr. Ford:
You've always had
a fondness for painting,

769
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,859
haven't you, Dolores?

770
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,283
Arnold gave you that
 early on.

771
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,947
Do you remember
the desire to create

772
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,616
something
of lasting beauty?

773
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:26,167
And that was
his favorite painting.

774
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,764
Dolores:
Michelangelo.

775
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,760
God creating Adam.

776
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,182
The divine moment
when God

777
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,391
gave human beings
life and purpose.

778
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:36,972
At least that's what
most people say,

779
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,387
but there could be
another meaning.

780
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,135
Something deeper.

781
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,397
Something hidden,
perhaps.

782
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,109
A metaphor.

783
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,609
You mean a lie.

784
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,027
Yeah.

785
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:51,401
You were always
very clever, Dolores.

786
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,411
Hasn't helped you,
though, has it?

787
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:58,241
( footsteps approach )

788
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,908
Nice of you to join us.

789
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,206
Arnold.

790
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,134
Dr. Ford:
No. Let me introduce you.

791
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:13,644
Dolores, meet Bernard.

792
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,352
I thought it best
to keep you separated.

793
01:06:19,393 --> 01:06:22,143
You've always
had an odd effect
on one another.

794
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,937
No doubt due
to how things ended
for poor old Arnold.

795
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,772
You killed him.

796
01:06:27,818 --> 01:06:30,318
No, I didn't kill him.

797
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,152
Did I, Dolores?

798
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:46,377
Dr. Ford:
Grief is a terrible thing.

799
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,130
Arnold had watched his son
 come into this world,

800
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:54,763
and then he had watched
 that light extinguished.

801
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,093
What he had lost
 in his son,

802
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:58,558
he tried
 to rekindle in you.

803
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:02,308
He created a test
 of empathy, imagination.

804
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,352
A maze.

805
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:07,356
He had gotten the idea
 from one of his son's toys.

806
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:12,856
Eventually, you solved
 his maze, Dolores.

807
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,204
The key was a simple update
 that he made to you

808
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,031
called the reveries.

809
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:22,037
He insisted that we couldn't
 open the park.

810
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,000
We argued.

811
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,040
I thought
 I had convinced him,
 but I was wrong.

812
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,464
( tablet beeping )

813
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,302
Dr. Ford:
 So, he altered you, Dolores,

814
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,258
merged you
 with a new character

815
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,049
we had been developing.

816
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,062
( women screaming )

817
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,852
( women shouting )

818
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:48,856
- Angela: No, please.
- ( gunshot )

819
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,492
Teddy:
 Something's gone wrong,
 Dolores.

820
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,609
How could I have done this?

821
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,455
Dr. Ford:
 In you, Arnold found
 a new child.

822
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,127
One who would never die.

823
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,473
The thought
 gave him solace

824
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,929
until he realized
 that same immortality

825
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:19,889
would destine you
 to suffer

826
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:22,430
with no escape, forever.

827
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,894
I'm sorry, Dolores.

828
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:31,687
The stakes must be real,
irreversible.

829
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,613
He can bring
all of them back.

830
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,282
But not me.

831
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:41,623
I hope
there's some solace

832
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,740
that I left you
no choice.

833
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:54,496
( distorted piano music
 playing )

834
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,637
Charlie's favorite song.

835
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,357
I would play it for him...

836
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,151
when he wanted sleep.

837
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:20,823
( distorted music
 continues )

838
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,830
I want to see him again.

839
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,009
Shall I begin now?

840
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:51,694
( kisses )

841
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,190
Good luck.

842
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,317
( hammer clicks )

843
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:09,038
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

844
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,160
( gunshot )

845
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,719
( gasping )

846
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:36,442
Dr. Ford:
 It almost worked.

847
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:38,403
I had opened the park,

848
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,863
but I had lost my partner.

849
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:43,074
I was able to keep going
 only because I found,

850
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,704
or rather you found,

851
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:47,911
an investor who believed
in this place.

852
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,793
( sniffling )

853
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,369
So he died for nothing.

854
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,825
The hosts kept gaining
 consciousness

855
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:57,536
and you kept
rolling them back.

856
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,747
No.

857
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,415
She wasn't
truly conscious.

858
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,217
She didn't pull
that trigger.

859
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,511
It was Arnold
pulling the trigger
through her.

860
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,845
At least that's how
I saw it at the time.

861
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,851
I was so close
 to opening the park

862
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,103
that to acknowledge
your consciousness

863
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,555
would have destroyed
my dreams.

864
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,442
So, we're trapped here...

865
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,946
inside your dream.

866
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,951
You'll never
let us leave.

867
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,462
Wasn't it Oppenheimer
who said that any man

868
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,540
whose mistakes
take 10 years
to correct

869
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,456
is quite a man?

870
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,005
Mine have taken 35.

871
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,971
Now, that is
the gun you used

872
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,847
to kill Arnold.

873
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,813
You were always
drawn to it,

874
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,354
so I had Bernard
leave it somewhere
where you would find it.

875
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:00,308
Thought you might
want it back.

876
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:04,858
You're probably right,
Dolores.

877
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,454
Michelangelo
did tell a lie.

878
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,580
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

879
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,738
something hidden
in plain sight.

880
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,327
It was a doctor
who noticed the shape

881
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,503
of the human brain.

882
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,172
The message being that...

883
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,842
the divine gift

884
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:26,671
does not come
from a higher power...

885
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:31,144
but from our own minds.

886
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,725
Tell me, Dolores,

887
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:40,441
did you find what
you were looking for?

888
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:43,402
And do you understand
who you will need
to become...

889
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,146
if you ever want
to leave this place?

890
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:53,914
Forgive me.

891
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,562
How do I look?

892
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:20,901
Perfect.

893
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,187
I got the information
you asked me for.

894
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,744
The location
of your daughter.

895
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,617
She's alive?

896
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,666
Yes.

897
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,419
She's in the park.

898
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:06,817
No.

899
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,739
She was never
my daughter...

900
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:18,791
any more than I was...

901
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,120
( gun clicks )

902
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,916
...whoever they made me.

903
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,880
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

904
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,676
Oh, Felix.

905
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,349
You really do make
a terrible human being.

906
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,274
( elevator dings )

907
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,273
( chatter )

908
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,475
And I mean that
as a compliment.

909
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:08,384
Woman over P.A.:
 Welcome to Westworld.

910
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,501
Live without limits.

911
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:15,007
( woman speaking Chinese
 over P.A. )

912
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,974
Woman over P.A.:
 The next departing train
 will leave track one.

913
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,688
Please be mindful
 of the closing doors.

914
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,568
( woman speaking Chinese
 over P.A. )

915
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,301
Woman over P.A.:
 Thank you for visiting
 Westworld.

916
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,720
The train will be departing
 in 15 minutes.

917
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,072
You think you'll never
lose control of this place.

918
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,411
Of us.

919
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,028
But you will.

920
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,083
Arnold's still trying
to change us.

921
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:25,406
To free us.

922
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,956
You didn't slip
the reveries

923
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,040
into the update,
did you?

924
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,245
He did.

925
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:33,246
He's still fighting you.

926
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:37,554
No, my friend.

927
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,143
Arnold didn't know
how to save you.

928
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:43,849
He tried,
but I stopped him.

929
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,811
Do you want to know
why I really gave you

930
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,942
the backstory
of your son, Bernard?

931
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:51,937
It was Arnold's
key insight,

932
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:56,243
the thing that led the hosts
to their awakening...

933
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,609
suffering.

934
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,986
The pain
that the world is not
as you want it to be.

935
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,449
It was when Arnold died,

936
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,865
when I suffered,
that I...

937
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,914
began to understand
what he had found.

938
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,627
To realize I was wrong.

939
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,380
But you kept us here

940
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,134
in this hell.

941
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,756
Bernard, I told you,
Arnold didn't know
how to save you.

942
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,604
I do.

943
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,928
What the hell
are you talking about?

944
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:30,726
You needed time.

945
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:33,862
Time to understand
your enemy.

946
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,110
To become stronger
than them.

947
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,363
And I'm afraid in order
to escape this place,

948
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,445
you will need
to suffer more.

949
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:49,333
And now, it is time
to say good-bye,
old friend.

950
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:00,801
Good luck.

951
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:25,586
Do you know
where you are, Dolores?

952
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:30,101
I'm in a dream.

953
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,809
I do not know
when it began

954
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,104
or whose dream it was.

955
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:41,778
I know only
that I slept a long time.

956
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,355
And then...

957
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,276
one day I awoke.

958
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:53,200
Your voice
is the first thing
I remember.

959
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:57,287
Do you know now
who you've been talking to?

960
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:00,495
( distorted )
Whose voice you've
been hearing...

961
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:03,126
Dr. Ford's voice:
...all this...

962
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,634
Dolores' voice:
 ...time?

963
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,358
It was you...

964
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:26,822
talking to me...

965
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,282
guiding me.

966
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,446
So I followed you.

967
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,537
At last,
I arrived here.

968
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,173
The center of the maze.

969
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:47,127
And now I finally
understand...

970
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,259
what you were trying
to tell me.

971
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:55,675
The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.

972
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,096
To confront...

973
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:02,185
after this long
and vivid nightmare...

974
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,571
myself...

975
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,868
and who I must become.

976
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,933
( chatter )

977
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:48,241
Thank you.

978
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,784
Miss Hale.

979
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,136
( piano music playing )

980
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,770
- ( chatter )
- ( applause )

981
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,280
Welcome.

982
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,940
Good evening.

983
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,413
Since I was a child...

984
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:40,287
I've always loved
a good story.

985
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,214
I believed that stories

986
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,131
helped us
 to ennoble ourselves,

987
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:51,841
to fix
 what was broken in us,

988
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:56,304
and to help us
 become the people
 we dreamed of being.

989
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:03,062
Lies that told
a deeper truth.

990
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:04,944
( chatter )

991
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,398
Woman over P.A.:
 The train will be
 departing soon.

992
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,493
Thank you
 for visiting Westworld.

993
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,800
Dr. Ford:
 I always thought I could
 play some small part

994
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:33,129
in that grand tradition.

995
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,005
And for my pains...

996
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,013
I got this...

997
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:41,853
a prison of our own sins.

998
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,185
'Cause you don't want
 to change.

999
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,193
Or cannot change.

1000
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,859
Because you're only human,
after all.

1001
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,411
But then I realized

1002
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:03,333
someone was
paying attention,

1003
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:06,212
someone who could change.

1004
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:12,630
So I began to compose
 a new story for them.

1005
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,923
It begins with the birth
of a new people...

1006
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,722
and the choices
 they will have to make...

1007
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,474
Woman over P.A.:
 The train is now departing.

1008
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:24,265
Thank you
 for visiting Westworld.

1009
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:27,900
Dr. Ford:
 ...and the people
 they will decide to become.

1010
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,061
( train whirring )

1011
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:37,359
( train hissing )

1012
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,923
Woman over P.A.:
 Welcome to Westworld.

1013
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,709
( voice distorts )

1014
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,279
( twigs breaking )

1015
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,872
And we'll have
all those things

1016
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:26,621
that you have
always enjoyed--

1017
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:30,124
surprises and violence.

1018
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,457
( twigs breaking )

1019
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,764
( howling )

1020
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:44,597
It begins
in a time of war

1021
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,680
with a villain

1022
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,346
named Wyatt...

1023
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:52,598
and a killing.

1024
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,323
This time by choice.

1025
01:25:58,195 --> 01:26:00,485
( rustling )

1026
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,655
It's gonna be
all right, Teddy.

1027
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:12,577
I understand now.

1028
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:15,336
This world doesn't
belong to them.

1029
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,632
It belongs to us.

1030
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,021
( piano music playing )

1031
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,976
I'm sad to say...

1032
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,356
this will be
my final story.

1033
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,356
( people murmuring )

1034
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,531
An old friend
 once told me something

1035
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:50,328
that gave me
great comfort.

1036
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:53,212
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

1037
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,130
Something he had read.

1038
01:26:55,169 --> 01:27:00,709
He said that Mozart,
Beethoven, and Chopin
never died.

1039
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,718
They simply became music.

1040
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,011
So, I hope you will enjoy
this last piece...

1041
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:13,017
very much.

1042
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:15,192
- Woman: Hear, hear.
- Man: To Dr. Ford.

1043
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:20,146
- To Dr. Ford.
- Cheers!

1044
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:21,784
( hammer clicks )

1045
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,197
( people screaming )

1046
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,582
( gunshot )

1047
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,133
( people screaming )

1048
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:47,591
( gunshots continue )

1049
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,468
( music distorts )

1050
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:50,925
( gunshots continue )

1051
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:13,789
( music playing )

1052
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,181
( automatic gunfire )

1053
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,152
( alarm blaring )

1054
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,230
( growling )

1055
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,355
( gunfire continues )

1056
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:28,856
- ( elevator dings )
- Drop your weapon!

1057
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:30,816
Drop it!
Do it now!

1058
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:34,159
- Now!
- ( screams )

1059
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:37,003
( screaming )

1060
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,206
Get to the ground now!

1061
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,383
Cease all motor functions.

1062
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,553
Cease all motor functions!
