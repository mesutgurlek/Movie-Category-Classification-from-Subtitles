1
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:55,300
DON'T TOUCH THE WHlTE WOMAN

2
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,239
Everything is in shambles,

3
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,145
Industry, commerce, cattle farmers,
means of communication,,,,

4
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,310
The economy is stagnant,
progress is at a standstill,

5
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,012
And who is responsible for all this?

6
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:23,555
These little rascals,

7
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,626
These miserable
and dirty individuals,

8
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:32,995
thieves, liars, hypocrites, murderers,
vulgar non-believers,,,,

9
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,293
It is our fault!

10
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,869
We've wasted too much time
trying to integrate them,

11
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,531
to make human beings,
civilized men out of them,

12
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,609
Gentlemen, my department staff
is doing everything they can,

13
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,874
but it is a very difficult endeavor,

14
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,347
They are anarchists!

15
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,974
George,,,,

16
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:55,213
Anarchists?
You mean savages?

17
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,254
Hello!

18
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:59,018
This is Anthropology Professor
Pinkerton,

19
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,583
We were in college together,

20
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,961
These people refuse to recognize
the value of private property

21
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,159
and how one can benefit from it,

22
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,259
They don't accept
the selfish principles

23
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,931
that were given to human nature
by divine providence,

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,337
And, sir, excuse me,

25
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,342
This conversation is confidential,

26
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,242
If you wouldn't mind leaving us,

27
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,976
Gentlemen, I think it's time we
do away with these sub-humans,

28
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,609
so that our race can accomplish
without delay

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,551
the mission that was entrusted to us:

30
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:31,488
conquer this continent
and establish civilization here,

31
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,582
Do away? But how?

32
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,318
We are responsible,

33
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,658
We need to respond to the resistance
of these miserable people

34
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,994
with a determined
and aggressive action,

35
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,591
even if that should mean
the annihilation of these people:

36
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,226
men, women and children,

37
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:47,363
It is the only solution if we want
to treat the roots of the issue,

38
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:49,999
No, gentlemen! This is impossible!
We are not barbarians,

39
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,546
The more we kill this year, the less
we will have to kill next year,

40
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,171
The more I get to know
these miserable people,

41
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,910
the more I think that we either
have to kill them all

42
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,486
or keep them in an extremely
poor condition,

43
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:05,991
In the name of progress, we need
to apply, let's say, a final solution,

44
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,721
So, who are we going to trust
for this mission?

45
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,629
This is precisely the problem,
We need to be extremely discreet,

46
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,064
It's very important,

47
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,831
Do not underestimate the influence
of the press on public opinion,

48
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,566
Remember Watergate,

49
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,904
We are not politicians, General,

50
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,204
We represent this country's economy,

51
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:29,646
Which means progress
and civilization,

52
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,912
The army is only the armed division
of the country,

53
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,281
Precisely,

54
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:38,221
That is why the army must intervene
immediately, without hesitation,

55
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,385
To defend its highest interests,

56
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,062
What about Congress, gentlemen?

57
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:49,601
We are not politicians, General,

58
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:52,433
We represent our country's economy,

59
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,406
Which means progress
and civilization,

60
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,571
Gentlemen, I have given my life
to serve my country,

61
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:10,214
and I am happy to be given
a new opportunity to campaign,

62
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,089
I forgot to introduce you to Hermine,

63
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:18,290
a poor orphan who follows her father
everywhere on the field,

64
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,093
My dog,

65
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,161
Please,

66
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,363
Please,

67
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,031
Thank you,

68
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:38,614
Our president's magnetic eyes,

69
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,687
General, your life is too precious,

70
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:44,848
You will obviously conduct
the operations,

71
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,984
but as far as direct management
on the field,,,,

72
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:51,029
It would be better to choose
a less important leader,

73
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,326
You must not be at risk,

74
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,893
What do you mean, gentlemen?

75
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:01,906
Glory is born out of risk!

76
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:07,407
This project is strange,

77
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,345
We are forgetting the essential,

78
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,542
We found out your daughter
was getting married this fall,

79
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,710
Yes, my dear daughter,

80
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,883
Please accept these railway bonds
as a wedding present,

81
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,290
How nice,

82
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:23,658
Let's see,

83
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:29,559
Did you see that, Hermine?
How nice these gentlemen are!

84
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,572
This will make a nice stipend
for you when you become an adult,

85
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:40,869
So, who are you offering me
as a leader?

86
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,540
Custer,

87
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:49,819
Custer, I should have known,
The boy general, is that it?

88
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,448
Please, understand us, General,

89
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,187
Custer is a legend, a myth,

90
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,957
The whole country
will rally behind him,

91
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:02,023
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I have asthma, Please, leave me,

92
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,898
We have something else, General,

93
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,834
Get the nails!

94
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,604
I need to think about this, gentlemen,
This is a very serious decision,

95
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,278
What is this about?

96
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,685
Nails, For the inauguration
of the railway system,

97
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,486
How interesting,

98
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,296
Daddy, I want to count my bonds,

99
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,335
And how many inaugurations
can you have with these?

100
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:38,267
300,

101
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,498
300?

102
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,131
Progress is beautiful,

103
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:49,114
We shall cover the country
with railways,

104
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:59,591
But Custer is in Washington,
ostracized by our president,

105
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:05,028
He won't forgive him
for his stance in Congress,

106
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,395
Custer has recovered
our president's trust,

107
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:13,765
It's your fault, Sitting Bull!
You sign peace treaties,

108
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:17,172
And they wipe their ass
with our treaties,

109
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,801
They wipe their ass with them,

110
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:22,712
This is the soldiers' fury,

111
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:28,185
The wise President Nixon
ignores all this,

112
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,380
I hope,

113
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,354
They devastated our fields,

114
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,687
Yes, our fields,

115
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,624
They cut down our forests,

116
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,161
Yes, our forests,

117
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:38,890
They exterminated our game,

118
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:42,434
Yes, our game,

119
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,332
They poison us every day

120
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:48,168
with their alcohol
and their flour full of strychnine,

121
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:50,367
But don't listen to me,
I'm a madman,

122
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,808
We are condemned
to die on reservations,

123
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:56,507
They slaughter us as soon
as they have a chance,

124
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,585
but the president doesn't know
anything about it,

125
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,744
But don't listen to me,
I'm a madman,

126
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,220
The president doesn't know
anything about it,

127
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:07,987
I remember, as they were arriving,,,,

128
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:12,190
They are powerful,
You have not traveled,

129
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:15,131
I went to Washington,

130
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,102
They are not offering war,
They are offering peace,

131
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:24,871
For you, Sitting Bull, making peace
really means making peace,

132
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:29,005
For them,
it means preparing for a new war,

133
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:32,243
And the next one is imminent,
Sitting Bull,

134
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,185
-You want some?
-Here,

135
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,186
Why are you saying that, madman?

136
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:42,727
Because Custer is back,

137
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,440
Custer!

138
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,872
Custer!

139
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,608
Hello, gentlemen,

140
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,622
Excuse me, sir,

141
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:49,422
Excuse me, Madam,

142
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,358
Well!
A comb doesn't just disappear!

143
00:10:56,469 --> 00:11:01,930
It was here! I know it!
I take it with me in all my battles,

144
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,905
-I should have come on my horse,
-Darn! Custer!

145
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:06,740
You know me?

146
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:09,610
Who doesn't know
the General Custer?

147
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:10,910
May I introduce myself?

148
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,509
Professor Pinkerton,
Hartford Anthropology Department,

149
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,247
Nice meeting you,

150
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,118
Well?

151
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:19,418
I can't find it, sir,

152
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,694
Here's your comb,

153
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,964
-Thank you,
-My pleasure,

154
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,592
Thank you very much,

155
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,728
Anthropologist? Are you sure?

156
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,171
Anthropologist, yes,

157
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:41,546
It's Custer!

158
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:47,341
Welcome,

159
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:51,116
My brother, I am late,
I had lost my comb,

160
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,692
-Really?
-Let's go,

161
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,029
George, you want some coffee?

162
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:03,967
I had breakfast in the train,
It's included in the price,

163
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,096
Give me your book,

164
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,872
We spent a lot of money, George,

165
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:13,673
We had to find it somewhere,

166
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:19,743
With horse feed on my part and
your nephew with the troop rations,

167
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,251
we accomplished miracles,

168
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,548
I don't want to know,

169
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,921
Of course, All you care about
is your military and political career,

170
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:30,154
You don't realize
that many of the journalists

171
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:33,289
who defended you in Washington
were paid by us!

172
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,460
And nowadays, it is expensive,
Here,

173
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,840
Well, I need to change,

174
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,776
Where can I go?
Sergeant!

175
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,855
Are you doing all right, Commander?

176
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:03,224
I like chips, There are many kinds,
but these are the best,

177
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,695
To my taste,

178
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,776
You have magnificent hair, General,

179
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,716
Yes, it impresses the lndians,

180
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,481
Now, you understand
why this is important,

181
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:31,384
It's crucial,

182
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,189
Anthropologist?

183
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,091
Anthropologist,

184
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,185
You want some?

185
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,527
I only drink coffee in the morning,

186
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:45,696
Look, my old sergeant,
I brought you this from Boston,

187
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,335
-A telescope, That's very useful,
-Thank you, General,

188
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,533
Yes,

189
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,009
My regiment,

190
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,210
May l?

191
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,082
Please,

192
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,520
The glorious Custer flag,

193
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,941
Attention!

194
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,378
Scoundrels!

195
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:32,747
You're not soldiers!
You're scoundrels!

196
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,719
At ease!

197
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:46,759
Look at these,
They make wonderful show shoes,

198
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,333
Is that my General?

199
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,697
Yes,

200
00:14:58,244 --> 00:15:03,307
Bastard!
Why tomatoes?

201
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,086
Custer has arrived,

202
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,149
It's over for these wicked lndians,

203
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,856
I'm going to get dressed,

204
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,530
Family life is over,

205
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,335
Wake up!

206
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,209
What is this?

207
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,077
Idiots!

208
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:38,582
Bastards!

209
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:42,085
The General is here!
Don't you know what the army is?

210
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:45,089
Well, wake up!

211
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,950
My brother,
are these the men I left you?

212
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:52,861
Long live Custer! Long live Custer!

213
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,365
Long live Custer!

214
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,164
Long live Custer!

215
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,795
Long live Custer!

216
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,067
Long live Custer!

217
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,733
Long live Custer!

218
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:05,401
Custer!

219
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,342
Long live Custer!

220
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:09,414
Long live Custer!

221
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,574
Long live Custer!

222
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:12,742
Long live Custer!

223
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,412
Long live Custer!

224
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:19,423
Long live Custer!

225
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,287
Long live Custer!

226
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,759
Stop it, enough!
Get your guns!

227
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:23,886
Long live Custer!

228
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:33,337
Prepare!
Stand at attention!

229
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,634
Attention!

230
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:38,710
Shit!

231
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,377
Custer!

232
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,120
Custer!

233
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,195
Old chap,,,,

234
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:06,301
Look, I have a gift for you,
It's a scalp,

235
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:13,739
Hello, Colonel,

236
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,247
He's always drunk,

237
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:22,178
Let me smell your breath,

238
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,518
Things are going to change
around here,

239
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,057
For you, too, Major Reno,

240
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,595
Watch out for the shit, Custer,

241
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,672
Second line, first one to the right,

242
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:49,475
Second line, first one!

243
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,875
Turn around,

244
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,183
An lndian must not witness
a white man's punishment,

245
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,881
Lick it,

246
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,219
It's not my shit,

247
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:00,792
Lick it,

248
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,053
Do what he says!

249
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,150
Bastard!

250
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:33,623
Colonel Custer!

251
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,693
General Terry,

252
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:37,319
In my arms,

253
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,692
Beautiful fresco, isn't it?

254
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,997
It's our Sistine Chapel,

255
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:49,768
Come, I'm going to introduce you
to a few friends,

256
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:53,910
Did you have a nice trip?

257
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,105
Very nice, General,

258
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,943
What's new in Washington?

259
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,485
My only thought was to come back,

260
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,688
Colonel, may I introduce you
to civil society?

261
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,894
First of all, the political power
representatives,

262
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:21,200
Please, come forward,

263
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,307
Oh, yes,
Come here,

264
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,176
My daughter Hermine,

265
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:35,220
Our two guardian angels,
Sister Lucie, chief infirmary nurse,

266
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:39,587
and Marie-Hélène de Boismonfrais,

267
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,821
How is your whitlow doing, General?

268
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,193
Much better, my dear,
Thanks to you,

269
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,926
Nothing is more important
than meeting with political power,

270
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:50,001
Quick! Quick!

271
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,933
We'll just do a re-enactment,

272
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:55,803
Everything is possible for the press,
Come, Custer is waiting,

273
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:04,643
I like the opera,

274
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,047
Mozart?

275
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,415
Maybe,

276
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,957
Excuse us, General,

277
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,888
I'm Kellogg, a journalist,

278
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,860
I need to take a picture of you
with the people in power, if possible,

279
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,122
I'm a military man,

280
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,494
Please, this is necessary,

281
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,396
For the general public, Colonel,

282
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,436
You belong to everyone, Colonel,
It is only normal,

283
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:29,338
Thank you, Miss,
I will come with you,

284
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,568
General, the photographer,

285
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:38,583
Ah, yes, these are futile demands
one must abide to,

286
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:43,518
Your dog,

287
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:44,919
Please, place yourselves,

288
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,457
I'm sorry, Miss,

289
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,222
Let's play some music, for ambiance,

290
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,562
Watch out,
Don't move,

291
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,828
It's my brother, Madam,

292
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,427
George Armstrong Custer,

293
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,403
Victorious over the lndians,

294
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:11,514
My dog,
A present from the Russian Czar,

295
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,085
Say hello to the lady,

296
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:18,145
Excuse me,
Military information,

297
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,287
I walked around a lot
in the past few days,

298
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:22,951
I saw a lot of lndians,
A lot of them,

299
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:24,051
What tribe?

300
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,597
Cheyenne, Oglala, Blackfeet,

301
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,496
-No Algerians?
-No,

302
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,296
That's fame,
That's fame, Mitch,

303
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,664
Yes,

304
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,431
I fed the dog,

305
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,801
Very well,

306
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:40,443
Damned lndians, They sleep in there,
I don't understand what they want,

307
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:43,980
They live like rats,

308
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,259
That's progress,

309
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,421
It's dynamic, more convenient,

310
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,400
But our century is too pious,
too religious, Custer,

311
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,429
My dear Custer,
I'm happy to be able to count on you,

312
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:35,329
I would have liked
to fight the battle myself,

313
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:39,632
but with my asthma
and my whitlow,,,,

314
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:44,698
I also have a problem,
I can't ride my horse anymore,

315
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,607
Well, less and less often,

316
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:48,304
I have some sort of rash,

317
00:22:48,414 --> 00:22:53,545
The doctor says it isn't serious,
but I'm afraid,

318
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:57,645
Well, I'm afraid my prostate
is acting funny,

319
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,657
Or worse, even,

320
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,720
My dear Custer,
you're very lucky to be healthy,

321
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,697
But you have experience, General,

322
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,166
Stop tapping your feet like that,

323
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,672
It lifts up the dust,
and it's bad for me,

324
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:24,177
There's that shithead Mitch
with that asshole Custer,

325
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:28,083
Answer them to make them happy,

326
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:36,788
What are these poor men doing?
What are they doing?

327
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,530
I don't know these tribes!
Are they crazy?

328
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,466
They're not allowed to be here,

329
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,733
This land belongs
to the railway company,

330
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,469
Scout!
What tribe is this?

331
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:53,238
These are all Sioux,

332
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:55,609
One moment, I'll ask,

333
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,414
Shit!

334
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,854
Pigs,

335
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,015
Is this absolutely necessary?

336
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,584
Certainly, It is very important
for you to know the power players,

337
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:14,792
Incredible!
A military man like me!

338
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,428
Forced to go to this grotesque
Buffalo Bill exhibition,

339
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,301
So, are we going in or what?

340
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,307
I repeat,
it's very important for you,

341
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:36,850
What do you want?

342
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:40,015
I'm Mitch, Custer's scout,

343
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,324
Long live Custer!

344
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,157
Hello, Colonel,

345
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,198
Hello,

346
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,761
I should tell you that Miss de
Boismonfrais will be with us tonight,

347
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,102
Is that so?

348
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,333
She'll think
that I'm a tasteless man,

349
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,344
a man without any artistic
sensibility, for choosing this,,,,

350
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:04,904
No, rest assured, She knows your
position forces you to be here,

351
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:07,451
-My dear brother, no alcohol,
-Just one drink,

352
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:10,215
Since Buffalo Bill
didn't wait for us to start,

353
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:14,884
I think I should go ahead
and announce your arrival, General,

354
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:18,986
As the great General Sheridan
used to say:

355
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,898
"General, I will not hunt your buffalo

356
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:33,205
if the great Buffalo Bill
doesn't come with me,"

357
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:35,746
Buffalo Buffoon!

358
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:39,305
General, I'll be here
waiting for your orders,

359
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:43,616
No, Mitch,
Don't touch the white woman!

360
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:46,348
Buffoon,

361
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,018
Imagine the safari
I organized for him,

362
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:52,153
Would you like to drink something?
Whisky, Cognac, mint?

363
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:55,427
I don't drink,

364
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:57,798
I'll have orange juice,

365
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,895
It's war, sir,
Whisky or water,

366
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,268
Water,

367
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,801
-What's your name, Miss?
-Rose,

368
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:08,777
Scented?

369
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:13,945
Buffalo Bill,

370
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:16,885
That old fag was my scout
for two years,

371
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,049
He frequently took the wrong path,

372
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,790
Bravo!

373
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,630
Bravo!

374
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:32,102
He is here,

375
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,139
Mr, Buffalo!

376
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:47,845
And then I told the Great Duke
Alexis of Russia the story of my life,

377
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,716
Colonel Custer isn't here yet?

378
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:53,416
Sister Lucie!
We are here to watch the show,

379
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:57,791
When I was working
for the Kansas Pacific Railroad,,,

380
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:00,831
The Colonel Custer--

381
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:09,330
,,,l killed 4,280 buffalos
in 18 months!

382
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,174
Mr, Buffalo, come with me!

383
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,838
Colonel Custer is here!

384
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:24,287
I killed 4,280 buffalos!

385
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,254
Buffalos!

386
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,383
Buffalos!

387
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:31,623
You can't treat me this way,
understood?

388
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,823
Custer is waiting for his homage,
Quick!

389
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,800
That's impossible, I have never
done this at the end of my show,

390
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,302
My audience is waiting,

391
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,804
They want me to tell them
about my life,

392
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,204
No, you have to do it now,

393
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:45,936
or you will not see one penny
of the money you and I agreed upon,

394
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:47,944
And you must look convinced
while you're doing it,

395
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,877
That bastard,

396
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:57,114
He is always crossing my path,

397
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,628
Don't be casual with me,

398
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:08,428
Ladies and gentlemen,

399
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:13,027
we have the great honor
to have with us tonight,,,

400
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,663
Bravo!

401
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:19,733
-Sister Lucie, please!
-,,,Colonel Custer!

402
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,270
Music!

403
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:28,047
Long live Custer!

404
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,759
At last, General,

405
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:39,421
Excuse me,

406
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,591
Left, right, left, right!

407
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:47,432
Are people this tall nowadays,
in West Point?

408
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:48,563
Yes, Colonel,

409
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:54,168
In my time, I was the tallest,
Very well,

410
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,311
Sit down,

411
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:04,355
Colonel,

412
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:05,616
Look, no alcohol,

413
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,160
Very well, Major Reno,

414
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:12,526
Ladies and gentlemen:

415
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,360
You know sister Lucie?

416
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,401
It is a duty for me
to give a public homage,,,

417
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,663
And the representative of the lndian
Affairs Department, of course,

418
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:24,640
,,,and all my admiration
to the hero of Washita,

419
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,306
What are you thinking of, Colonel?

420
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,938
Nothing,

421
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,346
What better comment,,,,

422
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:35,215
Cadet!

423
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,150
Yes, Colonel,

424
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:38,154
Cover your fiancée,

425
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:39,154
,,,than the letter,,,

426
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:40,815
How immodest,

427
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,053
,,,written by General Sheridan

428
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:52,593
to our heroic Colonel when he
found out our troops had prevailed,

429
00:29:52,704 --> 00:30:00,634
And now I will let
General Sheridan speak,

430
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:05,773
"For their energy and swiftness

431
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:14,349
during one of the worst snowfalls this
part of the country had ever seen,

432
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:19,897
with temperatures below 30°F,
for his bravery,,,,"

433
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,931
-Why do you risk your life like that?
-For my country!

434
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:32,474
"For their triumph
over the ferocious Cheyenne,

435
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:37,742
the Joint Chief of Staff wants
to thank the soldiers and officers

436
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:41,580
who fought in the battle of Washita,

437
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:46,919
and particularly
their distinguished leader,

438
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:53,021
Major General George
Armstrong Custer,"

439
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,164
Put the light on him!

440
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:00,136
Long live Custer!
Long live Buffalo!

441
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,671
Heroic brothers!

442
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:05,265
You,,,,
With this image,

443
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:08,972
Such emotion,

444
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,410
Does cigar smoke bother you, Miss?

445
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,352
Thank you,

446
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:22,893
What a battle, General!

447
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,143
I don't know how to explain it,

448
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:45,911
When I saw you for the first time,
I had a strange feeling,

449
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:49,180
A premonition, a memory,

450
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:53,417
Maureen O'Hara,
Gone With the Wind,

451
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:55,220
You're flattering me, Colonel,

452
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:59,491
No, Miss de Boismonfrais,
I'm just honoring the truth,

453
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:01,896
You must believe me,

454
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,993
If I may ask,
how did you end up here with us?

455
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,912
When my father died,,,,

456
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:24,887
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't want you
to recall such feelings,

457
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:29,117
My mother was penniless and agreed
to accept her brother's hospitality,

458
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,819
My uncle owns a bank in Boston,

459
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,660
and his wife is a direct descendant
of the Mayflower pilgrims,

460
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,700
This music is so melancholic,

461
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:50,305
I was bored in Boston,

462
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:54,146
Life was superficial,
Dances, parties, you know,

463
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:57,278
So when I heard how much
American soldiers were suffering,

464
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,790
I decided to offer my help
to serve our cause,

465
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:05,625
General Terry says you're a fairy,
He's wrong,

466
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,460
You're an angel,
Miss de Boismonfrais,

467
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:12,366
Being nursed by you
must be something divine,

468
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,234
No, Colonel,
Bullets must respect you,

469
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,901
The country needs you,

470
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:59,540
We're going to play a game,

471
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:08,458
Don't cry, It's a game,

472
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:22,532
I don't want this,
I want to leave!

473
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,399
Old hag!

474
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:42,351
Let's go,

475
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,297
Then they locked them up,

476
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,167
The chimney fell and killed them all,

477
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,598
Go sit down,

478
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,438
Sitting Bull,
what are you waiting for?

479
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:08,239
For them to kill us all?

480
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,246
We need to go get our brothers,

481
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,680
They killed them like animals,

482
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:16,220
What are you waiting for?

483
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:19,316
-Custer, the butcher of lndians,
-Come,

484
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:21,682
What do you want, Sitting Bull?

485
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:25,388
Go and get the warlords,

486
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:32,959
Two-Moons, Faithful,
Crazy Horse, Raven,

487
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:32,724
You're crazy if you think
you're going to stop progress

488
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,730
by killing American soldiers,

489
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:38,393
America could be your father
and your mother,

490
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:39,492
Bravo!

491
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:40,593
-Thanks,
-You're welcome,

492
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,434
And the people, your children,

493
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,704
In the name of my government,
you'll be put to death by hanging,

494
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:48,870
Shut up!

495
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:51,607
Hang them!

496
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:10,325
-WATCH OUT FOR lNDlANS
-Watch out for nothing!

497
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:12,902
May I speak?

498
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:15,404
You may speak, madman,

499
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:20,773
Brothers, until now, you've fought
with no strategic insight,

500
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:23,142
You can't speak!
You're not a chief,

501
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:26,705
A man with no hair on his head
is not a man,

502
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:28,979
-What's he talking about?
-He's talking about war,

503
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:34,320
He's talking about war?
We must not talk about war,

504
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:36,985
The madman has no hair,
but he has ideas,

505
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:37,823
Let's listen to him,

506
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,556
Speak, madman,

507
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:42,428
You're the most valiant warriors
on Earth,

508
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,524
But you're naive,

509
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:47,729
For you, war is
about individual accomplishment,

510
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,739
not collective action,

511
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,308
Collective!

512
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,070
Collective!

513
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:55,475
Shut up,

514
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,947
We shall speak to our brothers,
the warriors,

515
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:30,337
What's the violin for?

516
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:35,147
I really enjoy playing the violin
in the countryside,

517
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:56,999
Don't mock the tradition, madman,

518
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:04,547
If they want war, they'll have war,

519
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:09,177
But in order to wage war,
we must unite,

520
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:16,784
For if we fight each on our own,
as we have done until now,

521
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:19,658
we'll never be able to beat them,

522
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:25,365
You've heard Sitting Bull,
The time of unity has come,

523
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,529
Apart, you are nothing,

524
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:32,166
The white men will go on
destroying tribe after tribe,

525
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:35,712
If all tribes are united,
we form a people,

526
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:41,774
Not poor, not disowned,
but oppressed men,

527
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,581
Men!

528
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,623
The people can overcome
the oppressor!

529
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:49,750
Brothers, forget your differences,

530
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:52,694
Let's gather the little
that everyone owns!

531
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:54,025
Let's buy weapons!

532
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:58,466
Use this for collective action,
new tactics,

533
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:02,005
We don't need heroes,
but we need an army,

534
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:08,602
Not tomorrow but now, now, now!

535
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:16,311
They're coming back, the rascals!

536
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,691
Cut his head off,
Like this,

537
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:28,123
Come on!

538
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:07,995
Brothers!

539
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,538
Brothers!

540
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:18,978
Brothers!

541
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:24,647
If we continue to wait,
they'll kill us all, one by one,

542
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:29,249
You're the most revered,
the most respected of us all,

543
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,885
Look!

544
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:33,930
Look!

545
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,061
Huh?

546
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:40,563
If I were young and impetuous
like you,

547
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:44,471
I would think today is a good day
to launch an attack,

548
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:49,638
But I'm old and wise,
and I know we must wait,

549
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,806
Nobody is contesting your authority,
chief,

550
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,749
But the young men
cannot wait any longer,

551
00:42:57,288 --> 00:43:01,691
Go on, work,

552
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,889
Or I will have you killed
by my soldiers,

553
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,137
-So what's wrong with you?
-Nothing,

554
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:30,710
Why are you looking at me
this way, huh?

555
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:35,451
Leave me alone and cover yourself,

556
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,826
You look like a white slut,
We'll go to the movies tomorrow,

557
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,304
In memory of Lee Nelson who killed
98 lndians during his lifetime,

558
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:57,012
What I don't understand
is the lndians' attitude,

559
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:59,548
It's obvious that the Lord
gave this land to white men

560
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,810
so they could settle here,

561
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:02,351
So why do they resist?

562
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,786
Because they're savages!
They're savages!

563
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,621
I sometimes feel
like they're possessed by demons,

564
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,058
May God preserve us from that!

565
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:14,325
God and the 7th Cavalry,

566
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,362
These military buildings are strange,

567
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,440
They are military-like,

568
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:02,701
So, it is indeed a pious act to kill
lndians, lsn't that right, Colonel?

569
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:07,111
What a beautiful sky!
Look at all these stars, Colonel,

570
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:08,742
Look!

571
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:13,313
Look, the stars have fallen to Earth,

572
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,358
Stars,,,,

573
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:16,585
Mitch!

574
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:24,565
Screw you!

575
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,636
They're Blackfeet,

576
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:27,931
I tricked them again,

577
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:31,370
Are they lndians?

578
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,369
With me by your side,
you have nothing to fear,

579
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,105
Miss de Boismonfrais,

580
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,113
-You can call me Marie-Hélène,
-Champagne, Mitch!

581
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,034
Don't you smell something strange?

582
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:10,537
Yes, of course!
Look at these dead men hanging,

583
00:46:11,282 --> 00:46:12,544
I can't believe this,

584
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,815
If there's one thing that I demand,
it's cleanliness!

585
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:21,216
Where's the formaldehyde?

586
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,093
Champagne is for white men,

587
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:44,806
Mitch!
Champagne is for white men,

588
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:52,285
Custer, son of a bitch!
Here, take this,

589
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:58,122
Marie-Hélène, lndians are savages,

590
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:02,427
I sometimes feel
like they're possessed by demons,

591
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:05,468
Custer, you're a piece of shit,

592
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:08,834
Mitch, leave the white woman alone,

593
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:10,304
Here!

594
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:18,181
Come here!

595
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,045
You, keep working!

596
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,380
The president is watching you,

597
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,520
Come here,

598
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:25,611
What do you want?

599
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:30,183
We'll see if I can't touch
the white woman,

600
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:31,522
Come with me,

601
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,096
Come here!

602
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:36,462
Go up there, Go on!

603
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:39,866
Not like that, like this,

604
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:47,207
Look, she's white,

605
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:49,438
White as an angel,

606
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,141
White as milk,

607
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:57,711
Turn around,
It's just you and l,

608
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,584
Turn around, dear Madame,

609
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,457
Will you let me touch your ass,
Miss de Bonbonbon?

610
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:05,961
Yes?

611
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:08,691
That's good,

612
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:17,764
Not too big, not too small,
Just right, Oh la la!

613
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,641
Custer, do you realize?

614
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:25,203
She loves an lndian!

615
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:30,784
Take your clothes off!

616
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:33,550
Naked, Marie-Hélène,

617
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:41,361
Custer, look,

618
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:44,025
I'll fuck you up the ass!

619
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:50,899
-What is this?
-Leave me alone,

620
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:53,408
Watch out!

621
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,137
Good morning, General,

622
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:56,577
-Good morning, Professor,
-Did you sleep well?

623
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,240
No, The bed is too soft,
I prefer sleeping on the ground,

624
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,318
The warrior's rest,

625
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:02,578
I was just at the lndian School,

626
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:04,085
We are setting up an exhibition,

627
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:05,883
a rather sad
but necessary exhibition,

628
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,322
Marie-Hélène is there, too,
You know her,

629
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:09,790
She is an extraordinary woman,

630
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:13,761
A true patriot, She's been
helping us since 4:00 a,m,

631
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,422
Every time I travel,

632
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,932
I unfortunately have to organize
this kind of exhibition,

633
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:20,469
I have some photographs,
Are you interested?

634
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:21,401
Do you want to see them?

635
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:22,335
Look at this,

636
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,339
This one is from an exhibition
in Bolivia,

637
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,005
Yes,

638
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,476
This one is in Africa,

639
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,775
Revolutionary leader?

640
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:35,113
Look at this one,
lsn't it beautiful?

641
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,679
What's going on, my little lndian?

642
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,924
That's not very good publicity for
you, the way he treats your scout,

643
00:49:43,027 --> 00:49:44,858
I can do it myself,

644
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:49,462
If you do it, it's entirely different,
really,

645
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:54,560
Very interesting,
Congratulations, Professor,

646
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:58,073
You stay here,
We'll go see that,

647
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,378
Anthropologist?

648
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:10,078
Anthropologist,

649
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:20,887
I thought it over, and I'm very happy,
because thanks to the newspapers,,,,

650
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:24,365
-Hello, Archibald,
-Hello, darling,

651
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:26,265
No, this is not a good time
for breakfast,

652
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,463
Thanks, anyway,

653
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:32,531
That's obvious,
It doesn't smell like lilies,

654
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:37,376
So the newspapers work well
because the acid allows,,,,

655
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:39,073
My goodness,
That smell,,,,

656
00:50:39,183 --> 00:50:40,275
It's interesting,

657
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:47,552
Yes, You know that the English
eat fries in newspapers, Oh, dear,

658
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,057
And this one,,,,

659
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:51,354
What are you doing in our school?

660
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:54,431
It's no longer your school, Miss,
We're occupying it,

661
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,158
You can stay here, if you wish,

662
00:50:56,266 --> 00:50:58,166
It's a horrible spectacle
for children,

663
00:50:58,268 --> 00:51:00,259
Okay, now it's a little cleaner,

664
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:03,340
Juju, come help me clean this guy,

665
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,604
Do you see what we do to lndians
when they're mean?

666
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:09,542
So you have to be very nice,

667
00:51:09,646 --> 00:51:12,581
Either he's taking his revenge,
or there are too many newspapers,

668
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:15,709
Come help me! Quick!

669
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:18,014
Come on!

670
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,749
Come here,
The coffee is going to be cold,

671
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:25,761
Excuse me,
but I had to finish this stuff,

672
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,195
-Do you want some coffee?
-It's a nice thought,

673
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,925
Marie-Hélène,
do you want some coffee?

674
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:31,466
No, it's too strong for me,

675
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:34,401
I'll gladly have some,

676
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:36,735
Is it good?

677
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:38,438
Did you make it?

678
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:39,531
No, I got it next door,

679
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,005
Your wife asked for 2,000 dollars,

680
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:45,775
I only have 1,000,
I don't know where to get it,

681
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:49,444
You're the one
who's dealing with money,

682
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,180
-Hello, soldier,
-Hello,

683
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:57,156
Yes, here it is,
I invented the concept,

684
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:03,427
I empty their bowels, and then I fill
them up with newspapers, hay, etc,

685
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:04,398
Good,

686
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:05,934
The smell is unbearable,

687
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:09,096
Yes, that's from the acid in the
newspapers, It acts as a disinfectant,

688
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,299
But thanks a lot, anyway,

689
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:14,377
Did you work all night?

690
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:18,244
Well, I helped Archibald,
the veterinarian,

691
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,009
Now that they've been disinfected,

692
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:22,551
they can be on display without
being a risk for the population,

693
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:26,885
You're always so considerate,

694
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:31,119
Hello, children, Hello,

695
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,589
It's beautiful to help a noble cause,

696
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,293
When is the battle taking place?

697
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:41,200
Top secret,

698
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,069
But I can say it to you,

699
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:46,874
You're shaking,

700
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:50,435
No, Yes, Well,,,,
I think I am tired,

701
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,139
Should I walk you to your hotel?

702
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:56,345
No, duty first, Colonel,

703
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:00,448
An angel,

704
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,016
Come with me,

709
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:12,928
I need money,

710
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:15,527
Major Archibald, come on,

711
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:20,372

Come on,

No,

00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,047
Come on!

716
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:29,880
Buffalo Bill!

717
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,682
I always have to run into him,

718
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,916
Let's immortalize
a historical moment,

719
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,356
Come on!

720
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,017
Come on!

721
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:38,025
Buffalo Bill!

722
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:39,288
Oh, come now,

723
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:41,125
Don't move!

724
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:42,966
Talk some more,

725
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:46,229
Tell me how great you think
this beautiful weapon is,

726
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:47,963
This is an admirable machine gun,

727
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,631
It comes from France,
a European country,

728
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:54,177
60 shots per minute,

729
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:56,976
At ease, Custer,

730
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:03,312
I see that you've received
your horrible toy,

731
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,479
It's a beautiful toy, Custer,

732
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:07,420
Don't be negative about it,

733
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:09,924
I said, at ease,

734
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,152
How is your health, General?

735
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:16,164
Very bad, thanks,

736
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:19,435
I had a terrible heat stroke,

737
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:23,165
such bad sunburns on my hands
that I can never lift my sword again,

738
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:26,174
and I think you could cook
some bacon on my head,

739
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:27,573
I am sorry, General,

740
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:28,667
You can be,

741
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:32,510
Excuse me, General,
can we have a word in private?

742
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:35,312
You can speak
in front of this gentleman,

743
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:37,182
You know him very well, The right
to being informed is sacred,

744
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:41,189
He is on our side anyway,
so go ahead,

745
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:47,252
The presence of a clown in your army
is not acceptable and dishonorable,

746
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:50,356
I am talking about Buffalo Bill,
obviously,

747
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:53,630
I sort of agree with you,
Please, explain it to him,

748
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:55,261
My dear General,

749
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,136
the war against the lndians
is not very popular in the country,

750
00:54:58,241 --> 00:54:59,868
In Europe, people are against it,

751
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:01,035
We must therefore launch

752
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:04,875
a big publicity and public relations
campaign, etc,

753
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:08,179
Anything we can do
to reinforce our control,

754
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:12,779
People like Buffalo Bill a lot,

755
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,749
The war is not popular?

756
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:18,794
War is the essence of a people,

757
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:21,523
But not with this machine!
With a sword!

758
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:22,530
Man to man,

759
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:29,134
Charge!

760
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,764
At ease, Custer,

761
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,900
Don't be obsessed with Buffalo Bill,

762
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:36,980
He represents
the folklore in our project,

763
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,638
You are the glory,

764
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:42,014
You wage war in its essence,
its primal truth,

765
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,952
Well, then!

766
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:48,320
By the way, I'm meeting
with Sitting Bull tomorrow,

767
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:49,722
Do you want to come with me?

768
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:52,124
Thank you, General,

769
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:57,223
Come over here, Custer,

770
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:05,436
I have a rather confidential matter
to ask you about,

771
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:09,407
I have issues with my daughter,

772
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:14,246
She's seeing one of your officers
who is a bit of a drunk,

773
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:15,181
Major Reno?

774
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:16,081
Yes,

775
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:20,122
Tell me something,
Does he go to the brothel?

776
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,659
I have no idea, but I can tell you
he's stopped drinking,

777
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,523
Drinking isn't the problem, Custer,

778
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:27,153
Sometimes, myself,,,,

779
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:36,730
No, I'm afraid he'll give my daughter
a shameful disease,

780
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:42,741
Another herd of lndians!
They'll end up filling up this hole,

781
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,177
About Sitting Bull,,,,

782
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:49,650
About Sitting Bull,
I had a brilliant idea, Custer,

783
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:52,415
Sometimes my intelligence
scares me,

784
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:54,990
In order for war to be popular,
it has to be inevitable,

785
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:58,186
I found one reason for it to be so,

786
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:00,229
When are we fighting?

787
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,494
Glory, Custer,
You always want glory,

788
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,941
At ease, Custer,

789
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:32,395
Are you the madman?

790
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:37,596
Aren't you ashamed of being naked
in front of children?

791
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:40,300
We know each other,
don't we, Chief?

792
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:44,100
I brought you a few gifts,
to prove our friendship,

793
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,271
But I see you haven't
brought me anything,

794
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:51,541
My daughter wanted
a pair of moccasins,

795
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:54,515
She'll be very disappointed,

796
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:56,711
We have nothing to give,

797
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,221
I chose the white men,
I only work with them,

798
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:04,022
Scout! My seat!

799
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:05,253
At your service!

800
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:08,160
You'll see,

801
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:23,405
Your friend, Colonel Custer,

802
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:28,576
is going to tell you about the orders
given by our beloved President Nixon,

803
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:30,949
Go ahead, Custer,

804
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,952
It's him!

805
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:39,825
Why did you abandon your houses?

806
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:44,492
Because you destroyed them,

807
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,195
Sometimes there were still people
inside of them,

808
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:51,968
You were ordered
to go to the reservations,

809
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:59,342
My people are dying of hunger
in the reservations,

810
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:07,754
You promised us work,
schools for our children, hospitals,

811
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:11,021
for everything
you have taken from us,

812
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:13,687
This is not a proper answer,

813
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:16,732
And even if it was,

814
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,666
it doesn't give you the right

815
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:23,068
to occupy the big hole
of the Black Hills,

816
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:27,007
The big hole of the Black Hills,,,,

817
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,510
That's all we have left,

818
00:59:29,613 --> 00:59:32,514
Our country does not want war!

819
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:35,107
So why are you here?
Indian murderer,

820
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:39,748
In the name of our government,

821
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:43,189
I order you to go back to your
reservations before the next moon,

822
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:46,729
If you refuse to comply,
you will be declared hostile,

823
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:49,958
hence rebels and enemies
of our country,

824
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:54,264
Therefore, you will be responsible
for everything that will happen,

825
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:56,835
Please note
our magnanimous attitude

826
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,238
and the lack of responsibility
of these savages,

827
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:00,673
I saw everything,
I wrote it all down,

828
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:04,440
Well, I think it's time to have lunch,
Come on, let's go,

829
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:05,946
Let's go!

830
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:08,415
This piece of shit was given to me

831
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:10,918
by the Great white old man
in Washington,

832
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:15,357
I piss on it now,

833
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,787
Custer,,,,

834
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:19,953
An officer who has gone
through West Point

835
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:24,591
does not lower himself
to this type of scuffle, Come on,

836
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:28,530
Go back home!

837
01:00:28,638 --> 01:00:32,836
Go away, birds of hell!
Get out of here!

838
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:38,904
Come on, out!

839
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,074
Father,

840
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:43,778
Why didn't you defend me?

841
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:48,119
Because I was eating cherries,

842
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:11,413
Go fetch my horse,

843
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:24,160
Major Reno, I hope you've read
Colonel Custer's book,

844
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,058
I have not read it,
but I definitely intend to do so,

845
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:31,623
Marie-Hélène, I really didn't expect
to see you here, Miss,

846
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:33,168
Colonel, I was so happy at the idea

847
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:35,066
of getting a dedicated copy
of your book,

848
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,968
You read it?

849
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:38,404
Who hasn't, Colonel!

850
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:44,140
Not only are you a great soldier,
but also a great poet,

851
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:48,849
I remember one of the passages,
It starts like this:

852
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:52,012
The night was ideal
To put our project to fruition

853
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:54,454
The breeze was sweet and fresh

854
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:56,422
And the full moon
Seemed to be on our side

855
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:58,926
In the attack of the Indian camp

856
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:09,403
I'm embarrassed to hear your praise,
This is nothing but a soldier's prose,

857
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:21,673
Buffalo Bill's cow!

858
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:29,521
Oh, Colonel!

859
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:32,720
Very nice to see you,

860
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:38,426
I suppose you don't see
a problem if I sign?

861
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:46,100
-Let's go,
-My great autobiography,

862
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:55,481
"The attack of the stagecoach,
the buffalo hunt,,,,

863
01:02:55,585 --> 01:03:04,220
The scalping technique, etc,"

864
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:13,066
I see the lndian Affairs
representative,

865
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:20,838
For the lndian Affairs representative,
I have a gift,

866
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:32,382
Here it is, for the lndian Affairs
representative,

867
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:48,060
That's the gift,

868
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:51,902
Relax, Colonel,

869
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,904
If you'll excuse me,,,,

870
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:05,988
Pitiful buffoon,

871
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:08,489
Him and his mistress,
Calamity Jane!

872
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,458
No scandal,
We need him,

873
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:12,391
Ouch!

874
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:14,861
Long live Custer!
Long live Buffalo!

875
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:23,470
For the lady!

876
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,613
Don't worry,
I'm looking after her,

877
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:46,662
Marie-Hélène,
I had a fantastic horse ride,

878
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:50,130
You never told me
why you chose a military career,

879
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:56,229
Since I was young, I've felt a burning
desire to serve the country,

880
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:58,933
What convinced me to join the army

881
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,704
was the confusion that was
everywhere in the country,

882
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:04,211
The army represented purity,
sacrifice,

883
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:07,545
Purity, in the midst of a society

884
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,144
plunged into materialism
and anarchy,

885
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,746
How I like listening to you!
You speak so well!

886
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:18,557
Alas, you're not the only one,

887
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,322
Alas? Why?

888
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:25,928
My speeches in Washington
were rather successful,

889
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:29,630
Some very influential people
insist for me to campaign

890
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:32,367
and run for presidential elections,

891
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:34,841
President?

892
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:36,706
Yes,

893
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:44,314
Custer, president!

894
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:48,186
The night is beautiful,
but I'm starting to be a little cold,

895
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:49,223
Let me walk you,

896
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,009
He always gives me
delicate missions,

897
01:06:11,114 --> 01:06:12,741
But you're a great man,

898
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:15,841
Oh! Yes,

899
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:27,789
What a soldier,

900
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:30,365
The only thing he does
is ride a horse under a full moon,

901
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:33,333
And we're here, waiting for him
to get rid of the lndians for us,

902
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:37,805
Damned lndians!

903
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:42,274
How many cannons can we have?

904
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:45,108
At least half a dozen,
my dear friend,

905
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,341
Watch out, Buffalo,

906
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:49,841
Fire!

907
01:06:58,194 --> 01:06:59,889
Well done,

908
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:06,265
Well done,
That's real war,

909
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:11,238
You don't like progress, Colonel,

910
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,602
Progress!

911
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:17,669
And now, the cannon number,
These machines have no humanity,

912
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,045
Custer, you are right,

913
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:22,913
No cannons,

914
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:26,352
Revolvers, shotguns, knives,
but no cannons,

915
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,083
No cannons,

916
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:34,219
You see, General, the time
of scientific wars has come,

917
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,161
It is clean, anonymous,
You don't see your enemy,

918
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:39,632
But you chose Custer, right?
Well, you shall get Custer,

919
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:43,797
Custer is all about glory,
charging with a small weapon,

920
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:47,069
We'll see,

921
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:48,404
Lift your arms!

922
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:50,206
Take these cannons
back to the store,

923
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:54,249
Let's go to the Joint Chief of Staff
meeting, my friend,

924
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,752
Bring the box,

925
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:01,790
Proceed,

926
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:12,462
Hook it up,

927
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:17,565
Come on, now,

928
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:19,800
Hermine, you can't fall asleep

929
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:22,469
in the middle
of these secret documents,,,

930
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:25,479
,,,right as the war council
is about to start,

931
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,913
Go get some fresh air, sweetheart,

932
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:30,212
Please excuse her,
She follows me in all my campaigns,

933
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,413
That's enough,
Here,

934
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:42,090
Gentlemen, the president, Let's not
forget him and his magnetic gaze,

935
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:45,395
The plan is the following,

936
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:49,961
The column led by Crook exits
Fort Fetterman and walks up North,

937
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:56,011
pushing the enemy back
if they appear, until this place,

938
01:08:56,112 --> 01:09:00,549
The column led by Gibbon
exits Fort Ellis

939
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:06,782
and, coming down this path,
joins with our friend Custer's men,

940
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:10,325
Take it easy Custer, It creates dust,
I've already told you that,

941
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:13,224
I hope you're following me,
gentlemen,

942
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:15,593
An elegant and inescapable
pliers movement,

943
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:18,792
which will corner the enemy's ass,
if I may say,

944
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,926
in a magnificent cul-de-sac,

945
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:23,631
What do you think, Custer?

946
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:30,039
Major,,,,

947
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:32,842
Very funny, Custer,
Very subtle,

948
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:39,218
Don't forget that this battle plan is
based on your sense of cooperation,

949
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:40,914
Of collaboration, Custer,

950
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:44,356
This is not a personal adventure,
Do not forget,

951
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,256
Yes, General,

952
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,556
-Understood?
-Yes, General,

953
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,995
And don't forget your trial,

954
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:54,763
So with this operation, you can
promise us a definite success,

955
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:56,805
There will be no survivors, correct?

956
01:09:56,906 --> 01:10:00,740
It has to be a complete victory,
A clear, sharp, definite victory,

957
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:04,574
Gentlemen, this is in the hands
of Colonel Custer,

958
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:10,847
So, you go in slowly, as if you were
notables, and you ask for weapons,

959
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:12,853
Go ahead! Go ahead!

960
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:14,684
Go ahead!

961
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:20,217
Go ahead!

962
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,810
Chief, quick!
Come in,

963
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:30,096
Oh, a shotgun,
It's beautiful,

964
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:34,067
We're going to kill them all
with this,

965
01:11:34,804 --> 01:11:35,702
Madman!

966
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:37,932
I need to have a word with you,

967
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:46,306
Here, a gift, Tomatoes,

968
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:55,685
Here, our good president,

969
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:59,249
Those are only my pants,

970
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:07,134
Ah, madman,

971
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:11,402
You always have fun
throwing tomatoes at my face,

972
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:13,634
Fine, Throw them,

973
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:20,477
Come on, I'm here,
Be brave, Throw them,

974
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:37,727
I know you're getting weapons,
It means that war is imminent,

975
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:41,234
I don't care whether you win or lose,

976
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:43,464
I only want one thing,

977
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:45,233
You need to kill Custer,

978
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,237
Should I keep talking
or should I shut up?

979
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:55,283
Speak,

980
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,375
Custer loves to change clothes,

981
01:12:57,486 --> 01:12:59,750
He has a different uniform
for every battle,

982
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:03,484
This time, I'm going to give him
a beige uniform,

983
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:06,652
He'll be very easy to spot
among the soldiers,

984
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,287
Why do you want Custer to die?

985
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:10,695
That's my business,

986
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,325
Why do you want Custer to die?

987
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:20,241
Because he treats me like an lndian,

988
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:36,487
What massage, Colonel?

989
01:13:36,592 --> 01:13:39,060
You need to cut your hair,
There is no other option,

990
01:13:39,161 --> 01:13:39,991
Your hair is too fragile,

991
01:13:40,096 --> 01:13:42,894
My hair is my legend,
I can't cut it,

992
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:44,431
Colonel!

993
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:47,366
Shit!

994
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,631
I can't!

995
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:52,639
Indians call me Custer Long Hair,
lsn't it true?

996
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:54,334
Sure, Custer,

997
01:13:54,443 --> 01:13:55,740
And if I don't cut it,,,,

998
01:13:55,845 --> 01:13:59,474
You'll be bald, Colonel,

999
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,510
Cut it,

1000
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:11,620
A man without hair
loses his masculinity,

1001
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:14,626
General, look at this uniform,

1002
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,561
I made it for you
with my own hands,

1003
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:18,758
Completely,
I did it all myself,

1004
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:20,460
Look how beautiful it is,

1005
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:22,469
Well done,

1006
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:25,699
You're all savages, but you do
very well with that type of thing,

1007
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:27,002
What is this?

1008
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:28,167
An amulet,

1009
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:29,608
No, General,

1010
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,806
That's not a good amulet, General,
That's bad,

1011
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:36,373
I don't know lndian customs, But you
must, since you're a gynecologist,

1012
01:14:36,485 --> 01:14:38,146
Anthropologist,

1013
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:40,449
I know lndians very well,
Right, little lndian?

1014
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:49,823
Sitting Bull will be disappointed,

1015
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:09,916
And now there are people
everywhere, in the hole,

1016
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:13,978
They have many weapons,
much to drink and much to eat,

1017
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:19,186
These holes are well-cared for
by our brothers,

1018
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:21,160
Today is a big day,

1019
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:29,704
-Where do you come from?
-Mexico,

1020
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:33,366
Sitting Bull, they are coming
from everywhere,

1021
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:36,239
Our plan is working,
Lots of lndians,

1022
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:37,869
They finally understand,

1023
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,177
This time, we are going
to slaughter the oppressor,

1024
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:48,216
Please, gentlemen, go ahead,

1025
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:50,758
I'm sorry I'm not sharing
your green beans,

1026
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:52,724
but it's not allowed in my diet,

1027
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:56,059
I have to be content
with this humble crayfish,

1028
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:58,963
Please, eat your green beans,

1029
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:01,226
Tell me about you,

1030
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:03,601
There are many things
I had never done

1031
01:16:03,706 --> 01:16:05,139
before knowing you, Marie-Hélène,

1032
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,606
Like what?

1033
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:07,903
Being in love,

1034
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:12,913
Custer, for the country,
for God, and for your glory!

1035
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:14,039
For the army!

1036
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:15,343
For progress!

1037
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:18,318
Cheers, gentlemen!

1038
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:22,349
I love my wife, naturally,

1039
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,323
But it's a different kind of love,

1040
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:29,193
I love her like a sister,
like a mother, a daughter,

1041
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:33,325
The feelings you inspire in me,
Marie-Hélène,,,,

1042
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,460
My love is immense,

1043
01:16:35,571 --> 01:16:38,267
I feel the irresistible desire
to kiss you,

1044
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:43,038
to hold you in my arms with a frenzy,

1045
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,940
No, no, Colonel,

1046
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:53,078
No, George Armstrong,
I'm a decent girl,

1047
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:59,093
I love you, too,
but you must respect my virtue,

1048
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:03,893
I feel faint, I can't breathe,
I don't feel well,

1049
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:08,333
I'm an animal for talking
to you that way, Please,

1050
01:17:08,437 --> 01:17:09,529
Please, come,

1051
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:11,071
I need some air,

1052
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:14,609
Relax, gentlemen,

1053
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,337
Do you need help, Colonel Custer?

1054
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:17,434
No, thank you,

1055
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:19,377
I would like to go to my hotel,

1056
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:19,970
Yes,

1057
01:17:20,082 --> 01:17:21,071
-To my hotel,
-Yes,

1058
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:25,244
Ah, women,
They're so fragile,

1059
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:31,020
Now that the women are gone,
we can be a little more casual,

1060
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:34,521
Good evening, General,

1061
01:17:35,397 --> 01:17:36,762
I'll help you, Madam,

1062
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:39,197
Don't touch the white woman!

1063
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:40,928
Marie-Hélène,
you have nothing to fear,

1064
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:43,129
My love is so immense
that I'm ready to make a sacrifice,

1065
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:44,865
I'm happy just to see you,

1066
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:46,498
-Yes, let's leave,
-Sure,

1067
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:48,508
Champagne!

1068
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,445
I'm mainly used to treating animals,
but it doesn't matter,

1069
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:54,709
You're not pregnant?

1070
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,341
How dare you?

1071
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:59,080
-Sorry, a faux-pas, General,
-Can you introduce me?

1072
01:17:59,188 --> 01:18:02,055
General, let me introduce you
to my fiancée,

1073
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:04,185
Good evening, General,

1074
01:18:04,293 --> 01:18:07,387
Major Archibald, this is the
fourth time you're introducing her,

1075
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:11,432
Another faux-pas, General,

1076
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:32,654
You must forgive me, Marie-Hélène,

1077
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:34,450
I didn't want to offend you,

1078
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,046
I had a weak moment,

1079
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:37,625
The flesh is weak,

1080
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:39,557
I don't need to forgive you,
George Armstrong,

1081
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:41,856
I'm the happiest of all women,

1082
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:44,489
Is that true?

1083
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:47,568
It's so beautiful to feel loved
so passionately

1084
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:52,231
by a man who can renounce
the prosaic materiality of love,

1085
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:55,538
That is how I love you, Marie-Hélène,

1086
01:18:55,644 --> 01:18:57,839
I think I'm going to go,

1087
01:18:57,946 --> 01:18:59,743
I'll walk you,

1088
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:20,796
Dear wife,

1089
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:29,971
Today, I won a great victory,

1090
01:19:33,015 --> 01:19:44,324
Maybe more important
to me personally

1091
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:51,525
than all my military victories,

1092
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:54,329
Marie-Hélène,

1093
01:19:54,436 --> 01:19:57,132
George Armstrong,

1094
01:20:04,446 --> 01:20:06,778
Since you didn't have dinner,
I thought,,,,

1095
01:20:06,882 --> 01:20:10,750
I brought you a club sandwich,

1096
01:20:14,223 --> 01:20:16,088
Adorable Samaritan,

1097
01:20:27,169 --> 01:20:28,864
You must eat,

1098
01:20:28,971 --> 01:20:35,103
Eat? In my condition?
Excuse me,

1099
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:40,338
Is this where you write
your memoirs?

1100
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:43,316
Yes, I was writing to my wife,

1101
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,287
What a lucky woman,

1102
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:55,160
Marie-Hélène,

1103
01:20:55,264 --> 01:20:55,855
Yes?

1104
01:20:55,964 --> 01:20:57,898
My blood is burning,

1105
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,064
My poor little heart
is like a pony galloping too fast,

1106
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:05,699
-Please,,,,
-Yes?

1107
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:06,739
We must resist,

1108
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:08,867
Yes, yes,

1109
01:21:10,646 --> 01:21:12,079
I feel so perturbed,

1110
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,240
-My poor little heart,
-Marie-Hélène,,,

1111
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:16,908
,,,is a wounded pony,

1112
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:19,487
Please, Marie-Hélène,
We must resist!

1113
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:24,753
-Yes!
-We must resist, Marie-Hélène,

1114
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,690
Yes!

1115
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:28,490
Excuse me, but where
did you learn to do that?

1116
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:31,157
Carrying wounded soldiers,

1117
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,733
For the country!

1118
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:36,594
George Armstrong,

1119
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:39,173
Marie-Hélène,,,,

1120
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,434
Take me!

1121
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,373
Take me!

1122
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:49,378
Mr, Buffalo, this is not the right
time or the right place for you,

1123
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:54,788
My place is always
where America calls me to be,

1124
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,484
But you're supposed
to follow my orders,

1125
01:21:57,593 --> 01:22:00,255
Glory and victory!

1126
01:22:00,362 --> 01:22:01,829
Music!

1127
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:07,666
I order you!

1128
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:18,276
That's all we needed,
A clown among my soldiers,

1129
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,247
My white angel,

1130
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,215
That Buffalo Bill is unbelievable,

1131
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:26,219
He would do anything to steal
some of General Custer's glory,

1132
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:28,983
Absolutely,

1133
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:31,225
Remember you went to West Point,
General,

1134
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:34,420
Stay calm and remain elegant,
You are the glory,

1135
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:45,673
General, get ready!
Buffalo Bill is leaving with you,

1136
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,317
Glory to the flag!

1137
01:23:00,422 --> 01:23:01,650
What is going on?

1138
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:03,691
A little technical problem,

1139
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,987
How long is this going to take?

1140
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:07,721
An hour,

1141
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:12,289
Do you realize that a battle
is starting?

1142
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:15,493
Your machine is obviously modern
and beautiful,

1143
01:23:15,604 --> 01:23:17,629
but it doesn't seem to work very well,

1144
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:19,866
I'm warning you, General,

1145
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:23,809
If Buffalo Bill does his little number
among my soldiers during the battle,

1146
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:26,574
I will not miss an opportunity
to kill him,

1147
01:23:26,682 --> 01:23:28,946
I understand, but I don't want
to know anything about it,

1148
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,713
I have no affinity for this comedian,

1149
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:35,256
But whatever you do,
I don't want to know about it,

1150
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:38,182
Calm down,

1151
01:23:40,462 --> 01:23:43,625
General, your men
are very beautiful!

1152
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:45,791
Thank you, Buffalo,

1153
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:48,870
-I find them,,,,
-These are my men!

1154
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,938
They are my 7th brigade!

1155
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,836
Let me finish my speech,

1156
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:56,934
These men I just inspected
are absolutely splendid!

1157
01:23:57,045 --> 01:24:01,744
And I am proud, General,
to be one of your men,

1158
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,147
Yes, thank you,
Please, go now,

1159
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,709
-They are real soldiers, yes!
-Get out of here!

1160
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:08,187
Yes, General,

1161
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,527
Excuse me, General,

1162
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:17,154
And you, Buffalo Bill, will not get
any more money from us,

1163
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,632
General, allow me to walk
with my troops,

1164
01:24:20,736 --> 01:24:23,204
Granted, Custer,
But do not forget,

1165
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:24,863
Even if you spot the enemy,

1166
01:24:24,973 --> 01:24:26,634
you must only attack
after communicating

1167
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:29,040
with Crook's and Gibbon's columns,

1168
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:30,372
Do not attack by yourself!

1169
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:31,969
Go ahead,

1170
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:35,038
Do not forget,

1171
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:39,883
Do not attack by yourself,
Leave a little bit of glory for them,

1172
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:17,817
Farewell, my brave soldiers!

1173
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:23,956
And don't forget!
For the country, always! Go!

1174
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:49,890
It's time to go,
I'm leaving you with my little man,

1175
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:51,686
Give Daddy a kiss,

1176
01:25:52,327 --> 01:25:53,521
Here,

1177
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,621
Be careful, Mitch,
Don't get killed,

1178
01:25:57,732 --> 01:26:00,530
Me? Get killed?

1179
01:26:02,838 --> 01:26:03,896
Never!

1180
01:26:20,655 --> 01:26:23,283
Don't look at the soldiers,

1181
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:27,225
They're not soldiers,
They're ghosts!

1182
01:26:27,329 --> 01:26:32,596
Look at the sky!
It is beautiful!

1183
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:39,470
Go ahead! Go on!

1184
01:27:47,342 --> 01:27:51,403
I found a nice little blonde
in Baltimore,

1185
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:52,343
It's horrible,

1186
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:55,314
I have to stay here and play the fool
with all these knuckleheads,

1187
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:58,409
You're really lucky,

1188
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,714
After this, I'm going to Chile,

1189
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,085
Stop, It's depressing,

1190
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,020
There we go,

1191
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:04,455
It's happened again!

1192
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:06,857
Colonel Custer is firing Major Reno,

1193
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:09,590
He wants to act by himself,
He can't help it,

1194
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:13,065
He's going to get it
when he comes back,

1195
01:28:28,617 --> 01:28:30,847
For the country!

1196
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:36,254
This is a big day for us,

1197
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:39,691
Come on!
The young must protect the elders,

1198
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:41,489
Go ahead,

1199
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:43,723
Go ahead,

1200
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:45,197
Come on,

1201
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,698
Mothers, protect the young,

1202
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:56,743
Go ahead,

1203
01:28:58,413 --> 01:29:06,616
Dirty lndians! You're dead!

1204
01:29:28,843 --> 01:29:31,710
Wait, We must wait,

1205
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:34,577
Those are the orders
from General Terry,

1206
01:29:34,682 --> 01:29:36,149
Do you remember Washita?

1207
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:40,347
If I'd waited,
there would've been no Washita,

1208
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:43,256
Wait for what?

1209
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:45,189
They're all here,
Look at that,

1210
01:29:45,293 --> 01:29:51,232
Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,
My prey is escaping,

1211
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:58,161
At least a thousand,
This is going to be a good show,

1212
01:29:59,174 --> 01:30:01,608
General, you'd promised
to be nice to the lndians,

1213
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:03,940
We're planning to be, my friend,

1214
01:30:04,045 --> 01:30:05,603
So, my little Hermine?

1215
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:08,546
Still absorbed
in your Emily Bronte book?

1216
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,346
-Yes,
-That's good,

1217
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:19,292
My dear Anthropology Professor!
I knew it,

1218
01:30:19,394 --> 01:30:21,954
I'm leaving, General,
I'm done with my work,

1219
01:30:22,063 --> 01:30:23,621
Where are you going?

1220
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:25,460
Home,

1221
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,536
Don't tell my wife
about Marie-Hélène,

1222
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:39,772
I need to think about it,

1223
01:30:39,881 --> 01:30:42,145
I'm very discreet,

1224
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,514
What are we waiting for?

1225
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:47,179
I want to charge,
I'm going to charge!

1226
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:49,449
Please, calm down,

1227
01:30:49,557 --> 01:30:52,526
My prey is escaping!

1228
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:22,180
Watch out, brother!

1229
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:24,352
You have to go around them!

1230
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:27,121
He was found guilty,

1231
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:30,789
Hold your horses,
Sergeant, watch your men,

1232
01:31:46,347 --> 01:31:49,908
My stomach!

1233
01:31:50,018 --> 01:31:52,578
To have a stomachache
on the battlefield,,,,

1234
01:31:52,687 --> 01:31:58,091
It's awful! It hurts!

1235
01:31:58,193 --> 01:32:01,959
I can't fight!

1236
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:03,121
Are you wounded?

1237
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:06,564
No, I'm in pain,
My stomach,,,,

1238
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:11,264
Wait,

1239
01:32:11,372 --> 01:32:14,000
Should I finish him?

1240
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:16,709
You're scared, huh?

1241
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:18,603
Buffalo!

1242
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:20,579
Excuse me, Madam,

1243
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:25,283
Buffalo!

1244
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:48,638
Lay on the ground!

1245
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:54,139
-He's giving up,
-Buffalo Bill,,,,

1246
01:32:55,884 --> 01:33:02,221
Custer is going to remain
by himself in combat,

1247
01:33:02,323 --> 01:33:07,625
and he'll get all the glory
from the victory!

1248
01:33:07,729 --> 01:33:09,492
Calm down,

1249
01:33:09,597 --> 01:33:13,260
Congratulations, Custer,

1250
01:33:13,368 --> 01:33:15,097
Come, Marie-Hélène,

1251
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:18,900
Put your clothes back on
in front of these ladies, buffoon,

1252
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:24,138
He doesn't deserve your hand,
He is a coward,

1253
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:26,179
I need water!

1254
01:33:27,882 --> 01:33:29,349
He's very sensitive,

1255
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,782
He gives a pathetic example,

1256
01:33:31,886 --> 01:33:34,252
I've finished examining the animals,
and their excrements are clear,

1257
01:33:34,355 --> 01:33:36,084
May I be relieved, General?

1258
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:36,986
You may,

1259
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:38,080
Good,

1260
01:33:38,192 --> 01:33:39,284
Excuse me,

1261
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:44,088
How beautiful,
Too bad there are so many lndians,

1262
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:46,462
Yes,

1263
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:49,661
When does the battle start,
George Armstrong?

1264
01:33:49,771 --> 01:33:52,672
I don't know, my dear,
I must wait,

1265
01:33:52,774 --> 01:33:54,537
Wait,

1266
01:33:54,642 --> 01:33:57,008
Did you see all this big game?

1267
01:33:57,111 --> 01:33:59,170
But I must wait for General Gibbon,

1268
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,716
Another one
of General Terry's ideas,

1269
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:04,910
I think he's jealous of your glory,

1270
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:07,419
Of my glory and
of my presidential stature,

1271
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:08,853
Yes,

1272
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:13,227
Oh!

1273
01:34:13,328 --> 01:34:16,058
They really are wild animals,

1274
01:34:19,967 --> 01:34:22,435
How are you feeling, Marie-Hélène?

1275
01:34:22,537 --> 01:34:24,937
Good, but a little bashful,

1276
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:28,031
What opinion must you have of me,
after what happened last night?

1277
01:34:28,142 --> 01:34:31,805
George Armstrong,
Together forever--

1278
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:40,781
Marie-Hélène,,,,
Forever,

1279
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:55,328
Marie-Hélène, the white angel,
She's dead,

1280
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:56,494
No kidding,

1281
01:34:57,005 --> 01:35:01,465
Glory to our heroine!

1282
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:16,751
Tonight,,,,

1283
01:35:16,858 --> 01:35:18,553
Careful,

1284
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:25,827
-On stage, the theater will be full!
-Very well,

1285
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:27,696
Ah, my stomach!

1286
01:35:27,802 --> 01:35:33,672
Be brave, Stand,

1287
01:35:46,921 --> 01:35:49,913
Custer! It's over for you!

1288
01:35:50,024 --> 01:35:53,755
Damned butcher!

1289
01:35:59,867 --> 01:36:03,462
Trumpet,

1290
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:04,868
Play!

1291
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:18,710
Charge!

1292
01:36:28,696 --> 01:36:31,062
Kill them all! No mercy!

1293
01:36:32,733 --> 01:36:34,200
Charge!

1294
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:40,869
Kill the warriors first!

1295
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:22,308
Where are all those lndians
coming from?

1296
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:24,543
Where were they hiding?

1297
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:27,212
They are crazy! That is not
a proper way to make war!

1298
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,050
Gather the troops!

1299
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:35,488
Regroup!

1300
01:37:35,596 --> 01:37:39,088
Gather the troops!

1301
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:46,997
Come back this way!

1302
01:37:47,108 --> 01:37:52,478
Regroup!
Everybody go this way!

1303
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:55,845
Let's go!

1304
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:11,894
Collective action,
Collective,

1305
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:16,299
Tomorrow all the Americans
will be dead,

1306
01:38:17,772 --> 01:38:21,469
And now I shall go kill Custer,

1307
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:25,876
You're as old as a child,
and children must not fight,

1308
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:33,553
Companions, gather!

1309
01:38:38,392 --> 01:38:41,520
Form a circle!

1310
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:44,723
Form a circle!

1311
01:38:44,832 --> 01:38:47,801
Damned lndians!
They don't know how to fight a war!

1312
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:50,735
Form a circle!

1313
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:58,042
Surrender!

1314
01:39:08,122 --> 01:39:09,555
Indian warriors!

1315
01:39:09,657 --> 01:39:13,753
Where are the warriors
of the old days,

1316
01:39:13,861 --> 01:39:18,594
who would fight alone
against 100 guns?

1317
01:39:28,275 --> 01:39:29,742
Reload your gun,

1318
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:32,108
I can't, It's blocked,
You can't reload the bullets,

1319
01:39:32,213 --> 01:39:35,114
Impossible! It's the latest
American army model!

1320
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:36,877
The American army is finished,
that's all,

1321
01:39:36,984 --> 01:39:39,043
Where's your horse, Archibald?

1322
01:39:39,153 --> 01:39:41,121
I was the first,

1323
01:39:43,324 --> 01:39:44,791
Watch out! On the left!

1324
01:40:06,314 --> 01:40:07,508
Hi, ho, brave men!

1325
01:40:30,371 --> 01:40:32,305
We need to finish these lndians!

1326
01:40:33,574 --> 01:40:37,840
Charge, 7th Cavalry!

1327
01:40:55,363 --> 01:40:59,493
"Don't touch the white woman,"

1328
01:41:37,772 --> 01:41:40,866
It's not the best, but it hurts,

1329
01:41:46,914 --> 01:41:47,903
Are you all right, Archibald?

1330
01:41:48,015 --> 01:41:53,817
If you could move your butt,
I'm already,,,,

1331
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:04,789
Whoever dies for the country
hasn't lived in vain,

1332
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:06,423
I, on the contrary,
will live for the country,

1333
01:42:06,534 --> 01:42:08,627
because I'm not that stupid,

1334
01:42:11,105 --> 01:42:14,233
-Brother!
-Are you fatally wounded, brother?

1335
01:42:14,341 --> 01:42:16,832
It's pointless, I'm dying,

1336
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:27,817
The administration,,,,
I checked the accounts day by day,

1337
01:42:32,827 --> 01:42:36,160
You killed Marie-Hélène, my brother,
You killed all my comrades,

1338
01:42:36,263 --> 01:42:40,791
Play the trumpet!
It's a slaughter!

1339
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:43,563
I will kill you all!

1340
01:42:43,671 --> 01:42:44,968
All!

1341
01:42:45,072 --> 01:42:46,903
Play the trumpet!

1342
01:42:48,275 --> 01:42:50,402
I think we really lost, this time,

1343
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:52,911
That Custer is a complete idiot,

1344
01:42:54,348 --> 01:42:55,906
That doesn't surprise me,
I told you,

1345
01:42:56,016 --> 01:42:57,415
Look at what he's doing,

1346
01:42:57,518 --> 01:42:59,418
He's unable to win
against a few miserable lndians,

1347
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,044
I think we must sell everything,

1348
01:43:01,155 --> 01:43:01,678
So?

1349
01:43:01,789 --> 01:43:03,051
Pass the message,

1350
01:43:03,157 --> 01:43:03,953
Now?

1351
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:05,491
Right away,

1352
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:16,591
I am the father,
I can do whatever I want,

1353
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:21,240
Where is Custer?

1354
01:43:21,342 --> 01:43:26,803
Shot dead, General!

1355
01:43:56,677 --> 01:43:58,235
-I killed him,
-Yes,

1356
01:43:58,345 --> 01:44:00,609
-I'm really happy,
-Yes!

1357
01:44:03,684 --> 01:44:05,208
We must leave right away,

1358
01:44:05,319 --> 01:44:06,684
That's the only thing to do,

1359
01:44:06,787 --> 01:44:08,015
-Wait!
-Are you ready?

1360
01:44:08,122 --> 01:44:11,819
-Gentlemen! Don't leave this way,
-Wait,

1361
01:44:11,926 --> 01:44:15,987
I have the heroine's body,
I'm responsible,

1362
01:44:16,096 --> 01:44:17,723
-She is dead,
-Yes,

1363
01:44:17,831 --> 01:44:19,298
We need to be transported,

1364
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,300
-I have her body,
-There's no room,

1365
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:23,427
What do you mean, there's no room?
It's me!

1366
01:44:23,537 --> 01:44:24,970
There's no room,

1367
01:44:25,072 --> 01:44:26,733
I have a right to transportation!

1368
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,308
Let her rot here,
Pretty simple,

1369
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:32,573
Let's fly,
This isn't important,

1370
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:39,878
Wait!
I'm Mitch, Custer's scout!

1371
01:44:39,987 --> 01:44:41,352
Jerks!

1372
01:44:43,057 --> 01:44:45,548
Bastards!

1373
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:47,854
White savages!

1374
01:44:47,962 --> 01:44:51,125
White savages!

1375
01:45:13,621 --> 01:45:17,717
I'm the one who killed Custer,
I'm very happy,

1376
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:24,029
There will be other battles to win,
other Custers!

1377
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:27,430
Yes, many other Custers are alive,

1378
01:45:28,669 --> 01:45:34,005
There will be other Custers to kill,
Sitting Bull!

1379
01:45:55,796 --> 01:45:56,558
Daddy!

1380
01:45:56,663 --> 01:45:58,790
What is this?

1381
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:00,560
Look what I found,

1382
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:06,071
It's adorable, So cute,

1383
01:46:06,173 --> 01:46:08,266
What are you doing?

1384
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:10,343
So cute,

1385
01:46:10,444 --> 01:46:12,537
What's that?

1386
01:46:12,646 --> 01:46:15,911
"Sell all your railway bonds
immediately,"

1387
01:46:16,016 --> 01:46:17,813
-What is it?
-My God!

1388
01:46:17,918 --> 01:46:19,909
Dad?

1389
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:21,547
-Dad?
-Out of my way, sweetheart!

1390
01:46:21,655 --> 01:46:22,519
Can I keep it, Dad?

1391
01:46:22,623 --> 01:46:26,923
Do whatever you want
with your damned pigeon!

1392
01:46:37,237 --> 01:46:39,967
This is not the 7th Cavalry!

1393
01:46:42,276 --> 01:46:44,506
These are lndians entering the city!

1394
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:46,704
Good Lord!

1395
01:46:46,814 --> 01:46:47,508
Over there, as well!

1396
01:46:55,889 --> 01:46:58,858
Indians,,,,
This wasn't planned,

1397
01:46:58,959 --> 01:46:59,948
Out!

1398
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,152
Out!
