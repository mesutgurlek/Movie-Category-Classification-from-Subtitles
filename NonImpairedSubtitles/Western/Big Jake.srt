1
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:19,180
1909: the Edwardian Golden Age.

2
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:21,685
Genteel civilization had come
to England, the continent

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,187
and the eastern United States.

4
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,121
New York
rivaled London and Paris

5
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:27,250
as one of the great metropolises
of the world.

6
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,788
Albert Einstein had expounded
his theory of relativity

7
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,698
back in 1905, and science

8
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:39,670
had brought us the wonders
of the modern world.

9
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,301
Culture and refinement
had arrived

10
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:47,709
on the east coast of America.

11
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,180
Caruso was singing Pagliacci
at the Met.

12
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,706
Arturo Toscanini was conducting.

13
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,219
The Barrymores were performing

14
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:58,188
and a Ziegfeld girl
was the rage.

15
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:00,783
1909 in the western part
of the 46 United States

16
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:03,260
was not so refined.

17
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,225
The surviving lndian warriors

18
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:08,596
were now being rounded up
by the U.S. Army.

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,261
ln Washington,
William Howard Taft--

20
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,797
300 pounds of pure Republican--
was President

21
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,241
and life was comfortable.

22
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:22,212
ln other parts of the country,
men were fighting each other

23
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,772
and the elements.

24
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:29,220
ln the New York
department stores

25
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:32,246
a lady could buy maxis
and boots and live in style.

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,724
Out west,
they didn't think about style,

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,751
just living.

28
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,735
Eastern empire builders
had secured their fortunes--

29
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,999
the Morgans,
Vanderbilts, Carnegies.

30
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,266
There were empires
in the west, too,

31
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:50,206
such as
the great McCandles Ranch.

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,574
But these huge ranches
were held together

33
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,638
only by having
enough men and guns.

34
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,913
Notre Dame teams
were playing football

35
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:06,253
with end Knute Rockne
catching a forward pass.

36
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,259
ln the Arizona Territory

37
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:10,523
another team,
the Arizona Rangers

38
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,258
were busy just trying
to keep the peace.

39
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:16,324
Anna Pavlova, prima ballerina
of the Russian ballet,

40
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,097
was dancing Swan Lake.

41
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:25,071
The dance hall girl in the
Klondike gold rush saloon

42
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,271
was somewhat different.

43
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:30,076
By 1909, still photographs
had come to life.

44
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:33,846
Motion pictures had been born
with The Great Train Robbery.

45
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:41,155
While that make-believe drama
was on the movie screens

46
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:44,185
nine men crossed the Rio Bravo
into Texas.

47
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,093
The turbulent years
between the Civil War

48
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,468
and the turn of the century

49
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,268
brought out the best
in some people

50
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,298
but in others,
it brought out the worst.

51
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,902
Example: O'Brien,
a half-breed Apache

52
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,937
born of a Chiricahua mother
and lrish father.

53
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:06,848
A professional gunfighter--
one of the last of his kind.

54
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,149
Pop Dawson--
rode with the James boys

55
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,620
in Kansas and Missouri.

56
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,453
Said to have murdered
more than a dozen men--

57
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,686
one for as little
as seven dollars.

58
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:20,231
Trooper-- name unknown.

59
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:22,256
A back-shooter.
Considered a coward.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,268
Reputed to have been

61
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,133
a cavalry soldier
sometime in the past

62
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,765
but not to the personal
knowledge of his confederates.

63
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,435
William Fain,
younger of the Fain brothers.

64
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,239
Favors a shotgun-- a Greener--

65
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,076
for its bloody killing effect
at short range.

66
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:37,445
James William Duffy.

67
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,541
At age 14, killed his first man

68
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:42,519
who was an admirer
of his prostitute mother.

69
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,112
Dead shot with a rifle.

70
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,919
William Devries-- young Billy.

71
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,220
Not quite 21.

72
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,228
This raid was thought

73
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:53,425
to have been
his first outlaw act.

74
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:56,263
Walt Devries, his older brother
by 20 years.

75
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,394
He looks
more like an lowa farmer

76
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,199
than a professional killer.

77
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:03,139
John Goodfellow--
may be the worst of them.

78
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,937
An indiscriminate killer.

79
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,672
Women, children,
no consequence at all.

80
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,270
Prefers to work close.

81
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:11,339
Favors a razor-edged machete.

82
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,716
John Fain-- sometimes peace
officer and bounty hunter.

83
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,211
Served with distinction during
the Spanish-American War.

84
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:20,247
Professional soldier
thereafter.

85
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,817
Now between wars.

86
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,556
Currently banks,
trains, killings

87
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,766
and responsible for organizing
the infamous McCandles Raid.

88
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:44,977
Morning, Pancho.

89
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,540
Good morning.

90
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,291
Child, you need some air.

91
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,745
Time to get up, Mr. Jeff.

92
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,183
Delilah, l'm naked.

93
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:28,412
l seen you naked
the day you was born

94
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:29,943
and many times
thereafter.

95
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:31,578
Riders coming.

96
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:40,692
ls you getting up?

97
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,723
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,509
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

99
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,511
Grab his head,
grab his head!

100
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,514
Come on, now, hold him,
hold him, hold him.

101
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,539
Hold him, hold him,
hold him.

102
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,575
Chico!

103
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,917
That boy.

104
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,183
Chico!

105
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,384
Chico!

106
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:10,724
Hey, hey, come on!

107
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:15,264
Now, l know you'd like
to see Mr. Stubby

108
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,562
ride that bronc again

109
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,399
but go fetch me them eggs
like l asked you to.

110
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,426
Go ahead, now.

111
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,302
Hurry up.

112
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,109
Huh...

113
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,086
Strangers coming.

114
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,336
Mr. Jeff will be
a little late.

115
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,968
You make sure you have
a half a dozen or so

116
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,944
fresh eggs for
him, Moses Brown.

117
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,708
l've already
done that, woman.

118
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,271
For Miss Martha.

119
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:07,842
l'll take care
of that, boy.

120
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,785
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,584
Why, this is ridiculous.

122
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:14,284
Breakfast, Miss Martha,
nice and hot.

123
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,690
Thank you, Delilah.

124
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:16,694
But it's hot.

125
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,423
Just a minute, Delilah.

126
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,023
Bert, this is nineteen
hundred and nine.

127
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,499
There... There just
can't be rustlers.

128
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,933
Can be, Miss McCandles.

129
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:28,564
l'm 42 years old, and l fought
in the Lincoln County War.

130
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,767
lt's just not
that long ago that...

131
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:34,505
Why, it's just 15 years ago,
himself, Mr. McCandles hung...

132
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:38,743
Your breakfast is
getting cold, Miss Martha.

133
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:43,120
Some lovely flowers in
the garden, Delilah.

134
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:46,487
l wonder would you ask
Maria to cut them for me?

135
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:48,685
Yes'm.

136
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,250
You were saying, Bert?

137
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:52,455
l'm just saying, Miss McCandles

138
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:55,762
we're close enough to that
Mexican border to...

139
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Spit.

140
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,136
Yes, ma'am, that close.

141
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,833
And we're losing
a lot of cattle.

142
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,304
Let me think about it.

143
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:07,811
All right, ma'am.

144
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,836
Oh, Bert?

145
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,651
There are some men
riding in.

146
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,653
We could use
some short help,

147
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,655
if you like
the look of them.

148
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,680
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,020
Hyah!

150
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:46,875
Whoa, whoa.

151
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:48,510
-Whoa...
-Try him again.

152
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:56,946
A ranch sure is

153
00:10:56,988 --> 00:11:00,287
a deserted-looking place
during a roundup.

154
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,520
Can l help you men?

155
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:08,259
We heard
you was hiring.

156
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,961
Was.
But you're late.

157
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,737
Too late?

158
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,636
Afraid so.

159
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,469
Now, this place surely
does bespeak

160
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,706
of a great deal of money,
don't it?

161
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:26,973
Anything else l can do for you?

162
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,576
Trouble with money, though,

163
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:32,282
is that there's always somebody
wants to take it away from you.

164
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:35,451
l said is there anything else
l can do for you, mister?

165
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,929
Still, that's the only problem
with it,

166
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:42,367
and ain't that
the awful bloody truth?

167
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,094
Billy, you stay close
to me, you hear? Real close.

168
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,876
No!

169
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:30,410
Run, Little Jake.
Run.

170
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,244
Mrs. McCandles,

171
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,252
you want that
kid alive?

172
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,550
Don't you be a damn fool.

173
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,283
Hey, sonny.

174
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,656
-Hey, Trooper.
-Yeah!

175
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,001
Hyah!

176
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,212
Hey, O'Brien!

177
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,548
The boy!

178
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,421
Why, you mangy little...

179
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:26,657
Breed!

180
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,426
He's no good to us dead.

181
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,768
l can wait.

182
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:37,967
Fain,

183
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,670
l don't like
the name ''Breed.''

184
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:43,202
l'll try and remember that.

185
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,109
Give me that!

186
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,015
Come here, you little...

187
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,704
All right.

188
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:26,948
Put me down!

189
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,824
Come on,
put me down!

190
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,592
Hyah!

191
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:47,006
-Hyah!
-Hyah!

192
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,181
Get the doctor,
then find my sons.

193
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,845
And himself, your husband?

194
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,854
l have no husband.

195
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,981
Come on!

196
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,319
Hyah!

197
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,621
Take him to my bed.

198
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,290
Please, be careful with him.

199
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,433
Old Mexico!

200
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,774
There ain't nothing
they can do to us here.

201
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,006
The Mexicans can.

202
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,619
Jeffrey McCandles,
can you hear me?

203
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,431
This fool doctor says
you're going to die

204
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,865
but l say you are not.

205
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,506
l taught you better manners

206
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,512
than to make a liar out of your
mother, Jeffrey McCandles.

207
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:35,615
He's just sleeping,
Martha.

208
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:36,984
l know that.

209
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:51,961
Delilah, there's a big
red strongbox in the attic

210
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,970
l want it.

211
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,198
Yes'm.

212
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,658
We're seeking permission
from the Mexican government

213
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,856
at the highest possible levels,
Mrs. McCandles.

214
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,058
When we receive
that permission,

215
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,259
we are prepared

216
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,700
to enter Mexico
with howsoever many troops

217
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,227
as are acceptable
to the Mexican government

218
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,263
and to deliver
the ransom

219
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:33,708
wherever and
to whomever directed.

220
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:38,977
l am told that there
is $1 million in that box.

221
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,045
Buck,

222
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,486
what about you?

223
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,422
Speaking for the Rangers
or for myself?

224
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:48,948
For yourself.

225
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,756
l got ten of my best men
with me.

226
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,490
l'd like to go after
the boy myself.

227
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,760
lf you say so, Martha,
l'll take that box in.

228
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:59,427
l am grateful to you both

229
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,907
but l don't think this is
a job for the Rangers, Buck

230
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:05,568
nor for the Army, sir.

231
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,907
lt is, l think,
going to be a very

232
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:13,916
harsh and unpleasant
kind of business

233
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,387
and will, l think, require
an extremely harsh

234
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:20,549
and unpleasant kind
of man to see to it.

235
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:39,465
No, sir.

236
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,603
No, sir, l ain't.

237
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:43,840
Haven't butted into
anybody's business

238
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,849
since l was 18 year old

239
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,443
at which time
it almost got me killed.

240
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,647
Ain't going to
start that again.

241
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,287
What's the matter?

242
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:01,797
Oh, what'd he have
to go and do that for?

243
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,801
You got any last
words, Scotsman?

244
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,860
Aye, give me my bonnet.

245
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,337
My head's cold.

246
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,453
All right, now, let's
get on with the hanging.

247
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,522
Howdy.

248
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,688
Got you kind of surrounded,
haven't they?

249
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,402
This your business, mister?

250
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,632
What is he, a murderer
or a horse thief?

251
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,333
He's a sheep farmer.

252
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,969
Phew, that's where that
horrible odor comes from.

253
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:50,670
That's right.

254
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:51,874
How 'bout the boy?

255
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,383
You gonna hang him, too,

256
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,385
or just beat him up
some more?

257
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,182
Mister, you shouldn't
butt into something

258
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,155
that's none of your business,
you really shouldn't.

259
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,124
l think you're right, friend.

260
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:03,353
A man shouldn't
butt into anything

261
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,157
that ain't his own affair.

262
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:06,356
Sheep farmer--

263
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,490
you want to sell them sheep?

264
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:09,726
Uh, yes, sir.

265
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:14,533
Well, let's see,
l'll give you $100 now

266
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:17,097
and $300
when l get them to market.

267
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,405
Well, that's highway robbery.

268
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,535
Well, maybe you think

269
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:23,240
you're going to get
a better offer for them today.

270
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,180
l'll take it.

271
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,843
With one proviso.

272
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,317
What's that?

273
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,982
l go with the sheep.

274
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,990
Good.

275
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:36,185
You're working for me.

276
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:38,127
You go ahead.

277
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:40,995
You go right ahead.

278
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,693
lf there's anything l enjoy more
than hanging a sheepherder

279
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:46,464
it's hanging somebody who sticks
his nose into my business.

280
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:49,769
Go on, you try to cut that rope.

281
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:53,038
No, you've got me scared.

282
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,041
You do it.

283
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,439
Dog!

284
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,618
Get him off! Get him off!

285
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,783
Dog!

286
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,315
Just who in the hell
do you think you are?

287
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,658
Jacob McCandles.

288
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:15,961
Oh, l, uh...

289
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,491
l thought you were dead,
Mr. McCandles.

290
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,504
Not hardly.

291
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,028
You going to cut him down?

292
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,317
Now his hands.

293
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:44,449
200 miles south, Bar MC.

294
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,326
Foreman's name's Gonzales.

295
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:47,762
Tell him l sent you.

296
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:49,425
Take the boy with you.

297
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:50,558
Thank you, sir.

298
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,829
Come along, son.

299
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:59,768
lf you follow him,
l'll hunt you down and kill you.

300
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,472
Every mother's son
of you.

301
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:04,636
Come on, dog.

302
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:21,992
Seòor McCandles!

303
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:25,835
Hola, Chihuahua.

304
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:27,336
Para usted, seòor.

305
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:23,558
Here you are, Mr. McCandles.

306
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,858
Thanks, Joe.

307
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:30,959
Hank!

308
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,492
She's in there,
Mr. McCandles, waiting.

309
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,664
What happened
to your spurs?

310
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,196
Oh, they don't work

311
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,732
on these newfangled
velocipedes.

312
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,335
Oh.

313
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,505
Well, see that they get
my gear out of that car.

314
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:45,037
Yes, sir.

315
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:01,659
Martha.

316
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:07,660
lt's been a long time.

317
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:09,673
lt's good to see you again.

318
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:12,574
You've changed, Jacob.

319
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,440
Not you.

320
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:18,973
You're as young
and lovely as ever.

321
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:23,577
l called you, Jacob

322
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,485
because your grandson
has been kidnapped.

323
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:28,082
You didn't know
you had a grandson?

324
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,355
You have, by
your son Jeffrey,

325
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,692
and Jeffrey has been
badly wounded by the kidnappers.

326
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,958
Will he live?

327
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,056
This is the ransom note.

328
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,068
The blood on it
is Jeffrey's.

329
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:39,160
Will he live?

330
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,329
Yes.

331
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,430
l would not contemplate
otherwise.

332
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,486
Do we ha...

333
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,455
Do you have a million dollars?

334
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,617
Yes. And many times that.

335
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,387
Hank!

336
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:04,917
Yes, ma'am?

337
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:08,396
Will you bring in
the strongbox, please?

338
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:16,071
Set it down here
on the table.

339
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:17,573
That's all.

340
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:18,939
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,714
ls this the way you want it?

342
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,584
Yes.

343
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,055
They're very dangerous men.

344
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,887
They've already killed
ten people.

345
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,119
Many of them you knew.

346
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,252
Juan and his family...

347
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:39,626
Teena and the little boy?

348
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,290
Moses Brown.

349
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:44,266
Old Mose...

350
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,428
lousy cook.

351
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,964
Jacob, as l said, they're very
dangerous and violent people.

352
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:52,769
And l don't think
we've got any other choice

353
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,437
than to give them
what they've asked for.

354
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:55,968
l agree.

355
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:59,847
But you know that, pay or not,

356
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:02,010
you run the risk of never seeing
the boy again.

357
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,452
l understand.

358
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,922
Well, ''follow the map
until met.''

359
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,150
That's easy.

360
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:11,889
l'll need food for a week,
water for ten days,

361
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,523
three packhorses
and a good mule.

362
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,898
Waiting for you outside.

363
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,733
Martha, you didn't happen
to think of my Greeners--

364
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:22,102
the double barrels?

365
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,539
Oh...

366
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,643
Ah...!

367
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:38,113
Oh... you brought Betsy.

368
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,554
Pays to be careful.

369
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,354
Well, now let's see
if l've forgotten any...

370
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,451
Oh, l'll need
a piece of clothing

371
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,395
that the boy's worn recently.

372
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,366
His?

373
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,800
Yes.

374
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,167
Well...

375
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:02,702
Hank, who picked the mule?

376
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:03,712
l did.

377
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:04,713
Pack it.

378
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:05,714
Yes, sir.

379
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,113
Don't forget the
rest of the gear.

380
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:08,138
No, sir.

381
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,055
Hello, Buck.

382
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:20,324
Hello, you old horse thief.

383
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,854
l thought you was
dead for sure by now.

384
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,127
That'll be the day.

385
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,360
Thinking of taking a trip?

386
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,164
Well, a million dollars
is a lot of money, Jacob.

387
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,329
l thought we might
go with you.

388
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:29,395
ln those?

389
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,030
They're faster
than a horse.

390
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,904
They'll go farther
and last longer.

391
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,933
lt's 1909, Jacob!

392
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:36,706
Meaning that my way's
old-fashioned.

393
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:38,941
Meaning l'm offering my
help, if you'll have me.

394
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:42,279
Well, thanks, Buck,
but l'll go it alone.

395
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:44,513
Well, suit yourself, Jacob.

396
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:47,318
What about me?

397
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:48,448
James?

398
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:49,958
Good morning, Daddy.

399
00:28:49,992 --> 00:28:52,961
lt's been some time
since l've seen you.

400
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:54,462
Ten years, l think.

401
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:58,959
Nine years and four months.

402
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:00,968
But you're welcome
to come along, son.

403
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:03,528
l am moved by your faith
in someone

404
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:07,270
you haven't seen since
he was 16 years old, Daddy.

405
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,642
''Daddy''?

406
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,203
Daddy.

407
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:15,543
Daddy.

408
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:21,918
Well, son, since you haven't
learned to respect your elders

409
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,927
it's time you learned
to respect your betters.

410
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:42,838
lf you weren't my father...

411
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:45,073
Go ahead, l give you leave.

412
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:50,685
lf you're going with me,

413
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,120
l hope you can use that hogleg
better than you can fight.

414
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,250
Does that suit you... Daddy?

415
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:01,128
You can call me father,

416
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:03,563
you can call me Jacob,
you can call me Jake,

417
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,864
you can call me
a dirty son of a bitch,

418
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,836
but if you ever call me
''Daddy'' again

419
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:10,133
l'll finish this fight.

420
00:30:25,021 --> 00:30:26,181
Tiquina?

421
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,587
Seòor?

422
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:29,454
Tell Sam Sharpnose
l want to see him.

423
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:32,222
Tell him the same place
as the last time

424
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,354
and all he needs
is his saddle.

425
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:36,991
Get yourself a good horse.

426
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,727
Oh, Tiquina?

427
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:40,895
? Si?

428
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:42,301
Bring the horse back.

429
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:44,704
Seguro, Seòor.

430
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,235
Where's your brother?

431
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:49,869
He ought to be here with you.

432
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:51,971
He'll be here.

433
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,666
Look out for that mule!

434
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,520
l tried to tell you
about them horses, Jacob.

435
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,616
Now you take these here
automobiles...

436
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,422
Jacob, this is
your son Michael.

437
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,428
Father.

438
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,828
Good to see you again.

439
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,798
He's a mite skittish,
isn't he, Father?

440
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,996
The little fellow's
still alive, Mother.

441
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:52,267
Are you sure?

442
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,366
l saw him.

443
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:55,741
The kidnappers were
in the Chilicote flatlands,

444
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:57,905
20 miles from Coyame Pass,
five hours ago.

445
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:59,005
Using the automobiles,

446
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,016
l believe the Rangers
can get to the pass

447
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,541
long before the kidnappers,
and set a trap for them.

448
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,611
You want to chance it,
Mother?

449
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:07,622
Buck?

450
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:08,782
No matter what happens,

451
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:11,088
l think they'll kill the boy
sooner or later.

452
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:13,652
l've got the best riflemen
in Texas with me--

453
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:15,095
that means in the world.

454
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,359
With luck, at say, 200 yards,

455
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,423
l think maybe we can kill
every one of those animals

456
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,957
before they hear the shots
that did it.

457
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,263
l think it's worth a gamble.

458
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:25,532
lt's very daring.

459
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:27,769
Yes... yes, l'll chance it.

460
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,675
What do you think, Jacob?

461
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:34,607
Suit yourself, Martha.

462
00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:41,846
l was asking your opinion,
Jacob.

463
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:45,759
No, you made up your mind.

464
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:47,729
You made your decision alone.

465
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:49,128
You live it alone.

466
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,759
l was wrong.

467
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,235
You haven't changed,
have you, Jacob McCandles?

468
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,204
Not one bit.

469
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,707
Do it!

470
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:05,944
You still want me
to take this box in?

471
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:08,245
Yes.

472
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:10,844
lf they fail, it falls to you.

473
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:21,724
You coming along?

474
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:25,393
No. l'll go with them.

475
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:31,869
Dog...

476
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:33,807
let's go!

477
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,725
l hear him.

478
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:23,840
Sam.

479
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:26,676
Morning, Jacob.

480
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,557
l brought the saddle.

481
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:40,390
There's your horse.

482
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:41,861
Going hunting, Sam.

483
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:43,591
-Hunting for what?
-Men.

484
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,590
l don't hunt Apaches.

485
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:50,195
l don't hunt my own people.
You remember that, Jacob.

486
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:54,937
They kidnapped my grandson, Sam.

487
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:59,037
l don't know what color they are
and l don't care.

488
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,482
l have no gun.

489
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:08,022
Close or far?

490
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:12,117
Close. My eyes... no good.

491
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:20,797
Me, too.

492
00:38:57,532 --> 00:38:59,432
Keep going!

493
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:07,141
Any sign of
the kidnappers, son?

494
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:10,406
Couldn't see anything moving
for miles.

495
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:12,912
Good, then we must be
ahead of them.

496
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,643
There's a narrow pass
at the end of the valley.

497
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:17,776
l think it's a good place
for us to trap them.

498
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,578
l'm for it.

499
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,424
Buck, not knowing
where the kidnappers are

500
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,155
we can't chance that pass.

501
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:30,426
They're young fools.

502
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:32,728
And l'm an old one.

503
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:35,201
We're going get that boy.

504
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:20,842
We'll hide these machines
up at the end of the canyon.

505
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:24,214
This is a good place
for the ambush.

506
00:40:41,135 --> 00:40:43,933
Jump!

507
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:01,622
Stop these damn things!

508
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,851
Get out!

509
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:07,724
Take cover!

510
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:25,670
Good place for an ambush,
all right.

511
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:27,977
And we're it.

512
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,033
What happened
to that crazy bicycle?

513
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:57,067
l think he crashed
into that canyon.

514
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:10,617
Let's get him out of here.

515
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:12,023
Come on!

516
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:09,949
They've had enough, John.

517
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:12,579
They ain't going to be able
to follow us anymore.

518
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,213
Let's sting them
a little more

519
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:17,691
and they'll come through
with the money.

520
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,908
That crazy kid.

521
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:35,967
Yeah.

522
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:37,374
The horses!

523
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:38,970
Everybody get
to them horses!

524
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:40,514
Move it!

525
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,924
Grab that kid!

526
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,134
Stop! Put me down!

527
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:16,380
Damn it, Pop,
the next time

528
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:18,409
l tell you to
tie that kid up

529
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:21,616
don't be worried
about hurting him.

530
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:24,648
Hyah! Hyah!

531
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:03,958
Get out of here, you...

532
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,508
Buck...

533
00:45:58,153 --> 00:45:59,313
The boy?

534
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:02,517
We don't know.

535
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:06,327
My son Michael?

536
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:09,922
We don't know, uh...

537
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:12,660
There was an explosion
southeast of here.

538
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:22,206
Well, do you have any water?

539
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:25,235
No.

540
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,808
Well, l'll give you
half of ours.

541
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:31,250
And as soon as l can

542
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:34,915
l'll telegraph
that you're walking in.

543
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:36,651
Going south,
it's going to be some time

544
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,488
before you get to
a telegraph station.

545
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:41,086
l'm going to have to take one
of your mounts, send for help.

546
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,357
Some of my men are hurt bad.

547
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:44,194
No, l'll need them.

548
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:45,358
Anything else?

549
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,426
No.

550
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:52,701
No, you've been more than
generous, Mr. McCandles.

551
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,300
l think so, Buck.

552
00:46:55,343 --> 00:46:57,504
15 years ago,
l'd have killed you

553
00:46:57,545 --> 00:46:59,979
for risking my grandson's life.

554
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:02,380
lf l find him dead,
l'll still kill ya.

555
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,346
You going along?

556
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:11,847
Well, the last time l asked you
that question, you said, ''No''

557
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:14,589
and you said it
in a loud and clear voice.

558
00:47:14,629 --> 00:47:17,928
Now l'm asking you a question:
You coming along?

559
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:21,561
You damn rights l am, Father.

560
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:25,796
Throw a blanket on him.

561
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,933
l can ride without a blanket.

562
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:31,434
l'm not worried about your butt,
it's his back.

563
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:36,841
Come on.

564
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,255
Something down there.
ls that it?

565
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:00,272
That's it.

566
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:03,402
Well, here, you take the mule
down the long way.

567
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:05,912
l don't want to lose him
even by accident.

568
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,004
You go with him.

569
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:08,515
l'm going down there.

570
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:12,178
You'll go where you're told.

571
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:19,025
Do this, do that.

572
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,324
l'll do as l
damn well please.

573
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,557
You do what
your father tells you

574
00:48:23,598 --> 00:48:25,156
every time he tells you

575
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,429
you might come through
this thing alive.

576
00:48:27,468 --> 00:48:30,164
Maybe even
save the boy's life.

577
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:32,934
Otherwise, you're going
to get yourself killed.

578
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:35,339
Don't matter to me,

579
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:38,937
but you'll probably
get him killed, too.

580
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:40,412
That does.

581
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:35,296
Oh, Father, am l
glad to see you.

582
00:49:35,336 --> 00:49:36,598
You ain't dead?

583
00:49:36,637 --> 00:49:37,604
No.

584
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:38,935
No broken bones?

585
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:40,565
l don't think so.

586
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:42,235
Take off your glasses.

587
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:43,607
My what?

588
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:45,669
Your goggles.

589
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:54,516
That's for scaring me
out of ten years of my life,

590
00:49:54,555 --> 00:49:56,318
which l can't spare.

591
00:49:56,357 --> 00:49:57,688
l had to be still.

592
00:49:57,725 --> 00:49:59,716
l didn't know who was
moving around up there.

593
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:01,786
You hurt?

594
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:03,797
No.

595
00:50:10,204 --> 00:50:12,672
That's for risking
my grandson's life.

596
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:15,699
You do that again and l'll break
every bone in your body.

597
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,472
Father...

598
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,745
The next time...

599
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:23,182
Yeah?

600
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:28,154
The next time,
l won't take off my goggles.

601
00:50:29,323 --> 00:50:31,314
Whoa.

602
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:43,263
You all right?

603
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:44,896
Was.

604
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:48,136
For an old mule, he's got
quite a kick, don't he?

605
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:51,009
l think he was using
brass knuckles.

606
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:54,276
Better mount up
before we lose him.

607
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:57,478
Wonder what the hell
he has in store for us next.

608
00:51:41,962 --> 00:51:44,988
You know, that's a dirty
habit, if you ask me.

609
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:47,023
Nobody asked you.

610
00:51:50,371 --> 00:51:51,770
Pa?

611
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:52,773
Yeah?

612
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:56,538
You need to wear
glasses, do ya?

613
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:59,341
Just to see with.

614
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,473
Pa...

615
00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:04,075
Mm-hmm.

616
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:05,483
They say that Ma
booted you out

617
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:07,384
'cause you had a weakness
for the ladies.

618
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:08,615
ls that true?

619
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:14,117
l mean, no offense,
but l find that hard to believe.

620
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,594
What do you find
hard to believe?

621
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:21,601
James, cut it out.

622
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:25,071
l mean, maybe
before you got old

623
00:52:25,105 --> 00:52:27,198
you was quite
a ladies... ooh!

624
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,243
What's the matter
with your leg?

625
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,576
Nothing.

626
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:35,878
You been favoring it all day.
What's the matter with it?

627
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:39,579
l got hit by some buckshot,
that's all.

628
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,554
Take down your pants.

629
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:43,454
Are you on the level?

630
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:45,823
You going to take down
your pants

631
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,384
or do l have to do it
for you?

632
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:48,918
You and who else?

633
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:50,362
Dog.

634
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,431
My, what a beautiful pattern.

635
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,768
He must've been
real close to you.

636
00:52:58,806 --> 00:53:00,967
Will you shut up?

637
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:01,997
That's a deep one.

638
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:03,202
Sam, you know
what he did?

639
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:04,268
Forgot to duck?

640
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:07,371
He stuck his butt up,
that's what he did.

641
00:53:07,414 --> 00:53:09,848
Boy, when you're in
that kind of a gunfight

642
00:53:09,884 --> 00:53:11,181
keep your butt down.

643
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:13,186
That's the thing
to remember.

644
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,711
There's always some bustard
on the other side

645
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:18,850
that's got enough the sense
of humor to shoot you there

646
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:21,157
instead of in the head,
every time.

647
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:23,789
How about a shot of whiskey?

648
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:25,765
Yeah, where is it?

649
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,133
ls that them?

650
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:09,301
Yep.

651
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:11,937
Maybe, uh, eight
hours ahead of us.

652
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:13,071
All of them?

653
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:14,546
Yep.

654
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:16,675
They're not trying to
cover their tracks,

655
00:54:16,717 --> 00:54:17,945
that's for sure.

656
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:21,317
Sam, l got a hunch
we're being followed.

657
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:23,915
Near or far?

658
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:27,689
Well, far... l... l...
l feel it more than l know it.

659
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:29,821
l'll go see.

660
00:54:29,863 --> 00:54:31,694
Where'd you get
those saddles?

661
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:36,864
Found 'em.

662
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:40,196
All right, you two,

663
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,969
grab yourself a saddle.

664
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:43,374
Hurry it up.

665
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,605
Wouldn't want
to lose you children.

666
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:12,495
We're being followed.

667
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:13,699
You were right.

668
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:14,765
How many?

669
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:15,832
Three or four.

670
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:16,934
Did you see 'em?

671
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:18,569
No, but l got close enough
to hear 'em.

672
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:20,910
They're still
a couple hours behind.

673
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:22,245
A couple hours, huh?

674
00:55:22,282 --> 00:55:23,874
You better cool off
that horse, Sam.

675
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:25,885
We'll take a break here.

676
00:55:33,227 --> 00:55:35,388
Give me a swig
of that water.

677
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:37,192
See to your horses first.

678
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:38,858
l'll take him.

679
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,609
What kind of a gun is that

680
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:02,679
you got hanging around
your belly, Michael?

681
00:56:02,723 --> 00:56:05,021
lt's a Bergman 191 1.

682
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:08,551
191 1? lt's only 1909.

683
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:10,153
Preproduction model,
Father.

684
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,255
We own some stock.

685
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:12,925
Why is it
so funny-shaped?

686
00:56:12,966 --> 00:56:15,901
The shells load into
a magazine, Father,

687
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,404
the magazine into
the handle of the gun.

688
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:20,134
lt's gas operated,
you see.

689
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:21,402
Gas operated?

690
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:22,932
lt shoots real fast.

691
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,444
Well, Michael,
can you shoot?

692
00:56:25,479 --> 00:56:27,071
Proficiently, Father.

693
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:29,082
Well...

694
00:56:29,116 --> 00:56:30,708
as many times as you can

695
00:56:30,751 --> 00:56:32,719
before this hits the ground--

696
00:56:32,753 --> 00:56:34,414
like maybe once?

697
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:39,359
Well, Michael,
you were supposed to shoot.

698
00:56:39,393 --> 00:56:41,452
With this?

699
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:43,087
lt's a gun, isn't it?

700
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,188
Well, yes, of course.

701
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:45,664
Well, shoot it.

702
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:47,166
But, Father...

703
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:57,800
Boy, you need a keeper.

704
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,437
Pa, l wouldn't
come out just yet.

705
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,381
Sam, l want to offer
my personal apologies.

706
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,781
You can get up now.

707
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:05,284
l'm not coming out.

708
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,685
Not till you say
l can shoot back.

709
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:09,188
He fired his six shots.

710
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:10,281
Pa!

711
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:12,417
Stop interrupting.

712
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:18,496
Put that thing away.

713
00:57:20,334 --> 00:57:21,892
That damn mule!

714
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,001
lf he busts up that box,
Michael, you'll... ouch.

715
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,038
Till you're used to
the safety on this...

716
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:32,875
Being dry, you better
help your father.

717
00:57:32,913 --> 00:57:33,971
Oh.

718
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:41,714
Father, l...

719
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:43,723
Proficient, eh?

720
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:59,503
Now, what was it
you were trying to tell me?

721
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,508
That there were eight shots
in that gun.

722
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,203
Oh, thanks.

723
00:58:03,243 --> 00:58:04,574
Give me a hand here.

724
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:07,842
Father, there has been
a misunderstanding.

725
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:09,906
When l said that l could
shoot proficiently

726
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,178
l meant with this.

727
00:58:11,218 --> 00:58:12,776
-With that?
-Yes, sir.

728
00:58:14,922 --> 00:58:18,050
Pick a target.

729
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:19,615
That tall tree there,

730
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,821
the edge of the small
broken branch.

731
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:24,422
Son, that's over 400 yards.

732
00:58:24,464 --> 00:58:26,694
Nearer five.

733
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:28,928
Well, if you can shoot
that far,

734
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:31,869
quarter of a mile straight
along the edge of my nose

735
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:33,304
is a mountain buck.

736
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,830
Shoot it.

737
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,105
l don't kill to make
a point, Father.

738
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:43,749
Michael,
there's two reasons to kill:

739
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:45,547
survival and meat.

740
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:46,951
We need meat.

741
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,385
Oh, it's too late.

742
00:58:57,531 --> 00:59:00,432
That's good shooting.

743
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:02,367
Not bad.

744
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:05,235
Father, you want
to try a shot?

745
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:07,035
Scope's set
for 500 yards.

746
00:59:07,074 --> 00:59:10,043
Son, l couldn't
see that far.

747
00:59:10,077 --> 00:59:12,045
Sam?!

748
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,673
Give me a hand
packing that mule.

749
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:19,911
Michael, let me see
that hand gun.

750
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:24,351
That sure is something.

751
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:46,874
Damn.

752
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:48,609
Something wrong, Father?

753
00:59:48,649 --> 00:59:53,348
Well, l can sleep cold,
eat raw meat, even raw fish,

754
00:59:53,387 --> 00:59:57,221
but, come evening,
l sure miss my hot coffee.

755
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:59,384
Open me up a can
of them peaches.

756
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:01,758
Hey... quite
an improvement.

757
01:00:01,795 --> 01:00:04,662
l'll bet you could almost get
that fancy gun

758
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:06,325
out of that fancy holster

759
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:10,063
before some fast gentleman
with an old-fashioned six gun

760
01:00:10,103 --> 01:00:11,439
blew a hole in you.

761
01:00:11,439 --> 01:00:12,463
blew a hole in you.

762
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:13,564
-Oh...
-You know what l think?

763
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:17,475
A spring... a spring at
the bottom of the holster.

764
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:19,672
lt might work.

765
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:21,943
Sure spending a lot of time
with this thing.

766
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:23,609
Michael, do you
really think

767
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:25,551
that Little Jake
is still alive?

768
01:00:25,586 --> 01:00:26,951
What did you call him?

769
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:28,887
He called him
Little Jake, Father.

770
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:30,948
Mom insisted.

771
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:32,185
Well, l'll be damned.

772
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:34,956
You didn't know he was named
after you, did you?

773
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:36,326
No, l didn't.

774
01:00:36,363 --> 01:00:38,923
Well, l guess it's
kind of hard to keep in touch.

775
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:41,298
l mean, you run out
on your family that way.

776
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:43,803
You never hear that at home.

777
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:46,500
You're short on ears
and long on mouth.

778
01:00:51,378 --> 01:00:54,142
Will you ever learn
to can it, James?

779
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:56,615
Well, you sure are respectful
of his feelings,

780
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,878
l'll say that for you.

781
01:00:57,918 --> 01:00:58,885
Me?

782
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:00,386
He was right.

783
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:01,718
Yeah.

784
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,983
That's the trouble.

785
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:12,559
Oh, thanks.

786
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:17,203
What's the boy like,
Michael?

787
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:19,229
He's like you
and James, Pa.

788
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:20,968
Like me and James?

789
01:01:28,582 --> 01:01:30,243
Still four or five of them?

790
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:32,946
Yep, but they
haven't closed in yet.

791
01:01:32,987 --> 01:01:34,887
They're being real quiet.

792
01:01:34,922 --> 01:01:36,480
How close?

793
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:38,754
Maybe another hour.

794
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:41,386
There's one closer, though,
right behind your head.

795
01:01:41,428 --> 01:01:44,795
l don't know whether
he's with them or not.

796
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:48,529
He... sits his horse out there
about 200 yards.

797
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,935
He waits. He listens.

798
01:01:50,971 --> 01:01:52,268
Wonder what he wants.

799
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:55,173
l could kill him, Jacob.

800
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:56,608
Real easy.

801
01:01:56,644 --> 01:01:58,578
ln cold blood?

802
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:01,012
Oh, you're squeamish, are you?

803
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:04,209
Well, between your brother's
love of pretty toys

804
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:05,946
and your high moral tone,

805
01:02:05,986 --> 01:02:08,454
l hope you don't get killed
before this thing's over.

806
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:09,547
We'll wait.

807
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,784
You won't have to.

808
01:02:10,824 --> 01:02:11,882
He's coming in.

809
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:15,460
James, come on.

810
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,471
Hello to camp.

811
01:02:31,512 --> 01:02:33,104
Can l come in?

812
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:37,745
Come on in and welcome.

813
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:51,292
Well...

814
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:52,765
l was hoping for
a cup of coffee

815
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,461
but you're running
a cold camp here.

816
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:56,264
Yep.

817
01:02:56,303 --> 01:02:57,600
How about a peach?

818
01:02:57,638 --> 01:02:59,435
No, that's hurts my teeth.

819
01:02:59,473 --> 01:03:04,274
Well, l got hooked on these
when l was a younker.

820
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:05,505
Could never get my fill.

821
01:03:07,581 --> 01:03:09,515
Oh, hell, mister,
you don't need that.

822
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,574
l'm not a damn fool.

823
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:12,210
l know you got
three or four men

824
01:03:12,252 --> 01:03:13,378
out there watching me.

825
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,409
Can l move my hand?

826
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:16,616
Go ahead.

827
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:23,191
That's my bona fides.

828
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,135
Well, l hope that boy
don't catch a cold.

829
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:32,400
That would cause me
great annoyance and displeasure.

830
01:03:32,439 --> 01:03:34,964
Mister, that just scares
the hell out of me--

831
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:37,305
the thought that you
might be annoyed.

832
01:03:37,344 --> 01:03:40,643
l'm glad to hear that.

833
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:43,241
Now, did you come here
to give me a message

834
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:45,251
or just to pass the time of day?

835
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:47,116
From here you go to Escondero.

836
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:49,418
You wait there
till you hear from us.

837
01:03:49,456 --> 01:03:52,948
You've been following us two,
maybe three days.

838
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:54,927
Why did you wait so long?

839
01:03:54,962 --> 01:03:56,827
l haven't been following you.

840
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:58,695
l've been waiting right here

841
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,529
just like the map says.

842
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:01,966
Oh?

843
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:06,734
Hey... that the money?

844
01:04:10,744 --> 01:04:11,904
Open her up.

845
01:04:11,945 --> 01:04:13,503
l'd like to look at it.

846
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:20,952
Help yourself...

847
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:23,182
just as soon
as you bring in the boy.

848
01:04:28,095 --> 01:04:29,619
Who are you?

849
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:32,530
Just say l work
for the McCandles.

850
01:04:32,566 --> 01:04:33,965
The boy mean anything to you?

851
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,968
Never laid eyes on him.

852
01:04:36,036 --> 01:04:40,666
But l'm being paid to bring him
back alive or you dead.

853
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,938
Each and every one of you.

854
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:45,968
Now, l'd rather
bring the boy back.

855
01:04:46,013 --> 01:04:47,241
That's easier.

856
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:49,749
But when it comes
right down to it,

857
01:04:49,783 --> 01:04:50,943
don't matter to me.

858
01:04:50,984 --> 01:04:55,751
l'll earn my pay
one way or the other.

859
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:58,121
Now, how about you?

860
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:01,389
Are you the Big Chief
or one of the little lndians?

861
01:05:01,428 --> 01:05:04,090
Oh, just a little lndian.
Just a messenger boy.

862
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:06,725
Well, you've delivered
the message.

863
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:07,927
That's all.

864
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:09,060
There's more.

865
01:05:09,103 --> 01:05:10,570
l'm in here alone.

866
01:05:10,604 --> 01:05:12,868
You've been followed
like you think.

867
01:05:12,906 --> 01:05:14,931
You best stay
right on your toes.

868
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:17,602
You be real tough, real loose.

869
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:21,444
What you got in that box
is too big to keep a secret

870
01:05:21,482 --> 01:05:23,143
and the thing is this:

871
01:05:23,183 --> 01:05:25,117
you got to deliver that box
to us.

872
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:27,279
You got to put it
right in our hands.

873
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:28,652
You understand?

874
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:31,715
Good intentions won't buy you
nothing but that boy's corpse.

875
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,091
lt's just as
simple as that.

876
01:05:34,128 --> 01:05:37,256
Somebody takes that
box away from you

877
01:05:37,297 --> 01:05:41,324
we won't be understanding, we
won't wait, we won't try again.

878
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:44,963
l'll just send that boy's body
back to you in a basket.

879
01:05:45,038 --> 01:05:47,199
You understand?

880
01:05:51,044 --> 01:05:54,343
Mister, l said,
do you understand me?

881
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:56,679
l understand.

882
01:06:25,245 --> 01:06:26,337
Jacob...

883
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,445
What's the matter?

884
01:06:32,486 --> 01:06:35,182
l make big mistake.

885
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:38,157
ln that stand of trees,

886
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:40,353
there's two men.

887
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:45,231
They'll have heard
where we're going.

888
01:06:45,265 --> 01:06:46,698
Kill 'em.

889
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,098
Dog, go with him.

890
01:06:57,544 --> 01:06:59,876
Bring in the horses
and get that stuff packed.

891
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:15,986
Hyah!

892
01:07:34,882 --> 01:07:36,281
Hyah! Hyah!

893
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:41,948
Well?

894
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:44,455
l'm gettin' old.

895
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:46,425
There were two men,
l killed one.

896
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,394
Damn.

897
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:52,330
That means they'll get us
at Escondero for sure.

898
01:07:52,366 --> 01:07:53,799
Escondero.

899
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,597
Where have l heard
that name before?

900
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:58,239
Boom town. Oil.

901
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,727
Well, that cuts it.

902
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:27,757
Yeah, must be a celebration.

903
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:35,402
Town will be loaded
with strangers.

904
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:10,242
Ain't this
a little showy, Pa?

905
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:14,839
l mean, that big red box
and all the guns out?

906
01:09:14,882 --> 01:09:16,406
l hate secrets.

907
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,384
Never knew one to be kept.

908
01:09:18,419 --> 01:09:21,320
They've all heard
what's in that red box

909
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:22,913
and they all want it.

910
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:26,482
What we're doin'
by this ostentatious display

911
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:28,654
is telling them
they can't have it.

912
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:31,221
Hell, we may... may be savin'

913
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:35,292
some poor miscreant soul's life
by doing this.

914
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:36,997
Maybe even our own.

915
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:41,738
Go unpack that piggy bank
and the rest of our gear.

916
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:43,037
Hey, Jamaco!

917
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:46,573
Lleba los caballos.

918
01:09:46,613 --> 01:09:47,910
Si, Seòor.

919
01:09:56,857 --> 01:09:59,655
Man, when they fiesta
in this town,

920
01:09:59,693 --> 01:10:01,923
they really fiesta.

921
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:12,099
What's the matter with you?

922
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:14,972
He's the one
got away, Jacob.

923
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,906
Want me to get 'im?

924
01:10:16,944 --> 01:10:18,104
No.

925
01:10:18,145 --> 01:10:21,114
But keep an eye on him.

926
01:10:21,148 --> 01:10:23,275
Probably a lot more.

927
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:24,716
Dog.

928
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:29,255
Oh, this is heavy.

929
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:30,950
Feels like
it's full of rocks.

930
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,982
l'm going to get me
a big private room

931
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,288
with a big soft bed...

932
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:35,352
One big room

933
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:37,489
and one big bed
for all of us.

934
01:10:37,531 --> 01:10:40,295
Money doesn't
grow on trees.

935
01:10:40,334 --> 01:10:41,892
Give us a room.

936
01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:44,904
The dog is all right, but,
uh, we do not allow lndians.

937
01:10:44,938 --> 01:10:46,428
He's with me.

938
01:10:46,473 --> 01:10:47,599
No lndians.

939
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:56,014
No lndians?

940
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:57,607
l'll sleep in the barn.

941
01:10:59,286 --> 01:11:01,914
The Jacob McCandles?

942
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:02,944
That's right.

943
01:11:03,056 --> 01:11:04,353
My apologies, Mr. McCandles.

944
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:05,722
l thought you was dead, sir.

945
01:11:05,759 --> 01:11:07,954
Dead?

946
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:10,793
Next man says that to me,
l'm gonna shoot, so help me.

947
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,389
Dog.

948
01:11:34,388 --> 01:11:37,380
Bring it up.

949
01:11:37,424 --> 01:11:39,551
Put it over there
in the corner.

950
01:11:39,593 --> 01:11:41,891
Oh, don't tell me
it's that heavy.

951
01:11:42,996 --> 01:11:44,623
lt sure is!

952
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:47,395
l never knew money
could weigh so much.

953
01:11:47,434 --> 01:11:49,698
What time is it?

954
01:11:49,736 --> 01:11:51,499
l can't believe
l got two sons

955
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:52,903
who don't own a watch.

956
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,635
Nor a window
to throw it out of.

957
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:55,699
Pretty near dark.

958
01:11:55,742 --> 01:11:57,539
Yep. 5:00.

959
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:01,275
Man! Take a look
at Babylon.

960
01:12:02,983 --> 01:12:07,352
They're going to have themselves
a real party tonight.

961
01:12:08,422 --> 01:12:11,323
l wish l could dance me
a jig with a pretty lady.

962
01:12:11,358 --> 01:12:14,327
Why not?

963
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:16,454
Oh, because of the box.

964
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:18,829
Yeah, and the men
who followed us in.

965
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:20,561
We're walking into trouble.

966
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:22,466
What do you do
when cockroaches

967
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:24,300
get in the woodwork,
Michael?

968
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:25,498
Smoke 'em out?

969
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:26,665
That's right.

970
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:28,971
Why not wait until
they make a move?

971
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:31,977
Because waitin's good
for them and bad for us.

972
01:12:32,012 --> 01:12:33,980
You get impatient, nervy,

973
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:35,777
careless, maybe dead.

974
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:37,113
l've seen it.

975
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,913
Besides, you two children

976
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:40,510
haven't had the experience

977
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:41,851
for that sort of thing

978
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:43,686
and l don't have the patience.

979
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:46,284
So we're gonna invite 'em
here tonight.

980
01:12:46,326 --> 01:12:47,850
Now, Father,
l think that...

981
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:49,658
You think?

982
01:12:49,696 --> 01:12:50,958
Michael, your thinking's

983
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:52,488
already cost us some lives.

984
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:55,001
l intend to hang on to mine.

985
01:12:55,035 --> 01:12:56,559
Your father got us this far

986
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:58,366
'cause he knows what he's doin',

987
01:12:58,405 --> 01:12:59,770
so for the next 24 hours,

988
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:01,000
why don't you both

989
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,874
just keep your mouths
shut and listen to him?

990
01:13:03,911 --> 01:13:05,811
That's more words than l spoke

991
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:07,609
since l know you.

992
01:13:07,648 --> 01:13:10,276
Gentlemen, agreed?

993
01:13:10,317 --> 01:13:11,682
All right, Sam.

994
01:13:11,718 --> 01:13:12,810
l want you to go down

995
01:13:12,853 --> 01:13:14,480
and take a look
at the horses.

996
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:16,614
Make yourself seen
around the stables

997
01:13:16,657 --> 01:13:18,591
and tonight, James,
you go out

998
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:20,889
and have yourself
a real good time

999
01:13:20,928 --> 01:13:23,226
and when l leave
this room, Michael

1000
01:13:23,263 --> 01:13:24,958
you'll be the sittin' duck.

1001
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:26,295
With only you

1002
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,823
between them
and that box

1003
01:13:27,868 --> 01:13:29,665
they'll think
it's going to be

1004
01:13:29,703 --> 01:13:31,864
like taking candy
away from a baby.

1005
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:33,964
Tonight, Sam, there's
going to be a...

1006
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,702
disturbance out
on the street.

1007
01:13:35,742 --> 01:13:37,505
l want you to
come over the roof

1008
01:13:37,544 --> 01:13:38,670
and into the window.

1009
01:13:38,712 --> 01:13:40,976
But you tell him
not to shoot me,

1010
01:13:41,014 --> 01:13:42,504
not even by accident.

1011
01:13:42,549 --> 01:13:43,982
Yeah, remind...

1012
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:44,983
l heard him.

1013
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:45,984
Father, you know what

1014
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:47,553
you're letting
yourself in for.

1015
01:13:47,588 --> 01:13:50,716
There's a little
eight-year-old boy

1016
01:13:50,757 --> 01:13:52,520
somewhere out there

1017
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:55,357
scared, lonely,
and probably wondering

1018
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:57,556
what's happened
to his world.

1019
01:13:57,598 --> 01:14:01,500
We came here to find him
and take him home,

1020
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:03,127
alive, if possible.

1021
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,129
That's what l intend to do.

1022
01:14:07,174 --> 01:14:10,769
He's right about one thing:
You'll be all alone

1023
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:11,937
down there.

1024
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:13,207
No sweat.

1025
01:14:13,246 --> 01:14:17,182
All right, Sam, you better
pick up another shotgun,

1026
01:14:17,217 --> 01:14:18,980
a Greener, if possible.

1027
01:14:20,988 --> 01:14:23,422
Well, l'm gonna take
myself a nap.

1028
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:26,449
You wake me up, 9:00, for sure.

1029
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:30,394
Now, you two young fools
be careful tonight

1030
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,660
because if you
get yourself killed

1031
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:35,827
your mother'd never
let me hear the end of it.

1032
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:09,731
Por favor, amigo.

1033
01:15:18,745 --> 01:15:19,973
Whew.

1034
01:15:22,315 --> 01:15:23,475
Pardon me.

1035
01:15:23,516 --> 01:15:25,950
Are you with these
oil-drillers?

1036
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:27,145
Yep.

1037
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:29,586
Well, could you
tell me which one

1038
01:15:29,622 --> 01:15:31,954
is the orneriest
in your outfit?

1039
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:34,960
Oh, that's easy.
Mr. Sweet!

1040
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:36,256
That portly gentleman

1041
01:15:36,295 --> 01:15:38,229
right over there,
with the beard.

1042
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:43,793
Thank you.

1043
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:50,536
Mr. Sweet?

1044
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:51,543
Yes?

1045
01:15:51,577 --> 01:15:52,669
May l?

1046
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:58,540
You shouldn't have done that.

1047
01:16:02,622 --> 01:16:03,953
You were right.

1048
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,700
You're a little overmatched,
aren't you?

1049
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:21,263
Do you want some help?

1050
01:16:21,307 --> 01:16:22,501
No.

1051
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:27,609
You better quit being
unfriendly, mister.

1052
01:16:33,252 --> 01:16:35,584
Sam's made it, Pa.

1053
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:37,282
Well, it's about time.

1054
01:16:37,323 --> 01:16:38,449
Hold it.

1055
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:39,685
Just a minute, friend.

1056
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,420
l think there's
been a mistake.

1057
01:16:41,461 --> 01:16:44,191
Have you ever been
to Nacogdoches?

1058
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,960
Nacogdoches?

1059
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:48,159
No.

1060
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:49,668
Strange.

1061
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:51,602
Pardon me.

1062
01:17:01,214 --> 01:17:03,307
But l ain't never been
to Nacogdoches.

1063
01:17:03,349 --> 01:17:05,112
Damn it, mister,
l believe you.

1064
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:15,385
You're next.

1065
01:17:15,428 --> 01:17:16,520
Please sit
down, sir.

1066
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:17,722
Thank you.

1067
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,924
Say, l was lookin' at...
do l read right?

1068
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:21,194
Oh, yes, sir.

1069
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:22,895
Genuine hot showers

1070
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:25,495
imported all the way
from St. Louis.

1071
01:17:25,538 --> 01:17:27,301
The only one of its kind

1072
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,706
between Dallas and Mexico City.

1073
01:17:29,742 --> 01:17:30,731
Ah.

1074
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:31,936
l highly recommend it, Seòor.

1075
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:33,205
?Donde?

1076
01:17:33,246 --> 01:17:34,213
Over there.

1077
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:36,306
Muchicimas gracias.

1078
01:17:52,331 --> 01:17:54,629
Hey, how about
let's get out of here?

1079
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:56,760
After we finish this dance.

1080
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:57,996
Yes, ma'am.

1081
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:18,717
Oh, man!

1082
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:20,885
They ought to have
one of these

1083
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,259
in every barbershop
in the world.

1084
01:18:23,296 --> 01:18:25,491
Mas tante, maestro.

1085
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,195
Be through in a
minute, mister.

1086
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:31,226
Take your time, mister.

1087
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,505
Man, l smell as sweet

1088
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:39,534
as lilies
of the valley right now.

1089
01:18:39,579 --> 01:18:41,240
l'm in no hurry, friend.

1090
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,941
You just take your time.

1091
01:18:42,982 --> 01:18:44,108
Muchacho.

1092
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,947
Venga aqui.

1093
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:47,145
Si, seòor.

1094
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:52,283
There's a cantina

1095
01:18:52,325 --> 01:18:53,952
at the far edge of town
named Sanchez's.

1096
01:18:53,993 --> 01:18:54,960
You know it?

1097
01:18:54,994 --> 01:18:55,961
Si, seòor.

1098
01:18:55,995 --> 01:18:57,087
You go there and buy me

1099
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,096
a bottle of tequila.

1100
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:59,825
Pero la cantina
esta aqui cerca.

1101
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:00,957
Nowhere else, mind you.

1102
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,898
Now, they have a brand
special for me.

1103
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:04,231
Now, that's what l want.

1104
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,259
Go fetch it.

1105
01:19:06,339 --> 01:19:07,328
Si, seòor.

1106
01:19:09,508 --> 01:19:12,102
Well...

1107
01:19:12,144 --> 01:19:13,236
guess l'm finished.

1108
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:15,907
You stay right where you are.

1109
01:19:15,948 --> 01:19:18,382
Unless you want
to hurry things.

1110
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:19,475
Take your choice.

1111
01:19:19,518 --> 01:19:21,383
No hurry.

1112
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,751
No hurry at all.

1113
01:19:24,957 --> 01:19:27,050
But l could use
those clothes over there.

1114
01:19:27,093 --> 01:19:29,152
l'm getting a little cold.

1115
01:19:29,195 --> 01:19:31,925
You don't shut up
and stay where you are,

1116
01:19:31,964 --> 01:19:33,295
you'll be a lot colder.

1117
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:41,937
Here.

1118
01:19:41,974 --> 01:19:43,635
Protect yourself with this.

1119
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:33,651
Why don't you
buy me a drink now?

1120
01:20:33,693 --> 01:20:35,320
Well, l thought
we was leaving.

1121
01:20:35,361 --> 01:20:36,328
Later.

1122
01:20:36,362 --> 01:20:37,329
Hmm.

1123
01:20:37,363 --> 01:20:38,330
Am l too heavy?

1124
01:20:38,364 --> 01:20:39,353
No, not at all.

1125
01:20:46,038 --> 01:20:47,198
Hey, you...

1126
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,139
with that fancy holster on.

1127
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:51,006
Yeah, you.
You got my woman.

1128
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:54,238
Sorry.

1129
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,544
That's my woman.

1130
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,512
All right, friend.

1131
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:05,521
Hey, don't turn
your back on me

1132
01:21:05,558 --> 01:21:07,048
while l'm talking to you.

1133
01:21:07,093 --> 01:21:09,288
My apologies, sir, if l've o--

1134
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:10,556
Shut up!

1135
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:12,086
Yes, sir.

1136
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,560
Well, you sure
don't rile very easy, sonny.

1137
01:21:17,603 --> 01:21:19,662
You know, son,

1138
01:21:19,705 --> 01:21:21,434
you are a coward.

1139
01:21:21,474 --> 01:21:25,308
Yeah... yeah, you're a coward.

1140
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:26,936
Yeah, a live coward.

1141
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:28,970
Now let's hear you say it.

1142
01:21:29,048 --> 01:21:32,245
All right.
l'm a coward.

1143
01:21:32,284 --> 01:21:35,151
Hey, l think l finally
said something

1144
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:36,484
to rile the boy.

1145
01:21:36,522 --> 01:21:38,012
You sure did.

1146
01:22:02,982 --> 01:22:05,280
Well, friend...

1147
01:22:05,317 --> 01:22:06,944
that's it.

1148
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,214
No hard feelings.

1149
01:22:15,528 --> 01:22:16,995
The hell there ain't.

1150
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:22,861
Sam!

1151
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:30,443
Anybody hurt?

1152
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:32,943
What's the matter?

1153
01:22:32,978 --> 01:22:35,913
Shotgun blast
broke the lock, Jacob.

1154
01:22:35,948 --> 01:22:39,509
Newspaper clippings.

1155
01:22:39,552 --> 01:22:42,680
l killed a man
for newspaper clippings.

1156
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:45,019
Where's the money, Father?

1157
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,426
Where is it, Daddy?

1158
01:22:51,464 --> 01:22:53,557
You think l stole it?

1159
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,659
You think l stole it, Michael?

1160
01:22:56,702 --> 01:22:58,932
Tell the lndian
to go for a walk.

1161
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,439
Go for a walk, Sam.

1162
01:23:02,475 --> 01:23:03,806
You sure, Jacob?

1163
01:23:03,843 --> 01:23:05,606
Sure. Take the
dog with you.

1164
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:06,838
Go with him, dog.

1165
01:23:20,659 --> 01:23:21,785
Now what?

1166
01:23:21,827 --> 01:23:23,522
Where's the money, Daddy?

1167
01:23:23,562 --> 01:23:25,894
You go to hell.

1168
01:23:39,011 --> 01:23:40,342
James?

1169
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,517
Now, boys, you know that's...

1170
01:23:49,555 --> 01:23:52,649
that's no way to treat
your old daddy.

1171
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:53,680
Jokes!

1172
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:28,957
Can l come in now?

1173
01:24:28,994 --> 01:24:30,325
Come on in.

1174
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:35,327
Well, there ain't no money.

1175
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:37,665
There never has been.

1176
01:24:40,339 --> 01:24:42,500
That's right, never has been.

1177
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,442
lt was your mother's decision,
and mine,

1178
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:48,503
that we take the boy
and not pay for him.

1179
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:50,242
My mother's decision?

1180
01:24:50,282 --> 01:24:51,840
l don't believe you.

1181
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:56,116
There were seven McCandles
people killed, one crippled.

1182
01:24:56,155 --> 01:24:57,918
Your own brother shot--

1183
01:24:57,957 --> 01:25:00,323
maybe crippled,
maybe even dead--

1184
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:02,088
and my grandson kidnapped.

1185
01:25:02,127 --> 01:25:04,425
l ain't gonna pay 'em for that.

1186
01:25:04,463 --> 01:25:05,896
Neither is your mother.

1187
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:07,193
l thought l knew her.

1188
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:08,392
Not hardly.

1189
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:09,799
lt can't be done, Pa.

1190
01:25:09,835 --> 01:25:11,928
They'll kill
Little Jake for sure.

1191
01:25:12,037 --> 01:25:14,437
Not if we kill them first.

1192
01:25:36,528 --> 01:25:37,961
There you are, Jacob.

1193
01:25:37,997 --> 01:25:39,089
Just like new.

1194
01:25:43,135 --> 01:25:44,261
Quiet, dog.

1195
01:25:55,848 --> 01:25:58,646
What are you
snooping around for?

1196
01:25:58,684 --> 01:26:01,585
l ain't snoopin'.

1197
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:03,212
l come to get ya.

1198
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:06,588
Your horses are saddled
out in back, so let's go.

1199
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:07,785
Where to?

1200
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:08,793
l'll take you there.

1201
01:26:08,827 --> 01:26:09,919
That's all
you need to know.

1202
01:26:10,029 --> 01:26:12,725
'Ceptin' if you
don't have the money...

1203
01:26:12,765 --> 01:26:15,893
or l ain't back within
18 minutes from now...

1204
01:26:15,934 --> 01:26:18,232
or if somebody tries
to follow us

1205
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:19,897
to the meetin' place...

1206
01:26:19,938 --> 01:26:21,735
or tries to keep us
from leaving after

1207
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:23,935
we get the money, we'll
kill that little boy.

1208
01:26:24,009 --> 01:26:26,204
Well, l ain't gonna give
you the money

1209
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:27,803
till l get the little boy.

1210
01:26:27,846 --> 01:26:29,211
Now how you gonna do it?

1211
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:31,375
We'll have a rifle on him.

1212
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:33,715
With a real fine sharpshooter

1213
01:26:33,752 --> 01:26:35,117
behind it,

1214
01:26:35,154 --> 01:26:37,782
with one of them fancy
new telescopic sights.

1215
01:26:37,823 --> 01:26:39,950
From the time you
set eyes on him,

1216
01:26:40,025 --> 01:26:42,152
until one hour
after we vamoose,

1217
01:26:42,194 --> 01:26:43,889
you won't know
where our man is,

1218
01:26:43,929 --> 01:26:46,397
and we won't be able
to tell him not to shoot

1219
01:26:46,432 --> 01:26:47,956
even if we was so inclined.

1220
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,834
Something goes wrong,
that little boy is dead,

1221
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,394
sure as shootin'.

1222
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:56,499
Well, uh... give us
a couple of minutes

1223
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:58,737
to pull ourselves together.

1224
01:26:58,777 --> 01:27:01,439
The front's being watched.

1225
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,005
l'll be out in back myself.

1226
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:12,587
18 minutes.

1227
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:13,921
Means they're close by.

1228
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:16,051
James, give me back my watch.

1229
01:27:16,095 --> 01:27:18,928
Don't you ever return
things you borrow?

1230
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:21,522
lt's full of pictures.

1231
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:23,694
Yeah.

1232
01:27:23,736 --> 01:27:26,330
Michael, the sharpshooter
is yours.

1233
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:27,338
Kill him.

1234
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,498
How?

1235
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,837
Well, get lucky.

1236
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:31,866
Or better still,
pray that l get lucky

1237
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,673
and make him miss
the first shot.

1238
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:36,237
That'll give you
about ten seconds

1239
01:27:36,281 --> 01:27:38,909
to see his powder
flare, locate him,

1240
01:27:38,951 --> 01:27:41,419
and keep him
from shooting again.

1241
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:44,479
Nothin' to it.

1242
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:55,963
Well, let's get go--

1243
01:27:56,035 --> 01:27:57,969
Where's the other one?

1244
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,231
There's supposed to be
four of you.

1245
01:28:00,272 --> 01:28:02,331
He's dead.

1246
01:28:02,374 --> 01:28:04,604
We had to pay a price
to keep that box

1247
01:28:04,643 --> 01:28:06,167
for you and your friends.

1248
01:28:06,212 --> 01:28:09,147
l was told to bring in
all of you or none of you,

1249
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:11,911
so's we could keep
an eye on you, understand?

1250
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:13,475
No loose ends.

1251
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:15,248
Well, he's dead.

1252
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:18,085
l want to see his body.

1253
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:27,929
All right.

1254
01:28:27,967 --> 01:28:29,730
He's laid out with
the rest of 'em,

1255
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:30,928
down at the jailhouse.

1256
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:32,301
Jailhouse?

1257
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:34,033
Right over there.

1258
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:39,342
Jailhouse...

1259
01:28:39,378 --> 01:28:41,243
Come on, let's go see him.

1260
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,611
We haven't got all night.

1261
01:28:42,648 --> 01:28:43,615
Never mind.

1262
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:46,880
lt ain't important.

1263
01:29:40,606 --> 01:29:44,372
You gents is gettin'
a little nervous, ain't ya?

1264
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:45,877
Let's go.

1265
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:17,535
Sam...

1266
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:20,807
wish it were a little later.

1267
01:30:20,846 --> 01:30:22,245
Uh-huh.

1268
01:30:22,281 --> 01:30:25,341
Pitchfork rain right now
would be in our favor.

1269
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:26,851
Lightning might help.

1270
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,147
Might hurt, too.

1271
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:17,302
Hey, what's that?!

1272
01:31:17,336 --> 01:31:20,897
Too late to do him any good.

1273
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:22,964
There's another one inside.

1274
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:24,406
He's dead, too.

1275
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:25,569
The night watchman.

1276
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:27,476
Say, you ain't
a-lookin' too good.

1277
01:31:27,513 --> 01:31:29,674
Sight of blood bother
you or something?

1278
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:30,977
Only my own.

1279
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,175
Oh.

1280
01:31:32,217 --> 01:31:34,310
Well, this is where

1281
01:31:34,353 --> 01:31:36,321
everybody stops, except you.

1282
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:39,415
You take that box in alone.

1283
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:45,392
You'll be met
at the other end.

1284
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:59,569
Well, Sam, they say
the elk in Montana

1285
01:31:59,611 --> 01:32:02,739
are as big as
buffalo this year.

1286
01:32:02,781 --> 01:32:05,443
We ought to go hunt 'em
when this is over.

1287
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:08,476
l look forward to that.

1288
01:32:09,555 --> 01:32:11,318
l wish they were buffalo.

1289
01:32:11,357 --> 01:32:14,087
Yeah.

1290
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:17,254
Times change.

1291
01:32:17,296 --> 01:32:19,526
Gimme that mule.

1292
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,974
James...

1293
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:38,539
l see him.

1294
01:32:43,622 --> 01:32:45,385
Dog.

1295
01:34:16,682 --> 01:34:18,946
Good to see you made it.

1296
01:34:18,984 --> 01:34:22,613
Yeah, we've had a full day.

1297
01:34:34,066 --> 01:34:36,261
Guess he don't like
anybody behind him.

1298
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:37,529
Neither do l.

1299
01:34:44,443 --> 01:34:47,207
All right, that goes
for you, too, Fatty.

1300
01:34:47,246 --> 01:34:49,714
Get out where
l can see you.

1301
01:34:57,155 --> 01:35:01,489
You must figure
l'm a real dangerous man.

1302
01:35:03,495 --> 01:35:05,793
Will, come on down.

1303
01:35:12,938 --> 01:35:15,133
l told you to move, Fatty.

1304
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:20,773
Dog.

1305
01:35:22,247 --> 01:35:24,181
Get him off me!

1306
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:28,913
Call your dog off!

1307
01:35:28,954 --> 01:35:30,922
Get him away!

1308
01:35:33,558 --> 01:35:35,082
Get him off of me!

1309
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:36,685
Call that dog off!

1310
01:35:36,728 --> 01:35:39,196
Fain!

1311
01:35:41,066 --> 01:35:43,330
l wouldn't do that.

1312
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:44,858
Call your dog off.

1313
01:35:44,903 --> 01:35:45,961
Get him off!

1314
01:35:46,004 --> 01:35:47,096
Dog.

1315
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:55,740
Now call off yours.

1316
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,945
The box.

1317
01:36:25,243 --> 01:36:26,801
Open it up.

1318
01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:28,938
The boy.

1319
01:36:29,014 --> 01:36:31,073
Will.

1320
01:36:51,036 --> 01:36:52,094
Stay.

1321
01:37:02,147 --> 01:37:03,705
Open it up.

1322
01:37:06,218 --> 01:37:07,810
Take that hood off.

1323
01:37:07,853 --> 01:37:09,480
Like to see what l'm buying.

1324
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:32,734
l just saw something
in your eyes

1325
01:37:32,777 --> 01:37:34,836
l don't like.

1326
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,940
l saw a foolish thought.

1327
01:37:38,016 --> 01:37:40,644
You understand me.

1328
01:37:40,685 --> 01:37:43,119
Anything happens,
anything at all,

1329
01:37:43,154 --> 01:37:45,952
your fault, my fault,
nobody's fault--

1330
01:37:45,991 --> 01:37:47,458
my little brother

1331
01:37:47,492 --> 01:37:49,460
will blow that kid's
head right off.

1332
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:51,428
lt's as
simple as that.

1333
01:37:51,463 --> 01:37:54,159
No matter who else gets killed,
that boy dies.

1334
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:55,962
lf the shotgun misses him,
it don't matter.

1335
01:37:56,067 --> 01:37:57,762
You already know about
the rifle on him.

1336
01:37:57,802 --> 01:38:01,101
That won't be as messy
as a shotgun at three feet

1337
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:03,232
but that boy will be
just as dead.

1338
01:38:03,275 --> 01:38:04,435
You understand me?

1339
01:38:07,345 --> 01:38:09,279
Say it.

1340
01:38:09,314 --> 01:38:11,748
l understand.

1341
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:16,280
Now, open it up.

1342
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:51,355
That's the stuff
that dreams are made of.

1343
01:38:57,495 --> 01:39:00,055
What's a million dollars
look like, John?

1344
01:39:05,503 --> 01:39:07,334
Now you understand.

1345
01:39:07,372 --> 01:39:10,102
lf anything goes wrong--
anything at all--

1346
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:13,736
your fault, my fault,
nobody's fault, it don't matter.

1347
01:39:13,778 --> 01:39:16,110
l'm gonna blow your head off.

1348
01:39:16,147 --> 01:39:17,910
lt's as simple as that.

1349
01:39:18,016 --> 01:39:19,916
What did he say?

1350
01:39:19,985 --> 01:39:22,078
l can't hear him.

1351
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,920
No matter what else happens,
no matter who gets killed,

1352
01:39:25,957 --> 01:39:28,050
l'm gonna blow your head off.

1353
01:39:30,562 --> 01:39:32,189
Something wrong, John?

1354
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:41,729
Kill the boy!

1355
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:45,134
Dog!

1356
01:39:55,153 --> 01:39:57,144
Come on, little Jake!

1357
01:39:59,724 --> 01:40:01,089
Run!

1358
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:09,597
Gimme that shotgun!

1359
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:36,121
Whoa...!

1360
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:41,564
Will.

1361
01:40:44,769 --> 01:40:45,758
Will!

1362
01:40:48,106 --> 01:40:49,095
He's dead.

1363
01:40:53,878 --> 01:40:55,539
l want his shotgun.

1364
01:41:01,052 --> 01:41:02,485
Hurt?

1365
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,851
Yeah.

1366
01:41:06,091 --> 01:41:08,082
Put your finger there.

1367
01:41:17,802 --> 01:41:19,269
Are you hurt?

1368
01:41:19,304 --> 01:41:21,636
No, l'm scared.

1369
01:41:23,308 --> 01:41:25,276
So am l.

1370
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,073
But don't let them know it.

1371
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:02,244
Jake.

1372
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:03,872
Yes, sir?

1373
01:42:10,255 --> 01:42:11,779
You ever fire a gun?

1374
01:42:11,823 --> 01:42:13,654
No, sir.

1375
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:15,955
Well, use it if you have to.

1376
01:42:16,027 --> 01:42:17,961
Yes, sir.

1377
01:42:18,029 --> 01:42:19,587
Now, when l start firing

1378
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:22,395
you hightail it out
there and find James.

1379
01:42:22,433 --> 01:42:23,764
Yes, sir.

1380
01:42:54,566 --> 01:42:55,624
Ready?

1381
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:56,759
Yes, sir.

1382
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:57,790
Go!

1383
01:43:04,075 --> 01:43:05,838
Boy's outside! Kill him!

1384
01:43:26,631 --> 01:43:28,462
You hear that?

1385
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,865
They got the boy.

1386
01:43:29,901 --> 01:43:33,234
The hell l did,
that's my derringer.

1387
01:43:39,944 --> 01:43:42,970
James! Uncle James!

1388
01:43:46,284 --> 01:43:47,273
Oh!

1389
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:51,145
Jake, get out of here!

1390
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:53,180
Hide! The stables!

1391
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:56,224
That sound like a derringer?

1392
01:44:21,619 --> 01:44:23,610
l wouldn't.

1393
01:44:24,789 --> 01:44:26,313
Holster it.

1394
01:44:33,898 --> 01:44:35,263
Raise your hands.

1395
01:44:37,602 --> 01:44:38,967
The other's broke.

1396
01:44:39,037 --> 01:44:41,403
That'll do just fine.

1397
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:42,906
Now turn around.

1398
01:44:44,843 --> 01:44:46,504
Real slow.

1399
01:45:01,226 --> 01:45:04,127
l hear you killed two good men
in a fair fight tonight.

1400
01:45:04,162 --> 01:45:05,288
ls that right?

1401
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:08,925
No. Three, counting you.

1402
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,934
Prove it.

1403
01:45:57,949 --> 01:46:00,281
That sound like a boy screaming?

1404
01:46:02,487 --> 01:46:04,352
Wonder how he's gonna get it?

1405
01:46:04,389 --> 01:46:07,415
With a bullet or a machete,
like the lndian did.

1406
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:20,691
l wouldn't.

1407
01:47:46,224 --> 01:47:49,660
You come close, Mister,
but no cigar.

1408
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:04,838
Who are you?

1409
01:48:04,876 --> 01:48:07,344
Jacob McCandles.

1410
01:48:12,884 --> 01:48:14,579
l thought you was dead.

1411
01:48:16,688 --> 01:48:18,121
Not hardly.

1412
01:48:23,728 --> 01:48:26,526
Michael, that's
the second time

1413
01:48:26,564 --> 01:48:29,226
tonight you've
saved my life.

1414
01:48:29,267 --> 01:48:31,895
The first time,
l was a little slow.

1415
01:48:31,936 --> 01:48:34,404
You mean that?
lt was nothing.

1416
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:36,907
Jacob, here, took care
of that, didn't you?

1417
01:48:36,941 --> 01:48:38,272
Yes, sir.

1418
01:48:38,309 --> 01:48:39,571
Sir?

1419
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:40,770
Yes, sir.

1420
01:48:40,812 --> 01:48:42,347
Are you my grandfather?

1421
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:45,040
Yes, sir, l sure am.

1422
01:48:48,986 --> 01:48:50,453
James.

1423
01:48:50,488 --> 01:48:51,716
Dad.

1424
01:48:51,756 --> 01:48:53,917
Sounds better.

1425
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:55,482
Let's go home.

1426
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:01,162
Good idea.
