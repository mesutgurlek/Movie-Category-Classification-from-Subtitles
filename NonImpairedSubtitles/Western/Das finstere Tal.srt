1
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,783
<i>Open!</i>

2
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>Hey, you, open!</i>

3
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,993
<i>We are looking for someone.</i>

4
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,639
<i>There are things you
can't talk about.</i>

5
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:14,519
<i>Things happened in the past.
A long time ago.</i>

6
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,285
<i>But, not being able
to talk about them,</i>

7
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,176
<i>doesn't mean you can forget.</i>

8
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,257
<i>There are things, in fact,</i>

9
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,836
<i>that never will be forgotten</i>

10
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:37,963
THE DARK VALLEY

11
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,715
<i>How that foreigner found the
road to reach us, nobody knows.</i>

12
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,303
<i>Because here it was lived...
so close to the heaven,</i>

13
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,144
<i>below, we were considered
a half forgotten legend.</i>

14
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,203
<i>But for the people from
here, above was as well.</i>

15
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,213
Who are you?

16
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,180
Greider.

17
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,438
What are you looking for in our village?

18
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,682
Shelter.

19
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,661
You better go back from where you came!

20
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,364
Haven't you heard?

21
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,610
How long you want to stay?

22
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,772
The winter.

23
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,795
A bag won't be enough.

24
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,453
What are you doing here?

25
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,425
<i>The foreigner said that he
wanted to stay in our village,</i>

26
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,373
<i>and none of the children of
Brenner raised objection.</i>

27
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,451
<i>And this nobody was waiting for it.</i>

28
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:09,086
<i>Not even Mr. Brenner, at
first, he said nothing.</i>

29
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:15,591
<i>Because the foreigner
wore a mirror...</i>

30
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,941
<i>"a mirror, provided with memory".</i>

31
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:21,165
<i>Mr Brenner called him like this.</i>

32
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,683
<i>And then they carried the
foreigner to our house.</i>

33
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:22,831
For the winter?

34
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,023
You will see.

35
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,754
Where is your daughter?

36
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,901
Inside.

37
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:31,002
Call her!

38
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,726
Let her know him.

39
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,879
Luzi!

40
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,786
- Yes?
- Come to meet the guests.

41
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,633
She is Luzi.

42
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:07,134
And this is your new tenant.
His name is Greider.

43
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,174
Take care of him.

44
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,767
But not too much.

45
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,325
See you later.

46
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,293
- You can do it alone.
- Luzi!

47
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,346
No, that's good.

48
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:16,346
- No, I'll do it.
- Please.

49
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,973
If you want to eat something, come. Now.

50
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,229
Do you make photos?

51
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,339
With this box?

52
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,638
And what do you want to photograph?

53
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,415
Our valley?

54
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,317
And seriously you come from America?

55
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,790
Yes.

56
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,056
Is it true that there are Indians?

57
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,261
Yes.

58
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,962
Have you seen anyone?

59
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,724
Really?

60
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,425
Yes.

61
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,290
And why do you speak German?

62
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,630
- My mother taught me.
- And how is she knows German?

63
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:05,562
Luzi, enough. Stops to ask questions.

64
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,628
These men...

65
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,329
who are they?

66
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,230
The sons...

67
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:27,947
of Mr Brenner.

68
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:33,624
The six?

69
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,939
Mr. Brenner has the control
of the whole people

70
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,139
But also take care of us.

71
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,539
Lukas, idiot! Why do you scare me?

72
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,588
Lukas! No, we can't!

73
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,354
Please, Luzi!

74
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,151
Before we get married.

75
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,339
Lukas...

76
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:16,072
I don't even think about it.

77
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,066
But I must...

78
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:23,688
Always.

79
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,696
I'd like to work...

80
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,212
to help.

81
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,670
No, it is not necessary

82
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:49,312
- He is our guest.
- He might cut the firewood.

83
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,750
Always... that he can do it.

84
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:54,804
Not everyone knows.

85
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,440
The photographs that you do...
what are they like?

86
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,839
- Can I see them?
- Yes, of course.

87
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,543
- What is this?
- Texas.

88
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,365
This is you?

89
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,329
And your mother?

90
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:18,851
And your father?

91
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,841
Do you have a picture of your father?

92
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,622
No. He died a long time ago.

93
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:26,065
My father also died.

94
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,694
He perished on the mountain.
Near to my brother.

95
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,882
Due to a thunderstorm...

96
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,533
You don't do it so bad.

97
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:02,352
You can accumulate it here, on this side.

98
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:07,386
Later I'll go to the village. If
you want, you can come with me.

99
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,312
<i>Hi.</i>

100
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:53,013
What do you need?

101
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:55,391
A sack of flour, one of oats...

102
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,784
bacon, and white thread.

103
00:20:57,884 --> 00:20:59,584
- Hi.

104
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,567
And I also want sugar.

105
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,383
- How much?
- Two kilos.

106
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,792
And you? What do you need?

107
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,846
Coffee.

108
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,161
It will take a while.

109
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,835
And nails.

110
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:25,862
We have a blacksmith.

111
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,251
If you have to shoe a horse...

112
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:35,102
Does the ladies doesn't treat you well?

113
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,194
And Hans said...

114
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,581
That you'll take care of the guest

115
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,750
And what Hans says...

116
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:03,173
is done.

117
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:04,954
Is it clear?

118
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,945
Everything is ok.

119
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:22,185
Has anybody asked you?

120
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,944
Give me a drink.

121
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:29,252
And pour him too.

122
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,859
I don't drink.

123
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,585
He only watch.

124
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:27,790
If I invite you to drink, you drink!

125
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,531
Yes...

126
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:33,381
That is enough! Leave him alone!

127
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:40,024
But look!

128
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:45,291
Now you are worried by your guest!

129
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,708
Add it to my account.

130
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,713
The winter is long here.

131
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:37,127
This isn't a place for you.

132
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,630
Once the snow arrives it will be too late.

133
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:44,026
You could go now.

134
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:21,228
<i>In the following days, it
toured the entire valley...</i>

135
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:23,028
<i>the Mr. Greider,</i>

136
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:24,856
<i>with his device.</i>

137
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:30,003
<i>But of what happens in the
inn, he didn't speak again.</i>

138
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:58,719
If you want something to eat, just tell me.

139
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,073
Thanks.

140
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:05,711
When the wedding?

141
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:08,261
Soon.

142
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,512
Before the Immaculate Conception.

143
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:14,706
I'd like to ask you something.

144
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:21,786
Could you make me a picture? Next to Lukas?

145
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:25,365
Yes.

146
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,715
But it must be before the wedding.

147
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,483
<i>Greider kept his promise.</i>

148
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:58,177
<i>It was when the first snow fell.</i>

149
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:00,811
<i>Before the darkness was coming...</i>

150
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,026
<i>to our valley.</i>

151
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:24,955
Even more snow will fall.

152
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:35,629
There goes the tree!

153
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:02,311
<i>With the first snow, they began
to extract wood from the forest.</i>

154
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,111
<i>It was easier as well.</i>

155
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,640
<i>But it's a dangerous job,</i>

156
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:09,841
<i>in which all the men of
the village are involved.</i>

157
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,765
<i>Including the sons of Mr. Brenner.</i>

158
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,565
There goes the trunk!

159
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,158
Trunk stopped!

160
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,132
There goes the trunk!

161
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,890
Trunk stopped!

162
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:01,088
There goes the trunk!

163
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:28,969
I’m going.

164
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:31,574
Trunk stopped!

165
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,127
Trunk stopped!

166
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,373
The bell, he has died.

167
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:28,234
Take him home.

168
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:43,454
There is a picture. Luzi will bring it now.

169
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:18,731
I've been with the parish priest...

170
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,052
for the preparations.

171
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:23,853
He said that the wedding will be anyway.

172
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,943
He has already spoken with Mr. Brenner.

173
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,660
What if we left?

174
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:15,913
Forever.

175
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,359
And our families?

176
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,669
But what I want, Is you!

177
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:29,778
Do you think that I don't want?

178
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,376
I love you.

179
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:37,331
Then do something.

180
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:16,229
<i>The next day, Rudolf
Brenner went to hunt,</i>

181
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:19,427
<i>as every year, after the first snow.</i>

182
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:24,953
<i>It's when the hungry dams
go down to the valley.</i>

183
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,117
Hey!

184
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:17,231
Get out!

185
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:12,026
<i>In the village, it was said
that Mr. Brenner was concerned,</i>

186
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:15,703
<i>Because... Rudolf had
never been away so long.</i>

187
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:19,235
<i>To three days,</i>

188
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:23,036
<i>the Mr. Brenner' sons went out
in search of his brother.</i>

189
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,450
Prepare me the meal to take away.

190
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:36,233
In our town, in the valley, only
the Brenner can use weapons.

191
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,033
Don't you know it?

192
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:42,926
Did you bring it from America?

193
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:49,972
- Why do you need it?
- They'll come looking for me.

194
00:48:40,263 --> 00:48:43,652
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

195
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,715
<i>It snowed. During the whole night.</i>

196
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,510
<i>And the snow covered any track</i>

197
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,233
<i>The truth is, they have known that he
would never get out of the valley.</i>

198
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,771
<i>And, in spite of
everything, Mr. Brenner</i>

199
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:31,621
<i>insisted on holding the wedding.</i>

200
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,231
Our Holy Father...

201
00:53:34,286 --> 00:53:37,671
must not be forgotten, neither
for one day, nor for one hour.

202
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:40,531
You know it.

203
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:44,621
But today, we'll remember a father,

204
00:53:44,964 --> 00:53:46,764
who wasn't so powerful.

205
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:50,736
We'll remember...

206
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:53,616
the nice Joseph.

207
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:58,585
What do you think that he thought...

208
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:02,327
when his Mary gets pregnant

209
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:05,396
and he had never lain with her?

210
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:09,116
He should have felt furious.

211
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,875
And he felt powerlessness.

212
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,920
If he had left to Mary, it
had been understandable.

213
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:22,626
But he was a devout man...

214
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,575
And he didn't want that the
shame fall back to him.

215
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,416
So, he accepted.

216
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:37,746
Because he knew that his son came
from someone better than him.

217
00:54:39,088 --> 00:54:41,088
Then, Joseph understood...

218
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:44,896
that what the Lord gave to
him, it wasn't a sacrifice,

219
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:47,885
just a gift from heaven.

220
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,625
And what said the Virgin Mary?

221
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,161
"Since He needs me...

222
00:54:57,324 --> 00:54:59,024
and my belly,

223
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,171
I will not rebel.

224
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,209
Because there is someone

225
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:09,167
who knows better than me...

226
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:12,271
what is well...

227
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:15,375
and what is right."

228
00:55:18,854 --> 00:55:21,316
- Amen!
- Amen.

229
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:57,227
I want to confess me.

230
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:01,414
Confess you?

231
00:57:03,512 --> 00:57:05,212
Now?

232
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:56,709
On behalf of the Father... of the Son...

233
00:57:57,413 --> 00:57:59,113
and of the Holy Spirit.

234
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:01,577
Amen.

235
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,305
"May God, who illuminates our
hearts, give you the true knowledge

236
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:07,005
of your sins and His mercy."

237
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:09,016
Amen.

238
00:58:11,757 --> 00:58:14,057
I've missed the fifth commandment.

239
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:20,311
I have killed.

240
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,921
To one, in the forest...

241
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:29,173
to other, while he was hunting.

242
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,797
Who are you?

243
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:57,971
You knew my mother.

244
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,587
<i>What happened then,
more than 20 years ago,</i>

245
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,190
<i>the people still remember it today.</i>

246
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:24,942
<i>How he fought until the last moment,</i>

247
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:27,733
<i>and he didn't renounce to his wife.</i>

248
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:31,683
<i>How he prevented Mr. Brenner
was lying with her,</i>

249
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,268
<i>not only the wedding night,</i>

250
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:37,424
<i>even when she gets pregnant.</i>

251
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:41,762
<i>In the same manner as with
the others, in the valley.</i>

252
00:59:55,386 --> 00:59:58,686
<i>His parents were going hungry,
when they arrived in the Valley.</i>

253
00:59:59,922 --> 01:00:02,322
<i>As everyone who came here.</i>

254
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:07,152
<i>They would have been expelled
of the town immediately,</i>

255
01:00:07,678 --> 01:00:11,128
<i>but they should first have the
permission of Mr. Brenner.</i>

256
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:16,178
<i>Mr. Brenner needed fresh blood</i>

257
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:19,566
<i>and he liked what he saw.</i>

258
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,790
<i>The day in which Brenner
said to the parents</i>

259
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,956
<i>what they had to do in the valley...
with the girls</i>

260
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,475
<i>and it was he who decided who
was staying and who was going,</i>

261
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,184
<i>they talked and thinked,</i>

262
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,555
<i>but the famine prevailed.</i>

263
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:43,753
<i>They gave their word to Mr. Benner.</i>

264
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:46,532
<i>And they stayed.</i>

265
01:00:49,304 --> 01:00:51,004
<i>Then the day came</i>

266
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:53,987
<i>Brenner claimed that promise.</i>

267
01:01:08,427 --> 01:01:10,075
<i>She didn't believe it...</i>

268
01:01:10,076 --> 01:01:12,426
<i>when she heard to
call for the window,</i>

269
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:16,067
<i>it was her lover, he was
coming to take her.</i>

270
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:27,853
<i>They believed that paying them,
the innkeepers would hide them,</i>

271
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,537
<i>but Mr. Brenner had paid more.</i>

272
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,931
<i>The innkeeper was covetous.</i>

273
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:37,848
<i>And despicable.</i>

274
01:01:40,354 --> 01:01:42,704
<i>Then they were punished both.</i>

275
01:01:43,591 --> 01:01:46,569
<i>In such a way that everyone
knew that would happen,</i>

276
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,619
<i>in case of not
fulfilling their duties.</i>

277
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:02,608
<i>But then, our Lord,
He had mercy on...</i>

278
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:07,558
<i>others say that, just for a moment,
the devil didn't pay attention.</i>

279
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,920
<i>Nobody saw the woman again.</i>

280
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:25,795
<i>She left the valley...</i>

281
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:27,595
<i>forever.</i>

282
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:33,102
<i>The punishment of Brenner
turned to others.</i>

283
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:36,515
<i>The wife's parents.</i>

284
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:42,901
<i>They were not adapted.</i>

285
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:51,462
<i>And to the fiancé, they hung him,</i>

286
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,000
<i>until nothing remain of him.</i>

287
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,605
She...

288
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:21,927
Don't touch it!

289
01:04:29,134 --> 01:04:30,834
Come on, move!

290
01:05:05,546 --> 01:05:07,246
Dance!

291
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,535
Dance!

292
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,733
If not, I'll dance with her.

293
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,950
It's my turn!

294
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:42,972
- It's my turn!
- No, I haven't yet finished!

295
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:48,242
He's finished!

296
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:57,916
No! Please! Stop!

297
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,891
Please! Stop! Leave him!

298
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:07,846
What? What do you want?

299
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,933
Come on. There is still time.

300
01:07:41,073 --> 01:07:42,773
Lukas, no!

301
01:07:47,108 --> 01:07:48,808
Not worth...

302
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,075
Come on!

303
01:10:28,665 --> 01:10:30,365
The woman!

304
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:38,972
Luzi, take the rifle.

305
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,598
And you, drop them.

306
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:24,115
Go down from the horse! All. You too!

307
01:11:38,304 --> 01:11:40,104
Move away from the horses.

308
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:47,206
Luzi... get on!

309
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:10,701
Away from the horses.

310
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:21,841
Go, Luzi...

311
01:12:22,388 --> 01:12:23,187
Go.

312
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:24,888
Come on, go!

313
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:45,736
You...

314
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,492
I'll kill you.

315
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,323
I swear you.

316
01:12:52,127 --> 01:12:54,127
In your farm.

317
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:56,123
Tomorrow morning.

318
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:57,979
At the dawn.

319
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:27,934
Give me the weapon.

320
01:13:28,398 --> 01:13:30,098
The rifle!

321
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:39,919
Why do you do it?

322
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,491
Why?

323
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:48,312
Come here.

324
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:09,184
This is the first place to look for.

325
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,563
I want him alive!

326
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:35,148
- Why did you do it?
- Mother!

327
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,568
My god!

328
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,269
They'll come here.

329
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,210
No.

330
01:16:43,236 --> 01:16:44,936
I'll go to see them.

331
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,170
Thanks.

332
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:53,414
Woman! Go down at once!

333
01:17:56,382 --> 01:17:58,082
Go down at once!

334
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:29,051
What do you want from us?

335
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,950
Do you want money?

336
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:34,567
I don't want money from you.

337
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:37,357
I have something for you.

338
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:46,718
You like speaking very much about it.

339
01:18:48,536 --> 01:18:50,236
Money.

340
01:18:52,742 --> 01:18:54,442
Pick it up.

341
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,364
Pick it up!

342
01:19:14,322 --> 01:19:16,022
Eat it.

343
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,666
Eat it, I told you!

344
01:19:33,456 --> 01:19:35,156
Come on.

345
01:19:38,218 --> 01:19:39,918
Come on!

346
01:19:45,974 --> 01:19:48,518
No! Please! Enough!

347
01:19:49,188 --> 01:19:50,888
My god!..

348
01:20:10,332 --> 01:20:11,457
Eat it!

349
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:13,258
- Please! No!
- Eat it!

350
01:20:14,258 --> 01:20:15,510
Eat it!

351
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,124
Eat it!

352
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,825
Chew it!

353
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:23,999
Run!

354
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:07,013
Help me!

355
01:27:12,514 --> 01:27:15,030
Help me, please!

356
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,408
Help me!

357
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:23,517
Help me, cowards!

358
01:28:02,473 --> 01:28:04,173
Enough!

359
01:28:05,324 --> 01:28:07,024
Bastard!

360
01:28:07,146 --> 01:28:08,846
Bastard!

361
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,450
Come on!

362
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:29,090
Enough! Stand up!

363
01:29:34,732 --> 01:29:36,432
We have for two.

364
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:39,835
Two times in a row. There are four times.

365
01:37:36,805 --> 01:37:38,505
Stay here.

366
01:40:00,054 --> 01:40:03,287
She was... a beautiful woman...

367
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,535
your mother.

368
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:40,840
Come here.

369
01:41:13,292 --> 01:41:15,539
So... you are...

370
01:41:17,243 --> 01:41:18,943
her son.

371
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:18,998
And...

372
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:23,359
my sons?

373
01:42:28,896 --> 01:42:30,596
Dead.

374
01:42:32,876 --> 01:42:34,576
All of them.

375
01:42:42,984 --> 01:42:44,684
Your...

376
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:48,527
half brothers.

377
01:42:54,155 --> 01:42:55,855
Please..

378
01:42:56,488 --> 01:42:58,188
Make it fast.

379
01:47:46,144 --> 01:47:49,336
<i>He was nearly to die...
because of the temperature.</i>

380
01:47:52,502 --> 01:47:54,702
<i>He was in bed for three weeks.</i>

381
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:01,410
<i>Nobody said nothing.</i>

382
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:06,499
<i>But everybody knows that, many people,
had the intention to expelled him...</i>

383
01:48:08,008 --> 01:48:10,208
<i>or do something worse.</i>

384
01:48:11,321 --> 01:48:15,321
<i>So in that way, Mr. Brenner have
left his semen in each family.</i>

385
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:22,466
<i>And the liberty... is a gift,</i>

386
01:48:23,442 --> 01:48:25,142
<i>that not everybody have.</i>

387
01:48:33,325 --> 01:48:35,775
<i>The spring has arrive
sooner than expected.</i>

388
01:48:37,624 --> 01:48:39,324
<i>In March.</i>

389
01:48:39,538 --> 01:48:42,038
<i>In the middle day, Greider gone.</i>

390
01:48:49,673 --> 01:48:52,073
<i>He looked one last time...</i>

391
01:48:53,046 --> 01:48:55,446
<i>that was the last time I saw him.</i>

392
01:48:58,763 --> 01:49:02,013
<i>That day I told Lukas
that I was pregnant.</i>

393
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:05,464
<i>He felt happy. And proud.</i>

394
01:49:06,487 --> 01:49:09,637
<i>Because, at the end, it was
fair, as it has to be.</i>
