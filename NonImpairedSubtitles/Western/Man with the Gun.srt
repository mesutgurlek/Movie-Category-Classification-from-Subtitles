1
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,265
Dade Holman's calling card.

2
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,433
And that's one cashed-in dog.

3
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,874
Maybe the boy'd feel better
if I took a look.

4
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,820
Boys inside?

5
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,054
"Dog, you dare,

6
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,292
"dog, you die."

7
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,063
I've been thinking.

8
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,105
You know, somebody ought
to tell Mr. Pinchot

9
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,640
that when he's on Sheridan Street,

10
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,972
he shouldn't act like he's on Gold Street,
or people won't like him.

11
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,033
I'll tell him.

12
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,771
I'm very fond of Ed Pinchot.

13
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,281
We had a perfectly divine dance last night.

14
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,476
Except he didn't take off
his shoulder holster.

15
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,520
Take off his holster in Sheridan?

16
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,146
Oh, I guess he'd be safe these days.

17
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,555
Dade Holman's painted the town
bright yellow.

18
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,359
Well, it could be worse.

19
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,691
Mr. Pinchot usually shoots people.

20
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,731
Well, what did I say this time?

21
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,370
Really, Ann.

22
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,298
How's he called, that big one?

23
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,768
Ed Pinchot.

24
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,238
Wears a shoulder holster?

25
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,531
Yeah.

26
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,632
Come in.

27
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,474
Get on the loose shoe as soon
as I mend the Doc's rig.

28
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,807
He needs it for sick calls.

29
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,008
I'll mend my horse
if I can borrow your layout.

30
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,380
Ridin' through?

31
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,215
Yeah, as soon as I take care
of a little personal business.

32
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,449
Tools.

33
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,785
Thanks.

34
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,955
How about that,

35
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,289
middle of Sheridan Street,

36
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,854
and the gun blast didn't even roust
the Marshal out of his seat!

37
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,127
Sims get het up about a dead dog?

38
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,862
He ain't het up about the miner

39
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,063
who died sudden at the Palace last night.

40
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,039
Now, Saul, we can't afford
to worry about Gold Street doings,

41
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,643
but when Holman's gunslick gets
careless on this side of town...

42
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,010
Trouble's outside of town today.

43
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,907
Holman's fixin' for a busy one

44
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,076
when he borrows the Palace boys.

45
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,120
Now, everybody roundabout's
heard that gunshot.

46
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,916
They don't know it's just a dog.

47
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,422
Ain't even noon!

48
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,458
And business goes to pot for the day!

49
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,568
It's on the house.

50
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,301
Where will I find Nelly Bain's place?

51
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,533
Nelly Bain?

52
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,671
Corner of Sheridan and Gold.

53
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,040
Entrance on Gold.

54
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,135
But don't let that fool you.

55
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,475
It ain't an entrance.

56
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,573
Nobody, no man anyhow, gets past Nelly.

57
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,848
You want to wait till night,
you can see her girls at the Palace.

58
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,398
Sarah.

59
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,673
- Sarah!
- Yes, Miss Bain.

60
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,226
Miss Bain ain't home.

61
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,125
When do you expect her?

62
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,664
She won't be home all day.

63
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,401
All right, give her a message for me.

64
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,960
You tell her that Clint Tollinger
is riding through.

65
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,441
Tell her he wants to ask her
just one question

66
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,703
before he moves on.

67
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,908
You tell her right now. I'll wait.

68
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,144
I can't do it.

69
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,276
She's already told me.

70
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,726
I'm a doc,

71
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,397
so I'm entitled to theories,

72
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,937
and I got one now.

73
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,276
I got a theory
that sudden death is catching.

74
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:27,902
Tollinger!

75
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,514
Well, if you haven't got it yet,
maybe you never will.

76
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,180
No, you wouldn't remember me,

77
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,412
but I'm not likely to forget you.

78
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,656
No one who lived in Ponca,

79
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,557
who lived through Ponca,
is going to forget you in a hurry.

80
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,889
Doc Hughes.

81
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,054
Tollinger?

82
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,257
Might call him a town doctor, too.

83
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,498
Ponca was a mighty sick town.

84
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,968
Clint operated on it.

85
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,097
Patient lost a lot of blood, but lived.

86
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,203
Town tamer.

87
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,714
Where you headin'?

88
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,715
Not here!

89
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,344
I never could sleep in a saddle.

90
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,521
- Board my horse?
- My business.

91
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,649
Mostly west a mile
and over, Doc.

92
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,159
Where law and order
ain't caught up yet, huh?

93
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,860
We're mighty far west, seems to me.

94
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,097
Atkins here is president
of the town council.

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,363
It's his job to worry.

96
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,698
We're not that far west.

97
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,300
That so?

98
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,800
Well, I'm checking into the hotel

99
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,900
down here for a couple of days.

100
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,946
That'll give you time to decide
just how far west you are.

101
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,173
I'll see you, Doc.

102
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,580
Saul, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

103
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,913
I don't believe in operating
till you've tried all the cures.

104
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,690
We're not that bad off yet.

105
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,789
Aren't we?

106
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,095
Always dresses in gray.

107
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,789
Black would fit his profession better.

108
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,037
Dade says no guns unless we have to.

109
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,676
You reckon Castle saw us coming
and lit out?

110
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,553
Let's get a fire started.

111
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,861
You want the next one
between your eyes?

112
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,299
Tell Dade Holman I'm building here,

113
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,361
and if he bothers me again,

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,965
I'll personal put a bullet
through his fat carcass.

115
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,755
When Dade's got hisself

116
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,021
12 top gun hands out at his place,

117
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,325
not counting the boys
he's got here at the Palace,

118
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,696
that's just too many to fight, boy!

119
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,598
And should I, at any time, rile them up,

120
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,105
they can ride in here,
and wipe this town right off the map.

121
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,799
Now, Saul, ain't them the facts?

122
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,364
Heard you say so often enough.

123
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,536
There's more than one way
to wipe a town off the map.

124
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,977
A town has got to eat if it's gonna grow,

125
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,675
but Dade doesn't want farms
cluttering up his grass.

126
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,816
Look out there.
It smells like a ghost town already.

127
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,749
Son,

128
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,820
when you get a little older,

129
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,793
you'll realize there's certain things
that's best left alone.

130
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,197
And by and by, they just take care
of theirselves.

131
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,263
Leave Holman alone,
and he'll swallow us up.

132
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,460
He's done swallowed
and digested the whole lot of you already.

133
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,404
Long before I come to town.

134
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,400
Dade's a power in the county,

135
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,171
and he's gettin' to be a power in the state,

136
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,940
and now you want
to cut him down to size.

137
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,276
Yes, now.

138
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,540
Look, son, hold your horses, will you?

139
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,551
Dade is old, and he's fat,

140
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,484
and he's got hisself a bum ticker.

141
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,752
And one of these days,
he'll just pop off, just like that.

142
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,656
Then that'll be the time to go...

143
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,819
Son, quit it, will you?

144
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,158
You are digging holes
in my desktop again.

145
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,731
That land is mine, legal.

146
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,790
Dade needs to be told that, legal.

147
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,267
But if you won't do it, put a star on me,

148
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,462
and I'll tell him quick enough!

149
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,028
I ain't deputizing you,
nor no other darn fightin' fool

150
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,302
who wants to go out and get hisself killed.

151
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,670
- Saul, are you with me?
- I'm not waiting till Dade dies

152
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,338
to live on my own property!

153
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,942
I... Son!

154
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,039
Look, Jeff.

155
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,852
Now, did you hear that?

156
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,217
I heard.

157
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,224
Look, before you and Stella
set the wedding date,

158
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,260
I might've felt different about you
declaring war on Holman.

159
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,489
- But now, boy...
- It's too late, Saul.

160
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,396
I caught his boys red-handed
today trying to set a fire.

161
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,132
Well, I shot them off my homesite,
and I'm gonna keep 'em off.

162
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,401
Saul,

163
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,044
step into my office a minute, will you?

164
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,444
- Maybe you and me...
- No, Lee, we can't.

165
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,453
Tell her I'm here.

166
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,055
- Miss...
- She's home.

167
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,123
You see that? That's my foot.

168
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,126
It's too big to close the door on.
Now, you tell her.

169
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,161
ltching to get into it, Clint?

170
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,064
Hello, Nelly.

171
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,599
Your girls, I understand.

172
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,038
And you're the girl who was brought up
to think that dancing was a sin.

173
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,739
I know you've come a long way, Nell,

174
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,745
but then it is a long way from home,
isn't it?

175
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,905
I thought so.

176
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,344
But you're still in business, I see,
so you've found it.

177
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,981
I might have known.

178
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,544
The town's rotten ripe.

179
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,289
Is that why you picked it?

180
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,354
Now I'm here on personal business.

181
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,256
I got your message.

182
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,120
Just the one question.

183
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,489
It's been three years.

184
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
You don't expect an answer.

185
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,668
It's been three years, and I do.

186
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,138
Leave us alone, Clint, I'm warning you.

187
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,867
As soon as I get my answer.

188
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,707
You won't from me.

189
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,744
Be kind just this once.

190
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,002
Forget us.

191
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,116
Ride away and let me forget
you're still alive.

192
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,651
Beth is five now.

193
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,008
Where is she?

194
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,793
It's almost like you could
reach out and touch the snow.

195
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,003
It looks like a lake I once saw up
in the Sawtooth Mountains.

196
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,630
You know, Jeff, I thought
of a mountain lake for our honeymoon.

197
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,138
Not in the Sawtooths.

198
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,667
No one around for hundreds of miles.

199
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,271
Oh?

200
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,277
I could always fish,
but what would you do?

201
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,337
Fish!

202
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,585
Sometimes, Jefferson Castle,
I wonder about you.

203
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,378
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

204
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,949
Company.

205
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,628
Mr. Tollinger, this is my daughter, Stella,

206
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,596
and this young man ain't a member
of the family yet,

207
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,132
but he's the next thing to it.

208
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,394
- Jeff Castle, who had the trouble today.
- Pleased to meet you.

209
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,526
What trouble? Jeff, you didn't tell...

210
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,036
Look, Holman tried to burn him out,

211
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,469
but I got an idea.

212
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,541
First, I have to sell it to the council
at the regular meeting Friday.

213
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,937
But if I can't swing it,
I'll pay you for your time.

214
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,069
- Clint Tollinger.
- That's my risk.

215
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,876
I always try to make sure
that a town needs doing,

216
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,449
and a town wants doing.

217
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,609
We need it, all right.

218
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,449
You figure you can tidy up a town
single-handed, Mr. Tollinger?

219
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,510
With a little luck, yeah.

220
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,453
He's been 100% lucky,

221
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,651
and when it adds up like that, it ain't luck.

222
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,990
Call it timing. I just work faster alone.

223
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,822
Well, then you're not a marshal.

224
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,161
- Or a sheriff.
- He's a town tamer.

225
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,191
The difference is there are no rules
on my end of the business.

226
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,463
Except maybe one,

227
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,437
never stay in one town too long.

228
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,370
Well, you can clean up
for the rest of the town.

229
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,102
I believe in doing my own fighting.

230
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,507
Look, that won't be necessary.

231
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,546
If Mr. Tollinger does the job,
it'll go fast like he says.

232
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,738
If you'll just hold up...

233
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,339
I'm not holding up for anybody!

234
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,680
Not for Holman or Sims or anybody.

235
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,878
How about thinking of Stella?

236
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,580
I am thinking of Stella.

237
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,282
It's our homesite, and I'm building on it,

238
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,051
so we'll have someplace to live
when we get married.

239
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,117
Mr. Tollinger, I must say
you don't look fierce enough

240
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,026
to fight everyone's battles.

241
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,827
I'm a peacemaker by profession,
Miss Atkins.

242
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,366
Let's get you some dinner.

243
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,292
You haven't met my wife yet.

244
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,359
Oh, Mary.

245
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,194
Saul?

246
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,500
You're late tonight.

247
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,405
Mary, this is Mr. Tollinger,

248
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,636
and he's hungry.

249
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,878
Oh, this way, Mr. Tollinger.

250
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,787
Those guns...

251
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,058
All that talk about fighting,

252
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,398
and what happened to you today.

253
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,933
I'm scared.

254
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,237
Honey, you can't keep on
turning the other cheek

255
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,504
with a cemetery as big as we've got.

256
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,273
But to pay someone to stand up
like a man for you...

257
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,377
You understand, don't you?

258
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,282
I don't know.

259
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,782
Look, it's like this.

260
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,114
I've got to do my own fighting,

261
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,121
to get into training to be head
of my family.

262
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,885
Don't I, now?

263
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,127
Good night, honey.

264
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,595
Good night.

265
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,338
Mmm.

266
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,318
The boy's gonna take some handling.
But I think he's...

00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,446
(GUNSHOT)

268
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,511

(HOOFBEATS FADING)

270
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,121
Here he is.

271
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,499
- His left shoulder, it's bleeding!
- Get Doc Hughes.

272
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,198
Well?

273
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,934
Town needs it.

274
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,313
They'll find out they want it in a hurry.

275
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,753
Fourteen killings
and 31 robberies in the past year,

276
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,948
most of them in or around the Palace.

277
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,321
That's how things have
quieted down for us.

278
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,794
Call that spade a spade, Saul.

279
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,887
You're talking Tollinger,
you're talking gun law.

280
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,261
What have we got now?

281
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,201
Only it's Holman's guns and Holman's law.

282
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,902
People are scared to build.

283
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,131
They're scared to farm.

284
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,264
They're even scared off the streets.

285
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,968
You know how I feel about young Castle
getting shot up, Saul,

286
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,977
but Tollinger?

287
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,706
I heard about a town
he cleaned up right smart,

288
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,272
only a lot of businesses closed down

289
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,286
till the smoke blew away,
and never did open up.

290
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,482
If my business closed down,
I wouldn't know the difference.

291
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,421
$500 is a lot of money
to pay for a cleanup job,

292
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,021
but it ain't too much to pay a tamer,
willing to take all the chances.

Arthur.

294
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,192
One gun against Holman's army?

295
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,966
They'll take him fast.

296
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,471
Then Dade'll work his grudge off
on the rest of us.

297

I say if Gold Street riffraff
want to kill each other off,

298
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,809
let them, and good riddance!

299
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,275
Things have quieted down lately for us,

300
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,207
till tonight.

301
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,546
Ten years ago, there were a dozen farms

302
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,642
and three mining operations in the valley.

303
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,945
Now there's just Dade Holman.

304
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,381
He's got the valley,

305
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,549
he's got us backed up here in town.

306
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,054
Now he's working on the town.

307
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,719
He already owns Gold Street.

308
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,659
What happens when he decides
to take over Sheridan Street?

309
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,789
He'll take it over.

310
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,197
Can anyone here deny that?

311
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,427
Unless...

312
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,300
Are you sure Clint Tollinger is available?

313
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,505
I'm sure.

314
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,604
Is Tollinger the cure for what's ailing us?

315
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,909
As a doctor, I've seen some cures
worse than the disease.

Believe me,

his medicine is hard to take,

319

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,487
It's young Jeff Castle's new house,

325
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,724
gone up in a puff of smoke.

326
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,562
Well, if that don't just about...

327
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,392
What are you gonna do about it?

328
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,595
Well, I...

329
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,035
I could deputize

330
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,039
every man jack of you
for a war on Holman,

331
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,767
just like young Castle had wanted.

332
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,006
All over a pile of lumber!

333
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,844
Is that what you want?

334
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,175
Hold it, Lee.

Gentlemen,

337
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,285
I'm putting the proposition to a vote,

338
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,112
namely, to employ Clint Tollinger

339
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,316
in the capacity of town tamer.

340

All in favor signify by saying, "Aye."

341
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,250
- Aye.
- Aye.

342
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,992
All opposed?

343
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,832
Motion is carried unanimous.

meet Clint Tollinger.

Mr. Tollinger,

349
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,521
I guess you wouldn't mind
a little friendly advice

350
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,395
from a member of the town council?

351
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,455
What I mean is,

352
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,661
we don't want you to go hog wild on this.

353
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,704
I mean, just take it a little easy.

354
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,997
Too much gun play is bad for business.

355
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,235
What you mean is
that target practice in the hallways

356
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,403
is against the house rules, eh?

357
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,781
Oh, I see, having your little joke, huh?

358
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,838

361
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,332
Oh, hello, Tollinger.

362
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,134
Just looking around a bit

363
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,334
before you start to work?

364
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,637
No, I'm ready.

365
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,373
Ever been in Sheridan before?

366
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,642
No, but all these towns look alike to me.

367
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,978
So do the people.

368
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,617
I'll bet you, you never seen one
look like Dade Holman before.

369
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,486
Lay odds you never
get a chance to see him.

370
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,492
Saul Atkins tells me you know the terms.

371
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,755
You'll draw up a contract in letter form.

372
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,563
There's a clause I'd like in that contract.

373
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,360
- Yeah?
- No interference.

374
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,562
I'll do the job my own way.

375
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,301
You'll deputize me, and that's all.

376
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,670
If I need your help, I'll let you know.

377
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,334
Well, the town council took you on.

378
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,402
I'm just a hired hand here myself.

379
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,509
You're on your own, Tollinger.

380
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,844
What's Holman's brand?

381
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,178
Lazy Tombstone.

382
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,379
Who ramrods for him?

383
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,250
Pinchot. Ed Pinchot. Know him?

384
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,880
Yeah, I've heard he's overdue.

385
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,152
He's wanted down in Texas
for murder and rustling,

386
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,490
and in Abilene, Kansas, for plain murder.

387
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,791
And there's Frenchy Lescaux.

388
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,263
When Dade opened the Palace,

389
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,525
he brung Lescaux
all the way up from New Orleans,

390
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,126
I believe it was, to run it for him.

391
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,970
Two of a kind.

392
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,232
Lescaux can kill plain or fancy,

393
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,036
but he's partial to a bowie knife.

394
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,235
Fact of the matter is,

395
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,835
last marshal died of a knife wound

396
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,937
he got over at the Palace,

397
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,505
checking up on a knife killing
there the night before.

398
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,676
- But Lescaux claimed...
- Fill me in on Holman.

399
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,845
No name calling,
just how does he operate?

400
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,181
Well, Dade's a fat man,

401
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,685
but don't let that fool you.

402
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,124
Never lifts a pudgy finger hisself.

403
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,851
Well, you take yesterday, for example.

404
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,295
Just a typical day in Dade's life.

405
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,023
He cut himself a piece out of a trail herd

406
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,261
that was passing through.

407
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,736
Then he roughed up the new mine
merchant's over at Benning Creek Way.

408
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,202
Then he tried to grab
young Jeff Castle's homesite,

409
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,908
and, I'm betting you,
he divvied up the gold dust

410
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,072
they took off that poor dead miner
over there at the Palace.

411
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,941
Nothing is too small or mean for Dade.

412
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,651
Nothing's so rich nor fancy, neither.

413
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,744
(SCOFFS)

414
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,425
Grand piany from Italy,

415
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,687
yeah, fish eggs from Rooshy

416
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,785
and a brocade sofie from New York.

417
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,387
Did he bring in Nelly Bain?

418
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,431
Nelly? Oh, no.

419
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,797
No, not that one.

420
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,392
Nelly come on her own steam,

421
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,869
stays on her own terms.

422
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,769
Course, her girls work over at the Palace,

423
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,569
but nobody owns Nelly.

424
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,169
Now,

425
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,438
don't you tell them church biddies
I said so,

426
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,911
but Nelly is quite a female.

427
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,007
Ain't no lady of course,

428
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,516
but if some of the men in this town
stood up to Dade's boys

429
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,349
the way Nelly does, and got away with it...

430
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,944
Town never stood up before, huh?

431
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,717
(SIGHING) No. No.

432
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,085
And believe you me, mister, it...

433
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,822
(CLEARING THROAT) It ain't no
one-man job, neither.

434
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,419
And

435
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,998
it's too late now.

436
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,896
Well, they got to start sometime.

437
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:04,993
How?

438
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,469
You can't get at Dade.

439
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,698
He sits out there in that ranch

440
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,967
of his like a big, fat spider, I tell you.

441
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,475
He ain't been to town
in the last four or five years.

442
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,411
It would take an army to get through them
gun hands of his.

443
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,970
Well, we'll have to get him to town.

444
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,345
Get him how?

445
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,610
I'll work on that.

446
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,818
I'll take that oath now.

447
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,216
Okay.

(SIGHS)

449
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,500
- Mr. Tollinger.
- Miss Atkins.

450
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,331
I just stopped by to ask how's the patient?

451
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,199
Much better, thank you.

452
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,596
Doc Hughes says he can't be moved.

453
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,468
That suits me just fine.

454
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,606
Mother's with him while he's taking a nap,

455
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,774
while I try to figure out
Father's bookkeeping.

456
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,078
I don't know what the council's gonna do
for its book work

457
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,913
when Stella and Jeff get married.

458
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,974
When?

459
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,715
It seemed so soon, but now...

460
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,359
Maybe you can tell me something,
Mr. Tollinger.

461
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,388
After all, it's what you call your

462
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,885
business.

463
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,396
Would they have tried to kill Jeff,

464
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,900
if he hadn't shot at them yesterday?

465
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,730
I knew a man once, didn't own a gun.

466
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,500
Wouldn't have one in the house.

467
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,909
One day, those land grabbers
back in Lotawana County

468
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,309
came to pay him a call.

469
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,470
He sent his kid out to hide in the brush

470
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,947
before he'd open the door.

471
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,809
They shot him where he stood,

472
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,886
then they burned the house down
around him.

473
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,857
Jeff Castle just made one mistake.

474
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,853
What?

475
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,326
He didn't shoot to kill.

476
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,728
Oh, it is getting late,

477
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,770
and I want to be home
when Jeff wakes up.

478
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,096
First one's on the house, Mr. Tollinger.

479
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,695
My first drink on a working day
is my last one.

480
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,338
Can't afford to drink on the house.

481
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,936
Any of Dade Holman's boys in town?

482
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,475
We work for Dade Holman.
Who's askin'?

483
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,181
Well, look what we got here,
a new deputy.

484
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,281
With a long memory.

485
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,783
Fred and Sy Harkness.

486
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,158
You ran with Big Bill Thompson
down south,

down in Texas.

I hear there's a price
on your head in Texas.

That's in Texas.

491
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,302
Well, this is Sheridan,

492
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,168
where I'm giving you exactly 10 minutes

493
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,470
to get out of town and don't come back.

494
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,243
Don't ever come back.

495
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,437
- Why, you tinhorn...
- Move.

Every day's a shopping day for you, Annie,

you'll never save a cent.

Huh?

00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,657
You're going to do Mable's song tonight.

She's nursing a sore throat.

506
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,623
But I haven't got any voice,

507
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,391
and that's the worst kind!

508
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,628
They're not paying for your pear-shaped
tones at the Palace, dear.

Well, honestly, Nelly, half the time,
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,263
Well, try a little harder

512
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,810
'cause I have something to say
to all of you.

513
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,142
I'm warning you again
not to let your escorts

514
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,082
any further than the verandah steps
when they walk you home.

The ladies in this town

516
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,649
are just waiting for a reason
to force us to leave.

517
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,886
I'm going to keep them waiting
as long as the Palace

518
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,448
pays as well as it does.

519
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,583
Oh, honestly, Nelly,

520
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,027
the way you talk, sometimes
you'd think we'd never left home.

521
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,157
You notice I don't say anything
about your manners.

522
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,036
Appearances are all I care about.

523
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,764
You're pretty girls,
and the Palace is not a pretty business.

Ann,

525
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,004
whose husband were you flirting
with today?

526
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,707
Why, nobody's.

527
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,942
I mean, well, that is, at least he's new,

528
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,041
and not one of the old, tired ones.

529
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,949
New and attractive, obviously.

530
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,487
Oh, yes!

531
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,315
But, you know,
I think he's some kind of a law man

532
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,484
because he had a big star right here,

533
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,323
and he was all dressed in gray.

534
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,856
What did I do now?

535
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,366
Ann, you should realize by now

536
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,131
that you should never flirt with a man
wearing a badge.

537
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,566
Especially that man.

538
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,436
And from now on,

539
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,037
any rule I give you has nothing to do
with manners or appearances.

540
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,172
It's to keep you
out of the way of stray bullets.

So if you want a drink,

543
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,712
The Red Dog next door will oblige.

544
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,007
Tell Lescaux I'd like to talk to him.

545
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,025
A beauty, eh?

546
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,793
I brought her all the way
from New Orleans with me.

547
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,360
Won her with a stack of poker chips.

548
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,265
$2,000 worth.

549

550
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,767
What can I do for you, Mr. Tollinger?

551
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,978
Word gets around.

552
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,010
Then you may have heard that I told
the Harkness Brothers to get out of town.

553
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,075
You may even have heard
that I never warn a man twice.

554

555
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,456

because you've got things all figured out.

Starting now,
there will be no wearing of weapons

within town limits.

I'm prepared to shoot
any man who violates that rule.

560
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,399
Do you think you can make a crazy rule
like that stick in my place?

562

I thought this was Holman's place.

Except maybe for this.

he can pick up the Harknesses

You can set your clock by him.

651
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,803
He don't like to drink with no one,
so I keep the end of the bar for him.

00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,548
Wouldn't hurt my feelings none

Oh, no. I know my way around Sheridan.

I could tell you a lot of things

Well, they carry on.

Yes, I am.

That doesn't mean I'll stop you.

to follow, wasn't it?

Would any place have been too far

And I came to tell you.

Well, he may be lucky today.

You don't really believe that.

No.

808
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,959
- Then what are you going to do?
- Nothing.

809
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,426
I warned him.
I thought I made it pretty clear.

810
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,130
Yes, but if you warn a child,

811
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,672
and he does something foolish anyway,

812
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,140
you try to stop him from getting hurt.

813
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,302
Oh, I see. You think he's still a child, huh?

814
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:04,607
- Partly.
- Well, I think he's a man.

815
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,313
He might be a little young
and bullheaded about some things,

816
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,683
but if there were more like him around,
I might not be here.

This wasn't necessary.

But time is so important.

822
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,660
You didn't find him?

823
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,200
He picked up a load of lumber an hour ago.

824
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,467
I don't think Mr. Tollinger's interested.

825
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,028
I'm not going after Jeff.

826
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,536
I guess you have your reasons.

827
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,033
I'll go.

828
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,101
No.

829
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,214

in killing Jeff today.

And you were there when they shot him.

832

When I took this job,
we signed an agreement,

They've always sort of looked
after each other.

838

Well, that might make the waiting
a little harder.

839
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,206
You know what you remind me of?

840
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,877
No offense meant, of course.

841
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,546
You remind me of a hungry lion

842

I once seen pacing a cage in St. Louis.

843

- You? From what?

844

that I can't answer.

846
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,270
They want action from somebody else.

847
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,560
Just rode in to report, Tollinger.

848
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,696
Caught Jeff Castle trespassing
on Holman's property again.

849
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,160
Dade's keeping him for you
out at the place.

850
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,197
You can pick him up any time you want.

851
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,703
I don't recall issuing
any trespass warrants.

852
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,364
- Do you, Lee?
- No.

853
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,576
You arresting people these days
without a warrant?

854
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,337
We're not going to let something
like that stop us, are we?

855
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,540
The boy's all right. Not a scratch on him.

856
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,947
And that took some doing.
We got a few to show.

857
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,615
No threats, no trouble, no nothing.

858
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,879
Just an offer. Come and get him.

859
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,283
I don't see your white flag.

860
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,583
Huh?

861
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,523
Now, if you were flying one,
we might observe the rules of war.

862
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,228
You're not, so we'll abide by the town law.

863
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,799
If you got something on your mind,
Tollinger, say it!

Mr. Sims, keep an eye on that young man,
will you?

865
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,835
The law is, "No guns in town."

866
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,337
You've broken it.

867
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,345
That makes it legal and proper
to arrest you.

868
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,917
All right, dismount.

869
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,214
Dismount!

870
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,098
Mr. Sims, make out a warrant
for these gentlemen while I detain them.

871

Tell you what, I'll make those out.

872

You go on over to the Palace,

873

and tell Lescaux
to get a message to Holman right away.

874
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,137
Tell him I'll exchange
two hostages for one.

875
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,511
Two unscratched hostages
for one in the same condition.

876
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,335

It's about time he come
to pay his respects.

We'd like you to answer a few questions.

ain't richly deserving of what he got, but...

892
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,059
Will it get Jeff Castle back?

893
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,693

You don't have to worry.

906
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,620
He gets a big part
of his revenue from the Palace.

907

That's bad business,
wiping out the paying customers.

You're paid to protect our people

but you won't go after Jeff Castle.

And putting Pinchot behind bars

911
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,330
is just inviting Holman to come after him

912
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,463
and tear this town apart!

913

Now, suppose you stop telling me
what you don't want.

914
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,135
You want me to turn Pinchot loose
and ride out,

915
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,576
and bargain with Holman's
guns for Castle's release?

916

Will you guarantee the result?

No?

00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,778
You left me

970
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,223
because you couldn't stand
the kind of life I gave you.

971
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,883
- Is this better?
- Yes.

972
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,124
Better than being married to a gunfighter.

973
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,459
That's what I am, Nelly.

974
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,828
Guns are all I know about.

975
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,730
There are only two ways to use them.

976
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,895
And the way you use them wasn't murder,
because you wore a badge.

977
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,666
I don't know.

978
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,841
I only know it didn't make the waiting
any easier.

979
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,072
I thought you loved me at first.

980
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,680
Then I thought you might love
Beth enough to...

981
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,317
But you learned to hate so early

982
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,012
that you never learned anything else.

983
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,752
Guns are all you know about.

984
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,687
They're all you care about.

985
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,150
Still paying me back, huh?

986
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,157
For what? For something you can't help?

987
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,388
You forget, Clint.

988
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:22,090
I know that your father died
because he wouldn't own a gun.

989
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,792
You'll die because you do.

990
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:27,625
Well,

991
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,235
may be a short life, but it'll be a full one.

992
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,365
Plenty of exercise for your guns,
and all the women you want,

993
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,465
even nice ones.

994
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,975
That's for my full life,
and all the women I want.

995
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:48,155
Where does that leave the Atkins girl,
Stella? I've seen her.

996
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,452
I've heard about her,

997
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,221
every day falling a little more out of love

998
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,524
with her young man,
and more in love with you.

999
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:54,927
She reminds me of you,

1000
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,397
though, as you used to be,

1001
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,496
even down to hating this business.

1002
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,632
You're a little older now, too.

1003
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,171
Maybe she could persuade you to do
what I couldn't.

1004
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,633
Maybe.

1005
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,467
Clint, I wasn't telling the truth.

1006
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,374
I didn't have the courage before,
but now I don't care.

1007
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,745
Beth is dead.

1008
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,015
That first winter up north was so cold.

1009
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,922
She got sick. We did everything.
It didn't help.

1010
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,057
Clint!

1011
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,792
Clint!

1012
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,830
I'm not paying you back!

1013
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,294
I'm punishing myself!

1014
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,835
You'll never be human!

1015
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,336
You haven't any pity!

1016
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,634
No pity, Clint!

1017
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,101
No pity at all.

1018
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:51,418
- Hey, what's up?
- I'm cleaning out the Palace.

1019
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,647
Alone?

1020
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,916
Are you crazy?

1021
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,014
Bad house, boss.

1022
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,945
Worse every night,
and Tollinger's still around.

1023
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,646
It will not be long now.

1024
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,616
Things will pick up,
right after the party for Tollinger.

1025
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,922
Party? A farewell party?

1026
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,265
Clear out!

1032
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,519
Time to go.

1033
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,057
I do not know
what you are trying this time.

1034
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,762
You are armed, I am not.

1035
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,867
But I am warning you, Mr. Tollinger.

1036
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,063
You're leaving tonight.

1037
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,169
The only choice you have is which way.

1038
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,411
I am staying.

1039
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,315
All right, Lescaux, you're overdue anyway.

Don't!

Your property.

1046
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,092
Fetch in some more, boys.

1047

You started it!

01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,900
What are you trying to do, burn us all out?

1060

Give that house over there
a wetdown!

What's on your mind?

1062
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:54,840
The fire.

1063
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,750
Well, at least it took Lescaux out
of our lives for good.

1064
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,618
But the way he did it.

1065
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,284
Remember the fire he told us about once?

1066
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,726
The man who died in it
because he didn't have a gun?

1067
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,093
Yeah.

1068
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,396
Where's Jeff today?

1069
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,294
I don't know.

1070
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,469
Anything wrong between you two?

1071
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,974
Nothing he's willing to talk about.

1072
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,835
Anyway, it's hard to get anything
out of him since...

1073
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,073
- Good morning.
- Anything I can do for you?

1074
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,512
Why, yes, sir, you can.

1075
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,579
- I'd like to hire a horse.
- How long?

1076
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,084
Oh, three or four hours.

1077
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,278
I sell whiskey, sir.

1078
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,288
- So I've heard.
- Never touch it myself.

1079
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,620
I get my intoxication just riding around

1080
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,716
this glorious western countryside of yours.

1081
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,294
Corral's in the back.

1082
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,692
Make it a spirited animal.

1083
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,321
I want to feel the wind in my face.

1084
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,763
A spirited animal, sir.

1085
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,850
Guess you know what we're here for.

1086
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,354
Saw you making the rounds.

1087
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:09,790
Last on the list, huh?

1088
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,121
Last but not least.

1089
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,127
We weren't aiming to bypass you, Saul.

1090
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:14,856
We want time at the council meeting.

1091
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:15,988
You'll get time.

1092
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,192
Won't take long because we got the votes.

1093
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,801
The Palace is gone,
and maybe that's all to the good.

1094
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,531
Now we got to keep Holman off our backs,

1095
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,732
and the only way to do that
is to get rid of Tollinger.

1096
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,434
When it comes to destroying property,

1097
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,101
he's stepped on more toes than Dade.

1098
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,475
We can't afford to let him
run hog wild again.

1099
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,104
Where do you stand, Saul?

1100
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,175
I don't know.

1101
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:35,641
Just curious.

1102
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,876
We can swing this with or without you.

1103
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,683
How can you get rid of him just like that?

1104
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,458
So far, he's done exactly
what you hired him to do.

1105
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,190
You put up the money,

1106
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:46,890
he put up his life.

1107
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:51,198
He may have a reason for what he did

1108
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,859
that we don't even know about yet.

1109
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:53,924
Reason?

1110
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,800
For turning thousands of dollars
worth of good lumber

1111
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,031
into a pile of ashes?

1112
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,097
Oh, it's the lumber that worries you!

1113
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:00,665
And you wouldn't want to get rid of him

1114
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,303
just so you could hang out
a "Business as Usual" sign,

1115
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,177
so that you can pick up the trade
the Palace can't handle anymore?

1116
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,478
And you wouldn't be so crazy
to keep Tollinger around

1117
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,042
because you got your cap set
for him, now would you?

1118
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,587
That's enough, Virg.

1119
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,385
And a good morning to you, gentlemen.

1120
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,996
Trouble on my account?

1121
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,061
They told me they have enough votes

1122
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:28,103
to take you off the job
at the council meeting this afternoon.

1123
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,866
That's just about on schedule
as my jobs go.

1124
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,966
But I think that's something
Holman will want to take care of himself.

1125
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,603
Especially if he knows the town
is ready and willing.

1126
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,337
With a little wind last night,

1127
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,345
that fire could have touched off the town.

1128
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,405
It didn't.

1129
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,207
Fire might smoke Holman out.

1130
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,684
If it does, I'll be here.

1131
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,888
Don't matter how the council votes,

1132
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,787
I'll see you get full pay for the job.

1133
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,918
I'll finish what I started, or it'll finish me.

1134
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,195
- Don't matter how the vote goes?
- No.

1135
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,330
That's the way it works.

1136
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,094
If the town doesn't know it, Holman does.

1137
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,703
Town hires a man to fight its war.

1138
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,399
They find out he's fighting

1139
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,407
because he's got an itchy trigger finger

1140
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,534
that ain't under control and never will be.

1141
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:09,669
They get scared.

1142
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,940
They got a right to do something about it.

1143
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,482
Well, it'll be over soon.

1144
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,682
If it ends your way,

1145
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,115
then what happens

1146
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:20,715
to you?

1147
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,182
You'll have no trouble getting rid of me.

1148
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,454
I'll shake the dust of this town fast.

1149
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,293
Your young man rode out of town
again today.

1150
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,093
I just came by to tell you that, this time,

1151
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,658
I can't do a thing about it.

1152
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,900
If you get him back,

1153
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,169
let him know you want him back

1154
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:43,937
before that trigger temper
he's working up saddles him for good.

1155
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,752
When is it due?

1156
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,349
4:45, and you're lucky to get a seat.

1157
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,758
I'll send for the luggage.

1158
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:00,918
Billy!

1159
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:03,987
Billy!

1160
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,490
Leaving today?

1161
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,663
No, but soon.

1162
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,430
This is for someone luckier than I am.

1163
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,405
- You're staying?
- Mmm-hmm.

1164
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,111
Of course. A target right to the end.

1165
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,579
Standing in front of people
who won't stand back of you.

1166
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:20,979
Holman will collect for the Palace.

1167
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,278
I'm staying for that.

1168
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,308
Yes, it was your fire.

1169
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,520
Aren't you even now?

1170
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,856
I'm getting out of business soon,
if that answers your question.

1171
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,890
You've killed Holmans in every town
you've taken on.

1172
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,324
And you're staying here for the kill, too.

1173
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,963
You won't get out of business
until they put you out of business.

1174
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,101
And don't try to change now, Clint,

1175
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,311
or you'll find that even feeling a little
can hurt a lot.

1176
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:54,948
Yeah,

1177
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,975
I found that out last night.

1178
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,015
You've been living three years
with what I found out.

1179
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,521
Leave today.

1180
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,218
No.

1181
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:10,057
You've never met Dade Holman, have you?

1182
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:11,360
I have, once.

1183
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,225
He's a fat man, but he's as hard as you are.

1184
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,901
And he might even be smarter.

1185
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,481
(HORSE APPROACHING)

1186
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,954
(EX CLAIMS) Who you expecting, miss?

1187
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,522
- Fine horse! Fine ride!
- $1, please.

1188
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,088
Dollar? Where's your pa?

1189
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,625
- Gone to council meeting.
- Yes, Friday.

1190
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,262
Town always seems deserted
on meeting days, doesn't it?

1191
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:50,560
Mmm-hmm.

1192
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,665
Well, I guess
I got my dollar's worth all right.

1193
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,474
Hurry, Kitty!

1194
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,277
Lucky Kitty.

1195
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,474
She's going to visit her family.

1196
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,110
I don't call that fun.

1197
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,418
My family reads me like a book.

1198
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,787
What's the matter,
don't they like dime novels?

1199
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,190
Kitty will join us
when we locate somewhere.

1200
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,421
Nelly said we should be hearing soon.

1201
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,690
Hope it's soon.

1202
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,197
Town gives me the shivers.

1203
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,597
We just sit around,
waiting for the same thing

1204
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,134
everyone else is waiting for.

1205
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,898
- What?
- For Mr. Tollinger to get killed.

1206
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,929
ANN: Oh, I wouldn't like that.

1207
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,202
I mean, there are so many
ugly ones to spare.

1208
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,039
Well, just the same,
before the Palace burned down,

1209
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:31,909
I heard someone talking
about a surprise party for him.

1210
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,414
Well, Mr. Tollinger surprised them instead.

1211
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,178
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1212
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,454
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- What is it?

1213
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,853
I'm a drummer, ma'am. Ladies' wear.

1214
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,155
Miss Wakefield, Miss Ann Wakefield,

1215
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,698
I believe, ordered a bangle from St. Louis?

1216
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,393
That would be Miss Wakefield.

1217
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,499
Ann, someone to see you.

1218
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,532
On the porch.

1219
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,073
Oh, the porch, of course.
By all means, the porch.

1220
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,747
Kitty!

1221
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,089
Sorry, Nelly.

1222
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,383
- My luggage...
- It was picked up an hour ago.

1223
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,950
Come along, or it'll leave without you.

1224
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,928
KITTY: Bye, girls.
GIRLS: Bye.

1225
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,459
- Bye.
- Bye, Kitty.

1226
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,498
Oh, it's simply beautiful!

1227
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:30,271
Show the rest of you ladies anything?

1228
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,204
- Be glad to wait.
- Don't bother.

1229
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,969
- Stay on the porch, Ann.
- Bye, Kitty.

1230
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,031
Bye.

1231
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,172
Now, you're sure

1232
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,305
you won't forget the time?

1233
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:41,508
- Oh, no.
- Five minutes before 5:00.

1234
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,778
- Oh, I won't forget!
- Now, he's very punctual.

1235
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,848
Remember, not a word to anyone.

1236
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,456
It's the job, you understand.
He must be above reproach.

1237
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,957
Oh, I won't tell a soul.

1238
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,284
But that's the part that I...

1239
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,019
Well, I mean, Trotter's Bar is so public.

1240
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,826
Outside Trotter's Bar.

1241
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,665
A chance encounter on the street,

1242
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,702
that's what makes it look so natural.

1243
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,632
Then the handkerchief,

1244
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,695
the signal that you're not offended
with his gift.

1245
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:05,865
Offended?

1246
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,205
Oh, couldn't he tell
by just the way I looked at him?

1247
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,676
Well, he couldn't be sure.

1248
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,910
This is his way of being sure.

1249
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,482
Once he knows, then he'll have
no further need for an intermediary.

1250
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:17,746
A what?

1251
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,614
He'll speak for himself.

1252
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,852
Remember, five minutes to 5:00.

1253
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,656
How can I wait that long,
now that I know?

1254
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,758
Miss Wakefield,

1255
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,262
we're talking about minutes, not hours.

1256
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,130
Well, what would I do with myself?

1257
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,467
Oh, I know! I'll put on my hat.

1258
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,367
Excellent.

1259
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,747
KITTY: Oh, be careful of the hatbox.
It's borrowed.

1260
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,945
I'll write to you, Kitty,
as soon as anything's definite.

1261
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,351
Here's your ticket. I'll send for you soon.

1262
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:54,615
Ladies.

1263
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,385
Well, look who's here!

1264
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,449
Deserting a sinking ship, Cal?

1265
01:14:58,527 --> 01:14:59,585
Nothing here for me.

1266
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,391
This is one gone Tollinger-tamed town,

1267
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,455
and I'm heading back to New Orleans.

1268
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:05,659
Ann!

1269
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:08,027
Just getting some fresh air, Nelly.
It's so hot today.

1270
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,092
Well, catch your breath, Ann,

1271
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,195
and then go on back to the house.

1272
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:11,603
I don't want you in the streets today.

1273
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:12,970
Oh, it's worse inside.

1274
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,566
I'll be home soon, Nelly.
Well, <i>bon voyage,</i> Kitty.

1275
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,980
Ann, try and resist the Emporium today.

1276
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,146
You know you're out of a job,

1277
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,184
and that bracelet looks pretty expensive.

1278
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,310
Bracelet?

1279
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,613
Oh, yes. It's lovely, isn't it?

1280
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,881
The Emporium? I wouldn't dream of it.

1281
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,549
Well, bye, Kitty. Bye, Cal.

1282
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:31,954
Goodbye, Ann.

1283
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,752
- Goodbye, Miss Nelly.
- Goodbye, Cal.

1284
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,225
Goodbye, Mr. Zender.

1285
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,527
Zender?

1286
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,133
