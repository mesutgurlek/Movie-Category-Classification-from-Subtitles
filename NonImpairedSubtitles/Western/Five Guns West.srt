Who goes there?

00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,813
-Tampa.
-Houston.

00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,348
-Jason.
-Waco.

-Almore.
-Prince F.P.

00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,322
All right, get out of there.

7
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,201
l heard the Confederate Army
was hard up for men.

8
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,697
-l didn't realize how bad.
-Quiet down.

9
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,641
Hush up, man, l'm going to
be a comrade in arms.

10
00:02:57,642 --> 00:03:00,436
Sergeant, get these men ready.

11
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,231
All right.

...set down by the commands..

52
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,054
Do you know a place called
Dawn Springs?

53
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:05,222
A mining town. About four
days' ride north of here.

54
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:08,518
lt's abandoned now, except as
a midpoint in the stage line.

55
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,015
An agent cares for the
relief horses.

56
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,030
A stage'll arrive there about
the 18th of...

57
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,046
the month, with a man,
Steven Jethro.

58
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:18,114
1 8th? That's cutting
it pretty close.

59
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,998
That's a hard ride by direct route.

60
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,782
That territory is full of lndians
out to make war.

61
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:26,950
That's why we pardoned men
with your special talents.

62
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,254
Jethro was head of Southern
lntelligence Bureau...

63
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,614
operating beyond the lines. He's
gone over to the enemy.

64
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,438
That stage has to be stopped
on its way...

65
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,422
from California to Fort Mahan...

66
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,246
where Jethro's to turn the
information he...

67
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,347
has over to the Union commandant.

68
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,046
How do you want him?

69
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,647
Alive, if possible. Dead,
if need be.

70
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,614
What else do you know?

71
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,045
We know the stage is on
schedule and...

72
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,214
will be escorted by Union cavalry.

73
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,501
Let's see now.

74
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,942
All we have to do is make
a hard four-day...

75
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:58,976
ride in about three days...

76
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,605
get through the state plains
full of lndians...

77
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:03,740
looking for White scalps...

78
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:08,506
cross over the Union lines,hold up a
stage escorted by Yankee troops...

79
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,109
and then bring some
traitor all the...

80
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,210
way back here for Southern justice.

81
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,813
That is quite an order, Captain.

82
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,189
You've traded your chances
with a hangman...

83
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,205
for the chances of the trail.

84
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,412
Jethro, and what he knows
of Southern agents...

85
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,877
and the $30,000 he's carrying,
must not be...

86
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:25,978
allowed to reach the
Union authorities.

87
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,142
This $30,000, Captain...

88
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:31,268
ls that in gold bullion or
Confederate script?

89
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,370
lt's hard money. Badly needed
for the cause.

90
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,932
Jethro was also assigned to
provide operating...

91
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:39,033
funds for the individual agents.

92
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,917
Captain, we're certainly going to
try to get to Dawn Springs...

93
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,087
and keep that traitor from
reaching Fort Mahan.

94
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,526
Think those killers can do the job?

95
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,844
They're Southern soldiers, now.

96
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:57,956
Think those patriots
can do the job?

97
00:06:57,957 --> 00:07:00,676
lf they don't do it for reasons
of patriotism,...

98
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:02,628
they've got 30,000 other
reasons to do it.

99
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,694
Jethro must be stopped.

100
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:54,531
You're the trailblazer,
which way now?

101
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:57,539
That way is longer. lt's shorter
down by the riverbed.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,971
But a better chance of bumping
into lndians.

103
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:02,627
Not much of a chance this
far south. Might...

104
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,728
as well pick up miles while we can.

105
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:07,428
You making up our minds for us?

106
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,587
l'm just making up my own mind.
That's the way l'm going.

107
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:14,757
Anybody doesn't want to come
along, don't have to.

108
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,274
Couple more days, we'd have been
swinging from a tree like that one.

109
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,810
They've got other trees, elsewhere.

110
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:22,819
Keep on pulling fool killings, and
they'll fit one to your size.

111
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,353
You got no call to holler at me.
l did what you said.

112
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:29,506
Three miles from where l told
you l'd be waiting.

113
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,555
So what? We ain't swinging, are we?

114
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:32,916
Shut up.

115
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,106
You're always telling me
''shut up.'' l...

116
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:38,140
got things to say sometimes and...

117
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,410
Hale, l figure you can take
whichever route you like.

118
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,801
l'm going the short way. l don't
want to be late for that gold.

119
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:47,394
You hear what the captain said
about ''dead or alive''?

120
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,082
Seems your little brother is
going to have some fun.

121
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,513
He ain't never killed legal before.

122
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,209
You seemed to have made
yourself leader...

123
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,378
of this little group, Govern.

124
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:57,889
lt's all right with me.

125
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,154
Just don't get any ideas once
the gold's in our hands.

126
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,361
lt'll be up to you what
happens to it.

127
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,473
We'll all get what's coming to us.

128
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,898
You seem to be a lot of talk about
somewhere we ain't got yet.

129
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,874
Still plenty of trails up ahead.
Plenty of lndians.

130
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,942
Deserters from both sides,
and Union Cavalry.

131
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:19,220
Not to mention the killing things
that nature provides.

132
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,091
Four or five days.

133
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:13,609
-Comanche.
-Pretty far south.

134
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,512
The war gives the lndians
plenty of time...

135
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:18,681
to move, and lots of places to go.

136
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,244
Build a new one. We'll
make camp here.

137
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:25,343
Think it's wise to build a fire
with the lndians so close?

138
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:27,936
Figure they're far enough
away not to see it.

139
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:31,072
lf they're still around here, they
know we're here, anyhow.

140
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,735
l need some wood.

141
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:35,584
Shorty, get some wood for the fire.

142
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,631
-Don't call me ''Shorty.''
l don't like anyone...

143
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:39,299
-Get some wood.

144
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,910
Look at it burn.

145
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,914
lt reminds me... .

146
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:58,271
Some of the flames, red like
that girl's hair was.

147
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:01,373
-Girl?
-The girl on the road to San Antonio.

148
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,278
Look, John...

149
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,411
see how it changes color?

150
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,927
Looks like blood now. Like
red hair and blood.

151
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,067
Just think it, don't say it.

152
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,046
He's loco.

153
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:19,807
l'll kill you.

154
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,942
You ought to thank him instead.

155
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:23,276
Look.

156
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,123
Thanks.

157
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:50,702
-Morning.
-Morning.

158
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,364
Good coffee.

159
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,600
A lot better than that gun oil
they make in prison.

160
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,190
You from the Houston
calaboose or did...

161
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,359
they pick you up from
somewhere else?

162
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,641
All jails have got four
walls and bars.

163
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,877
They gonna carry your
sentence out soon?

164
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:14,553
Pretty soon.

165
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:18,062
Not very talkative, are you?

166
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,861
l don't figure talk about
getting my neck...

167
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:23,724
stretched is breakfast
conversation.

168
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,652
Young Candy is loco.

169
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:30,356
l wouldn't say that too loud.

170
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:34,717
Billy might decide one of
us looks like a rattler.

171
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:37,182
His brother'll keep him hobbled.

172
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:43,861
Seems like old times. Coffee in
the morning, on the trail.

173
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:48,061
Miss the cattle bawling, though.

174
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,685
Like the ones you were running
to the Yankees?

175
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,180
Son, you got a way of looking
for trouble, ain't you?

176
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,747
Not me, old-timer. l'm a
peace-loving man.

177
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,461
We can shoot them all right now.

178
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:01,245
Grab their guns and horses and
meet the stage ourselves.

179
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,684
There's three of them.
All fast with...

180
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,700
a gun. We can't take them all.

181
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,100
We can get them off
alone, one by one.

182
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,085
l want that gold that's
laying up north.

183
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:11,101
There's a lot of country to travel.

184
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:13,896
And there'll be Union
Cavalry to fight.

185
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:18,172
We'll have time enough to cut down
on them, after we get the stage.

186
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,980
l fought the heat and l
fought the cold.

187
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:27,836
That's when the kids died
of plague and...

188
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:29,971
my woman died from an
lndian's arrow.

189
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:33,922
l dug my rangeland out of the rock.

190
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:37,612
l fought an lndian and a rustler
for every acre of it.

191
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:42,248
Now the states are fighting over
something they dreamed up.

192
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,762
l don't much care.

193
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,028
When the war's over and
forgot, l'm still...

194
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,197
going to be pushing my cows along.

195
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:55,612
You sure was scared last night
when l killed that snake.

196
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,577
How'd you and your snake
rattle sleep, Shorty?

197
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:03,158
l told you once, l don't like
to be called that.

198
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,901
Look at that little fella go.

199
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,746
Candys are a strange lot.

200
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:57,850
You slug your brother to keep
me from hurting him.

201
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:00,679
l wasn't worried about
you hurting him.

202
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:03,194
The kid's a walking arsenal.

203
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,474
Where'd he get that?

204
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:07,066
l got one just like it. Made
them back in prison.

205
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,827
lt's a long walk to the
gallows tree.

206
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,594
You slugged me, Johnny.

207
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:30,554
-What'd you want to slug me for?
-l told you.

208
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:32,761
Now l'll tell you. The
next man that...

209
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,862
ulls a gun ain't gonna keep it.

210
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:38,056
-Nobody's taking my gun from me.
-l will.

211
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,377
lt'll take all of us
to do this job.

212
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:43,097
l don't want anybody killed
and l don't want...

213
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:45,266
gunfire bringing lndians
down on us.

214
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:47,673
Haggard.

215
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:51,449
-Want to fill the canteens?
-All right, Govern.

216
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,311
l'll help you, J.C.

217
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,168
l wouldn't call that boy
''Shorty'' anymore.

218
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,616
What does J.C. stand for?

219
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:19,865
Nothing.

220
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,330
You mean that's your name? J.C.?

221
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:25,597
Yep. There were 15 kids
in my family.

222
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:28,939
All boys, except one. l
was the youngest.

223
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:32,631
Time l come along, they sort
of run out of names.

224
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:36,668
What do you know? You're a
pretty unusual guy, J.C.

225
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:40,056
Ain't it a little early to be
sounding me out?

226
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,784
l don't get your meaning.

227
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:44,184
You ain't the kind of man
to be passing the...

228
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,360
time of day unless you
expect something.

229
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:50,156
l'm just telling you, it's a little
early to be choosing sides.

230
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,312
l just like to know who
l'm playing with...

231
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:54,360
or against, before l sit
down to deal.

232
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:58,104
You've been stacking the deck
ever since we started.

233
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:02,639
You tested Govern. Pushed the kid.
Now you're sounding me out.

234
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:07,042
-You got everybody figured out yet?
-l like you, J.C.

235
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,935
You and me got a lot in common.
Both look out for ourselves.

236
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:14,423
Sure, l've been looking to pick my
partner ever since we got started.

237
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,285
Now, l say it's you.

238
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:18,615
We can get that gold easy, old man.

239
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:20,807
Just for you and me.

240
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,759
And what are the others going
to be doing while...

241
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,711
we're passing the ace
back and forth?

242
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,072
Nothing.

243
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,975
Just nothing, J.C.

244
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,817
What do you say?

245
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,950
l say let's fill these canteens.

246
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,167
Now l know what J.C. stands for.

247
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:43,858
''Just Cautious.''

248
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:50,615
Those two are listening to more
than the sound of the water.

249
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:53,974
-They're making a deal.
-You want to make one with me?

250
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:56,471
l don't want all the gold,
just a share.

251
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,326
One for my brother, one for me...

252
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,257
-And one for me.
-That's right.

253
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,322
Our friends are back.

254
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,332
ls it a deal?

255
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:10,509
Candy, maybe we can do business.

256
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,638
You're talking to the wrong man.

257
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:22,774
We should have all the guns pointing
the same way at the showdown.

258
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,118
At the Candys.

259
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,230
Why do you think there'll
be a showdown?

260
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,429
The Candys will be walking away
from three dead men, unless we...

261
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,309
-Unless we join together?
-That's right.

262
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,206
What do you say? You,
Haggard and me.

263
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,256
Maybe you've got yourself a deal.

264
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:50,865
Don't string out. lndians like to
pick off the last man.

265
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:37,914
-l wonder what passed through here.
-Comanche's got a liking for fire.

266
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,013
l wonder what they've been burning.

267
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,973
Or who.

268
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:22,657
You'll have every lndian from 20
miles around down on us.

269
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:25,843
Leave him be.

270
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,108
-Get your foot off his hand.
-You're asking for it.

271
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,333
Move.

272
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,467
You're going to die looking
like a brave man.

273
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,363
Come on. Come ahead.

274
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,627
This guy's crazy.

275
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:41,728
Come on. Move.

276
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:52,317
Can l please have my gun back now?

277
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:03,730
You're savvy.

278
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,066
l think maybe you've got
a loyal dog to...

279
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,291
follow you. Rabid, but loyal.

280
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:29,155
Haggard.

281
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:40,465
Comanche.

282
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,793
-Looks like a Union soldier.
-What's left of him.

283
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,418
Hale, take the Candys
and scout the draw.

284
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,281
Haggard and l will circle
over the rise.

285
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,352
Should we bury him?

286
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,869
What for?

287
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,198
l didn't make any noise. l didn't
shoot, just like you said.

288
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,054
-You did good. He was scouting
alone?

289
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,813
-A mess of them are over there.

290
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,534
l figure this one was out on
the furthest flank.

291
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,573
The tribes are probably gathering
over across the river.

292
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:01,774
We'll have to swing out wide on
this side of the river then.

293
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,885
We'll make up for lost time later.

294
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:05,998
Pull out one at a time to
avoid big dust.

295
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,133
You know a place to meet?

296
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,605
There's a clump of oak
down by the river.

297
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:13,639
We should be able to
make it by night.

298
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,676
All right. You first.

299
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,349
Hale next.

300
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,311
Then John and then
Billy. l'll go last.

301
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:31,085
Suppose they catch one of us?

302
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:34,153
We'll hear the yelling and
we'll feel sorry.

303
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:54,882
-Stay spread out, Billy.
-Anything you say.

304
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:26,956
-Hi. l see everybody made it, so far.

305
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:30,252
-What if your riding in like that wasn't
safe?

306
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,268
l'd have heard the yelling
you talked about.

307
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:33,804
See if you can get quiet, quickly.

308
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,395
Why are you starting at me again?
l didn't do nothing.

309
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:37,932
-Shut up.
-Shut up...

310
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:39,293
both of you.

311
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,124
-Did you see anything?
-Not a feather.

312
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,692
We'll camp here till midnight.

313
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,572
Candy brothers take the first
watch. l'll take the next.

314
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:49,643
We'll be riding the rest of the night
to make up for lost time.

315
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:50,744
Cards, Govern?

316
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,100
Better get some sleep.

317
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,851
l don't expect any of us will
get much sleep tonight.

318
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:56,952
l will.

319
00:26:57,772 --> 00:26:58,872
Come on.

320
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,303
A little poker, J.C.?

321
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:07,690
We'll deal later.

322
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:15,148
Quiet out there.

323
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:22,634
Can't get over how close we come
to getting our necks stretched.

324
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,291
-Can you?
-Can l what?

325
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,722
-Get over how close we...
-l can't.

326
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,401
lt's funny.

327
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:34,506
When we reach the way station,
you stay close to me, hear?

328
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:36,107
Sure, John, don't l always?

329
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,708
-Stay real close.
-Anything you say.

330
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:46,026
What'd you say to Govern when Hale
and the old man went for water?

331
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:48,195
-Made us a deal.
-l'm glad.

332
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:53,035
He didn't bat an eye when l had
that knife pointed at his belly.

333
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:55,067
Why didn't you use it?

334
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,922
l don't know.

335
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,154
He didn't seem to care if l
knifed him or not.

336
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,823
He's all right. l'm glad we're
partners with him.

337
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:19,489
Your turn.

338
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,160
Cut out that dust storm,
girl. You want...

339
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,144
to give me another asthma attack?

340
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,640
Your drinking will give you an
attack soon enough.

341
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:36,744
Honey, you know l gotta
keep my throat all wet.

342
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,568
Otherwise, this desert dust
about choke...

343
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,737
your old uncle to death.

344
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:42,184
You go wash up.

345
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,392
l was just about to, Shallee.

346
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,288
Go on.

347
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,925
Why are you so short with
me? l know that...

348
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,191
Might be some more of them saddle
tramps looking to steal horses.

349
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:59,496
Almost wish it was, just
to see a new face.

350
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,326
Honey, you see the folks in the
stage. l don't see why you...

351
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:06,428
Here. Let's get those horses
to the lower stable.

352
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:52,343
No sign of the stage.

353
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:54,630
No sign of any soldiers, either.

354
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:56,492
No sign of nothing.

355
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,668
Let me do any talking
that's necessary.

356
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:07,144
Anybody here?

357
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,149
Saddle up and get out of here.

358
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,798
-We didn't come here to do any harm.
-l'm making sure you don't.

359
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,901
All we want is some information,
some water and a place to rest.

360
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,696
lf you don't mount up, you'll be
resting here a long time.

361
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,558
Has there been a stage through here
from California?

362
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,669
That stage isn't due
for two weeks.

363
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,453
lf that's what you want, get out
of here and come back then.

364
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:56,317
-Rent us a room and we'll wait for it.
-We don't run a hotel.

365
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,432
We'll just set you up in
business then.

366
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,236
l'll kill you with the next one.

367
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:11,772
Get a rifle, Uncle Mime.
Take to the back.

368
00:32:12,902 --> 00:32:15,297
Over here, there's a mess of them.

369
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,003
They're coming from the back.

370
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,882
Stand.

371
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:31,582
Drop the rifle.

372
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:45,014
Get that other rifle
and the pistol.

373
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:48,005
Like l told you...

374
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,532
all we want is water and
a place to rest.

375
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:54,116
The water's in the well outside.
You can rest there, too.

376
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:57,616
Thank you, ma'am. We accept
your gracious hospitality.

377
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,875
lt's like a breath of home.

378
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:03,652
You can all go outside. Tend to
your needs and get out of here.

379
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,092
Just as you say.

380
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:08,931
lf there's anything we can do,
don't hesitate to call on us.

381
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:10,793
All right, let's go.

382
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,966
Candy.

383
00:33:24,196 --> 00:33:26,864
We'll stay outside. You
stay in here.

384
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,613
Us there, you here.

385
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,683
l should've shot to kill
at his first step.

386
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,539
Now don't get fuss.

387
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,099
You do like he said. We don't
want no more trouble.

388
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,955
You can expect some
from those five.

389
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:44,739
They had us right under their guns,
and didn't do a thing.

390
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,339
Real gentlemen.

391
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,355
Did you see the look in
that last one's...

392
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,456
eyes? Like a snake l killed once.

393
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:35,611
That sure was a pretty girl.

394
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:38,690
They all look good after a couple
months in prison.

395
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:42,486
No reason why we can't mix a
little pleasure with business.

396
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:45,346
We haven't finished
the business yet.

397
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:47,842
Your share of the gold can
get you a hundred girls.

398
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:50,306
But as long as this one's
on our hands...

399
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:53,250
no reason why we can't enjoy
her companionship.

400
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,745
We got plenty to keep us busy.
That road'll...

401
00:34:55,746 --> 00:34:57,880
have to be watched every minute.

402
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:01,676
Billy, you'll take the first watch
up along the ridge.

403
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:04,641
We'll want some time to set ourselves,
when the stage comes.

404
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:06,977
Sure got one idea in your mind.

405
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,185
Can't get your mind off that
gold, can you?

406
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:13,152
Get your mind on too many things,
you'll wind up with nothing.

407
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,690
lf you fellows will excuse me...

408
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,337
l think l'll call on the
young lady.

409
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:24,353
Maybe ask her to the barn dance.

410
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:26,625
-Dance? l didn't hear about...
-Quiet, Billy.

411
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,441
-When's this dance gonna be?
-Help me with the horses.

412
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,906
ls he going to ask that girl
to the dance?

413
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,265
Get out of there.

414
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,730
l'd like a word with you, miss.

415
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,560
Say it.

416
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,417
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't frown.

417
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,586
Makes lines in the face.

418
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,748
That's better.

419
00:35:57,185 --> 00:35:59,040
Won't you invite me in
for a moment?

420
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,208
No.

421
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:03,200
-l don't mean any harm. You can
trust...

422
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:05,494
-How long since you saw a girl?

423
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,998
Long time.

424
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,030
Then l don't trust you.

425
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,120
No girls in the town you come from?

426
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,032
l came here to be neighborly,
not to answer questions.

427
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,700
l just wondered.

428
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:19,984
Where do you come from?

429
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,924
Lots of places.

430
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,328
South?

431
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,464
Sure. North, East and West, too.

432
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:30,111
Start riding in one of
those directions.

433
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,609
Honey...

434
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,072
l'll be visiting again.

435
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:41,759
Find out anything?

436
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,648
Just that this one's too smart
to say anything.

437
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:45,749
And he thinks he's charming.

438
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,640
Have much luck, son?

439
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,418
Just give me a little time.

440
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,745
Girls are like royal flushes.

441
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:57,236
Takes a little luck, a
lot of savvy...

442
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,862
and an ace up the sleeve.

443
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,665
Govern inside?

444
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,935
Col. Governs posting the guard.

445
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:06,846
l'm beginning to feel like an army
man, guard duty and all.

446
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:09,311
You got the next watch, private.

447
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,031
l sure don't have much taste
for this military life.

448
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,495
l wish that stage would
hurry and get here.

449
00:37:14,496 --> 00:37:17,118
You just been here a little
while, son. You...

450
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,253
got a lot to learn about patience.

451
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:22,782
l'm patient enough when the
chips are on the table.

452
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,110
Just want the game to get started.

453
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,126
You won't be much good if
there's any more trouble.

454
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:47,390
Won't be none. They're just riders
heading somewhere.

455
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,694
Besides, you don't have
to worry none.

456
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:52,455
Any trouble and l'll
take care of you.

457
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:05,053
They're not heading anywhere.
They've arrived where they want to go.

458
00:38:05,054 --> 00:38:06,781
Don't you go trying to find out.

459
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:09,661
Come back here. Don't you go out
there with them men.

460
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,762
You come right...

461
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,677
Here, miss, let me help
you with that.

462
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,557
lt's sort of heavy for such
a pretty little girl.

463
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:30,269
Let's have something more sprightly. l
promised the lady a dance tonight.

464
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,573
So we might as well make it
a bit more lively.

465
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:35,038
l told you to stay in the house.

466
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,456
l'd love to dance. l haven't
danced in just ages.

467
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:34,560
A little guitar sounds good with
a mouth harp, don't you think?

468
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,950
Gosh, that sounds good.

469
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,651
Get your own dance partner, sonny.

470
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:05,047
Only one girl.

471
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:11,251
What are you stopping for? We
just got going good. Let's...

472
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,877
Let's have the music.

473
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:26,586
Let's have that music.

474
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,301
John Candy didn't get
his dance yet.

475
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,706
All right, everybody's
had his dance. l...

476
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,658
think we'd all better get
some sleep.

477
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,658
-l ain't danced with my niece yet.
-Take her inside and dance all you like.

478
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:08,555
You haven't had your
dance yet, Govern.

479
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:11,521
So l get to escort the lady home.

480
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,770
That ain't hospitable.

481
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:29,742
l hope you enjoyed your dancing.

482
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:32,921
You almost started some trouble
you couldn't have stopped.

483
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:36,057
l didn't ask for any attention. l came
out for a bucket of water.

484
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:38,419
Your uncle could have got it.

485
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:45,065
l'm used to doing it. l got
in the habit.

486
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:49,380
l guess there's not much to do
around here, except work.

487
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,473
Not so long ago, this
place was full...

488
00:41:52,474 --> 00:41:54,489
of people. Then the mine ran out.

489
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,558
Everybody left, except Uncle Mime
and me stayed to tend the stage.

490
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:02,692
l get so as l feel like
running out.

491
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:06,201
Just running till l meet somebody.

492
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:07,992
Don't even matter who.

493
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,787
A dead town is a pretty
lonesome place.

494
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,728
We get along all right.

495
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,472
Till some saddle tramps
ride in and...

496
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:18,641
turn the place into a
shooting match.

497
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:22,038
You'll be first prize if you
don't stay inside.

498
00:42:22,393 --> 00:42:24,390
l'm not afraid of you.

499
00:42:24,698 --> 00:42:25,798
l guess you're not.

500
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:29,527
But l'm afraid of you.

501
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,664
l could hear that tune all the
way up on the ridge.

502
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:38,872
We gonna have that dance
we talked about?

503
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,303
Come on, let me spin you around.

504
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:44,444
The dance is over.

505
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:49,207
You should have been up there to
relieve him, Hale. lt's your turn.

506
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,774
l don't want that ridge unwatched.

507
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:57,080
How come you don't take
a turn up there?

508
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,032
Because l say it's your turn.

509
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:01,335
And l say it's so you can
hear the girl.

510
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:04,505
ln case any of the boys decide
to go visiting.

511
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,999
You got ideas about
nearly everything.

512
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,065
l might as well tell you...

513
00:43:09,272 --> 00:43:12,066
l'm getting a few ideas
about you, too.

514
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,516
Maybe we all better get some sleep.

515
00:43:50,776 --> 00:43:54,673
John, take the next watch
from your brother.

516
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,071
l want you two to come with me.

517
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,329
What for?

518
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,023
Our best chance is to keep them
bottled up inside the town here.

519
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:06,166
l want to look over the
other approaches.

520
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:10,030
We can't leave them holes to get
through,
out to open country.

521
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:20,405
They're leaving.

522
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:22,486
See, just like l said.

523
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:25,747
They left their gear around.
They'll be back.

524
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,181
l'm gonna look around while l can.

525
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:30,294
Maybe something'll tell
us why they came.

526
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:33,045
You'll get in a heap of
trouble. You stay.

527
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:36,340
l won't go far. This might
be our only chance.

528
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:11,974
Looking?

529
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:16,180
l was just looking for
some tobacco.

530
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,349
Uncle Mime ran out of it.

531
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:21,844
He gets into an awful state
when he's out of tobacco.

532
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,349
Sure, l know.

533
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,949
You was trying to steal tobacco.

534
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,348
Not steal. Just borrow some.

535
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,916
l would have asked, but l didn't
see anybody around.

536
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:32,356
Here.

537
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,197
Go on, take it.

538
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:38,079
You sure are pretty.

539
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:40,039
Thank you.

540
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:42,772
l don't hear nice things like that
much around here.

541
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,692
What's a girl like you
doing out here?

542
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,612
My uncle takes care of his
job out here.

543
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,713
l take care of my uncle.

544
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,060
You like it here?

545
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:54,025
No, but Uncle Mime's all
the kin l've got.

546
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,340
l have no place else to go.

547
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:59,203
l know lots of places. l
could show you.

548
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:02,580
Like what?

549
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:05,249
Like Waco, Dallas, plenty
of places.

550
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:07,348
ls that where you're from?

551
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,746
Sure. Me and my brother. That's
where we come from.

552
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,467
What are you doing way up here?

553
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,431
We got a job to do.

554
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,075
-l'll bet it's important.
-Sure it is.

555
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:21,107
The Rebels couldn't find nobody
else to stop that stage.

556
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:23,828
lf you're soldiers, why aren't
you in uniform?

557
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:26,708
You must be pretty dumb. We'd get
shot down in a minute...

558
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:30,777
if we went traipsing around in them
gray uniforms. Don't you know...

559
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:31,827
-Where you going?

560
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,971
-l think l'd better get back to the
house.

561
00:46:33,972 --> 00:46:35,731
Don't you want the tobacco?

562
00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:37,363
Yes. Thank you.

563
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,725
Trade you the sack for a kiss.

564
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:42,775
You're pretty.

565
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:45,463
Don't pull away.

566
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:47,251
Stop, please.

567
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:49,477
-Don't.
-All l want is a little kiss.

568
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:54,835
Don't!

569
00:46:54,836 --> 00:46:56,947
You stop pulling away, you hear?

570
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,275
Stop! l'll kiss you!

571
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:03,273
l told her not to go out there. Why
doesn't she listen to me?

572
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,722
Don't!

573
00:47:04,723 --> 00:47:06,356
You stop pulling away.

574
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:10,259
You won't be giving any
presents away.

575
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,157
l asked you nice, and you got all high
about it. l'm not asking you now.

576
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:18,738
-Billy, please don't.
-You're pretty.

577
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,842
Listen to me, Billy, listen. l've
been lonely, too, understand?

578
00:47:21,843 --> 00:47:25,650
Let me think about it
a little while.

579
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:26,738
-Let her go.

580
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:28,099
-Never seen a girl like you in a long
time.

581
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,539
Let go!

582
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,394
You made me hit him.

583
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:39,563
You shouldn't walk around alone.

584
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:43,249
My brother's funny. He
gets to wanting things.

585
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:46,322
Wanting can be a bad
thing, sometimes.

586
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:49,583
lt can ball up in a man's guts,
like cactus spines.

587
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:52,401
Man's got to rid himself of it.

588
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,809
What are you doing off
the ridge, John?

589
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,843
You're supposed to be
on the lookout.

590
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,147
Bring him to.

591
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:19,075
Haggard, take the skyline,
will you?

592
00:48:22,578 --> 00:48:25,679
-Did they hurt you?
-No, l'm all right.

593
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:30,096
Seems you can't resist parading
around like a pony in an auction...

594
00:48:30,097 --> 00:48:32,231
and stirring the boys up.

595
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:35,281
Don't seem to stir you up any.

596
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:37,201
lt might, but now l'm
only interested...

597
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:40,235
in seeing that you don't cause any
trouble between my men.

598
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,576
Get out and you won't have
to worry about it.

599
00:48:42,577 --> 00:48:44,244
l'm not worried.

600
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:47,262
l'm just tired of walking you home.

601
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:01,162
l saw what was happening.

602
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:03,984
l saw the crazy one put
his hands on you.

603
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:06,653
l saw it and l couldn't
do anything.

604
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:09,936
Don't torture yourself.

605
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:13,300
l was going to go out and
l saw this bottle.

606
00:49:13,937 --> 00:49:16,867
l thought it would give me
my nerve back.

607
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,660
But it took more of it away.

608
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:25,583
l'm all right. They didn't hurt me.

609
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:28,275
The leader came back and
stopped him.

610
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:31,855
Once the stage gets inside
town, there's...

611
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:34,024
two ways they can break
into the clear.

612
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,199
l want to avoid any running fight
out in the flats.

613
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,096
That means we got to keep
them bottled up.

614
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:42,679
Hale, you'll be here.

615
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:44,816
The stage will pass close
to you on...

616
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:46,927
the way in, so keep out of sight.

617
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:50,188
Billy, you'll be here, on
the smithy roof.

618
00:49:50,481 --> 00:49:52,342
And John, you and...

619
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:55,223
You better hear this.

620
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:58,699
Sure. Just where are
you going to be?

621
00:49:58,736 --> 00:50:00,301
ln the house.

622
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:03,231
You'll be able to keep
close to the girl.

623
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,127
l don't want the girl.

624
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,430
You don't want anyone else
to have her, either.

625
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:10,639
l'm thinking about the gold.

626
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,655
No reason a man can't have both.

627
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,798
All this talk. l'm beginning
to think...

628
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:16,967
there ain't going to be a stage.

629
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,734
Another day's waiting won't hurt.

630
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:22,393
lt hurts me. l don't like all this
waiting and watching.

631
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:25,518
l don't like you knocking
me off that girl.

632
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:27,567
l don't like you acting like
you own her.

633
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:29,294
Sit down.

634
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:32,463
Your brother's got a lot of dislikes.
What do you say?

635
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:34,598
l say you talk too much.

636
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:43,525
All right.

637
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:46,329
John, you and Haggard will be here.

638
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:49,531
Once the team is unhitched,
ride in.

639
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:56,670
That young kid, the crazy one, he
let some things slip.

640
00:50:56,815 --> 00:50:59,726
-They're Confederate soldiers.
-Leave it alone.

641
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:01,518
-He talked about a stage from
California.

642
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,311
-lt ain't due for two weeks.

643
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:04,621
Not the scheduled one.

644
00:51:04,622 --> 00:51:06,606
But they're here for something
to do with...

645
00:51:06,607 --> 00:51:08,557
a stage. One we don't know about.

646
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:11,245
Why wouldn't we know about it?
Any stage that was...

647
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,005
Unless it's carrying something
so important...

648
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,021
that we shouldn't know about it.

649
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:17,952
-Lf it is, l'm going to warn that stage.
-l won't let you.

650
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,831
You'll have to. l'm going to
slip away tonight.

651
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:33,613
Stay out of it, girl. They'll do what
they have to and ride away from here.

652
00:51:33,614 --> 00:51:34,989
And we'll be dead.

653
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,389
They can't leave us here to
set the army on them.

654
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,116
Then l should be the one to go.

655
00:51:39,117 --> 00:51:41,182
l have a better chance.

656
00:51:42,158 --> 00:51:45,259
You turn down the lamp
before l open the door.

657
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:45,580
Look what l got me. A nightrider.

658
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:47,787
Just what kind of a mission
were you out on?

659
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:50,540
To stop what you're waiting
for. The stage.

660
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,538
That's very bright of you.

661
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:55,083
How did you expect to
get out of here?

662
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:58,636
Out on the flatlands, John Candy
could see you clear as day.

663
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:01,707
He could've put a bullet between
your shoulders at 200 yards.

664
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:05,483
After you do what you come for, you
have a bullet marked for me anyway.

665
00:53:05,484 --> 00:53:07,208
l've been trying to keep you
from harm all along.

666
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:10,946
l can imagine how much my
life means to you.

667
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:13,812
-You can't imagine it at all.
-Maybe l can.

668
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,139
You're a man, like the rest.

669
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,635
You may not act like them, but
you think like them.

670
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:20,907
There are many reasons for not
acting as you think.

671
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:24,100
l'm sure you and your reasons are
very happy together.

672
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,661
Not very.

673
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:47,626
Couldn't sleep?

674
00:53:47,627 --> 00:53:49,454
Just out enjoying the moon,
like you. Only...

675
00:53:50,124 --> 00:53:52,106
l didn't have a pretty girl along.

676
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,026
She had some idea...

677
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:56,746
l know, l heard. l get the
feeling that girl's...

678
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:58,915
beginning to glitter like
gold to you.

679
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:00,816
Not pound for pound.

680
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,114
lt came to a choice, l
think she'd win.

681
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,810
So l've been figuring.

682
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:07,809
After the stage, you and me
shoot the others.

683
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:11,724
Then you take the girl, l'll
take the gold.

684
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:15,753
-l don't have to make that choice.
-You might.

685
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:22,186
A bullet can't hurt gold, but...

686
00:54:24,715 --> 00:54:27,881
Looks like this has been a
profitable night for you.

687
00:54:27,882 --> 00:54:29,913
Money isn't everything.

688
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:43,049
-l'm getting sick of hanging around.
-Be quiet.

689
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,545
There ain't any stage. The Rebs
got fooled, some way.

690
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:46,793
Sit down and hush up.

691
00:54:46,794 --> 00:54:49,481
You want something to do, you
might build up this fire.

692
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:51,305
The wind's cold on that ridge.

693
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:53,992
Don't tell my brother what
to do, old man.

694
00:54:53,993 --> 00:54:57,449
-Lf you're cold, build your own fire.
-Just asking a favor, son.

695
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,346
Billy don't do nothing
unless l tell him.

696
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:03,817
To me, some of the things you tell
him get him into trouble.

697
00:55:03,818 --> 00:55:07,369
-l'm getting mighty tired of you.
-Keep your hand away from the gun.

698
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,249
You're walking tall around here.
Giving orders, posting guards.

699
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,648
l think you think you're
really the boss.

700
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:14,568
Don't start anything, John.

701
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:17,795
Anything my brother starts,
l'll help him finish.

702
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:27,240
The stage is coming. Some
troopers escorting it.

703
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,899
Take your spots. Hold your fire
till they go for their guns.

704
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:54,049
Take cover.

705
00:55:56,681 --> 00:55:59,372
You'd get yourself killed,
wouldn't you?

706
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:57,734
Edmonds, unhook the horses.

707
00:56:57,735 --> 00:57:00,460
Millers, bring in the
relief mounts.

708
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:08,602
You the agent for the stage?

709
00:57:08,647 --> 00:57:11,338
Stand where you are. Throw
down your guns.

710
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,083
Ambush!

711
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,117
Get that stage out of here!

712
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,420
Stop that trooper. He'll
give a warning.

713
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:10,345
Steven Jethro?

714
00:58:18,182 --> 00:58:19,524
Steven Jethro, l arrest you
in the name...

715
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:21,604
of the army of the Confederacy.

716
00:58:21,605 --> 00:58:24,196
l am not Steven Jethro. You
certainly must be...

717
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:25,796
We'll find out.

718
00:58:45,157 --> 00:58:48,132
All right, what have you done
with that $30,000 in gold?

719
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:50,528
This could hang 200 men.

720
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:51,908
The gold, where is it?

721
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:54,212
l wouldn't carry it with me.
l wouldn't be that...

722
00:58:54,213 --> 00:58:56,196
All right, tell, where is it?

723
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,980
-lt's in California and only l can get it
out.

724
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:00,420
-You're lying. What did you do with it?

725
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:04,195
-Ain't he got the gold?
-Maybe you sent it on by another
stage.

726
00:59:04,196 --> 00:59:06,979
Or did you dump it somewhere
between here and California?

727
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,763
Talk, or l'll stake you in the sun
till your eyes turn black.

728
00:59:09,764 --> 00:59:11,683
l'm telling you the truth.

729
00:59:11,684 --> 00:59:14,372
l got it on deposit with Wells
Fargo in San Francisco.

730
00:59:14,373 --> 00:59:16,643
And l was going back for
it after a while.

731
00:59:16,644 --> 00:59:20,036
You done a lot of riding just
to look at the scenery.

732
00:59:20,037 --> 00:59:22,531
l'd hate to think l took that
trip for nothing.

733
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:23,555
Wait.

734
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:26,755
l'd like to see that California
territory.

735
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:28,740
We can't go back South, or the
Rebs will slap...

736
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:30,841
us in jail for taking money
they need.

737
00:59:32,324 --> 00:59:35,288
We sure can't stay up here
in Yankee land.

738
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:41,494
We're going to see you get back
to San Francisco real safe.

739
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:46,019
You're not taking him
to California.

740
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,675
The South doesn't want him
wandering around loose.

741
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:50,434
l want that gold.

742
00:59:50,564 --> 00:59:52,035
And l want him where he
can stand trial...

743
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:54,018
and tell what he knows.

744
00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:56,130
You've been telling us
what you want.

745
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:58,947
You say the girl can be part
of the rest of the spoils...

746
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:01,123
but you watch over her like
a mama chick.

747
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:04,130
You say you want the job done any
way, but done and over.

748
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:06,723
Yet you want to take Jethro
back with you.

749
01:00:06,724 --> 01:00:09,763
You don't even care that the gold
isn't on the stage.

750
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:12,728
l don't think you ever were
inside a jail.

751
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:15,938
You're not like us, mister,
not the least little bit.

752
01:00:15,939 --> 01:00:17,955
You're a Rebel officer.

753
01:00:17,956 --> 01:00:21,122
The Confederacy planted you on us
to see that we did the job.

754
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:24,098
You kept us together long enough
to get it done.

755
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,164
Now we're taking over.

756
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:38,369
l'm taking Jethro back.

757
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,801
Let him go and we'll let
you get out alive.

758
01:00:40,802 --> 01:00:43,681
What's wrong with you, Govern?
What do you want with him?

759
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,690
He wants him because Governs
not a killer like us.

760
01:00:46,691 --> 01:00:48,722
He's a Confederate officer.

761
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:50,626
A nice, honorable man, who's
going to try...

762
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,610
and finish the job if it kills him.

763
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,971
lt will.

764
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:57,937
-l can pick Govern off.
-No.

765
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:00,865
We want Jethro alive and talking.

766
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,432
-l won't even scratch him.
-Don't try.

767
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:07,962
They're not going anywhere.

768
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:18,026
Keep low. They'll try to
get us all. Here.

769
01:01:21,217 --> 01:01:22,714
Corral.

770
01:01:29,505 --> 01:01:32,097
lt'll take me a while to get my
shooting eye back.

771
01:01:32,098 --> 01:01:33,822
You'll have a lot of practice.

772
01:01:38,049 --> 01:01:39,585
What do they want?

773
01:01:39,586 --> 01:01:42,113
This man and the gold he stole.

774
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:44,193
You want the gold for yourself?

775
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:46,017
l'm a Confederate officer.
l'm sworn...

776
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:48,118
to bring him back with me.

777
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,408
He's a traitor.

778
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:51,474
We won't have him long.

779
01:01:57,825 --> 01:01:58,925
l'm listening.

780
01:01:59,777 --> 01:02:01,504
Will you come under a truce?

781
01:02:01,505 --> 01:02:03,520
Why don't you come in here?

782
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:04,864
Never mind.

783
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:07,431
We can talk just as easy this way.

784
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:11,481
Jethro's got the gold deposited
in California.

785
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:13,856
We can't get at it without him.

786
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:16,548
Send him out and you'll live.

787
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:21,817
lf you don't, we'll kill you, the
old man and the girl.

788
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:24,556
What do you say?

789
01:02:25,025 --> 01:02:28,353
You know he's lying. You give
in, they'll kill you.

790
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,207
lf l don't, they'll kill us all.

791
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,740
l need that target practice, son.

792
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:35,344
l'm a Confederate, remember?

793
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,155
This isn't North or South. This is
just a little war of our own.

794
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,087
Could be bad.

795
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,947
Could be worse.

796
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,855
No deal!

797
01:03:04,032 --> 01:03:05,087
Let's get him.

798
01:03:05,088 --> 01:03:08,511
He'd have you in the dust before
you got four feet across the road.

799
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:10,558
We can go around back, again.

800
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,478
-With Govern, it won't be
so easy this time.

801
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,977
-Just what are you going to do?

802
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,342
l'm going to sit right here.

803
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:20,444
You might sit too long. Somebody
come along any time.

804
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:22,078
We'll worry about that when
it happens.

805
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,247
Shouldn't be too long.

806
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,782
Govern'll save that girl if he can.

807
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:29,758
l don't like sitting around. Let's
get this over with.

808
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:32,223
We'll watch the house from here.

809
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,574
Let him think about things.

810
01:03:35,327 --> 01:03:37,722
What do you think they'll do
when night falls?

811
01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:39,893
Try to burn us out, maybe.

812
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,512
lt's hard, this waiting.

813
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,413
Hard on them, too.

814
01:03:44,543 --> 01:03:46,904
They can't be sure when somebody
might wander up.

815
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:50,046
Maybe more than they can fight.

816
01:03:50,047 --> 01:03:52,613
Not much chance of that out here.

817
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:54,334
They'll get nervous.

818
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:57,918
Hale has kept them stirred up
since we started.

819
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:01,577
He leads them now, but it
might not last.

820
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:05,663
Haggard looks out for himself,
in the main chance.

821
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,151
Candy boys are very restless.

822
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:11,223
Things might happen.

823
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,237
l don't like this sitting
and sitting.

824
01:04:14,238 --> 01:04:15,101
Shut up.

825
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:16,413
l don't like sitting!

826
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:18,429
-ls that the only word you know?
-What?

827
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,053
''Sitting.'' You've said it 20 times
in the last hour.

828
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:24,018
-Can't say nothing, anymore.
-You say enough.

829
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,789
Lie down for a while.

830
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,652
l'm all right, don't you worry.

831
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:45,852
Might be a good idea if we
took turns sleeping.

832
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:47,714
Be a long night.

833
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,388
Think maybe l could
have a small sip?

834
01:04:59,389 --> 01:05:02,114
All this excitement.
My throat's dry.

835
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:04,620
l think it'll be all right.

836
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:20,876
Govern.

837
01:05:20,893 --> 01:05:22,060
Yes?

838
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:27,864
l don't know quite how to say it.

839
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:29,536
ls it about why you're helping me?

840
01:05:31,645 --> 01:05:34,172
When you first came here,
l thought you...

841
01:05:34,173 --> 01:05:36,307
were the leader of a
bunch of killers.

842
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,447
lf l could lead my life the
way l wanted to...

843
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:42,331
l guess l've dreamed more
than most girls...

844
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:44,466
about where my life was going.

845
01:05:45,597 --> 01:05:48,129
Then you came, and l
seemed to know.

846
01:05:59,004 --> 01:06:01,900
lf things were different.

847
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,161
The bad years pass.

848
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,211
Things change, though.

849
01:06:07,484 --> 01:06:09,914
Memory holds on to some things.

850
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:13,001
How forgetful are you?

851
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,366
l'll remember every shot
you fired at me.

852
01:06:18,715 --> 01:06:20,473
The war will end.

853
01:06:20,828 --> 01:06:25,397
l guess, but right now we've still
got to fight what's left of it.

854
01:06:26,268 --> 01:06:28,834
lf it's over, why go on fighting?

855
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,849
Kind of like a stampede.

856
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:35,659
Not much sense to it, but it
has to run itself out.

857
01:06:35,835 --> 01:06:38,299
Men get trampled in stampedes.

858
01:06:39,387 --> 01:06:40,645
Yes.

859
01:06:41,403 --> 01:06:43,969
But somebody's got to ride it out.

860
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,162
l'll get him!

861
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:01,524
l'll fight Govern!

862
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:14,201
What made him do that?

863
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:16,063
Billy never could stand waiting.

864
01:07:36,026 --> 01:07:38,194
What are you waiting for?

865
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:43,353
l can't shoot an unarmed man. He
just come out to get his brother.

866
01:08:02,714 --> 01:08:06,475
What did he do that for? What did
he dive under the floor for?

867
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:10,999
Everybody on their feet. Jethro.

868
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,653
Stand still.

869
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:23,320
The Candy brothers made
up our minds...

870
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:25,208
for us. We'll have to move in, now.

871
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:28,568
John made it to cover. lt's a long
way for us to run.

872
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:32,102
You start toward the front. l'll
cut around the back.

873
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,076
-Where is he?
-Quiet.

874
01:08:39,193 --> 01:08:41,588
He might try and burn the place.

875
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,783
Now you know what he's doing.

876
01:08:49,784 --> 01:08:53,010
He'll shoot at the sound of your
step. So don't take that step.

877
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,791
Those random shots might
kill one of us.

878
01:09:03,128 --> 01:09:05,784
Just throw away that caution,
J.C., and move in.

879
01:09:05,785 --> 01:09:09,079
l ain't got much taste for running
across that space.

880
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,959
Ain't as young as l was.
Can't run as fast.

881
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,936
We've got to take advantage
of what's going on.

882
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:17,015
John's ready to drive them
into the open.

883
01:09:17,016 --> 01:09:19,831
They won't have much time
for shooting at us.

884
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:23,031
-There's the one chance they might.
-Cut out the talk and let's go.

885
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:25,996
The odds are too even,
son. Don't turn.

886
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:29,544
l've got my trigger finger all
nervous, it'll jerk easy.

887
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:46,551
-You can make it to the house easy.
-l don't see it that way.

888
01:09:46,552 --> 01:09:49,431
l figure that gold's far enough
out of reach...

889
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,415
to make it dangerous to
stretch for it.

890
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:53,238
What are you planning?

891
01:09:53,239 --> 01:09:55,574
All l've got left is my life.

892
01:09:55,575 --> 01:09:57,333
l aim to keep it.

893
01:09:57,784 --> 01:10:01,215
l'm leaving the gold to
you, son. All of it.

894
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:03,538
Don't even twitch.

895
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,944
Drop the gun.

896
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:14,079
l'm still here. Kick the gun a bit.

897
01:10:24,407 --> 01:10:28,043
We can run faster than he can
crawl. We'll get outside.

898
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:48,045
Candy!

899
01:12:15,253 --> 01:12:17,172
Don't even breathe heavy.

900
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:20,240
We don't want whoever wanted
to know l'm here, do we?

901
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:32,660
There are two dead men under that
porch, but one doesn't know it.

902
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:35,667
Some dead men hear real well.

903
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:37,715
Shoot and you'll have a
dead girl, instead.

904
01:12:37,716 --> 01:12:39,539
Throw it down or l'll kill you.

905
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,708
l've got nothing to lose.

906
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,381
But you have.

907
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:46,835
l'm thinking about heaving
on this trigger.

908
01:12:46,836 --> 01:12:48,765
Shoot me and my dead
finger'll pull it.

909
01:12:52,788 --> 01:12:54,819
Drop your gun.

910
01:12:55,668 --> 01:12:57,529
You get the girl...

911
01:12:58,067 --> 01:12:59,698
and l get the gold.

912
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,265
Don't, Govern, he'll kill you.

913
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:33,795
The Yankees came a long way
to be buried.

914
01:13:34,355 --> 01:13:37,649
They did the best they could
to serve their cause.

915
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:39,561
They died like brave soldiers.

916
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,234
Amen.

917
01:13:44,275 --> 01:13:46,409
For Hale and the Candys...

918
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,882
l hope it's not too hot in hell.

919
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,034
All ready, Govern.

920
01:13:50,035 --> 01:13:53,201
There's extra food and ammunition
in the saddlebags.

921
01:13:53,202 --> 01:13:54,302
You, mount up.

922
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:17,009
Let's get started, Jethro.

923
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:20,611
After we get South, l've got a long
way to come back home.
