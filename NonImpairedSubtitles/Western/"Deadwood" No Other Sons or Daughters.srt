1
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,593
( theme music playing )

2
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,873
HER MAJESTY
AWAKES, HUH?

3
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,647
AT THE TERRITORIAL
LEGISLATURE OF YANKTON.

4
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,832
WITH REGARD TO OUR TITLE
AND PROPERTIES, HUH?

5
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,851
ONE VILE FUCKING TASK
AFTER ANOTHER.

6
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,358
THEN THE ENEMY HAS YOU
BY THE SHORT HAIR.

7
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,371
THERE'’S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

8
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,878
DON'’T BE AFRAID.

9
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,759
NO?

10
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,603
IT'’S ALL RIGHT.

11
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,444
DON'’T FUCKING TRY
DOING AWAY WITH YOURSELF
AGAIN, HUH?

12
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,706
ON YOUR CLAIM TO SUSTAIN
YOUR OWNERSHIP.

13
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,831
MIGHT WE HAVE A WORD,
MR. BULLOCK?

14
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:41,007
I'’D LEAN MORE ON WHAT I FELT
ABOUT THIS FELLOW
THAN WHAT I SAW.

15
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,360
- NOT A WORD OF
THIS TO ANYONE.
- YES, SIR.

16
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,538
TAKE A WHILE
TO FIND OUT IF THOSE
ARE WHAT'’S IN ORDER.

17
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,638
NOT TO ME, NO.

18
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,016
I SAW A COLOR BENEATH.

19
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,279
EVER SINCE YOU GIVE ME
THAT INDIAN HEAD TO HIDE.

20
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,492
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER FUCKING
INSTRUCTIONS.

21
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,292
YEAH, KEEP DAN
IN THE DARK.

22
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,262
HAVE A SEAT,
YOUR HONOR.

23
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,851
AND YOU IMPROVE IT,
YOU OWN IT.

24
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,668
AND A PRELIMINARY GUESS
AT SOME NUMBERS.

25
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,860
$5,000.

26
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,165
IF YOU DON'’T MIND,
I'’LL CONTINUE WRITING.

27
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:38,210
LEFT ARM STILL USEFUL
AS AN OLD MAN'’S DICK?

28
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,184
SO DESIST FROM ANY CLEVER
ODOR REFERENCES.

29
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,165
AND RAISE YOUR NERVE
TO CONSULT WITH THE DOC!

30
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,683
GOD DAMN YOU!
SPILLING MY CLEANING
WATER TOO, MINISTER!

31
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,655
UP.

32
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,916
I AM OFF DUTY.
YOU'’RE ON DUTY.

33
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,253
YOU CAN GO
FUCK YOURSELF!

34
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,206
- WE'’RE FORMING
A FUCKING GOVERNMENT.
- YES, SIR.

35
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,476
COCKSUCKER.

36
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,484
SHOOT.

37
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,992
THANK YOU, SIR.

38
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,497
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

39
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,918
I BELIEVE IT'’S TIME
TO SEND FOR MY WIFE AND BOY.

40
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,408
- ( chuckling )
- TWO HOURS, MY PLACE!

41
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,833
DID A FUCKING
GOOD JOB HERE.

42
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,266
THAT AIN'’T
MY ROOM ANYMORE.

43
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,246
ARE YA?

44
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,343
YOU THINK I HAVE TO?

45
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,737
SO COULD WE ALL.

46
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,564
COME TO ME
IN A VISION!
YOU STUPID BASTARD.

47
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,327
ANYWAYS, I'’M GOING
TO LOOK FOR A PLACE.

48
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,017
OUT LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

49
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,994
AND LET YOUR TIE HANG DOWN
TILL YOU FEEL BETTER.

50
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,998
I WANT TO COME
TO THAT MEETING.

51
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,894
( chuckles )

52
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,316
( chatter )

53
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,330
( squealing )

54
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:37,222
( chatter intensifies )

55
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,055
I'’M OPENING
THIS BUSINESS.

56
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,082
NO, I'’M MORE OR LESS
JUST WALKING AROUND.

57
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,953
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS FROCK-COAT?

58
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,417
OR A SETTLEMENT 
OR A TOWNSHIP TYPE.

59
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,870
I'’M JUST A WHORE,
THOUGH.

60
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:16,358
WELL IT'’S GOOD
TO MEET YOU, TOO, JOANIE.

61
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,496
TAKE CARE.

62
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,100
I'’M GOING TO THE GEM.

63
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,447
I'’M HEADING ON.

64
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,010
AIN'’T YOU CLEVER TO SEE
THROUGH THE SUBTERFUGE.

65
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:38,049
( grunts)
GOD DAMN YOU!

66
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,817
GO AWAY!

67
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,157
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING
A BIG FUCKING DEAL.

68
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,342
BUT THAT ONE
TAKES THE PRIZE.

69
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,915
THANKS, DOC.

70
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,293
NAH.

71
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,601
ALL RIGHT.

72
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,112
( door closes )

73
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,911
IN A CASE LIKE YOURS
I WOULDN'’T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO PRESCRIBE.

74
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,884
ALL RIGHT.

75
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,190
AS I HAVE THE BRIBE SHEET.

76
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,789
YOU'’VE BEEN READING ON 
THE FUCKING YELLOW PERIL,
HUH?

77
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,481
HAD A LOVELY ADVERT
IN TODAY'’S "PIONEER."

78
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,346
HAVE THE SAME RIGHT
TO OPERATE BROTHELS
AS MEN?

79
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,707
Al:
OBJECTIONS?

80
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,213
MAYOR.

81
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,197
AND USE THE LION'’S SHARE
OF REVENUES TO PAY
THE BRIBES.

82
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,876
THERE'’S A PIANO OUTSIDE.

83
00:35:57,772 --> 00:36:00,775
SELF-NOMINATIONS 
ARE PERMITTED.

84
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,265
( crowd chatter )

85
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:51,158
IS OF THE ESSENCE
OF A FREE SOCIETY.

86
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,393
DON'’T DO IT
WITH NO MUD.

87
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,879
THAT STILL DON'’T
GET YOU OFF THE HOOK
ABOUT THAT PIANO.

88
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,903
SEVEN TIMES.

89
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:14,909
GOOD FOR YOU
VOLUNTEERING FOR THE POST.

90
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,259
AND AD HOC.

91
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:55,783
BIG PULL TO THAT,
GOING BACK TO WHAT
YOU KNOW.

92
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,591
VERY.

93
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,097

94
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,116
EVENING.

95
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:40,127
FIRE MARSHAL OBLIGATION'’S
GONNA TAKE?

96
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,049
MORE OR LESS
AS MUCH AS YOUR HEALTH
COMMISSIONER, HUH?

97
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,055
GRAVE ROBBER.

98
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,601
WELL, UM, IT'’S--
IT'’S EASING UP SOME.

99
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,426
AND MRS. GARRET
AND THE CHILD.

100
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:46,227
I'’D RATHER
YOU DIDN'’T.

101
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:04,662
COME TO OUR STORE.
COME BUY A BROOM.

102
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,168
ALL RIGHT.

103
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:23,814
AND WE NEVER ASK THE PURPOSE
OF A CUSTOMER'’S PURCHASE.

104
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,332
OUR MAYOR.

105
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,255
OH, MAYOR!

106
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:12,613
I'’M GONNA HAVE
A LOOK AT YOU.

107
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,117
ALL RIGHT.

108
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,995
LOOK AT MY FINGER.

109
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,033
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

110
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,152
THE NOT KNOWING
THE PURPOSE IS...

111
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,130
COMPETING WITH
THE NOT KNOWING?

112
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,349
AND YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS?

113
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:31,585
HE IS A SON OF A BITCH.

114
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,927
GOOD NIGHT.

115
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:49,386
GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR.

116
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,462
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
I'’LL TELL YOU WHERE.

117
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:45,943
( laughing )

118
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,089
WITH YOUR EYES
WIDE OPEN.

119
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,437
TAKE THAT BOY YOU SPOKE UP
FOR UP IN JOANIE'’S ROOM
THE OTHER DAY.

120
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,123
YOU JUST USE SOME
SPIT ON THAT OR LARD.

121
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,414
MIGHT'’VE KEPT YOU
FROM BEING SUCH AN EVIL
COCKSUCKER.

122
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,233
( dog barking )

123
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,240
SAY HELLO TO THE NEW
FIRE MARSHAL.

124
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,865
I WILL NOT BE A DRUNK
WHERE HE'’S BURIED.

125
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,838
- SHUT UP, CHARLIE.

126
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,779

I HOPE YOU'’VE EARNED
ME $5.

131
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,933
NO.

132
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,420
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.

133

134
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,973
SO I WAS TOLD.
SORRY FOR CALLING
SO LATE.

135
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,639
ALL RIGHT THEN.

136
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,509
- WON'’T YOU SIT DOWN?
- THANK YOU.

137
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,931
HOW HORRIFYING.

138
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,313
THEY'’RE IN MICHIGAN
WITH HER PEOPLE.

139
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,792
YES.

140
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,968
- ANY OTHER SONS
OR DAUGHTERS? 
- NO, THAT'’S IT.

141
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:18,148
I'’M SORRY.

142
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,403
ANYWAYS.

143
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,297
GOOD NIGHT.

144
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,866
I SEE.

145
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,319
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

146
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,900
( piano music playing )

147
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,654
? BOY, BUDDY BONE,
YOU CAN BLOW A MEAN
HORN THERE. ?
