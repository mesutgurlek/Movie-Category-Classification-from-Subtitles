1
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,762
Boys.

2
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,763
How are you?

3
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,312
Did you fuck me while I was out?

4
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:33,697
- Hell, no.
- Well, quit looking at me like that.

5
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,618
Except for talking a little cockeyed...

6
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,994
Al is back to his accustomed self!

7
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,999
What that is, speech,
crisis he went through...

8
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:48,213
Al's body parts are showing
they're healing at different rates.

9
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:53,591
Well, you talk cockeyed, boss,
all you want, long as you want...

10
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,133
just so you're miserable and mean.

11
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:59,054
How cockeyed do I look?

12
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:03,054
Appropriately cockeyed for one
who's been through what you have...

13
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,804
and then the fall you took.

14
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,015
Bullock look worse?

15
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:09,941
Naming your adversary
shows your memory is intact.

16
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:12,599
You're gonna have to gather
all your fucking wiles, Al...

17
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:15,695
'cause there's developments
that need interpretating on every front.

18
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:19,066
Al is out of the development
interpretation business...

19
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,986
for the short time being.

20
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,872
Wu's got a big tall Celestial
that's haunting him.

21
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,237
He's invisible.

22
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,037
But Wu's convinced
he's from San Francisco.

23
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,751
God damn it, Dan.

24
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,089
Will you shut the fuck up
and let this man harbour his resources?

25
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,631
You look in Chink's Alley?

26
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,797
You see any big unfamiliar chink?

27
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,929
Well, there ain't nothing to it, Al.
I just told you for a giggle.

28
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,102
I mean, you know. Excitable Wu.

29
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,355
So what else is new?

30
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,605
Nothing special...

31
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,694
Not a goddamn thing
that can't wait till you get well, boss.

32
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,114
There is a bell...

33
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,283
behind the bar.

34
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:06,530
Absolutely.

35
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,110
I know there is a bell.

36
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:12,455
I'm telling you
I want it brought up here.

37
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:14,203
Absolutely, Al.

38
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,580
I best help.

39
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,339
If there's anybody that can fuck up
the gathering of a bell, it's Johnny.

40
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,635
- You want some water?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,598
Fucking water.

42
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,978
Don't be a fucking jerk.

43
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,485
Your right eye is filled with blood.

44
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:58,454
Can you use your right arm at all?

45
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,418
Put your nose between my fingers...

46
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,580
you'll find how much
I can use my fucking arm.

47
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:08,709
That's good. That is a good sign, Al.

48
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:11,256
- Don't bullshit me.
- I won't.

49
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:16,224
I think you've had a small stroke...

50
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:19,558
guessing maybe from the strain
of that stone.

51
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,146
- You keep bullshitting them.
- I will.

52
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,851
This gets out...

53
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:28,900
I'll slit your fucking throat.

54
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:32,936
- I wield a blade good with my left.
- It won't get out.

55
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,111
- Lf I need it, you will fucking kill me.
- You stop that.

56
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,945
You find me no better...

57
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,411
you'll wish to hell I was fucking worse...

58
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,620
'cause I wield a blade good with my left.

59
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,584
Don't you put a fucking clock on this.

60
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,628
Madam...

61
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:56,207
in the chambers of my heart...

62
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,715
beats a love...

63
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,723
for every crooked timber of this...

64
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,928
shitbox of a structure, this building.

65
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:09,395
This building,
its warped floorboards and...

66
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:12,056
Fie!

67
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,649
Why, even in Richardson, my chef...

68
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:22,651
my eyes see a beloved household pet...

69
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,987
somehow walking upright.

70
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,159
See in Richardson...

71
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:34,461
a half-witted child, nonetheless adored.

72
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:38,132
Mrs Garret.

73
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:40,458
The very subject of my thoughts.

74
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:45,465
May I borrow Richardson, please,
Mr Farnum, to escort me on an errand?

75
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:52,351
Would you prefer
other company, ma'am?

76
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,844
Less...

77
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,272
mysterious?

78
00:06:58,527 --> 00:06:59,937
No, Mr Farnum.

79
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,606
Richardson.

80
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,492
I saved a lot.
I'll mop the rest in a moment.

81
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,160
- Go with Mrs Garret.
- Thank you, Mr Farnum.

82
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,707
Eyes down.

83
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,162
Therefore, madam, as to your...

84
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:26,884
generous offer to purchase my hotel,
I must gratefully decline.

85
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,591
I take you for the man in charge.

86
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,720
A.W. Merrick, sir,
owner, publisher, editor-in-chief...

87
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,970
and, for the moment, sole reporter.

88
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:43,265
Hugo Jarry, County Commissioner
appointed by Governor Pennington.

89
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:46,101
- Of this county?
- Yes.

90
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,231
- Has our county a name?
- Lawrence County.

91
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:54,951
Ah, well, thank you
for that information and congratulations.

92
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,610
Lawrence, Lawrence County.

93
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,031
My father was a newspaperman.

94
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,534
Lowell Sentinel-Bee.
I was raised among these contraptions.

95
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,040
Were you?

96
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:11,383
Great respect for the fourth estate.
Here's a statement to be printed.

97
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:21,267
"As to ownership of the claims in the
newly constituted county of Lawrence...

98
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,475
"as annexed to the Dakota Territory...

99
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:26,813
"a presumption of legitimate title
shall obtain...

100
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,808
"for claims worked...

101
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:32,565
"actively and continuously
prior to amendment of the treaty...

102
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,192
"with the Sioux Nation,
September, 1876.

103
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:39,399
"This presumption
shall be subject to qualification...

104
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,235
"according to mitigating facts."

105
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,575
If I discern this correctly, sir...

106
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:49,336
this statement could be taken to mean...

107
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:51,534
nothing.

108
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:53,922
The statement continues.

109
00:08:55,843 --> 00:09:00,800
"New title will be awarded on claims
to which title is denied at set prices...

110
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:04,590
"via lottery as conducted
by the County Commissioner."

111
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,929
I would be grateful
if that gets in your next edition.

112
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:11,015
I must tell you, Commissioner,
that even with that last bit added...

113
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:14,273
what exactly will or won't qualify...

114
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:18,689
or mitigate the presumption
of ownership, eludes me.

115
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:21,905
I didn't realise that was a bar
the statement had to hurdle.

116
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:26,698
Without an accompanying explanation,
sir...

117
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:30,531
this statement may work
an unsettling effect.

118
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,793
In any case, sir,
being the commissioner of this county...

119
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,288
and bidding you good day...

120
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,213
I have presented you with that
to publish in your paper...

121
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,622
as organ of record in this camp.

122
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,252
Front page.

123
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,906
"Trixie's to the hardware store,"
the big one said.

124
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,030
May we go there then, Richardson?
Have you time?

125
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:14,369
Yes. I only have stew to mop
before lunch.

126
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,925
- I like you.
- Thank you, Richardson.

127
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,135
You're pretty.

128
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:39,724
Thank you very much.
And probably that's all...

129
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,517
either of us needs to say
on that subject ever again.

130
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:52,238
I'm uncertain how long I may be, so...

131
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,698
I'll send you back to the hotel.

132
00:10:55,243 --> 00:11:00,201
Would you be so kind as to return this
to the pile outside the Gem?

133
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:06,044
Thank you, Richardson.

134
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,619
Goodbye.

135
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,092
Cunt!

136
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,093
Good morning.

137
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,219
Morning.

138
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,229
May we have a private word?

139
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,938
Don't flee, don't flee.

140
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,233
I'm going outside for a smoke.

141
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,831
Gentlemen.

142
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:02,752
You knocked up?

143
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,808
- Why would you ask?
- You wouldn't have come here first...

144
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,807
which means first you went to the Gem,
which you've never yet stepped foot in.

145
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,391
I sent in Richardson.

146
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,806
Meaning first you crossed
the thoroughfare with him...

147
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,316
opening the possibility you're
only puking from the company you keep.

148
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,066
I think I'm pregnant.

149
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:27,864
We make tea...

150
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:32,782
pennyroyal and cohosh...

151
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,993
if that's what you come to find out.

152
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:40,081
- I might very well die in delivery.
- Holy cow!

153
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:43,879
I meant to say, more likely
than other women, I might die...

154
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:47,926
because an ailment when I was little
shaped me for difficulty in childbirth.

155
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:50,261
Why not take your tale of woe
to the Doc?

156
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:52,887
I feel that Doctor Cochran judges me.

157
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,468
Lucky, then, you come to me...

158
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:58,397
that takes you to my bosom
and smoothes your hair...

159
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,354
and tells you all will be well.

160
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,858
I can tell you this much, Mrs Garret.

161
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,775
If you take the tea...

162
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:13,075
lay plenty of dope in...

163
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,621
'cause I've killed seven.

164
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:20,036
And every bleeding out
I laced on good and tight...

165
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,166
and for a long fucking while after.

166
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,582
I want children of my own.

167
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:37,010
Let me finish up
my Jewish lessons here...

168
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,012
then come find you.

169
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,140
Thank you very much.

170
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:43,600
- Thank you, Trixie.
- All right.

171
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,597
- My name's Alma.
- I know your name.

172
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,709
- Miss Isringhausen.
- Mr Adams.

173
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,585
- May I collect a change of clothes?
- Of course.

174
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:26,932
- I hope you slept well.
- I'm mortified to say I did.

175
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:28,135
Mortified?

176
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,847
Having done so
at the cost of your comfort.

177
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,858
I sleep anywhere, ma'am.
I'm like a dog in that regard.

178
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,442
We don't want you murdered
in your bed.

179
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,438
Perhaps it was irrational,
my being so afraid.

180
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:46,613
- That ain't a test fear's got to pass.
- I know she's had others done for.

181
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,913
So you've said.

182
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,039
- Anyways...
- May I know your given name?

183
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,703
Silas, if I remember correct.

184
00:14:57,423 --> 00:15:00,424
You have shown charity
to one among strangers, Silas.

185
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,469
Giving her great solace.

186
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:07,922
Thank you.

187
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,808
Or you're welcome, I guess.

188
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:13,392
Thank you, Silas.

189
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,572
And you're welcome.

190
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:36,910
Hostetler.
It's the Nigger General Fields.

191
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,788
Now you was to have had this horse
one week.

192
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:49,218
Shit, Old Nugget here
is sound and spoilt.

193
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:52,047
He's been living
on peppermints and apples...

194
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,053
in the private stables
of a San Francisco dry goods big shot.

195
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:59,263
Making you owing 17 weeks additional!

196
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,140
Yeah, I was delivering emerald earrings
to Mrs Big Shot...

197
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:08,193
and a diamond bracelet
and matching choker...

198
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,568
to Mr Big Shot's mistress.

199
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,110
$4 a week...

200
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:16,534
times 17...

201
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,112
is...

202
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,449
Here, cipher the result
against this $100.

203
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:27,213
$100...

204
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,422
take away 68...

205
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,583
Put the balance toward our future trade.

206
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:36,345
- Owing General Nigger...
- Nigger General.

207
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,883
...$32 credit.

208
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,847
Being you was away,
maybe now you got a chance...

209
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,060
to take off this half-ass uniform.

210
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:48,353
Then who's gonna know
I'm the Nigger General?

211
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,857
By your own telling,
you never was in no Union Army.

212
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:56,862
This ain't the time or the place
to be drawing people's attention.

213
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,985
Even for a goddamn fool.

214
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,949
Yeah, well, I keep missing the place
where it'd be a good time.

215
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,530
Must be my goddamn foolishness.

216
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:19,593
You wouldn't suppose they'd be
salting the fucking find over there...

217
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,089
now, would you, Doris?

218
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:22,883
I don't understand.

219
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:26,673
I was wondering if maybe
your new bosses Maddie and Joanie...

220
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:28,975
are sending me more
than my proper share...

221
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:33,428
giving me a false fucking impression
of how their pussy's selling.

222
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,603
I don't know.

223
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:40,151
'Cause this is...
This is fucking heavy action...

224
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,943
for an operation ahead of itself
far as decor and location...

225
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,942
and every other fucking aspect!

226
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,069
It's mostly from just the one trick.

227
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:52,238
- Which is who?
- I don't know his name.

228
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,662
They call him Mr W.

229
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,381
What does he look like?

230
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:03,458
- I wouldn't know how to say.
- Oh, fucking mutt.

231
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,087
- Is he tall or short?
- Tall.

232
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,386
- Thin or fat?
- Thin.

233
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,178
Good-looking, I guess.

234
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:14,973
- Clean-shaved or bearded?
- Bearded.

235
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,182
He threw me into a wall last night.

236
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,987
Don't tell me.

237
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,154
On what pretext, sweetheart?

238
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,531
I looked at him.

239
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,491
And that was against his instructions?

240
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:41,619
He had all the girls facing the wall.

241
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,413
And you peeked?

242
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:49,376
Now was this... Was this more or less
a push to the wall...

243
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,924
or did he fucking fling you, violent-like,
with more of the same in mind?

244
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:56,099
Violent-like.

245
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:59,008
Well...

246
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,558
that's a man with a problem,
ain't it, Doris?

247
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:08,026
Mr W.

248
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:13,656
Jesus Christ,
can I be that fucking lucky?

249
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,902
- Warm it up?
- Thank you.

250
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:27,794
How did you sleep, Carrie?

251
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:32,416
All right, I guess. How did you sleep?

252
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:38,637
- All right.
- Are you guessing?

253
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,099
I guess I'm guessing.

254
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:45,509
Do your back?

255
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,689
Yes, thank you.

256
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,940
My trick got you upset.

257
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,067
I was in with him the night before.

258
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,784
- I guessed he took to watching.
- How did that work out?

259
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,367
I guess he don't.

260
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,168
Or, anyway, not that night.

261
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,539
Or maybe just not me.

262
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,415
Do you want to know
what I do with him?

263
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,877
If you want to say.

264
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,387
I get him off through his pants.

265
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,722
Acting like my hand's my snatch.

266
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,647
Reaching around behind you?

267
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:40,608
- Behind me and between my legs.
- Through his pants?

268
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,311
Yes.

269
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,065
You don't put your hand inside?

270
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,407
- Are you naked?
- Dressed.

271
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,084
Except for my stockings
and my bloomers.

272
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,918
You talk any special way?

273
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,885
I remind him not to hit me.

274
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:13,133
Do you want to be writing this down?

275
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:21,767
Congratulations, Doc,
on your high and holy bullshit.

276
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:25,108
It's water off a duck to some,
but others still got feelings.

277
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,606
Of whom are we fucking speaking?

278
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:32,909
One as might die in childbirth
more likely than us lucky others...

279
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:35,324
but so sponged down
in your disapproval...

280
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:39,789
when she was kicking the fucking dope,
she's afraid now to seek your care.

281
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,703
- I'll call on her.
- Under some other fucking pretext.

282
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,216
- All right.
- Mighty fucking big of you, Doc.

283
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,881
You have about as miserable
a disposition as your employer.

284
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,304
I ain't exclusive to him no more.

285
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,861
Hey, now, Miss Lady.

286
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,314
How much do you want for that bottle?

287
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,564
What the fuck are you supposed to be?

288
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,526
Currency still spends, ma'am.

289
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:25,990
Is that
some dilapidated-type fucking uniform?

290
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,624
I scouted for fucking Custer.

291
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:31,796
A great man who would have
wanted you to sell me that bottle.

292
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,632
He was no great fucking man!

293
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:38,133
He was a long-haired cocksucker...

294
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,087
that could have saved many lives
by more drinking...

295
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:47,391
and stopped being so fucking ambitious,
and many still above ground...

296
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:52,188
and not scalped by the fucking heathens
and their guts spread over the plains.

297
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:56,690
You're a short nigger, aren't you?

298
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:00,524
For a fact.

299
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,408
My name's Jane.

300
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,576
I'm the Nigger General Fields.

301
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:08,450
Want a drink?

302
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,864
I want to buy that bottle,
that's what I want.

303
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,541
Well, you ain't buying it,
but you can have a fucking drink.

304
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,629
Thanks.

305
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:28,845
Don't fucking look around!

306
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,383
I don't care who sees a nigger
drinking with me...

307
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,394
or drinking from the same bottle
or how...

308
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:37,144
stupid his fucking outfit is.

309
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:40,020
This here is the epaulet
of a Union Army general.

310
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,527
And this here is the ass
of a drunken shitbird.

311
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:49,654
Finish this with me.

312
00:23:50,703 --> 00:23:55,199
If you can sit beside someone
and not stink or fart.

313
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:04,704
I've been known to cut the odd fart...

314
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:11,799
- but they've never stunk.
- I got the self-same gift.

315
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,971
If I took advantage, I apologise.

316
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,259
You took no more advantage
of me, Silas...

317
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:21,141
than the Samaritan did
the traveller from Jerusalem.

318
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,431
Good.

319
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,193
I should tell you, Silas...

320
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:33,483
that the Mr Swearengen
I've heard you say you work for...

321
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:38,027
is named by Mrs Garret as her
instrument in her husband's murder.

322
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,447
- Named by Mrs Garret?
- Yes.

323
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:42,415
- As her instrument?
- Yes.

324
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:47,038
Jesus Christ.

325
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,754
- What's your first name?
- Alice.

326
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:57,338
Well, Alice, your story don't get
less strange the more of it you tell.

327
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:59,968
Because Mr Swearengen
wouldn't do such a thing?

328
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:03,969
Generates a fucking strangeness
is her saying he was her hire.

329
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,594
I see.

330
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:09,061
Yeah, well,
that makes fucking one of us.

331
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,610
Would you introduce me
to Mr Swearengen?

332
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:14,696
You're asking me to?

333
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,063
- You want to meet him?
- Please.

334
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,494
Why do I feel lucky
we didn't meet across a poker table?

335
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:27,704
Anyways,
he ain't up to chatting just now.

336
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:34,248
Silas?

337
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:41,965
Her bearing gives you suspicions
as to her health?

338
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:43,680
No, not at all.

339
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:46,885
My notes indicate that it had been
a year since her last exam...

340
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:51,223
and with the day-long lull between
gunfights, I thought I'd have a look.

341
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:53,303
I see.

342
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:56,982
And she seems to be
coming along beautifully.

343
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:18,542
Since I have cared for you as well...

344
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:21,756
can I ask after your health?

345
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:29,176
I continue relieved of the weakness
you treated me for.

346
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,013
And you have nothing else to report?

347
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,849
Thank you for examining Sofia.

348
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:44,485
Folk wisdom and remedies
known to others in the camp...

349
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,275
are often quite adequate...

350
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:50,365
to the requirements of health.
And Trixie...

351
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,153
for example...

352
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:56,820
is a stalwart
and a reliable source of these.

353
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,829
However, I do have
some particular competence...

354
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,248
as to the implications
of anatomical anomalies...

355
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:09,753
congenital or consequent
of previous illness...

356
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:13,259
and I would hope
that you would avail yourself of this...

357
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:18,258
notwithstanding my idiosyncrasies
and my defects of character.

358
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:42,076
Please.

359
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:50,705
My experience, Mr Wolcott...

360
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,419
come to making restitution
for others' outlays, the rich can be tardy.

361
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,135
I'm just satisfying myself that my
employer's getting what he's paying for.

362
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:04,264
Bills of sale, drawn good and legal...

363
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,926
signatures genuine and witnessed.

364
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:11,774
- Join us, Commissioner.
- Gentlemen.

365
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:16,392
Notice about the claims
is in your newspaper publisher's hands.

366
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:20,356
That the Yankton statement may cause
unease among local claimholders...

367
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,944
as to the security of their title...

368
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,525
Mr Merrick found personally distressing.

369
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,366
He found it wrong and unfair.

370
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,365
- Was he looking for a bribe?
- No, he was not. I have a nose for that.

371
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,082
In any case, he's manageable.

372
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,542
I quite stared him down.

373
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,375
We're just chewing the fat in here,
Leon, barge the fuck amongst us.

374
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,513
Mr Merrick posted that statement
outside his office, Mr Tolliver.

375
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,634
- Put out an extra, did he?
- No edition of the paper at all.

376
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:52,177
Just the statement on the outside wall,
and people are fucking riled.

377
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:55,391
- Riled or frightened?
- Riled, sir.

378
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:58,764
That's the type of unsettlement
we ain't necessarily after.

379
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,979
Wanting to know where he's at,
who the fuck he thinks he is.

380
00:29:03,156 --> 00:29:06,026
You want to manage this,
Commissioner, or shall I?

381
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,777
You go on, Tolliver.

382
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:11,367
Maybe take another bath.

383
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:19,206
What in fuck's
that word supposed to mean?

384
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:23,663
Mitigating, as applied to a presumption,
would mean to lessen...

385
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,337
or soften strength or rigour.

386
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:29,760
I ought to punch you in the fucking nose.

387
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,223
Why would you punch me?

388
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:34,342
You had him here, didn't you?

389
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:38,551
Give him your fucking words
to print on your fucking machine!

390
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:42,392
Which is short of saying
I should have forced him...

391
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:44,606
to some purpose of my own?

392
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:48,643
Show me where the cocksucker's at.
I won't fall short of force!

393
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:50,941
Who convened the meeting, boys?

394
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:54,616
New county commissioner
give Merrick a statement...

395
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,573
mitigating us into an ass-fucking.

396
00:29:58,749 --> 00:29:59,946
Ouch.

397
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,581
And then I yelled:

398
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,373
"Put the fucking door down, Dan!"

399
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,637
Doc said only what would jolly you, Al...

400
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,555
but I do believe Mr Merrick
might be in the fucking soup.

401
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,842
You have got one yawning
fucking chasm of a mouth on you!

402
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:23,600
Fucking County Commissioner
made Mr Merrick post notice...

403
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,471
titles of claims
to be decided case by case.

404
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:31,060
The County Commissioner's
in the camp?

405
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,857
Yeah. And that hooplehead Steve
is about to punch Merrick...

406
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:37,481
for posting the notice, and I know
that you got a liking for Merrick.

407
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:40,818
I want you
to stop thinking now, Johnny...

408
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,569
and only answer the question
I'm gonna ask you.

409
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:44,987
Yes, sir.

410
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,541
Where's the Commissioner now?

411
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:50,836
- The Commissioner or Mr Merrick?
- The Commissioner, Johnny.

412
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,079
Where's the Commissioner?

413
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,749
He's at Bella Union.
He moved over there.

414
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:58,547
Jesus fucking Christ!

415
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,050
Get Bullock.

416
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,471
- Bullock?
- Bullock. Get Bullock.

417
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:07,972
Yes, sir.

418
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:15,892
May call the Sheriff in, huh,
fisticuffs between Merrick and Steve!

419
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:18,476
Shut the fuck up, Johnny.
Help me get situated.

420
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:23,407
Reads to me they're inclining towards
the present titleholders.

421
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:25,818
But then they start to fucking mitigate!

422
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:35,909
Yeah, they do get to mitigating,
this last part here.

423
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:40,172
I guess my question is who of us here
didn't know what government was...

424
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:41,503
before we came?

425
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:44,422
Wasn't half our purpose coming
to get shed of the cocksucker?

426
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:47,715
And here it catches up to us again
to do what's in its nature...

427
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,384
to lie to us...

428
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,057
and confuse us
and steal what we come to by toil...

429
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,814
and being lucky
just once in our fucking lives.

430
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:02,560
Are we gonna be surprised by that,
boys, government being government?

431
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:05,819
Will we next be shocked
by rivers running...

432
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:08,231
or trees casting fucking shade?

433
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:13,281
Look, I have said before
and I still fucking say...

434
00:32:13,372 --> 00:32:17,321
those of a mind,
make a price on your claims.

435
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,576
Get out from under uncertainty.

436
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:22,498
And that's from no fucking goodness
on my part...

437
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:24,794
and no fucking charity, either.

438
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:27,676
I am past picking up again.

439
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:32,048
This spot might be wrong,
but here's where I'm making my stand!

440
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:38,432
And I'll also say,
for being a fucking Commissioner...

441
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:43,681
this Jarry don't seem such a bad sort,
under the limits of what he is.

442
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:46,234
Wait a minute.

443
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,737
Does that mean
you've been fucking talking to him?

444
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,857
When in fuck did I say I wasn't?

445
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,988
I am asking you...

446
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,989
where the fuck he is...

447
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:01,995
and if he's at your fucking joint!

448
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,663
And I am telling you, yes...

449
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:07,327
and making no fucking apologies.

450
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,256
And saying one more question
in that tone...

451
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:12,498
will collect you a broken jaw.

452
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,008
I don't need another fucking question...

453
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,509
'cause I've located
the fact that I was seeking...

454
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:27,688
which is the whereabouts
of the fucking Commissioner...

455
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:30,056
and whoever wants can come with me!

456
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,398
- Dangerous turn, Mr Tolliver.
- Yes.

457
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,616
Temper loosened my tongue.

458
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:45,788
You got gall...

459
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,950
coming before me prettier than ever.

460
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:51,747
Are you all right?

461
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:53,745
On the fucking mend,
that's all to say on that.

462
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:56,330
What do you know
of this new commissioner?

463
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:59,464
His notice on the claims
has people pissed off.

464
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:01,841
I wouldn't want the cocksucker harmed.

465
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:05,514
- I don't intend him any.
- Don't be fucking clever with me.

466
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:08,596
He's allied with Tolliver.
Are you aware of that?

467
00:34:09,603 --> 00:34:12,141
- No.
- Bedridden, I know more than you.

468
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:16,557
The point is,
if their man's allied with Tolliver...

469
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,359
and fucking harm comes to him...

470
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:22,442
between the hoopleheads and me,
who will Yankton put it on?

471
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,188
You.

472
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:26,533
Do they understand...

473
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,532
how most of what happens
is people being drunk...

474
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:33,079
and stupid and trying to find something
else to blame besides that...

475
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,324
that makes their lives totally fucked?

476
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,835
- No, they don't.
- Yankton.

477
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,746
Yankton, exactly.

478
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:42,167
They're too busy stealing
to study human nature.

479
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,586
Did you ring, Al?

480
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,462
Now that's the sound
of that fucking bell being rung.

481
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,216
- Did you hear that sound?
- No.

482
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:53,099
No. Then get the fuck out.

483
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:57,182
And both of you
being government officials...

484
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,854
you ought to fucking look out
for each other...

485
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:04,307
Sheriff.

486
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:18,415
Had you vision as well as sight,
you would recognise within me...

487
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:22,199
not only a man,
but an institution and the future as well.

488
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:26,208
Fuck you, fuck the institution,
and fuck the future!

489
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:29,801
You cannot fuck the future, sir.
The future fucks you.

490
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,755
Come out from that cage,
you billiard-ball licking cocksucker.

491
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:35,633
- I do not take orders from hooligans.
- Come out!

492
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:40,017
We'll see if them cappers choose you
to look at or Tolliver's fucking money!

493
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:41,216
A chancy call.

494
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:44,478
Should you impede my progress, sir,
were I to attempt to leave this cage...

495
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:46,438
you would seal your fate...

496
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:49,561
as irrevocably
as the tyrant crossing the Rubicon!

497
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:51,230
Is he asking to suck my prick?

498
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:54,238
Why don't you just explain your
fucking statement, Commissioner...

499
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,482
as far as us keeping title to our claims?

500
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:58,568
I explain nothing under duress.

501
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:01,579
Have you ever lived a day
in your fucking life?

502
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:06,956
Pitch, Commissioner,
burning off the top of your fucking head!

503
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:10,960
Is that vision or sight?

504
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:15,539
Cunt or duress?

505
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,670
What the fuck, Tolliver?

506
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,262
The mob is an ungodly creature, Sheriff.

507
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,927
Come on!

508
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,722
Stand away or be shot!

509
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:31,305
He's under protection of the law.

510
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,230
You've got their fucking attention.

511
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,113
- Fuck 'em, anyway.
- Don't get me started.

512
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:47,079
Do not get me started,
Little Nigger General.

513
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:51,077
If something got to go in front
of "Nigger," and don't it always...

514
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,042
I prefer "short" to "little."

515
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,913
Short Nigger is a deal...

516
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,632
and I am a girl keeps her bargain.

517
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:02,299
Or I could just call you
plain Nigger General.

518
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,052
Call me just plain Nigger.

519
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,302
Short Plains Nigger.

520
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,382
Nigger of the High Desert.

521
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:22,403
Thanks for the conversation,
Miss Jane, and the whiskey.

522
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:25,359
I am going blind as a fucking bat.

523
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:30,160
Who is that, the fucking Sheriff?
Flanked by some assholes?

524
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:34,576
I feel no less manhandled by you, sir.

525
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,119
If they still had you,
by now you'd be feeling worse.

526
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:48,174
I need the lockup.

527
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:51,128
Wait till I take out Bill's robe.

528
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:13,575
And now to jail,
as wretched indignity accumulates.

529
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:18,576
A beating short of murder
might have done you considerable good.

530
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,077
The Commissioner meets
his constituents.

531
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:27,623
A man has to work some dogs
to learn how the world's tail wags.

532
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:30,466
Not coming to his aid,
you mean to build his character.

533
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,296
We all ain't sound like you, sir.

534
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:36,173
Many could use
some construction work.

535
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,173
Fellas like yourself,
that's hard to understand.

536
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,839
Your foundation's sunk deep.

537
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,681
Framework's first-rate,
your mason work.

538
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,851
Nothing unfinished in you,
or rotten or damaged.

539
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,601
Or sick.

540
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:02,028
Five long years talking to nobody.

541
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:06,326
Hostetler, you got enough problems
of your own.

542
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,794
You don't need other bodies,
especially a fool!

543
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:13,827
A fool! Hostetler a fool!

544
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,214
I hope you fucking strangle under there.

545
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,045
Mark us even on that $100.

546
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:21,845
If you don't get
your fucking thumb down...

547
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,804
I'm gonna run this pitchfork through it.

548
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:28,801
We drag the nigger from the livery
to our pitch pot in Chink's Alley.

549
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:33,311
And we make a good fucking racket
so that Bullock hears.

550
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:36,644
He comes out, he gives fucking pursuit.

551
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:39,737
Once he's across the thoroughfare...

552
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:43,273
the several of us
come from under the fucking stairs...

553
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,988
and go up and grab the Commissioner.

554
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,242
Well, suppose Bullock
comes out shooting?

555
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,244
Or we could just grab the nigger.

556
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,831
Your pelvic girdle does show
the effects of your childhood illness.

557
00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:05,007
Your labour may be difficult.

558
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:07,505
When you say difficult...

559
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,925
I have counselled patients
on the basis of their anatomy...

560
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,554
against taking pregnancies to term.

561
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,636
I do not make that argument with you.

562
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,900
Do you distinguish
between difficult and dangerous?

563
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,099
Yes.

564
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:26,195
Your shape does not add danger
to the delivery...

565
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,108
such as to justify, for instance,
the risks of a caesarean procedure.

566
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,151
It adds pain. Difficult in that sense?

567
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:37,622
Especially since
you might be reluctant to mollify...

568
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,124
the difficulty's effects with opiates.

569
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,635
I've been told it wasn't an alternative
for me even to contemplate, so...

570
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,762
this is new information.

571
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,015
I see.

572
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:05,566
And now that the choice
is within your province...

573
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:09,065
do you incline
in one direction or another?

574
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,195
To be honest, Doctor, I'm living into
the thought that I've any choice at all.

575
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,990
You know what I'm fucking writing...

576
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:21,405
fucking Nigger General.

577
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:25,535
To my ingrate fucking sister Etta...

578
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:27,584
who will outlast me...

579
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:30,999
I am writing my fucking will.

580
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:32,579
One...

581
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,836
What else they teach you, Hostetler...

582
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:42,382
at that school
where you learn how to write?

583
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,315
What else?

584
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:58,026
He's back up in the stall
up under the hay.

585
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:01,532
They taught you good.

586
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,491
Come on, you gutless cunts!

587
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:08,911
Grab that nigger!

588
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,375
Come on, Nigger.

589
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:14,253
Come on, boy!

590
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:25,680
They grabbed up a nigger.

591
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,425
Where'd a fucking nigger
come into this?

592
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:29,225
Hooples got him from the livery.

593
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,468
What about Bullock
and the Commissioner?

594
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:33,932
Reckon they're still upstairs.

595
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:37,522
You've told me nothing.
You've added a fucking irrelevancy.

596
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:43,651
It wasn't Hostetler.
It was some little nigger.

597
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:54,451
I'll give you $20
if you'll let me use that as my bedroll.

598
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:58,126
You got a better chance
waking up looking normal.

599
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,421
- Hi, Charlie.
- Is the Nigger General back to camp?

600
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:02,663
Yes, he is.

601
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:05,877
Don't act like you know, Jane,
just 'cause you're already drunk.

602
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:08,341
You are an ignorant cocksucker.

603
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:10,386
He come over winter
when you was gone.

604
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:14,256
- That's ignorant. I met him today.
- Why did you ask about him, Charlie?

605
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:17,266
It looked like
he was gonna get done for.

606
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:19,976
I mean, I couldn't see to be sure.

607
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:26,313
I'm thirsty.

608
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,281
Lie on your back, take aim and piss.

609
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,951
How did I wrong you,
choice gentlemen?

610
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:36,076
You want to start
with me getting draughted...

611
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:38,784
so my cousin
got the fucking confectionery?

612
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,824
And that's why
you're going to vulcanise me?

613
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,331
Shut your fucking mouth!

614
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:49,466
Your cousin, trapped East, allows you
to come here to strike it rich.

615
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,923
- Ain't that so, sir?
- Get him the fuck up!

616
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,886
Get him the fuck up!

617
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:04,479
You stole my look at riches,
you and your fucking monkey cousins!

618
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,399
You motherfucker!

619
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:12,147
- Disperse this riotous assembly!
- Let go of the Nigger General.

620
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:13,815
That monkey just motherfucked me!

621
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:17,689
I'll motherfuck you
and blow your head off.

622
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,044
Cunt!

623
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:44,843
May I please go over
those columns with you?

624
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,476
What is the fucking point
of you going over the columns?

625
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,935
You know the method
of this shit already...

626
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,728
took in probably
at your mother's fucking tit!

627
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,941
God help me for enjoying you out there,
even only to abuse me.

628
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,820
Although I also wouldn't mind
getting fucked.

629
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,861
A last try at twinning these columns,
then you'll have your fucking wish.

630
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,958
The correct answer in each instance
is $127.49.

631
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,789
You fuck.

632
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,187
Good evening, Trixie.

633
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:48,908
I was coming to you once I'd done
these columns and fucked a friend.

634
00:45:54,915 --> 00:45:57,038
Anyone else look in on you today?

635
00:45:58,168 --> 00:46:00,837
I did have another visitor, yes.

636
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:04,412
I'm gonna light a fucking cigarette
in here.

637
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:08,505
- Fuck anyone who doesn't like it!
- Please, do smoke.

638
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,880
Thank you so much.

639
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:18,007
So how'd the other visitor's visit go?

640
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:20,890
I am as we thought.

641
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:23,388
And?

642
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:31,318
And he expects an uneventful course,
though not without difficulties.

643
00:46:31,824 --> 00:46:35,488
- I love how they fucking put it.
- Well, that's my formulation.

644
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,248
Does formulation mean "plan"?

645
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:47,577
My plan...

646
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,789
at the moment, is to watch...

647
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,420
and wait.

648
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,473
I couldn't help noticing, Trixie...

649
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:07,016
you're occupied now
at the hardware store.

650
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:10,817
Yes, Alma, I am.

651
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:15,233
I'm spending time at Bullock and Star's
learning to do accounts.

652
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:18,446
I'm so delighted.

653
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:21,155
Though I'm also fucking
one of the owners.

654
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:22,275
Well...

655
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,321
I'm delighted by that as well.

656
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:31,416
Trixie, can I have a puff
of your cigarette?

657
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:35,837
- You ever smoked before?
- No.

658
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:48,138
Thank you.

659
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:51,975
Sure.

660
00:47:57,861 --> 00:47:59,024
Good night.

661
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:05,652
Congratulations.

662
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:24,297
- Hello, there.
- $127.49...

663
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:27,221
both columns separate, verified.

664
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:31,220
Lying with aplomb.
You've got the true calling.

665
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:35,518
What you heard otherwise
is none of your business.

666
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,554
I didn't hear anything else.

667
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:50,315
Let me work on your column now.

668
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,577
"My own darling wife Agnes...

669
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:02,079
"I have but a few moments left
before this letter starts.

670
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:04,752
"I never was as well in my life.

671
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:08,624
"But you'd laugh to see me now,
as I just got in from prospecting."

672
00:49:09,218 --> 00:49:10,333
He's lying.

673
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:13,547
I'm told he never prospected
a moment of his time in the camp.

674
00:49:13,639 --> 00:49:15,964
We must report him
so he'll be punished.

675
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:19,643
"I am almost sure I will do well here.

676
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:23,561
"We will have a home yet.
Then we will be so happy."

677
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:29,319
He spells like a child.
Sure is spelled S-H-U-R-E.

678
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:34,354
- Is it a very long letter?
- No, as you're about to discover.

679
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:37,360
"Here the man is hurrying me.

680
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:40,323
"I have but a few moments left
before the mail must start.

681
00:49:40,955 --> 00:49:42,698
"Goodbye, my dear wife."

682
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:46,077
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

683
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:48,837
"J.B. Hickok, Wild Bill."

684
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:51,166
Goodbye, Wild Bill.

685
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:57,587
- There's a postscript.
- Is it a very long postscript?

686
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:01,263
"Agnes, darling...

687
00:50:03,017 --> 00:50:05,888
"if such should be
we never meet again...

688
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,477
"while firing my last shot...

689
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:12,389
"I will gently breathe
the name of my wife, Agnes...

690
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:15,358
"and with wishes even for my enemies...

691
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:19,565
"I will make the plunge
and try to swim to the other shore."

692
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:34,371
Are you a man who needs
his trousers rubbed?

693
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:37,249
I am a man...

694
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,674
who needs his trousers taken off.

695
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:46,467
I can do that.

696
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:58,857
Seems to me there's reabsorption
of the haemorrhage.

697
00:51:00,278 --> 00:51:02,436
What the fuck good
is less blood in my eye?

698
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,523
I want use of my fucking limbs.

699
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:05,730
I understand.

700
00:51:05,825 --> 00:51:08,232
I have spent my last day abed hearing...

701
00:51:08,744 --> 00:51:11,151
second-hand news from imbeciles.

702
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:15,784
Strike you as overweening, Al,
setting nature to a schedule?

703
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:18,497
I'm not setting terms for nature.
I'm setting them for myself.

704
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:23,047
Who has dominion over nature?
Al Swearengen, owner and proprietor.

705
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:26,543
As to when he takes his leave,
you're A-one fucking right.

706
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:35,515
Well, I don't understand.

707
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:41,101
Bullock?

708
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,890
Why the fuck do you whisper? Bullock!

709
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:46,684
I could have said you was asleep.

710
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,564
- Doc.
- Sheriff.

711
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:57,446
Pithy and civil.

712
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:08,790
The Commissioner's all right.

713
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:21,058
You wipe the rim of that bottle, I'll
knock you out from my present vantage.

714
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:28,058
They're coming against us.

715
00:52:30,193 --> 00:52:32,233
Post a notice like that...

716
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:36,438
not award even one commissioner
of the three to local citizenry.

717
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,572
I'll guarantee you this, too.

718
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:44,702
Politicians ain't got balls
for this type of unsupported move.

719
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,661
Someone's backing their play.

720
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:51,796
Or they'd be here bending over for us.

721
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:54,831
- Is it Tolliver?
- Tolliver is us.

722
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:59,171
They ain't gonna pick Tolliver over me
this early in the game.

723
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:01,509
I see.

724
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:05,349
There's a nigger
in the fucking woodpile somewhere...

725
00:53:05,601 --> 00:53:08,270
someone from outside the camp.

726
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:11,803
Anyways.

727
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:14,472
That nigger the hooples grabbed,
did they kill him?

728
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,438
- Tarred his shoulder.
- What stopped them at that?

729
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,859
Me.

730
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,981
I get back on my fucking feet...

731
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,616
I'll carry my share of the water.

732
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,123
My money's on you.

733
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,702
Here comes some pain for you.

734
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,884
You ever think of screaming instead of
biting through your own fucking flesh?

735
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:46,803
It's my fucking pain.

736
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:52,262
And I am suggesting
an improved way of dealing with it...

737
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,343
which is how progress occurs.

738
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:57,230
Will you two be quiet?

739
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:03,396
Not only will we not be quiet,
you frog-faced fuck...

740
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:07,611
I'm gonna take this stick...

741
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,701
and drag it back and forth
across the bars of your cell.

742
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:13,905
I am not a prisoner!
I am in protective custody!

743
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:17,247
In care of a deputy
deputised by the Deputy Sheriff...

744
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,574
who orders you to shut the fuck up!

745
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:36,507
- You know Hostetler?
- He runs the livery?

746
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,890
- Taller than me.
- I know him.

747
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:47,057
I'd be glad if he heard
I'd have done just what he did...

748
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:49,606
only quicker.

749
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:53,069
I guess he'll understand that, if I don't.

750
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:57,532
He'll understand.
I'd tell him myself except...

751
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:00,947
I'm keeping indoors tonight.

752
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,993
Here comes some more pain.
