1
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,466
Hi!

2
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:16,670
Listen, I have few certain passions

3
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,232
another is playing "foot-flagon"
and another is...

4
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,581
Is it ok?
-Of course.

5
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,686
Thank you.
How much is it?

6
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:46,116
Nothing at all.
Dinner card covers it all.

7
00:02:56,466 --> 00:03:04,296
Unhanged Ones

8
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:29,327
"For money I'll do anything."

9
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,345
"Closed during renovation."

10
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:46,935
Gonzales, look!

11
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,820
"Office open"

12
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:01,620
It's 10% for me.

13
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:02,973
5%!

14
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:06,368
How much?

15
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,733
Thank you.
-Buy some paper and paint with it.

16
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:42,478
"Wanted Speedy Gonzales
-Alive in the town of Three Coins"

17
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,759
Is this you?

18
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,608
Well, what do you think?

19
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,929
I am the Lonely Rider.

20
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:05,338
Lonely? Don't you use deodorant?

21
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,617
"self service"

22
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,354
I am Tonto, assistento.

23
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:32,527
It's your turn now.

24
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,260
It says alive.
They won't pay for a corpse.

25
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,570
I can't see!

26
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,657
Look!

27
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,914
We did it.

28
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:25,110
I did it.

29
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:44,058
Let's pick up the guns.

30
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,355
Here it is.

31
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:26,055
With this fist I knocked out Gonzales.

32
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:34,036
Or was it so?
-I guess so, can't remember.

33
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,467
Gonzales must be pissed off now.

34
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:49,468
Are you?

35
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:55,470
You won't be smiling anymore
when they hang you, Gonzales.

36
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,553
We love horses and women!

37
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:33,199
Never shall we abandon them!

38
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:49,632
Everything goes just well...

39
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,807
Tonto doesn't suspect anything.

40
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:58,737
And when we get to the town
I'll kill him and take all the money.

41
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,458
You're in good mood.
-You're right.

42
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:08,492
Great...

43
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:13,857
When we get there
I'll chop his head with an axe

44
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:18,605
And I take all the money.

45
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,868
What a pair of idiots.

46
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,439
They do all the work and I'll get the reward.

47
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:35,496
I need to say something friendly
to Tonto so he won't suspect me.

48
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,361
It's a beautiful weather.

49
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:46,433
Really fine.

50
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:52,597
He won't suspect me if I'm friendly to him.

51
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:56,417
I think... oh, it's dazzling.

52
00:12:56,565 --> 00:13:01,823
I'll take a little nightmare after a hard day.

53
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:08,547
Mom, give me my mask!

54
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:12,664
Boys are teasing me!

55
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,778
Boys are teasing me again!

56
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:10,478
Why I have a nose like this?

57
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,638
Tonto, you remembered. Thank you!

58
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:30,114
Oh, wait a moment.

59
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:38,479
Here you are.

60
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,843
Oh my.

61
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,935
Good morning.

62
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,921
Would you like some bread mr Gonzales?

63
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,493
Surely you would like!

64
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:20,458
For me? This is too much.

65
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:24,653
A soft packet too. I'm getting excited.

66
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,069
A party mask.

67
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,122
Polarized.

68
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,424
What's this?

69
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,737
Winter mask.

70
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,019
Thank you very much.

71
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,217
Let's go then.

72
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:58,198
Put out the fire, will you.

73
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:14,590
Oh...

74
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:21,876
You just poured our drinking water there, boy.

75
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:26,917
And we only have 400 miles to travel.

76
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,498
Damn indian!
If we die of thirst, I kill you!

77
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:40,481
I wouldn't shout like that.
This is Indian territory.

78
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:41,870
What?

79
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:46,505
You shut up! I know where the ind...

80
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,899
But now there's a bit inside.

81
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,792
Don't worry. No-one will see it.

82
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:22,014
I just figured out something.

83
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:23,680
What is it?

84
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:31,007
I don't remember it anymore.
-It doesn't matter then.

85
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,533
You have some junk on your back.

86
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:36,600
Take it off then, please.

87
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,693
Thanks.

88
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,883
Where's the rope?

89
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,314
Can you tie me up again?

90
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:53,501
I won't tie you anymore.
Do it yourself!

91
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,507
Yeah, do it yourself!

92
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:59,340
Do you think we have time
to serve you all the time?

93
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,472
Well, I won't do it myself.

94
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,759
Won't you?
-No.

95
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,627
Tying is one thing you can't
expect a prisoner to do.

96
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,919
I got it.

97
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,586
We will sell you a part of you.

98
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,676
What?

99
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:21,230
Look, we'll get 10.000$ when we
get him to town for hanging.

100
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:27,434
And if you promise you won't
escape, we will give you 50$.

101
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:28,435
100$.

102
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:33,019
Let's make it 75$.

103
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,314
It's a deal. I won't escape.

104
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:40,519
But I'll be your guest with full
upkeep for the rest of the journey.

105
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,218
Yes.
-Water!

106
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:48,143
What?
-Water! I'm thirsty.

107
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:59,592
Tonto, you never went to school
so I want to tell you...

108
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:02,084
Look, this here is moraine.

109
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,472
And here's sand and below that comes the silt.

110
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:12,603
Then it's clay. Can you tell
me what comes after that?

111
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:13,822
You don't know?

112
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,299
Groundwater.

113
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,721
I'm thirsty.

114
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:29,924
And guess why?

115
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,256
Because I poured all our water to ground.

116
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:37,653
Right. It must be that.

117
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,110
Tonto!

118
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:10,666
Do you see what I see?
-No.

119
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,718
You see me and I see you.

120
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,665
No, no. There!

121
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:20,024
I use my indian gaze.
-Right!

122
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,797
Well, what do you see?

123
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,506
Two men.
-What else?

124
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:34,225
Water!
-I thought so.

125
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:56,400
Right...

126
00:21:56,436 --> 00:22:02,128
We'll take this water.
It's 3 against 2.

127
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,201
There's only 2 of you.

128
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,734
You're not gonna...
-Well, what do you think?

129
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:14,159
I'm a guest with full upkeep.
Go and get me some water!

130
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:17,158
Ok then...

131
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:25,371
We'll do this nice and easy
without any bloodshed.

132
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:36,464
Tonto, go there with white flag
and give them this.

133
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:40,930
What is it?

134
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,957
It's my business card.

135
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:48,753
It says "Lonely Rider, professional killer".

136
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,630
When they read it they will
surrender immediately.

137
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:21,484
That doesn't look like a white flag
to me. Or what do you think?

138
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,114
I think it's black.

139
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,893
They demand a real white flag.

140
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:40,637
Hey, come on guys!

141
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:46,292
This used to be white.
It's just little bit dirty now.

142
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:50,062
Tell him to wash it.

143
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,546
Wash it!

144
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:59,368
We have no water.
-Come and get it!

145
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:22,294
Excuse me.

146
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,483
Soap.

147
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:42,197
Let's try it.

148
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,267
It's a pretty good now.
We accept it!

149
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,377
Accepted!

150
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,466
I'm Tonto, a messenger.

151
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,447
Read this.

152
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,572
You read the name?
-Yep.

153
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:17,105
Surrender then!

154
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:26,036
It's all clear.
They surrender now!

155
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:29,365
I told you.

156
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,375
Let's go, Silver!

157
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:35,024
I told you.

158
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:52,716
Drop your guns!

159
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:59,511
I got one and my friend has one.
There's 2 of them.

160
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:10,928
You read my card. I'm Lonely Rider.
Hands up!

161
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:18,696
Your pr-man already gave us your ad.
I don't think we have a choice.

162
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,741
On your back!

163
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:24,793
And now we'll drink.

164
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:35,830
No!

165
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:05,180
What are you doing?

166
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,412
Fourteen.

167
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:11,551
We have already traveled 2 weeks now.

168
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:21,988
You don't have any water
to lend, do you?

169
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:26,504
I suddenly became so thirsty.

170
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:33,513
Really, I pay you back.

171
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:41,095
Hey ho, Silver!
So fast pace.

172
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,778
Shut up!

173
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:56,058
I gotta go...
-Again?

174
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,945
I knew it!

175
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,698
Petroleum!

176
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,907
I can still taste the difference.

177
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:44,804
How can you drink that?

178
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,143
We indians like firewater.

179
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:59,562
Tonto, I'm changing the subject but...

180
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:09,552
I can't deny it. Trips like this are
kinda interesting and broadening.

181
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:15,546
Of course, these aren't anything
compared to those package trips.

182
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:26,305
The possibilities to board and
wash are pretty weak for example.

183
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:35,837
But here. If you just let things come to you-

184
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:42,544
you can learn much about nature.
For example, we have seen so much...

185
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:46,583
All kinds of great things.
To name few...

186
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:54,055
I could mention among other things...
That...

187
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,494
Which should I pick first of all those...

188
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:04,663
Well, sand dunes, for example.

189
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:11,420
They've made great impression on me.

190
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:22,268
And the most important thing is
that you meet lots of new people.

191
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:29,841
Yep, that's correct. Very soon we
might meet many new people.

192
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:31,008
What?

193
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:38,816
Well, I have certain feeling.
And I've seen few of them too.

194
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:47,994
Do you mean those with red
faces and feather up here?

195
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:49,912
Right, good description.

196
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:51,555
Tonto!

197
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:54,583
What?

198
00:31:55,777 --> 00:32:01,050
Let's delude them. First some
merry singing and then...

199
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:08,281
Two little elephants were
marching on the sunny road...

200
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:30,418
Well, and you're just sleeping.

201
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,166
Everything went fine.
They all ran away.

202
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:43,430
You just take it easy, boy. We keep
you alive till we get the money.

203
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,988
Damned. It's gone.

204
00:32:56,238 --> 00:33:00,344
Here's wagon trail.
Let's follow it.

205
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:50,597
Damned. Do you know what I expect?

206
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:54,121
-No.
-The worst. Read it.

207
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:32,707
Where are you?
-In the end.

208
00:34:33,336 --> 00:34:36,007
Translate it!

209
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,064
Thanks for the horse.

210
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:51,066
I must confess something.
-What?

211
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,648
I don't get bored with you guys.
-Oh.

212
00:34:57,435 --> 00:35:01,048
That was too much!

213
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:06,083
You gonna walk. You walk!

214
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:10,810
No, I won't.
-You walk or I'll shoot you.

215
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:15,397
You won't shoot me. It's no use.

216
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:17,646
What do you mean?

217
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,414
To me it's all the same if I die
here or in the gallows-

218
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:27,915
-but to you it's not.
You'll get 10.000$ if you bring me there.

219
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:44,989
Well, how much do you want for walking?

220
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:49,404
Let's say 2 cents per step.

221
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:52,679
Do you mean length of the step or price?

222
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,151
Both. Step of 2 centimeter costs 2 cents.

223
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:01,938
You won't rip us off.

224
00:39:37,953 --> 00:39:40,002
What a lively dream.

225
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:42,782
I could hear the purling water.

226
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,230
Let's go!

227
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:21,072
Damn truant!

228
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:24,386
This was the last drop!

229
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:37,026
Last drop here too.
Who the hell drank my water?

230
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,376
Water! What water?

231
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:50,833
Goddammit! Confess!

232
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,486
I mean my petroleum.

233
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,746
What water? Water!

234
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,549
Tell me truth!

235
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,327
You need to press button here to
get water instead of petroleum.

236
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:28,954
Tonto.

237
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:34,637
Forgive me for being so pedantic
because of that water-

238
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:37,077
-but you're making it up now.

239
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,570
Faster!

240
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:57,575
What now? You don't like to travel?

241
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:00,406
Or has someone told you to have a break?

242
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,339
Tonto can't manage anymore.

243
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:12,873
I haven't drank a single
drop of water in 2 hours.

244
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,364
Gosh, I can't believe it.

245
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,478
You haven't drunk for 2 hours?

246
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:22,884
Everyone should splash with water
at least once in every hour.

247
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:27,772
Damn coyote! I haven't drunk in 2 weeks.

248
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,699
Not a drop.

249
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:39,922
So far I've been just
watching as you guys drink.

250
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,952
But now it's gonna change.

251
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:47,357
Now I drink and you will watch.

252
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:56,327
What's this? It's a map!

253
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:59,048
And it's damn accurate.

254
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:03,790
Look! Actually Wild West is just
like land of thousand lakes.

255
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:07,738
Look, this blue here is water, isn't it?

256
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:14,638
And who can navigate will find water.

257
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:17,830
This means one with the map.
And I have one.

258
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:20,515
Sidu, said the swede.

259
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:31,305
That brown here is hill.

260
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,685
It might be that.

261
00:43:34,798 --> 00:43:40,356
And lake is 5 miles that way.

262
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:42,250
Sidu.

263
00:43:43,728 --> 00:43:46,091
Have a break.

264
00:43:56,677 --> 00:44:01,424
And not much of summer camping
around the shores either.

265
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:05,574
Why don't you play some
hide and seek while I'm gone.

266
00:44:13,427 --> 00:44:15,438
I'm going swimming now.

267
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:20,112
I might sip some water too.

268
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:46,255
Here it is. Very accurate map.

269
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:52,038
Lake is just behind this knoll.

270
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:59,247
I'll just take off my clothes
and then it's bath time.

271
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:56,781
Scarf.

272
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,101
Still...

273
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:22,463
Map was right. Looks like a low tide.

274
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,237
It doesn't matter. I'm not that
good swimmer anyhow.

275
00:46:26,711 --> 00:46:29,738
I can practise.

276
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:42,685
It's damn good place to float.

277
00:47:01,205 --> 00:47:07,292
Who has a hollow head?
His name is Tonto.

278
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:36,156
Do you have any water?
-No.

279
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:38,495
Throw it away then.

280
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:42,461
Let's take a match.
-What match?

281
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:47,582
Foot-flagon match.
-Yes, let's play.

282
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:52,085
Here's the goal line.
-Right.

283
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,855
You remember? It's not allowed...
-Yes. I'll start.

284
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:15,004
Go away! what are you doing?
Gonzales!

285
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:17,966
Go away!
-I wanna play.

286
00:48:18,193 --> 00:48:21,519
Gonzales! Stop! Stop!

287
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:25,261
Go away! You can't play with us.

288
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:30,214
Let me play. I used to play in
commercial school's team.

289
00:48:30,214 --> 00:48:31,832
Dont lie to me.
-No. Really.

290
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,492
But you can't play with our flagon.

291
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:42,931
If I can play foot-flagon,
I'll get sip of water for both.

292
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:44,211
Is it a deal?

293
00:48:44,816 --> 00:48:47,998
Of course you can play!
-But...

294
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:49,670
Wait!

295
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:53,320
Water first, then game.

296
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,395
Thus it is.
-Ok.

297
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:31,973
Water!

298
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:34,880
There's a shower for both.

299
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,951
Sit down!

300
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:39,139
It's a mirage.

301
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:40,651
What's that?

302
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,649
Mirage. It's a scientific thing.

303
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:50,570
Do you know what science is?

304
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:58,067
It's like a... ray of light.

305
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:02,434
It goes like... Do you know prism?

306
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:04,711
Do you know it?

307
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:09,556
Ray of light comes downward.

308
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:14,151
And then there's solar prominence.

309
00:50:14,709 --> 00:50:17,130
Sit down on your arse!
It's a mirage.

310
00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:21,048
Let's look elsewhere for a moment
and it will go away. Look!

311
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:24,463
There's a bird.

312
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,491
Water!

313
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:52,772
I didn't get water.

314
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:24,005
Hey!

315
00:51:24,509 --> 00:51:26,397
Hey, woman.

316
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,241
What?
-There's a woman. Look!

317
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,067
What's that?

318
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:36,370
Oh, is it like one with boobs?
-Yes. Look!

319
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:51,945
Hello.

320
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:58,063
How's your trip going?

321
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:05,180
If I can say so, green really
looks good on you, miss.

322
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:15,534
I'm the Lonely Ridder.

323
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:33,069
Well, how's your trip going?

324
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:40,990
I must say, this color
looks good on you.

325
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:45,083
I'm Lonely Rider.

326
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:46,972
Hello.

327
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:49,694
Gonzales.
-Margareta.

328
00:52:51,146 --> 00:52:55,300
I must apologize as my
friend is in such state.

329
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:59,890
Has he been drinking?
-No, on the contrary.

330
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:05,504
Futhermore I'm very handy with the pistol...

331
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:13,312
Horses are very important to me.
When I was 3 years old my parents...

332
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:15,185
Hello there.

333
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:19,814
They put me first time on the back
of Silver. And that was the start.

334
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,687
Can I propose you to come with me?

335
00:53:24,793 --> 00:53:26,653
Feisty girl.

336
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:33,350
My parents said I'm gonna be a brisk man.

337
00:53:36,095 --> 00:53:37,900
Be quiet, I'm Tonto.

338
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:41,404
Damn. Are you trying to
come between us? What?

339
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:52,403
It's a...

340
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,314
It's been lovely weather.
-Yes.

341
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:13,268
You know miss...

342
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:18,260
Gonzales doesn't seem to be
much of womanizer either.

343
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,429
That style won't work for sure.

344
00:54:23,165 --> 00:54:25,943
How did it go?

345
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:36,898
I'm the Lonely Rider.

346
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:43,142
Womanizer.

347
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:46,567
Hello dear.

348
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:51,106
You can roll it here with finger.
And again.

349
00:54:52,045 --> 00:54:54,080
And other way around too.

350
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:59,475
It's a nice spur, isn't it.
-Really nice.

351
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:05,085
I can put it back and walk around.
It will make nice jingle.

352
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:09,035
Now it's good.

353
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:26,670
This man is criminal. Beat it!
Beat it, I say!

354
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:35,841
Hello.

355
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:41,239
Where are you traveling?

356
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,174
To Njetponimaj-stad
-Njetponimaj-stad.

357
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,430
It's a long journey, girl.

358
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:51,083
We came from there.
Four week travel.

359
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:56,868
No, one day walk.
-One day? What?

360
00:55:57,483 --> 00:56:00,256
It's one day walk.

361
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,356
Right, right.

362
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,413
We have to transport and
take care of this prisoner...

363
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:13,376
When man is a criminal, he's a criminal.
It's so hard and takes a lot of time.

364
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,992
One day walk? Right.

365
00:56:19,317 --> 00:56:23,064
I'm the man of straight action.

366
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:26,204
So let's move on to business.

367
00:56:27,571 --> 00:56:30,446
What's your name, miss?
-Margareta.

368
00:56:30,698 --> 00:56:33,483
No, I mean surname.
-Smith.

369
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:37,675
Right, in that case I propose
you to come with me-

370
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,224
-to the alders to cool off.

371
00:56:50,668 --> 00:56:52,928
Goddammit!

372
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:57,358
You a very pretty girl.
You're good to Tonto's old eye.

373
00:56:59,203 --> 00:57:03,289
You look ahead in life.
I'm a rich man.

374
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,943
Boy just tries there.

375
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:12,449
But we had everything settled.
how about going to the alders?

376
00:57:13,011 --> 00:57:16,520
I give you many presents.

377
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,869
You won't get away with
this without a duel.

378
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:27,618
You.

379
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:32,004
If I don't return alive,
will you wait for me here?

380
00:57:32,722 --> 00:57:36,306
I mean... well, you got the point.

381
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,335
10 paces, turn and shoot.

382
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:47,075
Now!

383
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:04,873
Did you say: first 10 paces and then turning?

384
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:08,746
Or was it vice versa?

385
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:14,063
Listen, it doesn't matter anymore.

386
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:23,119
Here you are.
-Thank you so much.

387
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:31,287
I got to go now, boys.
I have a violin lesson tomorrow.

388
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,256
There's no more water.

389
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:25,515
Hey.

390
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,483
Gonzales.

391
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,899
Life's a like circuit.

392
01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:46,653
One day one man drinks and
on other day others drink.

393
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:49,267
And today the others drink.

394
01:00:56,716 --> 01:00:58,993
We just go for little drink.

395
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:04,578
Lest you won't get bored in the
meantime why don't you dodge these.

396
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,398
Tonto.

397
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:38,843
Do you remember when
I told you about mirage?

398
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:44,543
It's a scientific thing...
-Yes, yes. I know.

399
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:50,070
But the most important thing is
that Gonzales must not know.

400
01:02:17,089 --> 01:02:20,009
One, two, three.

401
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:23,958
Did you notice that guys drank water.

402
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:27,713
And it tasted like a nectar.

403
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:36,976
Did you notice that guys drank water.
And it tasted like a nectar.

404
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,732
And then we go.

405
01:03:14,315 --> 01:03:18,691
Can you move away?
You're blocking the sun.

406
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,982
Goddammit!

407
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:52,658
Are you sure it was "alive"?
-Yes it was.

408
01:03:53,739 --> 01:03:59,048
They don't pay for dead?
-I don't know.

409
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:02,886
But if we take the chance.

410
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,251
Right, it was "alive" after all.

411
01:04:49,503 --> 01:04:52,339
Look, what the hell I got.

412
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:55,872
I have similar.

413
01:04:57,491 --> 01:05:03,035
I grabbed a girl from the throat
that way. I'm so shamed.

414
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:10,645
Actually we are very popular among women.

415
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:14,873
They have invited us to their
home for coffee many times.

416
01:05:18,202 --> 01:05:23,146
What a lovely place. Let's sit there.

417
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:27,047
Yes, as it looks like we can't
find suitable alder forest-

418
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:32,744
-maybe we can camp here,
make fire and eat some lunch.

419
01:05:32,745 --> 01:05:36,709
And we can arrange some show.

420
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:38,920
Let's go here.

421
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:43,842
Let's lounge here.

422
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:50,211
Sitting is another option too, of course.

423
01:05:52,187 --> 01:05:54,837
Let's change places.

424
01:05:54,837 --> 01:05:58,289
We already made some pairing.

425
01:06:02,617 --> 01:06:03,559
Just a moment.

426
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:09,977
Oh, you don't have any water by chance?

427
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:11,515
Forget it.

428
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:24,614
Now as we have pairs we
don't have to compete.

429
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:26,372
Let's just praise each other. Yes?

430
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:32,657
And then let's arrange some show.
And after that...

431
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:45,032
Ladies. To liften up the moody atmosphere
we have decided to arrange a little show.

432
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:49,894
So, great Indian chief, Tonto. Who,
by the way, is very good friend of mine-

433
01:06:49,895 --> 01:06:54,197
-will perform us his very funny
and talented rain dance number.

434
01:06:54,198 --> 01:06:56,834
Tonto, please.

435
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:09,877
I must say, you indians are so
much better in sports than us white.

436
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:12,183
You have the rhythm in your blood.

437
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:17,764
Faster pace!

438
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,310
Thank you.

439
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:34,838
And next my lonely friend.

440
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:38,837
Sing us a song!
-No, I won't...

441
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:39,838
He's a big star.

442
01:07:40,439 --> 01:07:42,150
Would you like to hear?
-Yes.

443
01:07:42,322 --> 01:07:45,160
Maybe I then...

444
01:07:46,624 --> 01:07:48,077
I could sing one song.

445
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,873
Can you give me little rhythm?

446
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:54,582
And now!

447
01:07:57,522 --> 01:08:03,960
Lonely avenger, he went to avenge.
From the Rio Grande, Ohio.

448
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:07,701
And his horse was called
Papu-Rikko-Reino.

449
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:17,127
And he traveled towards
the Mexico. And there he...

450
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:25,362
And he went to back of Mexico
where came kiss, kisses...

451
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:26,576
Lyrics...

452
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:33,628
And his horse was indeed
this Papu-Rikko-Reino.

453
01:08:33,629 --> 01:08:36,702
Horse with really strange pace.

454
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:43,126
And he has a woman in every port.
Indian girls were crazy about him.

455
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:50,616
Lyrics...

456
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:57,835
It didn't went as good as like once
in that place, you remember?

457
01:08:57,836 --> 01:08:59,300
Yes. Yes.

458
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:21,026
Were you talking about me?
-No...

459
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:25,831
What was so funny then?
-I only told a funny story.

460
01:09:27,486 --> 01:09:29,711
What story?

461
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:34,133
Well... It's not that good...

462
01:09:40,742 --> 01:09:49,507
Now as we have cosy ambiance,
we could start what we agreed, Tonto.

463
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:58,010
Well, good night then.

464
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:18,028
Get up, Gonzales!

465
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:23,657
You just sleep here but we
were with girls. What a night!

466
01:10:24,997 --> 01:10:28,902
We ate and drink. There was
water and dancing and singing.

467
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:31,516
But then we got lost.

468
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,164
You haven't seen two indian
girls around here?

469
01:10:50,752 --> 01:10:52,473
Let's try again.

470
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,472
Hell with it!

471
01:11:11,908 --> 01:11:14,947
Gonzales, get to the wagon!
We leave now.

472
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:28,524
Stop. I come a board.

473
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:17,940
No we walk...
-Except me.

474
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:24,805
Get to the wagon.

475
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,662
You mean you're not gonna walk?
-No.

476
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,991
It's your decision.

477
01:14:08,452 --> 01:14:12,614
Yeah, you just sit there, mister.
But we go again.

478
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:22,659
Stop! Stop! Damned!
-What?

479
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:32,521
Allright, damned. I'll walk.

480
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:58,902
I hear as if water splashing.

481
01:17:00,189 --> 01:17:04,209
Tonto, so do I.

482
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:11,879
My friend, sit down here and wait,
please. I'll go and check it.

483
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:46,134
Tonto!
-What?

484
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:52,456
You hear alright. There's water.
Come!

485
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,838
Could it be real?

486
01:18:30,014 --> 01:18:32,636
Sounds right at least.

487
01:18:41,069 --> 01:18:49,668
Reflection...
It's a beautiful phenomen.

488
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:57,805
You Tonto, as a uneducated
person don't fully understand-

489
01:18:57,806 --> 01:19:01,862
-what reflection is, for examle.

490
01:19:04,247 --> 01:19:09,207
I can tell you this though...

491
01:19:09,932 --> 01:19:16,052
that it's caused by gravity.

492
01:19:17,695 --> 01:19:20,083
Reflection...

493
01:19:23,436 --> 01:19:27,103
Goddammit! I won't spoil my good thirst!

494
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:30,591
One, two, three!

495
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:37,849
To the saloon, to the saloon!

496
01:19:41,303 --> 01:19:44,503
Gonzales, come for hanging.

497
01:19:45,535 --> 01:19:49,604

gallows to be hanged.

498
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:26,024
Sheriff. We... prisno, prisoner...

499
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:28,616
Sheriff?
-Yep.

500
01:20:29,949 --> 01:20:32,721
Aren't you a bartender?

501
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:41,541
Oh, you noticed?
You really noticed?

502
01:20:40,684 --> 01:20:42,963
What a clever boy.

503
01:20:43,473 --> 01:20:48,237
Damned! I'm also clerical officer,
pimp, vicar and the midwife.

504
01:20:48,478 --> 01:20:50,106
Is it enough?

505
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,360
Ok, the sheriff of town of Three Coins.
-What?

506
01:20:58,361 --> 01:21:00,791
Sheriff of the Town of Three Coins.

507
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:04,381
No, it's not.
This is Njetponimaj-stad.

508
01:21:04,523 --> 01:21:09,912
Yes, it is. 6 weeks ago we left Njetponimaj-stad.
Now we are in town of Three Coins.

509
01:21:09,913 --> 01:21:13,164
Don't talk bullshit. I oughta know.

510
01:21:14,764 --> 01:21:17,671
Bloody hell...

511
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,218
Have we traveled in circles for 6 weeks?

512
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:24,577
What the hell it's to you?

513
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:28,639
It's our finann-cial loss.

514
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:33,050
You might think so.
I just lost 10.000 $.

515
01:21:33,051 --> 01:21:34,181
What do you mean?

516
01:21:34,827 --> 01:21:38,182
Those 2 are wanted with that
price in town of Three Coins

517
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,199
Wait a moment, sheriff.
This is all sucks...

518
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:43,367
That's just funny.

519
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:47,074
And you're wanted for 10.000$.
It makes 20.000$ in all.

520
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,596
Dammit! Everyone against the wall! 

521
01:21:51,216 --> 01:21:55,423
Listen, sheriff. I'm not wanted man.
-Really?

522
01:21:58,871 --> 01:22:00,830
What's this then?

523
01:22:03,771 --> 01:22:06,153
I made that poster myself.

524
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,716
Self-made? Really?

525
01:22:22,155 --> 01:22:25,734
We go to the gallows now.
And I take the reward.

526
01:22:27,788 --> 01:22:30,610
Aren't you pissed off?

527
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:03,309
