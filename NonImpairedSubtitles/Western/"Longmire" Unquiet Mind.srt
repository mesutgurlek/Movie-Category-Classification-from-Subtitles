00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:33,394
Our policy is caution
and common sense.

327
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:36,430
Wayne and his buddies have
an arsenal and a vehicle.

328
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:37,832
I have two agents dead.

329
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,234
I will not send more people
in harm's way.

330
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,136
Come on. Let's just get
some snowmobiles up there.

331
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,439
They would hear you coming
a mile away, deputy Ferguson.

332
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,742
Burke: Y'all should
just let Wayne be, man.

333
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,377
Y'all know how his eye
got messed up?

334

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,179
Towson: Okay, look,

336
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,881
if your sheriff knows
what he's doing,

337
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,182
he will see the foolishness

338
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,118
of walking
into the teeth of this storm

339
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,487
and he will turn back
or he will take shelter.

340
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,088
If we're not gonna do anything,

341
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:02,990
can we at least try and figure
out what Walt is walking into?

342
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,393
I mean, it seems pretty obvious
that this was a setup.

343

Really? You think?

344
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,031
What have you learned about
the cook and the waitress?

345
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,966
Cook has a record for assault.

346
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,100
Waitress is clean.

347
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,568
What about your guards?

348
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,004
We vet all our contractors
fully.

349
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,307
Okay, well, this freak, Wayne...
he killed people

350
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,409
and sold their body parts,
which means money,

351
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,945
which means that he could have
paid for his freedom.

352
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:25,212
Who needs the money?

353
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,481
What about your Dr. Brooks?

with our thumbs up our...

357

Agent Towson has
the final call here.

It's our job to support him.

you're gonna tell Cady

You shouldn't sneak up on me

I expected someone else
to answer the door.

That saddle got anything to do

00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:23,898
with the horse trailer
out in the parking lot?

385
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,268

can see the young hero

Nobody's gonna see this, Henry.

I'm pretty sure you're not gonna
tell anybody about it.

There will be nothing to tell.

399
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,077
I saw two horses
in that trailer.

400
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:13,214
One horse is for the sheriff.

Right now, I <i>am</i> the sheriff.

It's alright Helen,
take your time.

When the snowcat was headed up
the Mountain

00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:29,053
and the convicts
were starting to argue,

he wanted to go higher up.

407
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:36,260
Finally, that guy Wayne
just stopped the snowcat

408
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:40,231
and forced another guy out,
and he took me as a hostage.

409
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,134
I just want to go home.

You're safe now.

I'm fine.

415
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,549
You must be the first hostage

that ever had time to grab
warm boots and a coat.

So, y was the leader, Wayne,
so nice to you?

Give you time to get dressed
for the elements.

but he doesn't strike me
as a gentleman.

421
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:18,869
In fact, between that coat
on your back...

422
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,838
And this,

423
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:21,972

we're all traipsing around
these woods.

You helped Wayne escape.

a future together,

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,865
a better life, and we will.

431
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,067
I don't see that happening,
Helen.

432
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:54,204
That's because you don't
understand Wayne...

433
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:56,974
Not like I do.

434
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:03,314
We met a year ago
at the prison.

435
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:05,716
I brought in dogs for therapy

436
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:08,953
to help rehabilitate
the prison population,

437
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,422
and he was so good
with the animals.

438
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,095
Wayne told me that he would be
transported through here,

439
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:21,298
and this was our chance
to be together,

440
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:25,302
the way we were meant to be.

441
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,239
So I moved up here
four months ago

442
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,775
and got a job at the diner.

443

He doesn't love you, Helen.

444

All he cares about is himself,

00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:39,249
or he wouldn't have
left you behind.

446

That psychiatrist
turned him against me.

447
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:51,662
But he'll get rid of her
and come back for me.

If I tell you,

454
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:16,920
you'll go after him,
and he'll kill you.
