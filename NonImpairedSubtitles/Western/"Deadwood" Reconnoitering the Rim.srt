Ellsworth:
 <i>HE'S DOWN THAT HOLE</i>
 <i>FOR A FACT.</i>

3
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,801
PITIFUL AS
YOU PURSUED IT,

4
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,067
YOU BETTER HOPE
HE AIN'T GOT SPACE ENOUGH

5
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,934
TO ROLL AROUND
HOLDING HIS SIDE,
AND BUST A GUT LAUGHING...

6
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:58,901
TELL ALL THE OTHER
WOODCHUCKS AT THE CLUB
THIS AFTERNOON.

7
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,033
HE MIGHT NOT EVEN
CALL IT AN ESCAPE.

8
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:07,667
MIGHT JUST CALL IT
HIS "MORNING'S ENTERTAINMENT."

9
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:11,601
Dan:
 <i>HEY!</i>  HEY, ELLSWORTH!

THE GREAT PROSPECTOR?

I GUESS BROM
SLEPT IN THIS MORNING.

14
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:24,234
SUPPOSE HIS ENTHUSIASM'S
ON THE WANE?

15

 <i>THAT'S ALWAYS</i>
 <i>POSSIBLE.</i>

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,367
HE SHOWS UP, YOU TELL HIM
I QUIT WAITIN'.

17
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,200
- SURE WILL.
- SEE YA AT THE GEM.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,133
ALWAYS POSSIBLE.

MY READERS,

HOW LONG YOU BEEN
HATCHING THIS?

63
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,901
I MADE A PRACTICAL
GODDAMN BUSINESS DECISION.

NO CHANCE
FOR ME TO MATCH
THEIR FUCKING OFFER?

65

YOU COULDN'T HAVE.

00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,634

THE DEALER DRAWS...

TRENCH MOUTH.
OPENER BETS.

EVEN A STOPPED CLOCK'S
GOTTA BE RIGHT SOMETIME.

78
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,000
COMMON LAW
JUST SAYS YOU GONNA
WIN ONE SOONER OR LATER.

 <i>BUT I'M GONNA KEEP</i>
 <i>PUSHIN' MY LUCK.</i>

$8.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,434
ARE YOU READY
TO STAND ANY MORE CREDIT
TO WILD BILL, TOM?

82
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:38,634
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM
ASK FOR ANY.

83
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,234
YOU WANT ME TO JUST
BET EIGHT, BILL?

84
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,934
COVER MY CALL.

85
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,534
AW, BILL, I CAN'T
LET YOU PUT YOUR GUN UP.

86
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:56,100
THAT COLT'S WORTH
MORE THAN MY RAISE
BY A GOOD 40 BUCKS.

87
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,200
- ARE YOU TAKIN' THE BET?
- I TELL YOU WHAT,

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,834
I'LL ADD
40 BUCKS TO MY RAISE,
TO MAKE THE BET FAIR.

89
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,667
AND THEN 50 MORE,

90
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,601
IF YOU'LL
PUT UP A SET.

91
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,667
( laughs )

92
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,300
POT'S RIGHT.

93
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,567
WOULD A NINE-HIGH STRAIGHT
DO THE TRICK?

94
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,434
POT TO
THE CLUB FLUSH.

95
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:42,667
WELL, THAT'S ONE IN A ROW
FOR YOU, WILD BILL.

96
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,567
WHO'S HUNGRY?

97
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,701
WHAT IN THE HELL DAMN
TIME IS IT ANYWAY?

98
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,334
SURE YOU WANNA
QUIT PLAYING, JACK?

99
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,834
THE GAME'S ALWAYS
BETWEEN YOU AND GETTING
CALLED A CUNT.

100
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,334
MEETING ADJOURNED, FELLAS,
TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

101
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,367
THAT DROPPED EYE
OF YOURS

102
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,367
LOOKS LIKE THE HOOD
ON A CUNT TO ME, JACK.

103
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:05,868
WHEN YOU TALK,
YOUR MOUTH LOOKS LIKE
A CUNT MOVING.

104
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,801
I AIN'T GONNA GET
IN NO GUNFIGHT
WITH YOU, HICKOK.

105
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:11,667
BUT YOU WILL RUN
YOURCUNT MOUTHAT ME...

106
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,033
AND I WILL TAKE IT
TO PLAY POKER.

107
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:21,400
Tom:
 <i>I'LL TOTE UP ACCOUNTS,</i>
 <i>MR. HICKOK.</i>

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,968
WE'LL DO WHATEVER
BUSINESS WE NEED TO
NEXT YOU'RE IN.

109
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:28,501
ANYONE WANTS TO,
CAN FIND ME AT
THE GRAND CENTRAL.

110
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,300
- Jane: <i>SHE'S WARM, ISN'T SHE?</i>
- Charlie: <i>SHE AIN'T TALK YET,</i>
 <i> NEITHER.</i>

111
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,501
THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT,
YOU SHUT UP!

112
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,834
SHE WILL GET A FEVER,
BEIN' WOLF BIT.

113
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,400
THE REASON WE RISKED
BRINGIN' HER INTO CAMP.

114
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,567
YOU DON'T NEED TO FEAR
THE SALOONKEEPER.

115
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,234
- HE'S NOT A DANGER
TO HER NO MORE.
- HE'S NOT?

116
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:55,801
SALOONKEEPER WORRIED
THAT THE LITTLE ONE

117
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,133
SAID ROAD AGENTS
KILLED HER PEOPLE--

118
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,534
WHO THE ROAD AGENTS
MIGHT SAY THEY WORKED FOR.

119
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:02,801
MEANING HIM?

120
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:06,234
HE TOOK A DIFFERENT
APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM.

121
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,067
SHE WOULD
DO BETTER INDOORS.

122
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:12,601
I TOLD JANE SHE COULD
TAKE MY ROOM WITH
THE LITTLE ONE,

123
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,367
AND I'D MOVE
BACK IN WITH BILL.

124
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,634
I WILL NOT STAY
IN NO FUCKIN' HOTEL!
THEY WON'T GIVE ME A ROOM!

125
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,434
YOU TWO KEEP
YOUR VOICES DOWN.

126
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,534
WHAT'D I SAY
ABOUT NOISE?

127
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:37,200
HE SNORES THE WHOLE
FUCKIN' NIGHT!

128
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,801
SNORING'S PAST
A PERSON'S CONTROL.

129
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,934
I WAS A FIELD NURSE
DURING THE WAR,

130
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,667
AT SHILOH
AND SECOND MANASSAS.

131
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,133
THAT WAS
A GOOD DEAL
OF VIOLENCE.

132
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,634
IS THAT WHEN YOU
GOT YOUR CALLING?

133
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:55,033
YES, IT WAS, SIR.
OUT OF THAT CRUCIBLE--

134
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,367
OUT OF ALL THAT HORROR,
TO COME TO GOD'S GRACE.

135
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,400
A MAN'S HEART
DEVISETH HIS WAY,

136
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,634
BUT THE LORD
DIRECTETH HIS STEPS.

137
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,133
HE DIRECTETH
ALL OUR STEPS,
MR. BULLOCK.

138
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,133
ALL OF US.

139
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,200
IF YOU'RE PREACHING
AT ME, REVEREND,

140
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,934
YOU NEED
TO PUT SOME MORE
LIGHT ON THE TEXT.

141
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:18,367
IF I AM
PREACHING AT YOU, SIR,
I DO YOU A DISSERVICE.

142
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,701
GOOD MORNING,
MR. STAR.

143
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,434
GOOD MORNING,
REVEREND.

144
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,801
Seth:
DID WE GET THE LOT?
CAN WE START BUILDING?

145
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:27,601
- THE REVEREND'S COME TO HELP.
- WE'RE STILL HANGIN' FIRE.

146
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,634
- WHAT'S THE DAMN HOLDUP?
- NEW GAMBLING OUTFIT
COME INTO TOWN.

147
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,801
- TIME WASN'T RIGHT
TO PUSH HIM TO A DECISION.
- I GOT ALL THE LUMBER CUT.

148
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,067
- AND I WARNED YOU
THAT WAS PREMATURE.
- YOU SAID 98%

149
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,868
AFTER YOUR LAST CONVERSATION
WITH THAT SON OF A BITCH.

150
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:42,033
98 IS NOT 100.

151
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,167
GOD DAMN IT!

152
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,501
- GOOD DAY, SIRS.
- Sol: <i>GOOD DAY, REVEREND.</i>

153
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,367
Jane:
 <i>I SAID THEY'D FIND</i>
 <i>A WAY TO STOP ME.</i>

154
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,334
IF IT'S RAISING ROOM RATES,
YOU HAVE TO GO AHEAD
AND RAISE 'EM.

155
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,701
RATES AREN'T THE ONLY FACTOR.
THERE'S A WAITING LIST
FOR OCCUPANCY.

156
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,734
YOU UNDERTAKER-LOOKING
SON OF A BITCH.

157
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:04,334
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S DOCTOR
ORDERED HER TO LIVE INDOORS,

158
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,567
AND I'M ASSIGNED
TO CHANGE HER DRESSINGS!

159
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,534
A SAD STORY, THAT'S NONE
OF MY AFFAIR, "MADAM,"

160
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,234
IF I GUESS
YOUR SEX CORRECT.

161
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,501
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
INNKEEPER?

162
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,033
MR. HICKOK.

163
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,701
LITTLE ONE TOOK
FEVER IN THAT WAGON
LAST NIGHT, BILL.

164
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,200
AND I THOUGHT JANE AND HER
COULD STAY IN MY ROOM

165
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,968
AND I'D MOVE
BACK IN WITH YOU.

166
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:25,534
E.B.:
 <i>I'M NOT IN OPPOSITION, SIR.</i>
 <i>JUST THE OPPOSITE.</i>

167
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:27,901
WHO WOULDN'T
WANT TO ACCOMMODATE
A SICK GIRL?

168
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,133
BUT THE SIMPSON HOTEL'S
CLOSED ITS DOORS.

169
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,000
IF MR. UTTER'S VACATING,

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,467
SHOULDN'T THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
BEEN TRYING ME ALL MORNING
GET FIRST CALL?

171
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,400
ISN'T THAT
SIMPLE FAIRNESS?

172
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,667
HE DON'T GIVE
FUCK ALL FOR FAIRNESS!
HE JUST DON'T WANT ME IN HERE.

173
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,667
HOW 'BOUT IF
HE STAYS IN HIS ROOM

174
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,367
AND THE LADY
MOVES IN WITH ME?

175
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,501
 <i>THAT WAY NO ONE'S</i>
 <i>VACATING NOTHING.</i>

176
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,133
THAT WOULD OUTFLANK
THE CHECKOUT ISSUE.

177
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,167
BUT IT MIGHT RAISE
QUESTIONS OF DECORUM.

178
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,901
- WITH WHO?
- NO ONE OF CONSEQUENCE,
I SUPPOSE.

179
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,701
LET HER IN.

180
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,834
 <i>I'M GOING TO GET</i>
 <i>SOME BREAKFAST.</i>

181
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,801
THERE WILL BE
A RATE ADJUSTMENT!

182
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,367
GOOD MORNING.

183
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,534
I'VE HEARD THE STORIES, MADAM,
I TELL YOU THAT AT FLAGFALL.

184
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,968
YOU ARE HERE
ON SUFFERANCE.

185
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,067
KISS MY ASS!

186
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,567
COCKSUCKERS.

187
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,601
WHERE WERE THEY
WHEN DAN AND ME WERE

188
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,601
CHOPPING TREES
IN THIS GULCH?

189
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,200
HANDS ALL BLISTERED,

190
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,300
BUCKTOOTH FUCKING BEAVERS
ROLLING AROUND IN THE CREEK,

191
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,434
SLAPPING THEIR TAILS
IN THE WATER

192
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,934
LIKE WE WAS HIRED
ENTERTAINMENT.

193
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,400
I'D HAVE PAID A NICKEL
TO SEE YOU CHOPPING WOOD.

194
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,200
YEAH.
DON'T THINK I WASN'T
BLOW FOR BLOW WITH DAN.

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,100
I CAN PLAY THAT SHIT
WHEN I HAVE TO.

196
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,100
BUT I'VE BEEN
TO CHICAGO TOO.

197
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,267
HOW DO I LOOK?

198
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,868
LIKE CHRIST CRUCIFIED.

199
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,868
Al:
 <i>GUESS THIS AIN'T</i>
 <i>A HOTEL NO MORE.</i>

200
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,367
COME SEE US TONIGHT
WHEN WE OPEN,

201
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,667
WE'LL FIND YOU
A PLACE TO LAY DOWN.

202
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,868
AND SOMEONE TO KEEP
YOUR FEET WARM.

203
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,567
I'M AL SWEARENGEN.
I OWN THE JOINT
ACROSS THE STREET.

204
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,701
- Man: <i>THE GEM?</i>
- THAT'S IT.

205
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:24,968
CY TOLLIVER, AL.

206
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,767
ED SAWYER,
JOANIE STUBBS.

207
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,934
YOU PEOPLE MUST'VE
TRAINED WITH THE HEATHENS.

208
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,868
YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU COME UP
ON US UNBEKNOWNST.

209
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,767
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
IN CAMP, AL?

210
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,934
THIS YEAR, SINCE MARCH.
I WAS HERE LAST YEAR TOO,

211
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,834
BUT THE FUCKING CAVALRY
DROVE US OUT.

212
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,968
PUT ALL THE WHITES OUT,
DIDN'T THEY?

213
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:46,334
DEEP FUCKING THINKERS
IN WASHINGTON PUT FORWARD
THAT POLICY.

214
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,434
THIS YEAR THOUGH, SO MANY
SOLDIERS DESERTING TO PROSPECT,

215
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,701
GAVE UP THE GHOST,
LET US ALL BACK IN.

216
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:54,133
AND OF COURSE,
CUSTER SORTED OUT
THE SIOUX FOR US,

217
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,601
SO NOW WE'RE ALL AS SAFE
AS AT OUR MOTHERS' TITS.

218
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,834
DID A JOB FOR OUR SIDE,
DIDN'T HE, AL?

219
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,467
Al:
HOW ABOUT THAT LONG-HAIRED
FUCKING BLOWHARD, HUH?

220
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,667
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, SON,
YOU CAN MARK MY WORDS,

221
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,567
CRAZY HORSE WENT
INTO LITTLE BIGHORN,

222
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,968
BOUGHT HIS PEOPLE ONE GOOD,
LONG-TERM ASS FUCKING.

223
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:10,601
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE
A DIRT-WORSHIPPING HEATHEN

224
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,501
FROM THIS FUCKING
POINT FORWARD.

225
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,501
- PARDON MY FRENCH.
- OH, I SPEAK FRENCH.

226
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,834
WELL, HERE WE ARE,
SETTLING THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS.

227
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:24,834
AND I'VE BEEN WONDERING, CY,
UM, PERHAPS WE SHOULD

228
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,968
TALK ABOUT
OUR AREAS OF OVERLAP

229
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:29,033
SO WE'RE NOT
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

230
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,667
- GIVE ME
A FOR INSTANCE, AL.
- UH, WOMEN.

231
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,667
WOULD WE WANT
TO AGREE ON RATES?

232
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,601
WELL, FAR AS PUSSY, AL,
WE'LL WANT TO LET THE MARKET
SORT ITSELF OUT.

233
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:41,167
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE I'M
UP AGAINST SPECIALTY ACTS.

234
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:44,234
HOW ABOUT TABLE GAMES?
ANY OVERLAP THERE?

235
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,434
WE'LL BE FEATURING
CRAPS, AL.

236
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,267
 <i>I PLAYED THAT</i>
 <i>IN CHICAGO.</i>

237
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:49,601
I DON'T
OFFER IT MYSELF,

238
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,934
GETS THESE HOOPLE-HEADS
CONFUSED, HMM?

239
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,901
THAT'S ONE AREA
OF OVERLAP AVOIDED.

240
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,000
- WHAT ABOUT FARO?
- WE'LL HAVE IT.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,801
 <i>THAT DECISION</i>
 <i>HARD AND FAST?</i>

242
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,934
I DON'T SEE OVERLAP
BEING A PROBLEM, AL,
EVEN WHERE WE DUPLICATE.

243
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,200
WE'RE OFFERING
DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERES.

244
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,601
YOU'RE A PIONEERING TYPE,
A TRAILBLAZER TYPE.

245
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,834
YOU'RE GONNA DRAW
A TRAILBLAZING ELEMENT.

246
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,067
MEANING I GET THE ONES
THAT DON'T WASH?

247
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:17,734
MUST CUT THROUGH THE STINK
THOUGH WHEN THEY WALK IN WITH
THOSE SACKS FULL OF GOLD.

248
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:20,834
OH, THE MONEY SPENDS,
DEFINITELY.

249
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,667
ANYWAYS, THANKS FOR
THE NEIGHBORLY VISIT.

250
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,267
YEAH, GOOD TO MEET YOU.
VERY GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

251
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,200
YOU'RE OPENING
AT 8:00, HUH?

252
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,267
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE AIMING AT.

253
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:33,400
8:00.

254
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,834
GOOD FOR YOU.

255
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,334
WOULDN'T SET
A FIRE RIGHT AWAY.

256
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,467
COME TO CASE US
THOUGH.

257
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,267
HE WOULD SET A FIRE.

258
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,133
THE WAY YOU TELL IT,
MISTER,

259
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,567
THE MAN DIDN'T SELL YOU
THAT CLAIM HOLDING A GUN
TO YOUR HEAD.

260
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,501
FRANKLY, MR. HICKOK,

261
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,868
BEING A NOVICE
IN THESE MATTERS,
I WAS DUPED.

262
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:59,267
AND NOW
THE SELLER'S DISAPPEARED.
YOU CHECKED INTO HIS ROOM.

263
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,133
IT SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE UP SHIT'S CREEK.

264
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,300
THE SELLER HAD ACCOMPLICES,
GENTLEMEN.

265
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,400
MEN OF-- WHAT PASSES
FOR POSITION IN THIS PLACE.

266
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,334
I WOULD PAY A HANDSOME BOUNTY,
IF THEY WERE BROUGHT TO MAKE
RESTITUTIONS.

267
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,501
SORRY YOU LOST
YOUR MONEY, MISTER.

268
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,601
BUT I AIN'T FOR HIRE
TO ROB IT BACK.

269
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,601
I MAKE NO TERMS
AS TO METHOD.

270
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,334
YOU DON'T FIGURE
A GOOD TALKING-TO
WOULD DO THE TRICK?

271
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,767
I'M NOT LEAVING CAMP

272
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,567
WITHOUT MY MONEY.

273
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,100
MISTER, THAT FELLA YOU SAID
HAD MY ROOM BEFORE ME?

274
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,767
A MAN NAMED TIM DRISCOLL,
YES, PURE CHARLATAN.

275
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,300
FRESH STAIN ON THE FLOOR
WHEN I MOVED IN.

276
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,000
HE MAY HAVE CHECKED OUT
SHORT A USEFUL AMOUNT
OF BLOOD.

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,767
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IN THE LEAST.

278
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,868
THAT WOULD MAKE
THESE ACCOMPLICES
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

279
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,000
DANGEROUS PEOPLE
TO DEAL WITH.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,200
YES, I QUITE TAKE YOUR POINT--
NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES.

281
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,133
WELL...

282
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,501
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

283
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,334
I'LL PURSUE MY REMEDIES
IN SOME OTHER FASHION.

284
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,801
I DON'T THINK
HE TOOK YOUR POINT...

285
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,434
QUITE.

286
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,534
I THINK HE QUITE
MISSED IT.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,400
I BELIEVE
I'LL PASS OUT, CHARLIE.

288
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,133
I GUESS YOU WERE
PLAYING POKER ALL NIGHT, HUH?

289
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,033
YES, SIR.

290
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,501
WHEN WE WAS COMING INTO CAMP
I SAW THAT MONTANA FELLA

291
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,467
YOU SEEM TO LIKE.

292
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,501
BULLOCK HAD MY BACK
AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

293
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:29,067
WELL, HE WAS SEEING

BY A FEW PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU.

472
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:47,667
AND, THEN AFTERWARD,
WE CUT THE BULLETS OUT

AND THE FUCKING PLAYING CARDS
HE WAS USING AS TARGETS.

526

 <i>AND POINTED YOU</i>
 <i>TO ARTIE SIMPSON.</i>

HE'LL GET YOU SURE.

PREFERRED FORM OF RELAXATION,

550
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:26,467

554
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,067
DAN DORITY,
THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

555
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:48,601
YES, I DIDN'T GO
TO THE CLAIM THIS MORNING.

556
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,501
YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD HIM.

557
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,634
I'VE HAD HIM HERE
THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS
IN TEARS.

558
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,868
DAN, LOOK!

559
00:31:55,868 --> 00:31:58,167

560
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,267

 <i>YES, I CHOSE NOT</i>
 <i>TO GO TO THE CLAIM.</i>

561

564
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:08,334
THEN PROCEED, MY SON,
SPEAK FRANKLY.

565
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,767
WE NEEDN'T REACH
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
MY CLAIM

566
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,534
HAS "PINCHED OUT,"
AS THE SAYING GOES.

567
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,000
OR WHETHER IT WAS A SHAM
PROPOSITION TO BEGIN WITH.

568
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,434
LET'S JUST SAY, I'VE LOST
FAITH IN THE PROPERTY.

569
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:21,467
- Al: <i>HAVE YOU?</i>
-AND I WANT MY $20,000 BACK.

570
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,834
IN THE HEAT
YOU'VE CONFUSED ME
WITH TIM DRISCOLL.

571
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:27,067
I THINK WE'RE BOTH AWARE,
AL, THAT DRISCOLL'S
NO LONGER IN CAMP.

572
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,601
AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU
COLLUDED WITH TIM DRISCOLL

573
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,234
AND PERHAPS WERE IN CAHOOTS
WITH OTHER PARTIES AS WELL,

574
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:34,434
I REQUIRE SATISFACTION
FROM YOU.

575
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:36,067
IT'S THE HEAT
AGAIN, BROM.

576
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,200
I DON'T COLLUDE
AND I DON'T CAHOOT.

577
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,467
AL, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE PINKERTON AGENCY?

578
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,868
- WHY?
- PURSUING ITS
BUSINESS INTERESTS,

579
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,968
MY FAMILY'S HAD
SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO
ENGAGE THE PINKERTONS.

580
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,234
WE MAINTAIN
FRIENDLY RELATIONS.

581
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:56,334
I'D PREFER WE TWO
SETTLE THIS AS GENTLEMEN,

582
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:59,767
BUT IF NEED BE,
THE PINKERTONS CAN BE MADE
A PARTY TO OUR DISPUTE.

583
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,467
HAS HE ASKED YOU
TO RECONNOITER THE RIMS
WITH HIM AT ALL?

584
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:05,701
NEVER.

585
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,267
DID HE ASK TO
AND YOU REFUSED?

586
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:08,801
 <i>DIDN'T GET AROUND</i>
 <i>TO IT, AL.</i>

 <i>I THOUGHT HE WAS IN</i>
 <i>FOR THE LONG HAUL.</i>

588
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:12,834
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY?

589
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:16,767
THE GOLD YOU FOUND
WASHED DOWN FROM SOMEWHERE,
THAT'S THE LAW OF GRAVITY.

590
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:21,634
AND YOUR CLAIM RUNS
RIM TO RIM THE WIDTH
OF THE FUCKING GULCH,

591
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:24,834
SO THE ORIGINAL DEPOSIT
THE GOLD YOU FOUND
WASHED DOWN FROM

592
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:28,267
IS LIKELY ON YOUR CLAIM ABOVE,
NEAR ONE OF THE RIMS.

593
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,300
THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL
I SHOULD RECONNOITER?

594
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,801
FIRST PLACE THE PINKERTONS
WOULD LOOK.

595
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,634
UNLESS I'M
FUCKING WRONG.

596
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:38,067
NO, THAT'S HOW
THEY OPERATE.

597
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,667
SO IF HE ASKS YOU,

598
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,267
WOULD YOU RECONNOITER
THE RIMS WITH HIM?

599
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,834
AL, I WAITED OUT THERE
ALL MORNING FOR HIM--

600
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:48,067
- <i>IS THAT A YES</i>
 <i> OR A NO?</i>
- <i>YEAH.</i>

601
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,767
 <i>I'D BE HAPPY TO RECONNOITER</i>
 <i>THE RIMS WITH HIM.</i>

602
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,033
AND IF DAN'S AND MINE
GOOD FAITH RECONNOITERING

603
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,634
DON'T SHOW THE SOURCE
OF THE GOLD,

604
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,534
DO YOU THEN MAKE
RESTITUTION, AL?

605
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,934
OR DO I HAVE RECOURSE
TO THE AGENCY?

606
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:03,567
IF AT THAT POINT YOU ASK,
YES, I'LL MAKE RESTITUTION,
ALL RIGHTS AND WRONGS ASIDE,

607
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,834
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT ME
BY THE FUCKING BALLS.

608
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,767
LET ME GO HOME 
AND CHANGE.

609
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,701
UH, DO I NEED
CLIMBING GEAR?

610
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:15,868
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BRING A PICKAXE.

611
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:17,634
GOODBYE, THEN.

612
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:21,567
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
AN ACCIDENT.

613
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,634
AIN'T THIS
A PRETTY PICTURE?

614
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,634
I CAN'T WAKE PEOPLE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

615
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,434
PASSED OUT
IN THE PUBLIC HALLWAY.

616
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,167
HE NEVER KNOCKED
ON THE DAMN DOOR.

617
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,033
BY THE TIME I LOOKED OUT
HE WAS SNORING.

618
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,434
DID YOU WANT ME
TO DRAG HIM IN
BY THE DAMN HEELS?

619
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:40,534
I SAY LEAVE HIM WHERE HE IS
AND GO ABOUT YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

620
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:42,067
HE'S UP.

621
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:44,634
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
CONGRATULATIONS,
COCKSUCKER.

622
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:47,300
DINNER'S BEEN
CANCELED, BILL.

623
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,667
ALL RIGHT.

624
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,934
THEM TWO FELLAS GOT
THEIR LOT BOUGHT

625
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,434
AND THEY'RE STARTED
RIGHT AHEAD
WITH THE BUILDING.

626
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,234
SURE.

627
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:58,968
I WAS THAT SHOCKED SEEING
YOU SLEEPING OUT HERE, BILL.

628
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:00,968
FIRST SAW YOU
MAYBE AN HOUR AGO.

629
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,400
DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB ME
AND THE CHILD, CHARLIE.

630
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,667
HE MUST'VE SOUGHT ENTRY
TO YOUR ROOM, WHEREVER
THE FUCK YOU WERE AT.

631
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:10,334
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE
THAT GODDAMNED INNKEEP WAS!
HE COULD'VE LET BILL IN.

632
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:16,033
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET ME SLEEP, ARE YA?

633
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:18,968
I'D WOULD HAVE
LET YOU SLEEP AS LONG
AS YOU WANTED.

634
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,667
( sighs )

635
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,601
- HOW'S THAT LITTLE ONE?
- GOOD.

636
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:33,968
SHE'S NAPPING.
MORE THAN I CAN
SAY FOR YOU.

637
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:36,868
ARE THOSE HARDWARE BOYS
LOOKING FOR EXTRA HANDS?

638
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,601
IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY.

639
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:42,801
I DON'T AGREE
WITH THIS PLAN.

640
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:45,200
RECONNOITERING THE RIMS
IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF

641
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,634
DUE DILIGENCE THAT FATHER
WOULD ASK IF I'D DONE.

642
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:50,133
NOR DO I SEE THE NEED
TO INVOLVE YOUR FATHER.

643
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:53,667
IT WAS MY MENTION
OF THE PINKERTONS, ALMA, WHICH
BROUGHT AL SWEARENGEN AROUND

644
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,634
AND THE PINKERTONS
CAN'T COME INTO THIS
UNLESS FATHER DOES AS WELL.

645
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,701
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM.

646
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:01,200
OUGHT WE POSSIBLY TO TAKE
A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THIS?

647
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,200
CONSIDER
WE'VE HAD AN ADVENTURE
COSTING US $20,000

648
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,100
AND LET MATTERS
REST THERE.

649
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,367
LET THEM REST?

650
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,133
YES.

651
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,133
IF YOU STILL WANT
TO SEE MORE OF THE WEST,

652
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,734
LET'S GO NOW
AND SEE IT.

 <i>OR ELSE RETURN</i>
 <i>TO NEW YORK.</i>

654

657
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,367
WHY DO YOU TAKE
THAT MEDICINE?

658
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,534
YOU KNOW WHY,
TO RELIEVE MY HEADACHES.

659
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:39,667
THE OTHER DAY I HAD
A WHOPPER OF A HEADACHE
AND I SAMPLED A BIT.

660
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,567

I EXPERIENCED "RELIEF."

662

PERHAPS THE SEXES EXPERIENCE
THE MEDICINE DIFFERENTLY?

663

THESE HARDWARE COCKSUCKERS

TO HICKOK AT THE HIP.

750

YOU MADE YOUR JUDGMENT

YOU SAW IT LIKE THAT
AND I DID TOO.

755

TO THE BEST OF THE BOTH

- <i>WHEN YOU SAID</i>
 <i> "WHICH WAS,"</i>

758
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,834
I DIDN'T FOLLOW
WHAT YOU WERE ASKING.

759

I WASN'T
ASKING NOTHING.

I WAS SAYING.  I DIDN'T
HAVE FULL INFORMATION

761
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:46,067
SO YOUR IMPRESSION
ON THIS WAS IMPORTANT.

SOMEONE I COULD TRUST.

763

- SO IS SOMETHING WRONG?

767
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:03,567
NO, NO.

768
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,934

I KILL THE COCKSUCKER I HAVE
