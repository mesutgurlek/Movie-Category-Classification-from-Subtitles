00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,700
A RESTORATION

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,300
FRENCH FILM ARCHIVE

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
In 1970, in a collection filed in French film archive.

4
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:26,900
A western titled "a DRAMA in the FAR WEST", comprising 4 coils.

5
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:29,925
Colored with the basic nitrates, the film was identified

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,050
After 30 years, like "Bucking Broadway" of 1917

7
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,200
Thanks to the presence of Harry Carrey, the actor John Ford's favorite.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,500
This restoration has eliminated in addition to other alterations,

9
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:43,025
the instability of the image and the numerous scratches that affect them over time.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,550
In collaboration with the "Modern Art Museum" French captions,

11
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:50,400
affected by decay, were translated, rebuilt and replaced.

12
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,900
with captions in English.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,950
It took nine months of work in the laboratory "Centrimage", under the

14
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:59,475
supervision of the French Cinémathèque, to correct the main

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
defects and restore life to one of the earliest works of a Director,

16
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:05,900
most of his works of the silent period,

17
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:09,300
today definitely seem to be missing.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,350
... The pride of all the cowboys of the ranch ...

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,600
... of whom Buck Hoover was their leader.

20
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,200
An independent spirit, 
as were all the cowboys on the ranch,

21
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,950
he was still taken by irresistible 
charm of Helen Clayton,
4 the boss's daughter.

22
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,000
The boss, the ol' Ben Clayton,
the owner of the ranch,

23
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,300
was a simple man with good sense.

24
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,700
"I'd like to give this to you, Miss ...

25
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Keep it as a reminder of me,
and if you're ever in need,

26
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,650
send it back to me as as possible ...
I'll know what that means."

27
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
BEN CLAYTON
BY FORTUNE-WYOMING

28
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
SENDING THORTON TO INSPECT HORSES

29
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
PREPARE EVERYTHING  FOR HIS ARRIVAL

30
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,700
EDWARD BELVILLE

31
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,500
"You have to make arrangements
for his slay, Buck.
He'll probably stay a week or two. "

32
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,900
Waiting for the dinner bell.

33
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,800
"She's pretty much in love with
Harry, ain't she? ...

34
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,000
He's only a simple ranch hand;
it must be more than friendship."

35
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,200
"I have a little surprise
 for you tonight!"

36
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,700
In the evening, at the ranch.

37
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Cheyenne's surprise..

38
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,000
"Well, Harry,
that's a beautiful house!"

39
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,500
"Pretty nice, isn't it?"

40
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,700
"Tell me ... why did you build
this ... home?"

41
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,500
"Because I want to get married."

42
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
"To whom?"

43
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,900
<i><b>"YOU"</b></i>

44
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,500
"Me? ... No ...
... What are you saying!"

45
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,100
"Yes! With you, Helen."

46
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,300
Courage tested ...

47
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
"Helen and I, 
we'd like to get married ...."

48
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,200
"After all, what can you
 offer her, my boy?"

49
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:42,300
"Well, I have about a hundred
acres of land ... a house ...
a little money in the Bank ..."

50
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,300
"My... er ...heart, to make her happy...

51
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,900
... and my two arms to work with!"

52
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,400
"You see, my boy, I've known
 for a long time that I would
 lose her some day;

53
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,200
But I'd never thought it
 would be this tough! "

54
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,800
Eugene Thornton had been 
sent on a stud farm inspection tour

55
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:40,000
by a big-time dealer 
of young horses.

56
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Early in the morning, 
a few days after he arrived.

57
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,900
"And now for the rest of the young ones ...

58
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,300
We'll gather them so you
 can examine them closely."

59
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,000
"Why does Helen look so preoccupied,
 since that stranger arrived?"

60
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,200
Now it was the turn of a foal,
 the pride of the ranch.

61
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:30,900
son of an untamable horse
 that had already killed
 three cowboys.

62
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,700
"Here is the horse they call
 the Cowboys Killer"

63
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,900
"Would you mind if I tried it ...?"

64
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Then the days went by ...

65
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,500
"Why don't you come
 with me to the city ...?

66
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:59,900
... being Eugene Thornton's, 
wife, doesn't that sound nice?"

67
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,900
"What about Cheyenne?...
... Cheyenne has my promise."

68
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,800
"Never mind! ...
His kind quickly forget."

69
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,500
"... and we'll get married when
 we arrive in New York."

70
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
The big news of the day,

71
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
the official publication
 of the engagement 
of Helen and Cheyenne,

72
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:43,700
was to gather al the farm. for all the 
cowboys of the area an occasion.

73
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,100
"Who will mount this animal here? ...
...it's pretty stubborn!"

74
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,600
"Home sweet home! 
Oh, there's no place like home!"

75
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,000
"Helen hasn't down yet ...
 Wait a minute ...
I'll tell her you're here."

76
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,600
"Congratulations, Cheyenne!...

77
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,100
I got married four times! ...
and I get stronger and sturdier!"

78
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,100
<i>Dear Dad.
This is to say farewell.</i>

79
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,000
<i>I'm leaving with Mr. Thornton to marry him.</i>

80
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,000
<i>Say goodbye to Cheyenne for me.
Helen.</i>

81
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,900
"Come on, ... be brave, ol'boy! ...
It's... it's pretty tough 
for me too!"

82
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,900
The last day of the 
trip to the big city.

83
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,000
Arrived in the prestigious
city at last ...

84
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,800
Loneliness, dreams
 and memories ...

85
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,500
"Here, ol'man! I can't help it!
I am taking the high trail! ...

86
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:32,300
If SHE ever comes back...

87
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I want her to have the little 
house I had built for her."

88
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:28,200
It was the first letter received 
by Cheyenne since the wedding
 announcement sent to him long ago.

89
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,000
<i>Dear Harry, 
I remembered what you told me</i>

90
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,400
<i>When you gave me the souvenir
you made for me, and...</i>

91
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,800
<i>I am sending it to you 
with this letter.
Helen.</i>

92
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,600
"Quick, a ticket to New York."

93
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,600
"Wait ...? ...
 Oh, I'll show you!"

94
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,500
At the Columbia Hotel 
in New York.

95
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,000
"Careful, boy! ...
when they whistle like that,

96
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,200
it means they're about
 to jump on you, to bite you!"

97
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,100
Meanwhile, Helen was meeting
the charming Glady for the first time,

98
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,400
whom Thornton had introduced
 to her as his sister.

99
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,100
"I'm going to give a 
reception on the terrace 
of the Columbia Hotel,

100
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,000
to celebrate our engagement."

101
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,600
The cowboys of Clayton ranch
were coming to New York

102
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,700
to deliver a train full of horses
 to their buyers.

103
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,800
Cheyenne was wondering 
just where he should start
looking for Helen.

104
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,500
He was just about to find
 a seasoned guide.

105
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,500
"I'll telling you, again, try to get
in touch with that oaf.

106
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,400
We'll see what he's up to."

107
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,300
"A nice guy, isn't he?"

108
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,300
"Yes!... I have come here
 to find my fiancèe ...

109
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,800
A snake of a man look her away ...

110
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,200
and her father all alone 
and upset out in Wyoming."

111
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,700
"I'm here to find her ...
... and I will stay until 
I set her free."

112
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,700
"What bravery! Alright!

113
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,400
If I can help you, believe me,
 I'd like to give you a hand."

114
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,200
"Say, I like this guy! ...
I can't swindle him!"

115
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,000
"Give me back my money."

116
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,800
"To the health of Eugene Thornton 
and to the graceful fiancèe...

117
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,100
he brought back from the wild
 solitude of Wyoming!"

118
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,300
"Ah! It's the young woman
the cowboy, showed me 
in the picture!"

119
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,600
As the evening went by,

120
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:25,300
Helen could see the real character 
of Thornton showing through.

121
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,700
"We should call the manager!"

122
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,000
"Call the station and tell them,
 Buck Hoover and his cowboys ...

123
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,700
should come and meet me 
here right away."

124
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:58,300
"If we had known that we'd 
have visitors we'd have 
washed up a little."

125
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,190
END
