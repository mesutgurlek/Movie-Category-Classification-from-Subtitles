1
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,306
Whoa.

2
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,174
All out, all out! What's
the matter, a holdup?

3
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,306
Nope, they missed us.
This is as far as we go.

4
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,180
Wait. It says
three miles to Wagon Gap.

5
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,117
That's as close
as we go, partner.

6
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:05,089
That sign is a warning. Nobody
that ain't loco ever goes closer.

7
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,149
I hope you sell
your wares.

8
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,628
<i>I hear tell there's a lot
of money in Wagon Gap.</i>

9
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:16,397
The only problem is to live
long enough to get it out.

10
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,132
Partner, which way you say
it was to Wagon Gap? That way.

11
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,731
That way? Come on, Duke. Wait a minute.

12
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,004
What are you scared of? Wagon Gap.

13
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,047
We'll sell our wares tonight and
leave for California in the morning.

14
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,448
<i>If you boys are going into Wagon Gap,
strap on a couple of shootin'irons.</i>

15
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,750
If you can bluff'em,
you might live till morning.

16
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,154
He's got
something there.

17
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,352
How much will you take for
those guns? Fifty dollars.

18
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,329
It's a deal. There you are. Thanks.

19
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,764
Aw, Duke, that ain't fair. What's wrong?

20
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,364
Look. Yours is much
longer than mine! So what?

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,409
All you have to do is stand closer
to whoever is shooting at you.

22
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,243
<i>As long as you boys are going into Wagon
Gap, would you mind taking this mail?</i>

23
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,373
Why, certainly!
There you are.

24
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,413
Giddyap, horse.

25
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,825
"Joe Bazzo,
Erskine Lakes.

26
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,529
"Dear Sal, this is
to let you know...

27
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,901
"we are building a new log house
where the old log house stood.

28
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,635
"We are using the logs from the old
log house to build the new log house,

29
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,112
but we are going to let the old log house
stand until the new log house is built. "

30
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,377
I don't get it. What are you
reading other people's mail for?

31
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,893
What are you ducking for?
You scared?

32
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,767
Come on, get with it.

33
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,564
Duke, let's go in here.
It's safe.

34
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,617
Chester, come out of there!
You don't belong in there.

35
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,328
What's the matter? Tired? Sit down. Yeah.

36
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,164
Come on.
Let's go.

37
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,195
Chester, don't let this town
scare you. You gotta keep saying,

38
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,641
"I must be brave. I must be
strong. " Say it to myself?

39
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,304
Certainly! I must be
brave. I must be strong.

40
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
Now you're talking!

41
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,021
I must be brave.
I must be strong.

42
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,350
<i>I must be nuts!</i>

43
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,697
Oh, no, you don't!

44
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,840
Come back with that merchandise!
What are you gonna do?

45
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,639
Be just as tough as they are!
You never shot one of those.

46
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,112
What's the difference?
Get out your gun.

47
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,378
I never shot one either. Take
the gun out. We'll fix them.

48
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,852
What am I gonna do with it?
Shoot it off! Up in the air.

49
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,719
But it makes a noise. C'mon, shoot it off!

50
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,940
It's Fred Hawkins!
That's nice shooting, partner.

51
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,378
And you got him
right through the heart.

52
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,440
I got him? I shot over
there. He fell over here.

53
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,985
Then that really is
nice shooting!

54
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,317
Jake Frame's been tryin'
to get rid of this varmint!

55
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,857
C'mon inside.
He'll set up the drinks free.

56
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,553
I told you shooting was the
only way to come into this town.

57
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,619
Wait a minute.
This man's just been killed.

58
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,632
So? Who's upset? I am.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,362
Judge?
Judge Benbow?

60
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,507
Judge?

61
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,807
Jim, what are you and the
Citizens' Committee riled about now?

62
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,212
I demand that those men be charged
with murder and held for trial.

63
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,944
Well, now,
I don't know, Jim.

64
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:30,114
It looks like a friendly shootin'
affair to me. Self-defense.

65
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,817
Fred there's
got a gun in his hand.

66
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,122
There have been 10
killings in the last week...

67
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,526
and not one man has
been brought to trial.

68
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,761
What sort of law do we have
here? All right, if you insist.

69
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,859
What's the deceased
got on him?

70
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,632
Twelve dollars and this knife
in his hip pocket.

71
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:51,143
I hereby fine the deceased $12
for carrying concealed weapons.

72
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,770
Just a minute, Judge. You
heard what the judge said.

73
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,009
Yeah, just a minute, Judge.
Stay out of this, Frame.

74
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,381
This is one pair of killers
you're not getting off.

75
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,545
Simmer down.
I'm on your side.

76
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,523
Just what kind of a
trial was that? Jake, I...

77
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,288
Strangers come into town and shoot
down one of our best-beloved citizens...

78
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,331
<i>And you want to let them
get away with it.</i>

79
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:16,232
What's got into you? That's the
fellow that was gonna buy us a drink?

80
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,896
It isn't safe for a man to
walk the streets of Wagon Gap.

81
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,735
You said it. That
fellow almost fell on me.

82
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,300
If the law won't do something,
we better do something.

83
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,144
I'm thinkin' a little taste
of rope is called for!

84
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,513
<i>Wait a minute.!</i>

85
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:36,317
Judge Benbow, stop this. You nor anybody
is stopping this hanging, Simpson.

86
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,291
Get outta the way.
You're obstructing justice!

87
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,166
Is that hard to do? No, no.
You'll soon get the hang of it.

88
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,535
Try this on for size.
Sixteen and one-half.

89
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,767
How's that?
That tickles.

90
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,300
Yeah? That did it. It don't tickle no more.

91
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,812
The Citizens' Committee is
headed this way. Get goin', boys.

92
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,317
We gotta stall 'em.
Stall 'em? Oh, stall 'em!

93
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,979
Ever hear the story about the
traveling salesman? They've heard that.

94
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,353
Yes, and it ain't funny. Wait a minute!

95
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,358
What about our
personal possessions?

96
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,987
Don't you want to send something
to your dear mother for a keepsake?

97
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,327
My mother? Yes! To your mother.

98
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:23,027
Oh, my mother! I would like to
send some stuff to my mother.

99
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,094
Would you take care of this
stuff for me? I'd be happy to.

100
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,470
It's priceless,
this stuff.

101
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,602
Hold that please.
Give it to him.

102
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,408
<i>String 'em up!</i>

103
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:46,447
Sorry to spoil your party.
This is gonna be done legally.

104
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,825
Since when are you the law? I
don't see the sheriff's badge.

105
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,228
Somebody put a
bullet hole through it.

106
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,029
Till we can keep a live sheriff,
the committee's taking over.

107
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,594
We're seeing that these men
get a fair trial. Fair enough.

108
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,573
And I'll see to it thatJudge
Benbow gives it to 'em.

109
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,610
C'mon, boys!

110
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,703
Just because he don't like you,
he's mad at us. Don't be ungrateful.

111
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,907
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson,
we'd be dead.

112
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,008
If it wasn't for Mr. Simpson,
we'd be on our way to California.

113
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,418
Give us a couple of horses
and show us the road.

114
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,458
<i>We'll call it even. The only road
you're taking is to Wagon Gap.</i>

115
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,460
You're charged with a killing,
and you're gonna stand trial.

116
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,723
You can figure out
your plea.

117
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,265
I'll plead insanity.

118
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,268
And I can prove it too.

119
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,183
This court
will now come to order.

120
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,183
Close down
that bar!

121
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,592
And quit gambling
for a few minutes!

122
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,391
Will the jury file in.

123
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,490
I object!
Order in the court!

124
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,297
He objected...

125
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,565
to what you said.

126
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,335
<i>I figured you might
be wanting a jury...</i>

127
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,104
so, to save time,
I picked one for you.

128
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,770
Look!

129
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,214
<i>That's the gang
that was gonna hang us.</i>

130
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,218
<i>To keep everything legal,</i>

131
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,222
<i>in case you don't like any member
of thejury, you can challenge him.</i>

132
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,555
I'll fight that little shrimp there. Order!

133
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,528
Order in the court!

134
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,430
Young man, in about two shakes,
I'll hold you in contempt.

135
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,436
<i>Judge, quit stalling. Let's
get this over with. Okay, Jake.</i>

136
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,972
Hmm.

137
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,500
As the judge, I hereby
sentence you two coyotes...

138
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,910
Just a minute,
Your Honor.

139
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,949
I'd like the court's permission to
say a few words to the defendants.

140
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,282
I don't know, Jim. We're keeping
Jake's business shut down,

141
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,947
and these delays
are costing him money.

142
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,357
But go ahead and make it
snappy. Thank you, Your Honor.

143
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,019
Boys,

144
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,496
it strikes me mighty curious thatJake
Frame's so anxious to get you hung.

145
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,897
I'd like to know why. Don't
ask us. We're strangers.

146
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,836
If you'll string along with me,
I've got an angle to keep you alive.

147
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,306
All right, Mr. Simpson.
We're in back of you. Good.

148
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,572
Your Honor, the defendants
are willing to plead guilty...

149
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,136
to the charge of killing
Fred Hawkins in a gun duel.

150
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,111
He did it again.
He said we did it.

151
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,450
Now they'll hang me.
Are you guilty?

152
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,286
No. Then what are you worrying about?

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,223
Oh.

154
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,853
Jim, the court thanks you
for simplifying matters.

155
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,626
I hereby sentence you
two coyotes... Your Honor,

156
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,431
may I remind you that you have
a jury? I picked them, didn't I?

157
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,994
You picked some
before they were ripe!

158
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,973
<i>Shut up, you.!</i>

159
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,704
You boys want to get your heads
together and bring in a verdict of...

160
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,441
Your Honor, I suggest you
first acquaint the jury...

161
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,712
with the statutes
pertaining to dueling.

162
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:04,051
Jim, let's not get all
snarled up in legal folderol.

163
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,683
I have the statues. Would
you like me to read them?

164
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,058
Or would you prefer
to quote them from memory?

165
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,064
No, no.
Go ahead.

166
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,263
Section 86-97 of the penal code
of the sovereign state of Montana.

167
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:22,637
"If any person slays or permanently
disables another person in a duel,

168
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,200
"the slayer must provide
for the maintenance...

169
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,247
of the wife of the slain
and for the minor children. "

170
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,011
<i>And Section 86-98...</i>

171
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,180
"Said slayer must pay all
debts of the person slain. "

172
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,450
What does he mean?
Yes.

173
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,585
<i>Oh. In simpler language, the law
makes these men responsible...</i>

174
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,562
for all the obligations
of the deceased...

175
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,758
both to his family
and his creditors.

176
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,324
Hawkins owed me $50,
Your Honor.

177
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,099
Considering what Hawkins owed me,
I'd say that's a right good law.

178
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,370
As a matter of fact, Jake,
I think so myself.

179
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,606
Especially the part about them
maintaining the widow.

180
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,727
Well, this is it. I don't
see any corn growing.

181
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,740
The widow
don't grow corn.

182
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,676
Then what's that scarecrow doing in
the yard? Who you calling a scarecrow?

183
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,010
You scatterbrained
numskull!

184
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,608
Ah, the Widow Hawkins!

185
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:44,782
Howdy, Mrs. Hawkins. These
are them. The culprits, huh?

186
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,985
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm awful
sorry. Oh, think nothin' of it!

187
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,824
I ain't hypocrite enough
to shed tears for Hawkins.

188
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,195
He wasn't any good. All he
ever did was drink and gamble.

189
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,393
Hawkins, come here!

190
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,273
All he ever did was drink
and gamble. Come on, Duke!

191
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,319
Nice dog.

192
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,879
Go on, Wolf. You have the
situation well under control, ma'am.

193
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,655
Guess we can get back to
town. Just a minute, Judge.

194
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,993
As long as our main obligation is to
take care of Mrs. Hawkins and the kids,

195
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,501
why can't we make some kind of
a financial arrangement? Such as?

196
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,834
We'll give her some cash now and send
a little every month from California.

197
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,773
How much you got?
Well, let me see.

198
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,811
Hmm, I have $70.

199
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,474
Precisely the amount the deceased
owed me. Poker the other night.

200
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,985
Duke, think of something else. I have.

201
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,579
Judge, there was only one bullet
found in the body of the deceased.

202
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,114
You can't hold both of us.
It's not legal.

203
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:58,323
Don't get technical.
You got a point, Eagan.

204
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,093
Yes, and he's pointing it at me. Quiet.

205
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,932
Ma'am, we have to keep this thing
legal. We've got to let one go.

206
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,938
Which one do you prefer?

207
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,998
Well... ain't much
to pick from, is there?

208
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,011
The little one looks good, but maybe
the big one would be a better worker.

209
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,981
Ahem. Judge, you have no
objections if we gamble for this?

210
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,110
There's no law against gambling
providing it's honest.

211
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,552
I'll play it as honest
as you would. Go ahead.

212
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,283
Take a card.

213
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,690
Any one? Any card. I won't even look.

214
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,389
Don't look at it! You
didn't give me a chance.

215
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,399
Don't try to cheat.
Play it on the up and up.

216
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,732
What card were you thinking of? What card?

217
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,796
What card were you thinking of?
C'mon, get it over with.

218
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,071
I was thinking of the nine of clubs.
Oh, no. It was the eight of spades.

219
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,339
That's the card you were
thinking of? That was the card.

220
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,881
How do you know it was the
eight of spades? Just a minute!

221
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,315
What does that look
like? The eight of spades.

222
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,751
That ain't fair. Just a minute, please.

223
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,348
You, you, you! I'll leave
it to the judge. Judge?

224
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:04,294
<i>That's the way I'd have done
it. That's what I thought.</i>

225
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,356
Good-bye, ol' pal.
I'm going to miss you.

226
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,632
On my way to California, I'm
going to be alone and desolate,

227
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,163
<i>left with nothing but fond
memories of our long friendship.</i>

228
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,579
Good-bye, Chester, old
boy. Good-bye, Duke.

229
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,344
Ma'am,
take good care of him.

230
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:30,377
I feel terrible bein' the cause
of you two good friends partin'.

231
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,482
It'll be hard for me for a
while, but I'll get over it.

232
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,789
Judge, my money.
What money?

233
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:41,322
You found me innocent. Therefore I
don't have to pay Hawkins's debts.

234
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,630
That's right.

235
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:49,163
Son, it sort of cracks my heart
to separate you two fellows.

236
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,176
So I'm gonna do you a kindness.

237
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,475
I hereby appoint you
custodian of the guardian.

238
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,879
And as such, you will see...

239
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,512
that he carries out
the terms of his sentence.

240
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,284
What's that for?
Legal fees.

241
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,587
But... that's not...
That's not legal.

242
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,287
Just as legal
as that card trick of yours.

243
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,763
Ma'am, they're both yours. I'll get
back to town. Good afternoon, gents.

244
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,199
All right, men.
Let's go.

245
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,533
Are you satisfied?

246
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,439
Now we're both stuck on this broken-down
ranch with nothing to do but work.

247
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,602
Hey, it could be
pretty nice work too.

248
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,578
Juanita?

249
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,105
<i>Come here.!</i>

250
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,210
This is Juanita, my eldest.
How do you do? I'm Duke Eagan.

251
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,221
This is my pal,
Chester Wooley.

252
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,223
This one's
your new guardian.

253
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,759
And this is a critter
that needs guarding.

254
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,625
She's got some frisky notions
I'm expecting you to halter.

255
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,324
I don't think you'll be mean
to me, Mr. Wooley,

256
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,733
or can I call you Daddy? Oh, ho-ho.

257
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,238
What's the matter
with you?

258
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm a guardian to the guardian, but
you can call me... Call him Duke.

259
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,641
Juanita, get in the house and
rustle up something for supper.

260
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,045
You fellows go to
the pump and wash up.

261
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,142
<i>Go with 'em, Wolf.</i>

262
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,849
I hope this soup's
just right.

263
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,258
If I'm any
judge of character,

264
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,888
the way to Mr. Wooley's
heart is through his stomach.

265
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,400
You don't have to cotton to
him, Ma. He's a prisoner of war.

266
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:27,098
When a woman gets to be my age, the only
way she can be sure of a man is to marry him.

267
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,140
I've got the young'uns
to think of.

268
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,676
Suppose Mr. Wooley
isn't the marrying kind?

269
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,712
Oh, every man's
the marrying kind!

270
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,216
All you got to know is how
to go about gettin' him.

271
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,116
More flies are caught
with honey than vinegar.

272
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,019
So beginning now, I'm a
woman of honeyed words.

273
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,217
Everything I say to Mr.
Wooley will be sweet as nectar.

274
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,955
My muted voice will be tuned
to the strings of his heart.

275
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,227
My touch will be feathery light
as I stroke those strings...

276
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,236
to bring forth a
dulcet melody of love.

277
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,829
<i>What ifhoney doesn't work
on Mr. Wooley?</i>

278
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,468
Then I'll hog-tie him!
Come and get it!

279
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,914
Come and get it!

280
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,578
Matt, get outta there!

281
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,622
Beginning tonight, Mr. Wooley
sits at the head of the table.

282
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,385
Ma? Git before I take a ladle to you.

283
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,757
Take your rightful place,
Mr. Wooley.

284
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,296
Mr. Eagan, you sit on
Mr. Wooley's left hand...

285
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,299
and, Matt, you sit
on his right hand.

286
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,460
What do I eat with? My feet? Oh, sit down.

287
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,273
Ha-ha.
Fooled ya!

288
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,809
Ha! Ha, ha.
Ha!

289
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:43,837
Sit down. What's the matter with you? Okay.

290
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,908
Mr. Wooley, help yourself
to some bread, fresh baked,

291
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,443
especially for you.

292
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,729
Duke, can I have
a piece of bread?

293
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,167
<i>Help yourself.
There's none there.</i>

294
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,934
Have a piece of mine.
Hog, don't eat so fast!

295
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,703
Mr. Wooley, have
a piece of my bread.

296
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,405
Thank you.
You're such a good child.

297
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,710
Soup's one of my best dishes.
Try it, Mr. Wooley.

298
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,719
Please excuse
yourself.

299
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,489
I didn't do nothing. See
that it don't happen again.

300
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,725
Go on,
eat your soup.

301
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,563
Go on, eat your soup! Yes, sir.

302
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,501
I told you not to let
that happen again.

303
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,374
Excuse yourself!
I didn't do nothing.

304
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,438
It's the soup. Don't blame it on the soup.

305
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,384
I don't have to brag about my soup,
Mr. Wooley. It speaks for itself.

306
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,582
You can say that again.
Oh, eat your soup.

307
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,354
It's that good, huh? Mm-mmm, delicious.

308
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,657
That's okay with me.
Listen,

309
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,824
don't hurt the widow's
feelings. I won't say nothing.

310
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,562
Look, eat the soup
whether you like it or not.

311
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,767
So I'll make a face. What do
I care? Just eat your soup.

312
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,708
Stop talkin' and let
me eat my soup. Eat it.

313
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,905
Ahem, ahem. You got a frog in your throat?

314
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,914
Of course not.

315
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,617
I'm sorry. It's the way
he eats at home.

316
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,852
What's the matter?
Yeah, the soup.

317
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,553
You can't dive into it.
Just eat it.

318
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,461
What's the matter
with you?

319
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,295
Is something wrong?
What is it?

320
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,165
You've got a tongue,
haven't you?

321
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,172
What? Eh?

322
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,769
You're trying
to say something.

323
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,039
Well, bring it out!

324
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,972
It's a fine
conversation.

325
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,281
<i>Very interesting.
Eat your soup.</i>

326
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,420
Duke, will you eat my soup
and let me eat your soup?

327
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,460
Will that make you happy? Very happy.

328
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,897
My goodness, take it.
Thank you ever so much.

329
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,059
I'll take
care of it.

330
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,127
Thank you very much.
It's all right.

331
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,939
How is it? You heard what the widow said.

332
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,742
Her soup speaks for itself. Not
only that. It will talk back to you.

333
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,080
You don't know what you're
talking about. I don't.

334
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,949
Are you expecting company? No, but you are.

335
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,520
You eat too dainty!
Quiet.

336
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,686
Go on, eat.
Delicious.

337
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,730
Dig right in!

338
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,498
It ain't nice
to do those things.

339
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,939
Will you please
make up your mind?

340
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,041
Eat your soup.
Eat yours.

341
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,086
What a night.

342
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:22,828
I love the stars

343
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,997
I love the moon

344
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,303
I'd love December

345
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,607
If it came in June

346
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,410
I...
Yi-yi-yi.

347
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,417
Lovely.

348
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,545
Did you like it? Uh-huh.
Sit down, Mr. Wooley.

349
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,090
Thank you.

350
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,532
Ah, loose your tie.

351
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,060
Go ahead! I don't know you that well.

352
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,301
Land sakes, man. I want you
to make yourself to home.

353
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,276
Mr. Wooley, I ain't a person
to beat around the bush.

354
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:11,304
I'm a woman. You're a man. That's the
nicest thing anybody ever said to me.

355
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,910
Well, Mr. Wooley,
Chester,

356
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,717
a woman means a lot to a man, and
a man can mean a lot to a woman.

357
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,783
Me and Hawkins didn't get
along. He never come home.

358
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:27,389
I've been a lonesome woman
these past few years.

359
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,627
I know
just how you feel.

360
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,296
I've been awful lonesome myself. Have you?

361
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,771
Haven't you ever
wanted somebody...

362
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,810
waitin' for you when
you come home at night?

363
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,007
Somebody... Somebody to kiss
you when you open the front door?

364
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,982
Someone whose hair you
caress with a loving touch?

365
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,487
Someone whose presence
would cheer and warm you?

366
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:53,183
Haven't you ever wanted to
embark on the sea of matrimony?

367
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,852
Your boat of bridal wreath
and orange blossoms...

368
00:24:55,927 --> 00:25:00,227
crosses the shoals of acquaintance
into the sea of affection.

369
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,359
The tempest of love causes
the waves of emotion...

370
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,496
to toss you helter-skelter,
hither and thither,

371
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,598
here and yon,
round and round.

372
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,836
Stop, stop.

373
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,472
Stop the boat.
I'm gettin' seasick.

374
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:20,245
Ah, Mr. Wooley,
I'm not a forward woman.

375
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,719
All my life
I've been shy and bashful,

376
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,951
just a rosebud
afraid to bloom.

377
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,152
But now I'm takin'
the bull by the horns!

378
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,525
Sit down!

379
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:35,999
I've been tryin' to convey to you in an
indirect way that I'd consider matrimony.

380
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,592
That is, after
you've been here a bit.

381
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,161
You mean,

382
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,639
me and you
get married?

383
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,074
Will ya?

384
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,135
Shh.

385
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,048
We shouldn't let the
children hear this. Uh-uh.

386
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,193
No!

387
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,000
Duke? Duke!

388
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,871
The widow wants to marry
me. Well, congratulations.

389
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,106
My little pal embarking on the
sea of matrimony. Stop, stop.

390
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,943
I just made that trip, and
I am not going to get married.

391
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,974
I wouldn't be so hasty. There's
ways of making you change your mind.

392
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,146
And you too!
Now get to bed.

393
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,088
There's work to be done
in the morning.

394
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,519
Watch 'em, Wolf!

395
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,396
I don't like the looks of
this. Should we make a getaway?

396
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,861
Get down.
Wait a minute.

397
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,735
<i>That dog knows what
we're talking about.</i>

398
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,934
How does the dog know
you said "getaway"?

399
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,484
Duke, don't say
those words.

400
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,180
Nice doggy, nice doggy.

401
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,315
Lie down. Lie down.
Uh-oh!

402
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,657
Hey, Duke,
I think I got him fooled.

403
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,530
When he ain't looking,
we'll make a g-e-t-a-w-a-y.

404
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,907
How do you like that?
He can spell too.

405
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,541
Chester, we've got to find some
way of getting rid of that dog.

406
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,551
Duke, fire stick.

407
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,215
Right.

408
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,885
Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Hold it.

409
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,828
Nice doggy.
Sit still.

410
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,957
You go out and open up the door. Hold him.

411
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,025
Nice doggy.

412
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,629
Don't bite.
Look, doggy.

413
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,307
Show him the stick!

414
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,469
Doggy, c'mon.

415
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,140
Take it easy now.
Nice doggy.

416
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,325
We were just
on our way to bed.

417
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,833
Nighty-nighty-nighty.

418
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,796
Hey! Hey!

419
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:59,130
That ain't fair. It's cold down
here, and you've got your coat on.

420
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,832
<i>Why haven't you,
Mr. Wooley?</i>

421
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,840
It's time
you were dressed.

422
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,376
There's water to be drawn,
the cow to be milked,

423
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,379
the chicken coop fixed,
the fence whitewashed.

424
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,745
I'll get the children up
to help me. Don't you dare!

425
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,148
After all, you're not
their father, Mr. Wooley.

426
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:18,588
Or... has
your heart softened?

427
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,591
No, ma'am.
Then get to work.

428
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,752
The lower forty needs plowin',

429
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,887
the harness needs sewin'.

430
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,797
If I do all that today, I'll
have nothing left for tomorrow.

431
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,960
Don't worry,
I'll think of somethin',

432
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,300
unless you've reconsidered
my offer of marriage.

433
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:38,274
Mrs. Hawkins, marriage is
nothing but a three-ring circus.

434
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,335
First the engagement ring,
then the wedding ring...

435
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,245
and then "suffer-ing. "

436
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,215
Duke? Duke!

437
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,721
I'm not gonna take the
bed. What do you want?

438
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,816
The widow's awful mad.
She's gonna work my head off.

439
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,361
Will you help me? All right, I'll help you.

440
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,726
I'll stay here
and watch the kids.

441
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,941
Ohh!

442
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,950
Here's the water.

443
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,145
Now look
what you've done!

444
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,088
No water, no breakfast.
Now get goin'!

445
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,037
Here's the water.

446
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:27,346
Pour it in the kettle. Yes, ma'am.

447
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:33,620
<i>Oh, boy, am I full. Oughta
be after all those pancakes.</i>

448
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,125
<i>How 'bout those six
eggs he ate?</i>

449
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,162
<i>Aw, shut up.</i>

450
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,459
Mrs. Hawkins? Dinner will be at noon.

451
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:44,524
I haven't had my breakfast. Them
that ain't here on time don't eat.

452
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,629
If I don't eat, I can't
work. It's your own fault.

453
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,903
Mr. Wooley,
I'm a tenderhearted woman.

454
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,740
I'm filled with the milk
of human kindness.

455
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,373
I'm overflowing with
the love of mankind.

456
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,078
Mine is a tender heart, ever
ready to take into its fold...

457
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,815
the tired, the sick,
the weary.

458
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,221
Do you get
what I'm driving at?

459
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,590
Yes, ma'am, but you're trying
to hitch up to the wrong horse.

460
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,994
Why don't you make Duke do
some work? I hate to admit this,

461
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,294
but I had to tell Mrs.
Hawkins about my heart trouble.

462
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,392
Heart trouble? Don't shout like that.

463
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,336
You, you... No, no. Work makes me sick.

464
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,431
I guess I'll just
have to lie around.

465
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,705
That won't be hard. You're the
best liar around these parts.

466
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,214
Don't talk to Mr. Eagan
like that. Get to work.

467
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,772
Betsy needs shoein' so
I can drive her to town.

468
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,978
The children will meet you
in the barn and point her out.

469
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,022
Now git!

470
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,317
Mrs. Hawkins...
Git!

471
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,532
Heart trouble.

472
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,965
Wish I'd have thought
of it.

473
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,738
Which one is Betsy? That
one? Ah, that's Betsy.

474
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,473
Your mother said
I got to shoe her.

475
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,386
Land sakes,
what's the commotion?

476
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,054
Mr. Wooley's shoeing Betsy,
so he thinks.

477
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,395
Mr. Wooley,
what on earth?

478
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,440
I had to
lend her mine.

479
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,971
Ma!

480
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,408
Ma! Ma!

481
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,570
Ma!

482
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,974
<i>Ma.!</i>

483
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,644
Ma!

484
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,313
What are you making all this
noise for? I can't sleep.

485
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,549
Give me that brush.
Ma!

486
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:40,610
Mrs. Hawkins, I'm not going to do it
anymore. I'm getting dishpan hands.

487
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,444
It's your own fault.
Keep on scrubbing. Ma! Ma!

488
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,949
Get to the front quick.
There's gonna be trouble.

489
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:51,216
Juanita's talking with Jake Frame,
and I just saw Jim Simpson comin'.

490
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,314
I've had enough trouble
with Jake Frame.

491
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:58,226
Wooley, chase him off
the place. Get goin'!

492
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,808
Mr. Wooley, when I
tell you to do something,

493
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,607
don't stop and play.
C'mon!

494
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,514
Mr. Wooley, I want you to throw
that ornery skunk off my property.

495
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,848
I was fixin' to do that,
Mrs. Hawkins.

496
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,720
Why don't you start? This is
a family affair. Throw him out!

497
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,016
Mr. Frame?
He don't wanna go.

498
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,928
Jake came to get my answer about
coming to work at the Round-Up.

499
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,764
There's that matter of $1,100
owed me by your late husband.

500
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,963
It's generous ofJake to give me a
chance to pay off the family debt.

501
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,939
Young lady, as long
as I'm your guardian...

502
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,135
you will never step
inside that saloon.

503
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,735
Good for you,
Wooley!

504
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,940
Watch out for the flowers. Hey.

505
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,142
I've got Hawkins's IOUs.

506
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,675
IfJuanita doesn't work for me, somebody
else is going to work off that debt.

507
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:01,623
<i>Working in a saloon might be good experience
for a girl. According to the law, Wooley,</i>

508
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,456
that's your responsibility.
But I work here all day!

509
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,295
You'll work for me at night.
Be at the Round-Up at 7:00.

510
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,307
The widow's on the warpath.
You better do something.

511
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,846
Do you think she could
use a 75-year-old man? 75?

512
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,906
That's how old I'm gonna be
before I pay backJake Frame.

513
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,417
Talking about money,

514
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,683
this is all the money I've made
since I've been working here.

515
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,590
Some guy tipped me a big penny and
thought he was doing me a big favor.

516
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,288
Say, that's a $20 gold piece.

517
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,853
Chester,
we're on our way.

518
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,891
We'll ride that to California. Ain't it
a little small for both of us to sit on?

519
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,904
I'm going in that poker game. Then
watch my smoke. Suppose you lose.

520
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,566
Oh, no, certainly not.
With your help, I can't.

521
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,438
Come here.

522
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,118
Well, what do
you boys do?

523
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,679
Bet 50.

524
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:13,056
I'll see that
and up it 100.

525
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,727
I'll call that,
and I'll raise it 100.

526
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,534
Let's bump it again.

527
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,543
I'll see that...

528
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,948
and up it another 100. That's all for me.

529
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,681
I'll call that.
I got a straight.

530
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,849
All blue, boys. Back to the mines for me.

531
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,951
What do you know?
Sure had a lucky streak.

532
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,156
How much did we win? Well, not
enough to pay off everything,

533
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,530
but a couple more games like this
and we're on our way to California.

534
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,694
Cash me in.

535
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,501
Look, don't let Frame know
that we won this money.

536
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,700
Frame.

537
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,336
That's me.

538
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,314
Frame!

539
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,477
Frame. Here,
put your ashes here.

540
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,146
I'm so busy and so tired,
Mr. Frame.

541
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,622
Looks like you had
a streak of luck, Eagan.

542
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,421
How 'bout you and me sitting
down to a couple of hands?

543
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,657
He can't. He's gotta go home right
away. Mrs. Hawkins is waiting.

544
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,426
<i>Oh, no, I ain't.!
Oh, yes, you...</i>

545
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,832
I'm here to see you,
Frame.

546
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,269
You and me's got to have a showdown
about Wooley. Stay where you are!

547
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,433
This day and night work
ain't a-workin' out.

548
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,603
He no more gets through working for
me, when he goes to work for you.

549
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,547
Then he no more gets through working
for you, when he goes to work for me.

550
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,347
He'll be an old man before his
time. My offer still stands.

551
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,618
I'll be glad to replace him
forJuanita. Juanita's staying home.

552
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,922
In that case,
we can't do business.

553
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,224
I was just talkin' to Eagan
about a poker game.

554
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,493
We'll play it three ways.
We get a stack of chips.

555
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,467
Eagan puts up his roll
against our interest in Wooley.

556
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,131
Whoever wins gets the money
and full possession of Wooley.

557
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,140
You can
count me out.

558
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:09,578
Duke, go ahead and play. If
you win, I'm free. No, I...

559
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,706
Yeah, yeah.
All right, I'm in!

560
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,343
How 'bout you, Mrs. Hawkins?
I don't believe in gambling.

561
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:20,652
Gambling's a sinful, crime-breeding
curse. Where are the cards?

562
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:24,217
Sit down, Mrs. Hawkins.
I'll take over, Joe.

563
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,286
There you are.

564
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,569
Wait a minute.
Women first.

565
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,729
How 'bout
Mrs. Hawkins dealing?

566
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:40,107
All I know about cards is what
Hawkins told me. I never played before.

567
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:44,671
We won't have any trouble
with her. Certainly not.

568
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,377
You never
played cards before?

569
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,082
Uh-uh.

570
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,955
Cut 'em. Cut 'em? Where'd you learn that?

571
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,756
Hawkins. Hawkins. You heard
what the lady said, cut 'em.

572
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,536
Ante up.

573
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,469
Hawkins.

574
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,318
Hawkins!
Hawkins!

575
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,380
I'll open.
I'll stay.

576
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,449
What do I do now?

577
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,018
Give me two cards.

578
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,621
I'll take one.

579
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,937
I'm standin' pat.

580
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,905
Hawkins?

581
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,339
Two reds.

582
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,071
Well...

583
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,214
<i>I'll see your two
and I'll raise you two.</i>

584
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,016
I don't want to cast any
reflections, but...

585
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,286
a person has to think twice
before buckin' luck like yours.

586
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,022
You may have me beat
and then again you mightn't.

587
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,725
Wooley, stop skitterin'!
And put that spittoon down.

588
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,530
I gotta...
Put it down!

589
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:17,404
<i>I'll see your bet...
and sweeten it a little.</i>

590
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,999
<i>I'll stay.</i>

591
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,873
Well...

592
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,745
I'll see that...

593
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,750
and I'll
raise you two.

594
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,514
I'll tell you what.

595
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,991
Let's get this over with
in one hand. Shoot the works.

596
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,959
All I can lose is Wooley,
and that ain't much.

597
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,393
I'm in.

598
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,873
Overworked. Let him lay. He needs the rest.

599
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,372
You pay him.
Sure.

600
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,817
I have invested my cash
in Widow Hawkins's property.

601
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,821
I've got a
fat deal there.

602
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,618
Duke?
Pardon me.

603
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,454
We've got to get out, or I'm
gonna be a bride. Beat it!

604
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,759
I'm tryin' to do a little
promoting. A lot of"symphony" I get.

605
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,628
Go ahead!

606
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:20,727
Sweetheart, how would you like to
finance an expedition to California?

607
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,205
<i>Wooley, come here.</i>

608
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,843
Would you excuse me, please? Okay, bub.

609
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,184
I thought you went home
with the widow.

610
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,121
I did...
but I came back again.

611
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,159
Mr. Frame, I wish
you'd a-won me in the game.

612
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,288
Working here is much easier
than marrying her. So that's it.

613
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,958
Wooley, I'm beginning to
really feel sorry for you.

614
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,936
How would you like to earn a couple of
fast horses and a stake to California?

615
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,939
If you'd give us the horses,
you can forget the steak.

616
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,874
I'm not hungry,
just tired.

617
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:04,244
A miner friend is getting worried
about the amount of gold he's got.

618
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:07,307
If you can get the information
from your friend, Jim Simpson,

619
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,579
as to when the next bullion
shipment is coming through,

620
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,848
I can ship my friend's
gold along with it.

621
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:16,222
If I ask him that, you'll give
us the horses? That's right.

622
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,524
I'll go over and ask him.
Don't give him any reasons.

623
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:25,126
My friend wants to keep it
confidential. Oh, a secret.

624
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,501
You don't want the stage-holdup guys
to find out about it.

625
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,132
That's right.
I won't tell them.

626
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,938
I won't tell nobody
but you.

627
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:37,378
I'm smart.
I got brains I haven't used yet.

628
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,576
Well, don't let 'em
go to your head.

629
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,518
Hello, Chester! Just
the man I'm looking for.

630
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,324
What'll it be? A shot of
milk. Make it a double.

631
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:57,959
What do you want to talk
to me about? Shh, shh.

632
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:02,131
When is the next gold shipment
coming in? Why do you want to know?

633
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,140
Mr. Frame says
I mustn't tell.

634
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:08,076
But if I find out,
he will do me a big favor.

635
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,843
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'll be glad to help.

636
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:19,116
The next shipment's due
on... Thursday. Thursday?

637
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:23,182
Oh, good! Let's have
a drink on that.

638
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,353
Thursday.
Good luck.

639
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,406
Thursday.
Thursday.

640
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,967
What's up? You know the gold's
comin' through on Wednesday.

641
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:46,073
We can set a trap for Frame
and his gang the day after...

642
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,744
and catch 'em robbing
the coach red-handed.

643
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,287
California's the land
of golden opportunity.

644
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,289
You'll have a stocking
full of gold!

645
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,622
I've got that now,
and I'm gonna keep it.

646
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,686
Duke, we're practically on our way to
California. What are you talking about?

647
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,197
The gold shipment
is coming in Thursday.

648
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,200
All I've got to do
is tell Frame.

649
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,236
He'll give us horses
and the money.

650
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,737
You can't tell him that.
He's the one they suspect.

651
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,673
Suspect of what? Of all
the stagecoach robberies.

652
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:16,611
Oh, what am I gonna do? Tell him the
shipment's going through Wednesday.

653
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,706
You'll be doing yourself and the
Citizens' Committee a big favor.

654
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,808
Tell him Wednesday?
Yes!

655
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,285
When he finds out,
what will he do to me?

656
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,846
We'll be on our way
to California. C'mon.

657
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,125
Mr. Frame... Wednesday. Good.

658
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,929
When do we get the horses? They'll
be in the barn Wednesday night...

659
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,765
after I've checked
your information.

660
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,274
Mr. Frame...
You and your big ideas.

661
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,809
Now I'm in
worse trouble.

662
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:51,280
If you tell Frame the truth,
think of the hole it'll putJim in.

663
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,442
Duke, if Frame
finds out I'm lying,

664
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,009
think of the hole
he'll put me in!

665
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,785
I was just
coming home.

666
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,558
I'll take care of you later. Where's
Juanita? She should be home in bed.

667
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,464
<i>Keep your hands in your pocket
She should be, but she ain't.</i>

668
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,766
That's her voice! She's
in there. We just left.

669
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,829
Now you're
going back in.

670
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,707
Find Jim Simpson and bring
him here. Lead the way, Wooley.

671
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:25,374
You heard what Ma said!
"Lead the way, Wooley. "

672
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,111
Make the cash box ring
ting-a-ling

673
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,416
Before the night's
any older

674
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,618
Set 'em up, Bill
and fill up the till

675
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,752
If you have gold
then you're welcome

676
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,694
Juanita? Juanita!

677
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,129
Shut up,
yourselves!

678
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:51,573
You can have what's nice
if you have the price

679
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,475
Wooley, drag her off
that stage!

680
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,740
Me?
Yes, you!

681
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,545
Ain't you the one that forbid her
to set a foot in this place?

682
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,142
Go on!
Go ahead!

683
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,415
You've got everything I want Juanita?

684
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,892
Your mama wants you to go home! Sit down!

685
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,953
Get her off there,
Wooley!

686
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,990
Juanita, you've gotta
come home with the family.

687
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,629
Juanita, come on home.
Your mama wants you!

688
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:31,076
Juanita, c'mon home! Wait a
minute. Frame says let her stay.

689
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,776
I say, take her out!
Stop that!

690
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,217
Ow!
Ohhh!

691
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,551
Leave that child alone!

692
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,923
<i>Are you gonna let her
get up on that stage?</i>

693
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:49,022
Are you? Go ahead and shoot
me and inherit this family.

694
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,364
Go ahead.
Not me.

695
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,961
Oh, c'mon. Oh, no. I don't want 'em.

696
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,598
<i>You don't want 'em?
Quiet, all of you.</i>

697
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,040
He don't want 'em!

698
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,135
Oh.

699
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,113
Anybody else
want my job?

700
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,446
Eh?
No.

701
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,747
Eh? Anybody
wanna take my job?

702
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,086
Juanita, you heard
your mother. Home.

703
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:17,320
C'mon. Home. Come on!

704
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,315
Wooley!
Look at that.

705
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,878
Not a man in town
who'd dare lay a hand on him.

706
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,550
Jim, are you thinking
the same thing I am?

707
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,559
I am.

708
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,154
There you are, Chester.

709
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,596
Now you can take your place with
the famous sheriffs of the West.

710
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,161
Why didn't you hire one
of them? They're all dead.

711
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,731
They're all dead? Dead!
Don't worry, Chester.

712
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,243
Keep this picture
and show it when you have to,

713
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,837
<i>and you'll bear
a charmed life.</i>

714
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,542
Suppose I should happen to
meet some nearsighted gunman?

715
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,177
That'll be his tough luck. Oh, I see.

716
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,653
If he kills me, he'll have
to take care of the widow.

717
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:23,022
That would make him
a dead duck.

718
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,152
And me too.

719
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,322
<i>Where's the sheriff?
Where's the sheriff?</i>

720
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:33,062
There's gonna be lead flyin'.
Some drunk's fixin' for a fight.

721
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,572
Chester?
Where'd he go?

722
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,938
He went thataway.

723
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,103
Chester, get up.
This is your big chance.

724
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,512
Tell 'em to stop the shooting, or you'll
run 'em all in! Show 'em you're not afraid.

725
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,244
Throw out your chest.
They'll fill it full of holes.

726
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,378
Go ahead! Don't push!
All right, don't push.

727
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,650
I didn't get this badge
for nothin'.

728
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,715
Go ahead.

729
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:59,558
That boy's got what it
takes. I don't wanna go.

730
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,221
I'll go!

731
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,126
You get us some
law and order, Wooley,

732
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,502
and we'll get the railroad
to come through Wagon Gap yet!

733
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,633
I'm donating you in the interest
of good government.

734
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,735
Me and the family are with
you. I'm depending on it.

735
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,610
Oh, yes.
Ohhh.

736
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,714
Mrs. Hawkins? Oh, go on down
there and act like a sheriff,

737
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,849
or I'll send you to the ranch and
really put you to work. All right.

738
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,402
Law and order.

739
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,735
If you had any nerve, you'd go
in there and stop them yourself.

740
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:48,710
If this doesn't work... You'll think of
something else for somebody else to do.

741
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,771
<i>I'm in town
for a good time, see?</i>

742
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,214
<i>I'll blast your heads
off! Stop disgracin' me!</i>

743
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:03,521
Haven't you got any red blood in your
veins? Yes, and I'm gonna keep it there.

744
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,527
Go on in!

745
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,620
<i>Don't move, anybody.</i>

746
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:11,861
<i>If you're tired oflivin',
we'll shoot it out.</i>

747
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,427
I don't want another word
outta any of you!

748
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,473
Oh, no, you don't!

749
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,068
Now you fellows in here will
have to stop shootin'...

750
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,339
because you're makin'
a lot of noise.

751
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,042
The horses are jumpin' up
and down, scarin' the women.

752
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,748
Now remember...

753
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,454
don't aggravate me.
No more shootin'.

754
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,692
Now look, everybody!

755
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,636
This shooting
has gotta stop.

756
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,207
Hey, little boy.
You! Fat little boy.

757
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,406
You!
Come here, little boy.

758
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:02,646
What're you doin'
wearing a man's pants?

759
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,983
I'm the new sheriff.
I want law and order.

760
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,649
You take care of the law,
and I'll order.

761
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:12,093
What'll you have? I don't drink
whiskey. It goes to my head.

762
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,255
That's just great.

763
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,028
I'll put it on your head,
and I'll shoot it off.

764
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,626
That's much better.
The other way I get sick.

765
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,605
What am I sayin'? Get it back
up there, or I'll drill you!

766
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,937
Mister, please don't.

767
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,410
I didn't want this mess.
I didn't ask to be sheriff.

768
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,607
It's all her fault.

769
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,913
Go ahead and shoot me.
You can have her.

770
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,355
<i>The Widow Hawkins.!
That drunk I'm not.</i>

771
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,995
Everybody up! Everybody up! You heard...

772
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,329
Shut up. Get those tables up. Yes, sir.

773
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,632
<i>Put your shootin'irons
on the table.</i>

774
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,264
<i>Get 'em up there.!</i>

775
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,072
Hey, you,
get this roof fixed!

776
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,211
<i>You heard the sheriff.
Get this roof... Shut up.!</i>

777
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:18,156
From now on, I want you all
to treat me with respect...

778
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,493
and very little of that.

779
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,898
Go on back to your tables.
You heard the sheriff.

780
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,596
Shut up!
Yes, sir.

781
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:32,533
Go on!
You heard the sheriff!

782
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,635
Land sakes,
he's done it.

783
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,977
That's my boy. You can
all go back to your homes.

784
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,349
There'll be no more shootin'
in Wagon Gap.

785
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,126
The sawed-off runt's scared.

786
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,823
What sawed-off runt are you
calling a sawed-off runt?

787
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:59,460
You, fatso. Any objections? Yeah!

788
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,505
Oh, I must've meant
somebody else.

789
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,563
I guess you did.

790
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,075
Yeah.

791
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,941
Here.

792
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,217
You're too young
to smoke cigarettes!

793
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,377
Just a minute.

794
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:20,981
I don't want you calling anybody a
sawed-off runt, or I'll run you outta town.

795
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:25,756
And I'm the sawed-off runt
that can do it too! Yes, sir.

796
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,888
Chester,
you're wonderful!

797
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,900
I'm proud of you. Ma'am, while
I'm wearing this badge of office,

798
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,198
I'll have no huggin'
and chalkin' in public.

799
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,468
And another thing, that goes
for any other place too.

800
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,770
Mr. Wooley,
I'm apologizing.

801
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,779
Don't let it happen again,
ma'am. I won't, Chester.

802
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,748
See what I mean?
I'm not to be trifled with.

803
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:50,752
I wouldn't overdo it. If you get the
widow mad, she'll really pour it on.

804
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,187
Oh. So you're
still hangin' around...

805
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,521
tryin' to tell me what to do. Oh, now...

806
00:54:56,593 --> 00:55:00,222
Listen, you! If you don't start
working and show some means of support,

807
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:04,358
I'm gonna run you in as a
vagrant! Chester, I'm your pal.

808
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:08,370
You owe everything to me.
And I'm a man that pays off.

809
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:12,101
I'm gonna start paying you off.
I'm gonna make you my deputy.

810
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,939
You really are my pal! You like that?

811
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:18,003
Swell. Your first duty is get to
the ranch and take over my chores.

812
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,448
Me? Yes, you! You've been
bossing me around long enough.

813
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,510
The worm has turned,
and every dog has his day.

814
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,715
Now get out! Just a minute. Ohhh!

815
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,487
Partner,

816
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,791
when you say that, smile.

817
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,503
Morning, Sheriff.
Good morning, Sheriff.

818
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,843
Good morning, ladies.

819
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,281
Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, Joe.

820
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,818
Juanita, how are you?
Where's your mama?

821
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,549
She just came into town.
She's right over there.

822
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:04,150
Good-bye.

823
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,822
<i>Yoo-hoo.! Sheriff Wooley.
I brought your dinner.</i>

824
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:11,526
It's roast beef today. Just when
I was in the mood for chicken!

825
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,331
Now... I got chicken
stewin' for supper.

826
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:17,737
I'll send Eagan back... Never
mind, no need. Roast beef will do.

827
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:21,368
You wait here for me. I'm going to
the saloon to stop them from fighting.

828
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:25,881
They're not fighting. I know, but
why wait until the last minute?

829
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:31,717
I'll be right back. I've gotta
see somebody about something.

830
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:35,224
Hey, there's the sheriff.

831
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,316
The sheriff!
The sheriff.

832
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,763
You don't all have to stop talkin'
on account of me. Then c'mon, boys.

833
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,890
Shut up!

834
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,041
What'd you say?

835
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,408
I didn't say nothin'.
Well, don't say it again.

836
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:59,505
C'mon, folks,
everybody have a good time!

837
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,608
Enjoy yourselves. But don't
nobody sneak up behind me.

838
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,389
Put the gun away! Chester, the
widow is working me to death.

839
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:12,986
So? We've gotta get out of
town. Tonight, you arrest me.

840
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:15,553
Then we can get away
while the town's asleep.

841
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,567
You like that? Only the part
about putting you in jail.

842
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,036
You're starting to like it? Yes.
Being sheriff has its advantages.

843
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,336
Listen, Chester. Get your
hands off me. Get 'em off!

844
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,399
Ahem.

845
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,207
I've had enough
of your flirting.

846
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,809
If another man even looks
at you, I'll kill him.

847
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,913
Why, you...

848
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,980
Hello, Sheriff.
Have another one.

849
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,526
It's on me.

850
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,744
Chester, you're living
in a fool's paradise.

851
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,944
It's not you they're
afraid of, it's the widow.

852
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,385
And speaking of the widow,
she's out to marry you or else.

853
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,447
Or else what? Or else she'll
find somebody else to marry.

854
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:19,689
Then what? Without her protection,
you'd just be another little fat man...

855
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,323
and a lovely target for these
men you've been pushing around.

856
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,731
Who would want
to marry the widow?

857
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,965
Who? Who? Nobody.

858
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:34,566
C'mon, everybody.
Drinks are on the sheriff!

859
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,215
Who would
marry the widow?

860
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,012
Judge, sit down
and have a drink.

861
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,851
It's a little crowded over
there. But it's free at the bar.

862
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:50,256
Bartender, milk for everybody. Milk?

863
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,528
What's the matter?
Any objections?

864
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,497
Milk!

865
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:02,030
Milk. I should've listened
to you in the first place.

866
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,472
I have something else I think
you'd like to listen to.

867
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,706
Have you heard the news about the railroad
coming through the widow's property?

868
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,680
No.

869
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,912
They're buying her property
for a right-of-way.

870
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,476
You don't say.

871
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,787
That'll probably make her
the richest woman in the state.

872
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,054
Hmm.

873
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,057
Bottoms up.

874
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,398
Bottoms up!

875
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,779
Drink up. This stuff
will ruin a man's stomach.

876
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,148
So will this.

877
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:55,213
Looks like the little fat boy
is gonna keep dealing us misery.

878
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,387
Worry about him later. Right now,
we've got the stage to think of.

879
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,767
Hey, Duke.
What's the matter?

880
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,329
What day is today?
Wednesday.

881
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,432
I thought so.

882
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:30,116
Jim, is Frame and his gang
gonna be fooled!

883
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:34,095
What're you getting at? You know you
told me the gold was comin' in tomorrow?

884
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,723
I told 'em it was coming in today.
Pretty smart, huh?

885
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,029
Send 'em
on a wild-goose chase.

886
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,594
The gold is coming today! What?

887
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:48,167
That wild-goose chase of yours is
gonna lay a golden egg... for Frame.

888
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,872
Head off the stage before
it reaches Dead Man's Pass.

889
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,881
I'll round up the men
and follow.

890
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,383
I get it.
We stop the stage.

891
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,510
The bandits are waiting
for the stage.

892
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,283
And then you show up instead of
the stage. That's well-staged.

893
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,848
<i>Exactly.! Providing
you reach the stage.</i>

894
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,258
Don't worry. I ain't
got that for nothin'.

895
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,662
Madam, you'll have to get down off
that buckboard. We're after the bandits.

896
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:12,200
C'mon, you'll have
to make it snappy.

897
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,998
<i>What do you mean
we're going after the bandits?</i>

898
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,097
You wanna play tag with
the bandits, go ahead.

899
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,165
Just a minute.
Take it easy.

900
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,507
I deputized you, didn't I?
Now get in there.

901
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,138
Wooley, I'm agin
the whole idea.

902
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,776
When you start ridin' by those bandits,
they're liable to start shootin'.

903
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,514
Don't worry. They're not
crazy. Well, I am worried.

904
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,887
I'm just sentimental enough
not to want my intended shot up.

905
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,018
Madam, it's about time
you and I had an understanding.

906
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,222
You may be intending,
but I'm not.

907
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,596
Now step aside and let me
do my duty! Don't rile me!

908
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,659
It's me protecting you. If you
want to keep that protection,

909
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,205
you better be thinking
about us gettin' wed.

910
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,868
I got all the protection
I need... right here.

911
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:58,607
Go home before I throw you in the
hoosegow for tryin' to scare the sheriff.

912
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:11,149
Mrs. Hawkins, I've been considering
making you a proposition.

913
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,287
Ain't got time, Judge. I can wait.

914
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:18,265
Wedding bells and train whistles...
most melodious.

915
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,268
Yes, indeedy.

916
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,700
What're you slowin' down for?
Let's not pass up this chance.

917
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,372
We have horses and a wagon.
Nobody's watching.

918
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,679
California's out that way. What
kind of a sheriff do you think I am?

919
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,913
I was put in office
to uphold the law.

920
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,978
You're my deputy, and
you're gonna help me!

921
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:44,015
Sure, the bandits might not shoot
you, but it's open season on me.

922
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,857
You got nothin'
to worry about.

923
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,092
You're safe as long as
I've got this picture.

924
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,831
What's the matter?

925
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,738
What's the matter?
The picture's gone.

926
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,208
Gone?
It's gone.

927
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,680
Duke, don't go another step.
Hold the horses.

928
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,512
Don't go
no further, Duke.

929
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:12,076
The bandits are right down
that road. Should I keep going?

930
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,248
No. No!

931
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,587
Duke, which way
does that road go?

932
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,718
To California.
California?

933
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,729
California.
Over there.

934
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,343
<i>The widow.!</i>

935
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,747
<i>Just had a faint notion...</i>

936
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:45,049
you'd be heading this way
once you found the picture gone.

937
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,385
Let's ride
back together.

938
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:50,425
You and me can discuss terms
for keepin' my protection.

939
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,393
<i>What do you say? Giddyap!</i>

940
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,712
Mr. Wooley?
Mr. Wooley!

941
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,913
Hurry up.
Get down off of there.

942
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,180
Keep your hands up.
Get over here.

943
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,937
Frame.
Frame!

944
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,176
<i>The sheriff!
Mr. Wooley?</i>

945
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,705
Mr. Wooley!

946
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,113
The widow!
Giddyap!

947
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,453
Wooley!

948
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,219
Now we lost the gold. Why
didn't you shoot the sheriff?

949
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,264
Why didn't you?
Me?

950
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,300
And have her chasin' me
instead of him? Uh-uh!

951
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,804
Where's the sheriff?

952
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,385
It's here, Jim.
He did it!

953
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,089
He saved the gold! If I wouldn't have
seen it, I wouldn't have believed it.

954
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,132
Aw, shucks.
It was nothing.

955
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,726
<i>I went for my guns, and they went
for the hills. Or vice versa. Wooley.!</i>

956
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,872
Wooley. Wooley!

957
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,706
You're a hero.
I seen it with my own eyes.

958
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,746
You don't need my picture
to be brave. How'd...

959
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,749
But I'd like you
to have it, Chester,

960
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,547
to keep close to your heart.

961
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,986
Thank you, ma'am.
I sure will.

962
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,957
Those bandits were Frame and
his gang! I recognized 'em.

963
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:40,154
<i>This is it. They're probably on
their way back to the Round-Up.</i>

964
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,720
Phil, take a bunch of men and
ride ahead. We're gonna get 'em.

965
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,732
There's no need
of bloodshed.

966
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,268
I'm gonna bring that gang in
single-handed. You're only one man!

967
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,533
There's only one gang.
I'll see you all later.

968
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,903
What happened? How do you get
outta here? Get on your horse.

969
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:59,178
Fine bunch of softheaded
idiots I tied in with.

970
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:03,617
I didn't notice you taking a
shot at him. Leaving town, I see.

971
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,177
It's all your fault.
You and your laws!

972
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,246
That sheriff's
got everyone hog-tied.

973
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:11,919
Not necessarily. If someone
would marry the widow,

974
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:15,657
that would relieve the culprit of
his responsibilities, also his power.

975
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,757
Any of you boys want to cut
yourselves in? I'd rather leave.

976
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:22,167
I was speaking of myself. I
thought you could hold your liquor.

977
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:27,574
I'm cold sober, Jake. It's just I desire
to settle down in my declining years.

978
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:30,441
Although the money the little woman
will receive from the railroad...

979
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,777
<i>which is coming through
her property...</i>

980
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:36,579
<i>has a slight attraction.
So that's it.</i>

981
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,621
If anybody's in line
for that money, it's me.

982
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,782
As the one who really killed
Hawkins, it's high time I confessed.

983
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,123
I'll thank you to appoint me the
family guardian. No deal, Jake.

984
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,857
That's hearsay testimony,
and I can't accept it as evidence.

985
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,456
I'll shoot the butterball and
inherit the family from him!

986
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,729
You'll have
to beat me to it.

987
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,068
Hey, the sheriff is coming
to take you in.

988
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,903
Order! If we're not careful,
we'll be shooting each other.

989
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,909
The judge is right.
It's every man for himself.

990
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:06,380
But the shot closest to the heart wins.
To avoid argument, mark your bullets.

991
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,316
This thing's got to be done
nice and legal.

992
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,481
Wait a minute!

993
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,824
Chester, go on in there,
but bring 'em out alive.

994
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:23,387
Don't worry 'bout me.
Worry about yourselves.

995
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:26,162
Take cover. I don't want
any of you gettin' hurt.

996
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,169
Go on,
take cover!

997
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,082
Here's to the widow. And her money.

998
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,921
May the best shot win.
Here's where I get rich.

999
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:54,224
I never missed a sheriff
in my life. Here's to it!

1000
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,928
Hey!
Here he comes.

1001
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,808
Frame, you and your gang
come out with your hands up,

1002
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,818
or I'm a-comin' in
a-shootin'!

1003
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,969
Now listen, Frame,

1004
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,565
someone is liable
to get hurt!

1005
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,484
Those dirty skunks,
shootin' at Mr. Wooley!

1006
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,650
Isn't it about time somebody
on our side used a gun? It is.

1007
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,627
Phil, take 10 men and
break in through the back.

1008
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:10,426
Come with me. We'll draw their
fire to keep 'em up front.

1009
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,957
Wooley, you stay here
with the women. Thanks.

1010
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,137
Jim Simpson and
the Citizens' Committee.

1011
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,410
Barricade the doors
and windows.

1012
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,850
Get back here,
you yellow-livered skunks!

1013
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:35,982
This brawl's gonna decide who runs this
town, and it's time you started picking sides.

1014
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,409
Unless something or somebody
draws their attention,

1015
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,778
Jim and them fellers
are goners!

1016
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,181
I'll do it! They won't dare shoot a woman.

1017
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:06,278
No. You have a family to think of.
Chester here'll do it.

1018
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,188
Shut up!
But I didn't say...

1019
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,257
I didn't say anything.
That's in case you do.

1020
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,730
Duke, tell Phil to hurry.
Jim needs help.

1021
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,791
When Chester gets there, they'll
stop shooting atJim, but I'll go.

1022
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:23,599
You sure this is gonna work?
Even Frame wouldn't shoot a woman.

1023
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,663
Why don't we all go? That's a good...

1024
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,209
Wooley, get goin'.

1025
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,804
Pick up the clubs, girls.
Lead the way, Wooley.

1026
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,905
Go on,
lead the way!

1027
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,060
Hold your fire, men.
Hold it.

1028
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,327
Hold your fire!

1029
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,604
You women go home where you
belong. This is a man's fight.

1030
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:05,375
All right, girls. Forward.
Frame, we're coming in.

1031
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,472
The sheriff.

1032
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,540
Ohhh!

1033
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,622
Hey... Hey...

1034
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,662
Hawkins.

1035
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,658
Duke!
Oh!

1036
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,054
I'll show you we'll have
law and order in this place.

1037
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,167
Oh, you poor
little thing.

1038
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,271
Frame!

1039
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,740
Come on.

1040
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,951
Come on.

1041
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,536
You might as well quit, boys.
You're all through in this town.

1042
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:43,628
Corral 'em all and take 'em
to the hoosegow.

1043
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,503
I'll see that you all get life
and maybe longer!

1044
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:49,043
The federal marshal
will take care of that.

1045
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,477
We're ridin' the bunch
into Butte to turn 'em over.

1046
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,175
Okay,
you got my permission.

1047
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,510
C'mon, everybody.

1048
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:06,084
You better come along.
I wanna talk to you.

1049
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:11,497
Mr. Wooley, the citizens of Wagon
Gap are deeply indebted to you.

1050
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:16,266
You're a fine man, and you've
been carrying another man's burden.

1051
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:19,466
Frame just confessed he was
the man that killed Hawkins.

1052
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,475
Chester, at last
we're on our way.

1053
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:24,637
Mr. Wooley, I was kinda hoping
you might have reconsidered...

1054
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:28,274
about hitchin' up. California, here I come.

1055
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,477
In that case,
Judge Benbow,

1056
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,487
I accept your
proposal of marriage.

1057
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,489
Let's go.
Just a minute.

1058
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:38,355
Judge, in regards
to the railroad...

1059
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:41,919
How'd you know? Just got
the offer this morning.

1060
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:47,196
It's gonna make me the
richest woman in these parts.

1061
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,266
You chump. If you'd
a-married the widow,

1062
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,274
we wouldn't have had to work
the rest of our lives.

1063
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:57,210
You wouldn't, but she have found somethin'
for me. You never do anything right.

1064
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,043
I don't? Didn't I
clean up all the bandits?

1065
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,879
Didn't I make the town of Wagon
Gap safe for women and children?

1066
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,546
So safe that nobody
even has to carry a gun?

1067
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,029
Giddyap!
