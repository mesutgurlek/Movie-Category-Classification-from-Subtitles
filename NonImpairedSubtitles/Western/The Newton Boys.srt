00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:03,324
Eighty, and I promise never
to tell anybody where they came from.

156
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,761
Eighty would be good.

You know, I'm retiring next month...

that might be valuable...

163
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,649
...to boys in your line of work.

164
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,648
It's a few square-door safes
I know about...

165
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,326
...in this part of the country.

166
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,485
Course, it'll mean a little investment
on your part.

- I like that Red Cross pin, Avis.
- Thanks.

169
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:11,924
- You a nurse?
AVIS: I was. That's how I met Brent.

170
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,090
One day he was
just another patient...

171
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:18,769
...and then I ran off with him,
and, well, here we are, casing a bank.

172
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:25,088
He takes all them powders and stuff.
He ain't sick or nothing, is he?

No, it's just him.

The box is an old Packer.

- Yeah. Anything with a square door.

180
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,642
It'll take it off there in one pop.
What else is on that list?

181
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:54,169
Well, we got 41 banks here.

are flush with that harvest money...

That's a mighty fine question.

What kind of businessman
are you, Willie?

A damn successful one.
Now, are you all coming?

No, it's the truth. That's true.

A great man, Pancho Villa.

Not people's money.
The bank's money.

to our people since before we was born.

about traveling, Jess?

- I'm talking about a couple of million.

- A lot.

Yeah. I'm talking about our children and
grandchildren not growing up on dirt.

- We won't have no kids if we get killed.
- Ain't nobody gonna get killed.

So banks are over for us.
So what?

939
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:13,593
We're getting desperate.
That's when it gets dangerous.

JESS: Aw, Joe.
DOCK: Joe!

out of my oil and lost $ 100,000.

This is a train. It's safer.

- You promised you were finished.

01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:51,269

we had trying to be legitimate.

you're the only man who got a raw deal?

Punk kid out back of the stockyards.

Puny little bastard.

Anyway, he goes legit and becomes
a postal inspector, of all things.

975
01:12:37,915 --> 01:12:41,749
Two months ago, they transfer him
from D.C. Back to his old neighborhood.

976
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:44,554
He likes the girls and he likes the ponies.

977

Now, with the girls, you pay them
enough, they always finish in the money.

But the ponies...

And sometimes, the Federal Reserve
loads extra bags at the last minute.

998

I'm gonna check all this out,
then do some planning on this train.

Gonna be dark out there tonight.

So I think it's a good idea
if we wear these light hats...

...so we can identify one another.

01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,874
WILLIS:... at the crossing.
We're parked on it...

1069
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:26,514
...you stupid rat bastard.

1070
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:28,074
Coming down with two!

1071
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:30,311
Coming up with one.

1072
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:32,432
Slowly.

1073
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:37,073
SLIM: Remember, they got guns in there.
- Yeah, well, so do we.

1074
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,431
JESS: I got him. I got him, Joe.
WILLIS: Got him?

1075
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:42,590
Mail car 2105.

1076
01:20:45,555 --> 01:20:47,273
Everybody outside now.
Let's go!

1077
01:20:47,715 --> 01:20:49,034
Watch the window.

1078
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:51,112
Don't shoot. We're out here too.

1079
01:20:51,275 --> 01:20:53,391
WILLIS:
Jackson, get that poison gas.

1080
01:20:57,675 --> 01:20:59,552
All right, you silly bastards.

1081
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:02,030
You're about to wish to God
you had come out.

1082
01:21:03,955 --> 01:21:06,594
[INDISTINCT YELLING]

1083
01:21:07,635 --> 01:21:09,432
Don't let him kill them in there.

1084
01:21:09,595 --> 01:21:12,314
Oh, it's all right.
Nobody ever died from a stink bomb.

1085
01:21:13,755 --> 01:21:14,949
Drop them guns, now!

1086
01:21:16,395 --> 01:21:17,794
Come on.

1087
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,673
JESS: Get over there.
WILLIS: Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go!

1088
01:21:22,075 --> 01:21:25,033
JOE: You, drop it.
WILLIS: Who's the head honcho here?

1089
01:21:25,995 --> 01:21:29,510
All right, move it, y'all. In here.
Come on, now.

1090
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:34,392
I'm only after the registered mail,
and I want every sack of it.

1091
01:21:34,595 --> 01:21:37,473
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1092
01:21:37,995 --> 01:21:40,190
Good. Let's go.

1093
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:47,029
Talk to me.

1094
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,272
Uh, Milwaukee registers are all up here.

1095
01:21:50,475 --> 01:21:54,434
St. Paul goes back this way,
and this section's going to Minneapolis.

1096
01:22:12,115 --> 01:22:13,594
There it is.

1097
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:18,310
All right. Start helping me toss
these out, and get Milwaukee first.

1098
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,273
- Every single bit of it, honcho. Let's go.
CLERK: Yes, sir.

1099
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:24,433
JESS: Coming down.
Where the hell have you been?

1100
01:22:24,595 --> 01:22:27,871
Oh, Jesus! Some Hoosier tried
to sneak off the other side.

1101
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:31,232
Had a shotgun. Goddamn it.
I had to shoot the son of a bitch.

1102
01:22:36,075 --> 01:22:38,794
Y'all got anybody over there
on the other side?

1103
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:41,111
You've got us all here, mister.

1104
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,713
JESS: Oh, hell. Joe, you got all them.
JOE: All right.

1105
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,514
GLASSCOCK: I got him.
Hell, I shot him five times, Jess.

1106
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:50,553
No, no, no.
He's further down the line.

1107
01:22:50,755 --> 01:22:54,031
Every one of you will pick up a bag
and lug it to them two cars.

1108
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,032
- Get going.
GLASSCOCK: Let's go.

1109
01:22:56,195 --> 01:22:58,072
JOE: That too.
GLASSCOCK: Throw it down here.

1110
01:22:58,955 --> 01:23:00,832
Put them in the back seat of that car.

1111
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:06,069
Some of you come here
and start loading in the back of this car.

1112
01:23:10,075 --> 01:23:11,394
Oh, my God.

1113
01:23:18,595 --> 01:23:20,472
You idiot!

1114
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:22,633
You shot Dock!

1115
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:26,712
No, no, I didn't.
That's a Hoosier, Jess.

1116
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:32,034
Oh, Jesus.

1117
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:34,753
You shot my brother.

1118
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:38,552
Goddamn it, Willis! Willis!

1119
01:23:38,715 --> 01:23:40,831
Get over here. It's Dock!

1120
01:23:43,155 --> 01:23:45,032
- Jackson?
- Yeah. Go.

1121
01:23:54,635 --> 01:23:56,671
I think we can take this guy.

1122
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:04,430
Yeah, you might all could take me,
but two or three of you will die doing it.

1123
01:24:04,635 --> 01:24:06,193
Now, get back to work.

1124
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:09,674
Easy, Dock. Dock, come on.
Oh, shit.

1125
01:24:09,995 --> 01:24:11,872
WILLIS:
No, no. Shit.

1126
01:24:12,075 --> 01:24:14,794
- Goddamn it.
JESS: He's bleeding to death.

1127
01:24:16,235 --> 01:24:19,193
Oh, shit.
We got to get him to the doctor.

1128
01:24:20,075 --> 01:24:21,713
You hold it.

1129
01:24:21,995 --> 01:24:24,350
We're gonna get you out of here, Hoss.

1130
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:26,432
Damn it. You just hang in there.

1131
01:24:26,755 --> 01:24:29,030
You hold on, Hoss.

1132
01:25:01,675 --> 01:25:04,314
Come on, Dock. Come on, now.

1133
01:25:05,035 --> 01:25:06,832
Come on.

1134
01:25:15,515 --> 01:25:17,312
Did you get it?

1135
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:28,834
JOE:
Come on.

1136
01:25:30,115 --> 01:25:32,834
Easy. Come on, come on.
Get that on there.

1137
01:25:33,035 --> 01:25:34,912
Get the hell out of here.

1138
01:25:35,115 --> 01:25:36,673
Now!

1139
01:25:37,315 --> 01:25:40,352
- I don't think he'll make it.
- Yes, he is. Get us a doctor.

1140
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:43,234
- Out here? Forget it.
- Then we'll bring him to Chicago.

1141
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:46,472
They'll tear the town apart.
A doctor sees him, calls the cops.

1142
01:25:46,635 --> 01:25:48,830
Let's keep our heads.
This could blow the deal.

1143
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:53,233
- We'll split the money and cut our losses.
- Job ain't done till Dock's taken care of.

1144
01:25:53,435 --> 01:25:55,073
- Bad idea.
- Take it easy.

1145
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:57,954
Murray, you know people.
That's why you're in this deal.

1146
01:25:58,155 --> 01:26:01,272
I don't give a goddamn how,
but find someplace and someone.

1147
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:04,114
If you don't, I swear,
you're not gonna make it.

1148
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:06,709
Calm down, Willis. Calm down.
I know a guy.

1149
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,593
Let's go then, goddamn it.

1150
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:15,113
Joe, take Dock with Murray and Slim.
We'll stash the money.

1151
01:26:15,315 --> 01:26:19,354
- Eight shares, eight different places.
SLIM: Trust you with our shares?

1152
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:21,671
We're trusting you with our brother.

1153
01:26:22,155 --> 01:26:23,349
Damn!

1154
01:26:25,275 --> 01:26:27,709
SLIM:
Jesus, Murray, I don't like this.

1155
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:31,151
Somebody had to see us
drag this bloody son of a bitch up here.

1156
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:32,589
Why isn't he dead, doc?

1157
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:35,553
DOCTOR: I don't know. Chest wound
alone should have killed him.

1158
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:38,149
Went in between his heart and his lungs.

1159
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:45,433
I'II, uh, I'll be back tomorrow
to work on the fractures in his arms.

1160
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,433
Keep quiet and don't get seen.

1161
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,752
He wants to win a fiddling contest,
that's his problem.

1162
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:57,952
It'd be a good idea
if we got the hell out of here too.

1163
01:27:09,995 --> 01:27:12,793
Joe? Get.

1164
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:14,314
Hey.

1165
01:27:14,515 --> 01:27:16,790
We ain't leaving you, Dock.

1166
01:27:21,995 --> 01:27:24,873
When you wake up,
I'll be sitting right here.

1167
01:28:05,795 --> 01:28:08,753
Don't pass nothing till you get to Texas.

1168
01:28:28,075 --> 01:28:30,111
Remember, no contact for a year.

1169
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:41,113
He didn't have a hat on, Willis.

1170
01:28:45,675 --> 01:28:48,030
God almighty.

1171
01:29:06,635 --> 01:29:08,193
Joe.

1172
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:19,593
SERGEANT:
Visiting hours is over, pal.

1173
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,552
Fan him.

1174
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:32,150
A pin. Just like the kid.
It's got an anchor on it.

1175
01:29:32,315 --> 01:29:33,509
What's this about?

1176
01:29:33,675 --> 01:29:37,111
- What are you doing up here?
- They told me I could buy beer up here.

1177
01:29:37,315 --> 01:29:39,033
Come a long way for a drink, Tex.

1178
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:42,949
- You got a name, candy boy?
- Yeah, I got a name. Name's Will Reed.

1179
01:29:43,115 --> 01:29:47,472
I'm an oil man, goddamn it.
I'm throwing a party. I came here...

1180
01:29:47,755 --> 01:29:49,473
Party's all over, pal.

1181
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:51,591
We got your buddies two hours ago.

1182
01:29:51,755 --> 01:29:54,315
That was an awful big score
you guys made last night.

1183
01:29:54,475 --> 01:29:57,194
It's too bad half the world saw
you guys coming here.

1184
01:29:57,355 --> 01:29:59,994
I'm just a messenger boy
in this scheme, all right?

1185
01:30:00,155 --> 01:30:03,033
You two seem like good old boys.
We can work something out.

1186
01:30:03,235 --> 01:30:04,873
Is that so?

1187
01:30:10,115 --> 01:30:11,673
I ain't got none of that money...

1188
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,550
...but I can get my hands on
a nice chunk of it, if you're interested.

1189
01:30:18,035 --> 01:30:21,072
They say the value
of money is all relative.

1190
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:25,590
This, for instance, is only 10 smackers.

1191
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:30,470
It's nothing compared
to the millions you crooks pinched.

1192
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:31,994
But...

1193
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,029
...it can pack a pretty hefty wallop.

1194
01:30:39,155 --> 01:30:40,713
Time's relative.

1195
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,593
You're what, 22, 23?

1196
01:30:42,795 --> 01:30:45,593
You'll be 50 years old
before you get out of prison...

1197
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:47,791
...if I don't get some answers.

1198
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:51,431
We got plenty of time.

1199
01:31:01,995 --> 01:31:03,553
Because.

1200
01:31:06,315 --> 01:31:08,033
I need you, Lou.

1201
01:31:16,515 --> 01:31:17,834
Come on.

1202
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:20,472
You can tell me, can't you?

1203
01:31:20,635 --> 01:31:23,274
I know this hurts.

1204
01:31:24,075 --> 01:31:27,112
I hope I die first.

1205
01:31:27,275 --> 01:31:29,470
Chief Schoemaker?
There's a message for you.

1206
01:31:29,635 --> 01:31:33,514
- They say it's urgent.
- Thanks. We'll talk later.

1207
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:05,189
Time is running out, pal.
Looks like you've been jobbed.

1208
01:32:05,355 --> 01:32:08,074
- She'll be here.
- She?

1209
01:32:08,235 --> 01:32:11,352
Yep. She's a business associate.

1210
01:32:11,555 --> 01:32:14,752
She doesn't know what this is about.
She's just bringing the money.

1211
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:17,913
Ain't a skirt in the world I'd trust
with 20 G's.

1212
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:21,234
I'd be worrying
about every time I let her down...

1213
01:32:22,075 --> 01:32:24,953
...every time she caught me
hanging a story on her...

1214
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:29,512
Women never really forgive you
for that stuff.

1215
01:32:29,755 --> 01:32:32,553
DETECTIVE: We've waited a half-hour.
She ain't gonna show.

1216
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:38,709
There she is.

1217
01:32:51,115 --> 01:32:52,389

No, no. See, now,
Jess had nothing to do with this.

He was off running horses...

We got Jess when he came across
the border to ride a pony on a bet.

all the money back...

...who actually
masterminded the robbery?

It's the gentleman sitting there
in the brown suit, William Fahy.

You thought I was gonna...
You thought l...

1518
01:55:39,395 --> 01:55:41,192
I thought you were.

1519
01:55:41,395 --> 01:55:45,070
I thought you were putting your
mask on and were gonna sort of...

1520
01:55:45,315 --> 01:55:48,432
Old habits die hard, don't they, Joe?
Let me ask you.

1521
01:55:48,635 --> 01:55:51,752
Looking back, if you had to do it over,
you wouldn't recommend...

1522
01:55:51,955 --> 01:55:56,710
No! We was crazy for doing it. I look
back and see then. But you're young then.

1523
01:55:56,875 --> 01:56:00,629
Then somebody said, "Why didn't you
invest that money into something?"

1524
01:56:00,835 --> 01:56:03,554
I said, "Who wants a better job
than what we already got?"

1525
01:56:03,755 --> 01:56:06,952
That's what we thought then.
Need money, go rob another bank.

1526
01:56:07,115 --> 01:56:11,154
- But you wouldn't recommend that...
- No, I wouldn't. That'd be crazy. Yeah.

1527
01:56:12,915 --> 01:56:17,352
When I first thought of robbing banks,
I never thought of hurting anybody.

1528
01:56:17,515 --> 01:56:21,474
I knew all of them bankers was rich,
and they didn't care about hurting...

1529
01:56:21,675 --> 01:56:25,634
They didn't care
about hurting us poor farmers.

1530
01:56:25,795 --> 01:56:28,229
So why should I care
about hurting them?

1531
01:56:28,795 --> 01:56:30,592
Why shouldn't I steal from them?

1532
01:56:30,755 --> 01:56:33,474
It's just one thief stealing from another.
