1
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,831
Shoo, now! Shoo!

2
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,839
Ain't you got no better manners
than to eat at the top of a house?

3
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,676
You, Guipago!

4
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,951
<i>You!</i>

5
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,276
<i>Rachel!</i>

6
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,391
What day is today?

7
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,193
Tuesday, I think, Mama. I'm not sure.

8
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,792
Butter tastes kind of wild to me.
Must be the green in springtime grass.

9
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,310
- Guipago!
- Rachel!

10
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,671
- Guipago!
- Rachel, the bread!

11
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,952
Rachel, the bread! Tuesday's bread day!
You gotta make the bread!

12
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,356
You ain't friends with me yet, are you?
Well, neither am I.

13
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,519
Guipago... grey-haired old grass-eater.

14
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,518
You're only half-horse, you know that?

15
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,077
The other half is mean old Kiowa Indian.
Yeah.

16
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,959
Rachel, honey, you'll break your neck!
Both of you!

17
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,516
<i>Whoa.</i>

18
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,518
You ain't gonna let
no skein of geese scare you?

19
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,392
They're only human.

20
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,990
Just fly a little higher than us folk,
that's all.

21
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,396
Giddup, Guipago.

22
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,198
Howdy, mister.

23
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,157
We got food down to the soddy,
if you care to partake.

24
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,359
- What's your name, girl?
- Rachel.

25
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,711
- Rachel what?
- Why, Rachel Zachary.

26
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,277
You're no Zachary.

27
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,516
Not a Zachary born,

28
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,997
but Ma says it's no different
than if I were flesh and blood.

29
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,958
How do you know who I am?
I never seen you before.

30
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,798
I am the sword of God.

31
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,912
The fire and the vengeance,

32
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,953
whereby the wrong shall be righted
and the truth be told.

33
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,996
Well, I declare!

34
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,269
Just what did he look like, Rachel?

35
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,994
Like something blowed in by the wind.

36
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,076
He had a sabre.

37
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,430
- Who is he, Mama?
- I don't know.

38
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,835
Some crazy old hunter, I suppose.

39
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,636
But he knows us. Or about us -
me being a foundling and all.

40
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,637
Nothing so wonderful about that.

41
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,035
Everybody in Texas
knew your ma and pa.

42
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,469
Or heard about them, anyway.

43
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,434
- But the way that he talked...
- Prairie fever.

44
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,597
- What's that?
- The worst thing you can get.

45
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,793
Loneliness. I was touched by it myself
once or twice.

46
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,071
If it wasn't I had a daughter to talk to...

47
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,629
Go in the root cellar and get me
some carrots and potatoes for the stew.

48
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,832
You!

49
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,716
How do, Miz Zachary?

50
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,396
I'd have come sooner,
but I had a long way to ride. Seven years.

51
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,233
You can't kill me.
The god of vengeance will blind your eye.

52
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,353
Death for death and blood for blood.

53
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,596
<i>Mama?</i>

54
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,756
<i>Mama, who you talking to?</i>

55
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,190
Git! How many times
must I tell you to get off my house?

56
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,756
Sorry-looking carrots.

57
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,792
Mama, what's the matter?
You got tears in your eyes.

58
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,273
No, I ain't.

59
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,472
I don't feel much like cooking
with no men in the house.

60
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,239
And your brother Ben away so long.

61
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,152
I wish Ben were here right now.
Right now!

62
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,477
It's a long ride to Wichita.
And even longer back.

63
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,592
I can't wait, Mama. I just can't.

64
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,436
Look at your bread.

65
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,190
It's rising just beautiful, Mama.

66
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,437
Take it out
before it gets too beautiful to eat.

67
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,313
- Shall I take some out to the boys?
- No.

68
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,831
If those big lumps Cash and Andy want
fresh bread, let 'em ride home for it.

69
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,268
- 25, 26, 27. Which counts up to 81 so far!
- All we need is 150.

70
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,996
<i>If I don't have them when Ben arrives,
I'll strap a saddle to my back.</i>

71
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,829
Ben promised to take me on the drive
to Wichita and show me how to live.

72
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,633
You got a way to go.
You ain't even shaved yet.

73
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,150
Ben says they have girls there
which only have first names.

74
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,236
Ben says...

75
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,516
That'll be brother Ben.

76
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,711
- I see you made it.
- Looks that way.

77
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,558
- How's Ma and Rachel?
- Fine.

78
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,750
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, brother.

79
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,396
I don't know about pretty,
but you didn't go to Wichita to be good.

80
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,710
Whoo! What's her name, Ben?

81
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,719
- Tell the truth, I don't recall.
- Don't recall?

82
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,308
By gee, if that ain't the way to live!

83
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,797
- Fine-looking bunch of riders.
- I hand-picked 'em.

84
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,992
- Off the barroom floor.
- They're sober now.

85
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,029
Boys, you can set down here.

86
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,435
No better shade within six miles.

87
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,632
The water is drinkable
if you don't put nothin' in it.

88
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,436
Cash!

89
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,196
Cash!

90
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,435
The one with no whiskers,
is he Injun or ain't he?

91
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,190
When I hire a man,
I don't generally start out by insulting him.

92
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,073
What does he call himself?

93
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,909
- Johnny Portugal.
- They change their names.

94
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,474
All I know,
he's the best horse-tamer in Texas.

95
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,239
If the wind's right,
I can smell Injun a mile off.

96
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,955
I hate to disappoint you, Cash.
That smell's comin' off of me.

97
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,753
I ain't changed my duds since Wichita.

98
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,668
- What did you pay for the fancy soap?
- One silver dollar.

99
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,475
Ain't nothing in Wichita
less than one silver dollar.

100
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,229
Don't matter, though.
Beef at the railhead's 30 cents.

101
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,793
30 cents! We must have a million pounds
out there with our brand on it.

102
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,354
For the first time we're gonna be rich!

103
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,834
- Ben.
- Rachel.

104
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,757
Ben!

105
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,549
Ben! Oh, Ben!

106
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,990
I'm so happy to see you! Oh, Ben!

107
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,708
Don't you cheat, you two.

108
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,356
Cash.

109
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,277
You can look now.

110
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,432
Well, what do you think?

111
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,792
I'm dreaming, ain't I? Ain't I, Ben?

112
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,035
- You must have paid a fortune.
- Not a red cent. Nothing at all.

113
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,914
I made a bet with a man
I could lift it off the floor by myself.

114
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,996
Cash. Andy.

115
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,195
Easy, now.

116
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,591
Must be getting weak.
Did that in Wichita with one finger.

117
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,109
Look here, Rachel. See how it opens.

118
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,278
You're playing the wrong end, daughter.

119
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,673
What makes you so happy, Mama?

120
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,236
Because you ain't sick or dead
or scalped or something worse.

121
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,639
Nothing could kill me except lightning -
and then it'd have to hit twice.

122
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,716
I believe that.

123
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,312
What tune is that, Mama?

124
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,030
Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

125
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,513
- Sounds like angels.
- What is it, Ma?

126
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,758
A pi-anna. Lord of mercy, a pi-anna!

127
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,598
Hallelujah, amen!

128
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,316
Ben Zachary must be counting
on a golden year to buy a pi-anna.

129
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,433
- Giddy-up!
- Pa! I wanna change my dress!

130
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,633
- What's the matter with that one?
- Don't you want her to get married?

131
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,992
Take more than a fancy dress
to catch a Zachary. Go ahead.

132
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,308
Papa! Papa!

133
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,751
Papa!

134
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,677
Give me that gun.

135
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,995
Papa!

136
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,918
- What's the matter, child?
- You snakebit?

137
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,600
- An old man.
- What old man?

138
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,679
He had only one eye and he wore a sabre.
A long sabre.

139
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,314
Get back in the wagon. Put your hat on.

140
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,639
I seen him and he sure seen me,
cos he got that one eye full, Mama!

141
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,197
<i>~ Down in the valley
you hear the wind blow</i>

142
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,792
<i>~ Roses like sunshine, violets like dew</i>

143
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,517
<i>~ Angels in heaven know I love you</i>

144
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,470
God love you, Ben,
for staying partners with a man like me.

145
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,354
It's been a burden doing business
with an honest, decent man.

146
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,392
- And crippled.
- Indian knife done that, Mattilda.

147
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,476
Indian squaw, Rachel, honey.

148
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,230
While he was tied captive
by them Kiowa devils!

149
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,638
We licked 'em good last time.
Us and our picayune neighbours.

150
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,719
- Four years ago Christmas, down there.
- You flushed 'em and I shot 'em.

151
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,231
- Ain't showed a feather in four years!
- Four good years for buzzards!

152
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,399
Groundhog, blue potatoes
and all the alkali salt you can eat!

153
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,149
Froze to the saddle!
A sunburn right through your clothes!

154
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,875
That twister two years ago,
like a big black dog chasing his tail!

155
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,391
And the turnaround down in the spring,
when the crick dried up and they all died!

156
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,397
Great God in the morning!

157
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,069
But now, this year, Mother, fat!

158
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,792
By the grace of God!

159
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,354
Fat as ever I've seen 'em in all my days!

160
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,118
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

161
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,279
We did it together, Ben.
Us Rawlins and you Zacharys.

162
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,349
What sayeth the Lord? The Lord sayeth
"Be fruitful and multiply. "

163
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,678
Multiply! We old folks
done all the multiplying we can!

164
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,110
You say. Therefore, Ben, Mattilda,

165
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,789
I'd like to see
our two families joined together.

166
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,275
- Keep talking, Papa.
- I don't mean you.

167
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,119
Not yet, anyway. Pull your dress down.

168
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,196
Who then, partner?

169
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,837
- He means me.
- You?

170
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,072
Charlie?

171
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,110
Charlie, come here.

172
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,997
Speak up, Charlie.
Tell my brother what you want.

173
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,511
Me?

174
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,956
- Nothing, sir.
- You're a liar, Charlie.

175
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,834
Yes, ma'am. I supposin' I am.

176
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,155
Tell him, Charlie, or I'll tell him.

177
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,479
Ben Zachary, sir,
I want to come courting.

178
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,069
- Courting who?
- Rachel.

179
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,992
My baby sister?

180
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,715
She's a pretty big baby.
And big enough, soon enough!

181
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,992
- Hush! You're getting drunk.
- Drunk! Drunk don't tell lies.

182
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,193
Well, Ben, what say you?

183
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,955
- I'll think on it.
- Huh! You'll think on it!

184
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,389
And that's all he'll ever do too, Papa.

185
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,432
The same goes with Cash Zachary.

186
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,838
I'm 20 years old and
I've been waiting 20 years to get married!

187
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,350
Maybe you ain't asked the right Zachary.

188
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,918
- Do you love me, Andy?
- I do, except you're tearing my coat.

189
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,749
- Do you want to marry me, Andy?
- I'd like that just fine.

190
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,519
Except I promised myself
I'd go to Wichita first.

191
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,392
What in the world for?

192
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,478
Well, I ain't never in my life had...

193
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,038
a glass of beer.

194
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,879
Oh. How long will that take, Andy?

195
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,115
- A month or two.
- I can't wait. I just can't.

196
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,879
I found a grey hair in my head
this morning.

197
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,355
Cash, you know you love Georgia.

198
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,040
<i>- Do I?
- He don't.</i>

199
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,709
- Don't I?
- I don't want him. I hate him.

200
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,518
Come here, Georgia.

201
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,438
No, not in a million years.

202
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,676
I said come here.

203
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,791
Dust him good, Georgia.

204
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,278
Closer.

205
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,470
Georgia, you just spoiled the best chance
you ever had of getting me married.

206
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,716
I hate you!

207
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,798
I'll kill him!
I'll kill all the men in the whole world!

208
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,356
Honey, pretty,
you'd just be sorry tomorrow.

209
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,430
Honey, pretty, if you're that anxious to get
married, there's an old man in the brush...

210
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,709
What old man? Georgia?

211
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,756
He didn't mention his name.

212
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,793
Mama, that's the old hunter.
The one I told you about.

213
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,554
What old hunter?

214
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,709
Mama, was anybody here?

215
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,789
Nobody, Cash. Nobody at all.

216
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,196
But, Mama, that crazy old man.
The one with the sabre.

217
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,356
Oh, him.

218
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,153
- Did you see him, Mama?
- Yes.

219
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,034
Many a time.
I've seen a hundred if I've seen one.

220
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,993
They all look alike to me. Lonely.

221
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,679
Lonely men are riding
all over this country.

222
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,837
Buffalo hunters, only the buffalo's gone.

223
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,159
I feel sorry for 'em.
No home, no family.

224
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,475
Sorry for 'em, I tell you.

225
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,431
Yahoo!

226
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,073
Will you do something for me, Cash?
Stay home.

227
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,509
It's a dirty job. I'm coming along.

228
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,553
<i>~ Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

229
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,993
<i>~ Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

230
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,356
Zacharys are finished!

231
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,715
Cash? Seen him?

232
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,277
- You hear him shout something?
- Was it him or the wind?

233
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,470
- I saw the flash of his sabre.
- Where?

234
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,194
First over there and then over here.

235
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,716
- Maybe there's two of him.
- Well, there's two of us.

236
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,315
Arrows of God upon them!

237
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
He can't get far on a dead horse.

238
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,876
- Cash?
- Yeah.

239
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,794
I can't see for nothing, Ben.

240
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,957
Couldn't see a standing mountain
in this storm.

241
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,118
It's hopeless, Cash. Hopeless for now.

242
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,391
Be three or four days
till this norther blows itself out.

243
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,796
Three or four days, he'll be dead.
He'll dry up and blow away.

244
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,071
Kelseys don't die. They got to be killed.

245
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,274
Ben! Get him!

246
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,359
Hang on, Ben!

247
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,751
OK. OK.

248
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,038
Hang on, boy! Hang on, now!

249
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,589
Look at him! He'll never make it!

250
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,190
- Hold him! I'll ride him!
- You can get him, Charlie! Come on!

251
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,469
Ride him, Charlie! Ride him!

252
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,277
Stay with him, Charlie!

253
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,348
Charlie!

254
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,278
You don't hurt me none!

255
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,153
You didn't ride him long enough
to get warm.

256
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,353
I'm right proud of you, Charlie.

257
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,715
Don't feel bad.
Ain't a man that can't be thrown.

258
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,037
Or ain't a horse that can't be rode.

259
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,311
Why don't you give her a try, paleface?

260
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,034
Easy, girl, easy.

261
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,076
Easy.

262
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,193
Ain't you the prettiest devil I ever did see?

263
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,514
I'm going to ride you now.

264
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
Easy and slow.

265
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,074
It ain't going to hurt much.

266
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,839
Not after the first time, anyway.

267
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,312
You've got a bur in your pretty hair,
ma'am.

268
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,519
Finish him, Ben. One less redhide.

269
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,678
You shut up, Cash.

270
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,835
- Ben's a mite touchy about Rachel.
- Yeah.

271
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,750
I got pay coming. And a bonus
for every horse I busted so far.

272
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,633
- We pay off in Wichita.
- I ain't fired?

273
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,877
What for?
You're the party done all the suffering.

274
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,156
Anybody else
see a bur in my sister's hair?

275
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,871
You, Rachel.

276
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,074
What reason you got to come smiling and
sashaying round here other than female?

277
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,555
Am I so different from the other women?

278
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,750
They stick to their wagons.

279
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,031
Maybe they're just not interested
in finding a husband.

280
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,118
Get on your horse and go home to Mama.

281
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,312
<i>Ben!</i>

282
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,633
Ben!

283
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,233
- What?
- He's gone!

284
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,828
- Who?
- Guipago's gone.

285
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,954
Guipago gone?

286
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,119
He wouldn't run away with his reins down.
I know he'd stand.

287
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,471
Who could have been so mean
as to steal him?

288
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,916
- Maybe he run away.
- Not with his reins down. He'd stand.

289
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,275
If that don't beat all!

290
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,239
We ought to put up 100 dollars
for that horse and a dollar for the thief.

291
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,432
We both know who stole the horse.
We'll have to find him.

292
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,154
Only an Injun
would be crazy enough to steal him.

293
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,192
Like Zeb's saying, Ben,
I think it's Injun work.

294
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,278
- It's Injun work, all right.
- Maybe.

295
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,839
Come on, Rachel, honey.
Get on behind me. We're going home.

296
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,272
Ben, I never seen you so oddly thoughtful.

297
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,317
I don't care about that old horse
if it's gonna worry you.

298
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,512
It ain't the horse, exactly.

299
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,349
- Tell me. It must be something dreadful.
- It's nothing.

300
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,273
Are you mad at me for sashaying around?

301
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,437
When I get you home,
I'm gonna whup you.

302
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,509
Tell me again, Ben.

303
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,436
Tell you what?

304
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,831
About the night Papa brought me home
and the stars were falling.

305
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,951
Yes.

306
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,514
You were the prettiest baby I ever did see.

307
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,519
- Am I still pretty?
- Nope. Old age has overtook you.

308
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,397
I saw blue butterflies
down by the crick this morning.

309
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,397
About a million of them.

310
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,954
They were flying in twos,
like sweethearts.

311
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,913
With four wings apiece.

312
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,759
That ain't a ladylike thing to say, is it?

313
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,112
Hang on to these days, Rachel.
Don't grow up too fast.

314
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,631
I got a big choice in this country, Ben.

315
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,195
I could marry
that handsome, winsome Charlie.

316
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,311
Or that baby Jude.

317
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,631
- I could even marry you.
- Watch your language, girl.

318
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,116
Why not? We're not cousins.
We're not even relatives.

319
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,515
We're not even friends.

320
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,237
Ben, if you met me in Wichita,
and had never saw me before,

321
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,593
would you take after me hat in hand,
mouth open, drunk or sober?

322
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,956
I just made up my mind.

323
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,673
Have you, Ben? Have you?

324
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,430
I'm gonna tell Charlie
he can come courting if he wants to.

325
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,279
I already told him that.

326
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,560
Wake up, Cash. We got company.

327
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,388
What is it? What is it, Ben?

328
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,432
Kiowas! Dirty stinking Kiowas!

329
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,869
- What do they want, Ben?
- I don't know.

330
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,310
But we'd better fort up.

331
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,794
Rachel, stay away from that window.

332
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,912
May the Lord bless this food.

333
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,951
Andy.

334
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,116
And may the Lord deliver us from evil,
red or white.

335
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,753
Amen.

336
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,713
Turn your plates over and hop to.

337
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,916
- Fill up, Andy.
- I'm a little off my feed this morning.

338
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,674
Ain't this something?

339
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,318
We sit here eating with the smell of those
killers comin' through that window.

340
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,796
<i>There's only three of them.
We can kill 'em before breakfast!</i>

341
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,356
All right, Cash.

342
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,392
Let's first make sure
they're after our scalps.

343
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,956
I'm gonna waste one.

344
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,590
<i>They don't scare for nothing.</i>

345
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,429
Medicine! They think
they've got bulletproof medicine.

346
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,757
I'm going to parley.
Don't shoot unless you have to.

347
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,678
- When is that?
- When they break the peace and kill me.

348
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,395
No, Ben! You ain't to go out there!

349
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,511
Mama, I got some shirts need fixing.

350
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,598
- You ain't to go out there!
- Mama.

351
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,995
I'd hate to have to shut you in your room.

352
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,953
Rachel, get away from that window. Now.

353
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,951
I come in peace.

354
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,150
My land.

355
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,998
My sky.

356
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,239
You are welcome.

357
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,388
Young horses. Good for fighting.

358
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,750
Good for hunting.

359
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,238
- You take.
- I am ashamed.

360
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,954
I have nothing as good
to give you in return.

361
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,909
You have in your house... woman.

362
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,077
One of our woman.

363
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,115
- Who told you this?
- Man of your tribe.

364
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,555
Old man. Carry long knife.

365
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,352
Him crazy.

366
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,311
Crazy man.

367
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,910
Sun... speak through him.

368
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,955
Dead people speak through mouth.

369
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,753
He speak.

370
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,031
Woman... my sister.

371
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,879
I her brother.

372
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,228
He lies.

373
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,193
How much woman worth?

374
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,670
There are not enough horses
to pay for her.

375
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,190
Not all you can own or all you can steal.

376
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,478
We want see.

377
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,433
You show her to us.

378
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,393
The woman in my house is white.

379
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,118
Father white. Mother white.

380
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,595
They burned to death by you.

381
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,551
Kiowa!

382
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,791
You scared them. They're running.

383
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,629
- I told you to stay away from the window.
- I ain't afraid.

384
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,194
- I am.
- What did he want, Ben?

385
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,149
He wanted to buy a woman.

386
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,838
You.

387
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,037
- Did you sell me?
- I held out for more horses.

388
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,709
- Why would they want to buy me?
- Because you're a girl, my pretty.

389
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,958
Horses and women are all the same
to a Kiowa. To be bought or traded.

390
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,152
- How did they hear about me?
- They must have seen you.

391
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,671
Kiowas are like panthers. Always
sneaking about when you can't see 'em.

392
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,918
The one in the white buckskin,
I'll never forget him. He was beautiful.

393
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,271
A Kiowa? You're daft, child.

394
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,119
Look! He's coming back.

395
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,598
Just like the one that killed Papa.

396
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,478
He's out of range, Cash. Save your lead.

397
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,478
Cash! Cash!

398
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,873
Ben, we could have killed him!
We could have killed him!

399
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,076
Cash.

400
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,390
I reckon
you'd better take the drive to Wichita.

401
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,315
I'd like that fine, Ben, but if trouble's
coming I want to be here for it.

402
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,278
We got 6,000 cows. A lifetime's work.

403
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,439
I'd take it most kindly
if you'd take the drive to Wichita.

404
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,874
Put it that way, I guess I gotta.

405
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,315
<i>Pa! Injuns! Kiowas!</i>

406
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,749
- Injuns!
- Kiowas!

407
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,838
- Red Injuns, Papa!
- Kiowas. Come down out of the hills.

408
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,239
A whole passel of 'em. Running across
the swale! We come on 'em sudden.

409
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,271
- Charlie?
- Yes, Papa?

410
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,153
- You two been drinking?
- No, Papa.

411
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,239
That's the truth, Papa.
We could have lost our hair.

412
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,477
- I even seen war paint.
- You get back on them irons.

413
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,795
- But, Papa...
- Git!

414
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,840
Come on, Charlie. How many were there?

415
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,112
If I was to guess, it'd be anywhere...

416
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,677
To tell the truth, they were four,

417
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,190
but they were taking the time of day,
brazen as can be.

418
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,355
They see you?

419
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,914
They must have seen our dust.
Paid us no heed.

420
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,033
Hunting party, most likely.
Probably back in the hills already.

421
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,799
I told you, Zeb.
Indian sign all over the range.

422
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,077
You spent more time with cattle instead
of sign, we could get this drive started.

423
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,398
All right, Charlie, let's run 'em through.
Come on.

424
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,709
Why don't that old man come round us

425
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,389
instead of sidling up to our womenfolk
when we're away?

426
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,273
- If there be truth...
- It's gotta be faced up.

427
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,039
We gotta go to Zeb, tell him what...

428
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,591
Keep those brands high on the hip
so we can see them from a long way off.

429
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,198
- Did you hear me, Tom?
- I heard you.

430
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,398
Ben! Ben!

431
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,230
The word is out, Ben.

432
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,794
- Kiowa scare talk.
- No, they've heard the lie.

433
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,150
It's sitting on their stomachs.

434
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,113
It's still a lie.
We got nothing to be ashamed of.

435
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,357
Ben.
What are you gonna do when they say it?

436
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,519
What will you do
when they say it to Rachel's face?

437
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,279
Kill 'em, I guess.
Or anyone else who says it.

438
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,709
That's all I wanted to hear.

439
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,232
Well?

440
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,229
- What's on your minds?
- We want to talk to you, Zeb.

441
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,592
- Later.
- Now, Zeb. While they ain't here.

442
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,513
- Oh. Who ain't here?
- The Zacharys.

443
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,515
Well?

444
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,679
Don't it seem queer them Kiowas
pick right now to move out of the hills?

445
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,510
Maybe the old man be loony, and maybe
they be lies he be telling our womenfolk.

446
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,235
But we got a stake here
in this land, in these cattle.

447
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,999
Maybe not as big as you, but still a stake.

448
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,271
Got our families to think of, Zeb.
Wives, children.

449
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,868
Them red devils
move down on us now because...

450
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,150
Well, because...

451
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,793
Say it.

452
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,399
Go ahead, say it.

453
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,797
Well, speak up, why don't you?

454
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,754
Anyone here just say she be Injun blood,

455
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,198
you'll get from me
what her brothers'd give you.

456
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,509
You wait till Ben's back's turned.

457
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,200
Ben!

458
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,551
Who put you hog-high for four years

459
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,832
when you might have had nothing
to chew on but buffalo grass.

460
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,353
You take this filth,

461
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,109
you believe this filth from an old man,

462
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,277
and then you take it up with me
instead of Ben.

463
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,913
Jude!

464
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,956
Take over here.

465
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,439
Hiya!

466
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,719
We'll make two more tonight, huh, Ben?

467
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,519
Ought to finish branding before daylight.

468
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,872
If the weather holds out, we could
start the drive to Wichita tomorrow.

469
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,950
- You hear something, Ben?
- Get back, Rachel.

470
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,832
Andy.

471
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,870
You there! Put your hands on your hat!

472
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,596
- Both of them.
- It's me, Ben. I ain't fooling you.

473
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,312
It's only me.

474
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,193
What in hell are you doing out here?

475
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,838
I saw Rachel standing in there.
I guess I'm too shy to come forward.

476
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,759
- Does your old man know you're here?
- Sure. He gave me his courting hat.

477
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,112
- Claims he has no more use for it.
- You can put your hands down.

478
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,071
Thank you, sir.

479
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,237
- Go home. It's getting late.
- No, sir, I can't do that.

480
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,873
I come to ask the question,
hoping she'll say yes.

481
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,673
If she don't,
I ain't coming back here no more.

482
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,392
I'm gonna leave home.

483
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,115
Go to San Francisco,
get a job on the first vessel I see.

484
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,516
Maybe go to China.
I ain't thought that far ahead yet.

485
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,153
- Rachel.
- I'm right here.

486
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,950
You ain't about to shoot Charlie,
are you, Ben?

487
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,310
I've been thinking about it.

488
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,398
But as long as I'm so short-handed, no.

489
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,599
Aren't you gonna kiss me, Charlie?

490
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,915
Ain't he kinda close?

491
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,600
You're gonna kiss me, not him.

492
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,079
Ben! I just kissed Charlie!

493
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,079
- So I'll have to marry him, I suppose.
- How do you say, Ben?

494
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,555
- I'll think on it.
- No.

495
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,433
Say yes or no right this minute,
Ben Zachary.

496
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,592
- Well, it's come to pass, Mama.
- What, Ben?

497
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,553
There's gonna be the biggest, noisiest,

498
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,672
most devilish, glorious
drinking and dancing wedding

499
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,917
ever celebrated
in this godforsaken part of the world.

500
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,079
- Wedding? Cash and Georgia!
- Not me, Mama.

501
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,476
- I'm talking about Rachel.
- Rachel?

502
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,192
Oh...

503
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,030
Give me some!

504
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,271
That's Wichita whisky. Aged four minutes.
Not long enough to cure whatever's in it.

505
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,198
- I know, but I need it.
- So do I.

506
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,233
My own little baby.
My own little baby getting married!

507
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,476
Charlie, he said yes!

508
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,636
- Rachel...
- Yippee!

509
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,755
Now tell me truth, girl.

510
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,948
Do you love him, Rachel?

511
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,558
Of course I do. Wouldn't any girl?

512
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,392
Ain't he the handsomest man walking?

513
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,756
I kissed her!

514
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,910
I kissed her.

515
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,679
No, it ain't possible.

516
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,196
I did kiss her. By God I did, baby!

517
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,072
I kissed her!

518
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,556
I kissed her! It's true I kissed her!

519
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,716
Whoa!

520
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,237
Ma thanks you kindly for coming.

521
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,158
There, there!

522
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,751
Zeb.

523
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,716
She don't seem to know me, child.

524
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,594
- I've got to put my arms around her.
- Yes, dear.

525
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,760
Don't touch me!

526
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,394
Don't touch me!

527
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,635
Get out of this house!

528
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,232
Dirty Injun, with your Injun ways!

529
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,954
- Ain't you done enough?
- Miz Rawlins...

530
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,594
Wound yourself around my son Charlie

531
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,430
to get yourself a litter of half-breeds
to run around my Charlie's cabin!

532
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,039
Squaw!

533
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,798
Kiowa squaw!

534
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,115
Red nigger as ever was!

535
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,435
- What does she mean?
- It's her grief.

536
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,951
You killed him. You killed him!

537
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,514
- You killed him!
- Woman...

538
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,029
- You killed him!
- Be quiet.

539
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,033
I've got to know the why of it, Ben.

540
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,199
It's the last thing I want to ask you,
but I've got to know.

541
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,390
All right, Zeb.

542
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,512
There'll be no branding cattle,
no drive to Wichita

543
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,915
till we settle this thing between us.

544
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,315
I'll take every man who can sit a horse.

545
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,149
I'll bring him before you to admit his lies
before I hang him.

546
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,913
Pray God they be lies, Ben.

547
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,157
I want every man jack of you
to ride with me.

548
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,036
It ain't his.

549
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,432
- That's Guipago all right.
- He's an hour ahead of us.

550
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,358
On that white stallion,
that's as good as a week.

551
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,275
<i>~ Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

552
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,279
<i>~ Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

553
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,349
Look at him. Damn his ugly soul!
Sitting up there laughing at us.

554
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,233
<i>~ Glory, glory, halle...</i>

555
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:49,434
I want the man who rides lightest to take
my horse and two others and go after him.

556
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,279
That'll be you, Portugal. Where are you?

557
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,794
How much are you paying?

558
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,036
Nothing.

559
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,870
Give me that horse.

560
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,276
Giddup!

561
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,551
<i>Ha-ha!</i>

562
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,995
<i>Here they come!</i>

563
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,629
It's a welcome sight!

564
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,512
I say it in my heart,

565
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,077
it's a welcome sight
to see you folks here gathered.

566
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,033
How do, Mr Rawlins, sir?

567
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,196
You think you've got a horse thief here.
Well, you ain't.

568
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,880
That horse I took from an Injun girl.

569
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,434
A redhide Injun.

570
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,518
And you can't do a man hurt for that,
now, can you?

571
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,871
Mr Rawlins,
I want you to know how sorry I am

572
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,434
about your son, Mr Rawlins.

573
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,076
There's nobody here knows
better than me what it is to lose a son.

574
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,839
How did you know my son was dead?

575
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,189
Someone told me, of course.

576
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,154
- Who told you?
- Must have been somebody here.

577
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,675
Whoever it was,
would you step forward, please?

578
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,795
I ain't gonna die.

579
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,276
Put it around his neck, boys.

580
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,668
Devils! You all turned to devils, devils!

581
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,076
You're all gonna burn on the day, devils.

582
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,760
Look at that book, Mr Kelsey.

583
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,233
Touch your hands to it!

584
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,269
It's the Holy Bible, Mr Kelsey.

585
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,949
Your last chance to cleanse your soul
before you meet your maker.

586
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:51,153
God, O God, have them hearken unto me.

587
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,035
To me, O God,
whose own son was took by the Kiowas.

588
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,720
Rachel Zachary.

589
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,990
I want to know about Rachel Zachary.

590
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,236
Injun. Redhide whelp as ever was.

591
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,439
True. It's true.

592
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,759
His papa knew.

593
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,355
Go on, old man.

594
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,350
And he knew my boy.

595
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,515
His name was Aaron.

596
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,870
He had blue eyes.

597
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,956
Young as he was,

598
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,675
I taught him to hold and fire a gun.

599
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,756
Tell us about Rachel Zachary.

600
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,316
It was raining.

601
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,752
Long ago.

602
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:02,674
We saddled up,
Will Zachary and me and many others.

603
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,556
Riding against the Kiowas
for a massacre they done.

604
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,160
We come to an Injun camp.

605
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,509
We killed

606
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,756
and we killed

607
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,759
and we had to lay down tired of the killing.

608
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,435
I heard a baby cry.

609
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,314
I went and found her.

610
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:35,309
A little baby
strapped to a Kiowa cradle board.

611
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,711
She had Injun paint on her belly,

612
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,118
on the flat of her hands
and the soles of her feet.

613
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,513
I had my hand on her throat

614
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,351
and Will Zachary said to me
"There'll be no more killing. "

615
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,755
"No more killing today. "

616
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,152
And he took her from me.

617
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,556
I swear it.

618
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,195
I swear it as I know I'm about to die.

619
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,156
I swear it to you, God.

620
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,160
And he took her to Mattilda
and they kept her as theirs.

621
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:29,875
Kept her in their own house.

622
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,754
And when the Kiowas captured my boy,

623
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:40,592
I come to Will Zachary and I said
"Give me that redhide baby for to trade,

624
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,998
to take to the Kiowas
for to get back my boy. "

625
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,830
Will Zachary wouldn't do it.

626
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,030
He wouldn't do it.

627
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,992
And my boy stayed captive.

628
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,436
His son is dead.

629
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,675
Killed by the Kiowas.

630
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,678
The very day my papa found Rachel -

631
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,759
in a settler's wagon,
wrapped in a Boston blanket.

632
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,477
Her parents were killed
by the same Kiowas that killed his son.

633
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,397
But he wouldn't believe that.

634
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,671
He came to my papa and he said
"Will Zachary, swap her. "

635
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,836
"Swap Rachel. "

636
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,474
"She's white, but she's a foundling. "

637
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,753
"Give her to the Indians
so I can get my son back. "

638
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,271
That's what he said to my papa,
and my papa ran him off the land.

639
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,552
And Abe Kelsey rode vengeance on us

640
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,116
till the people in each town
turned against us.

641
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,630
Till my papa was killed by a Kiowa lance.

642
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,475
And that old man made you run.

643
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,833
That poor old man
chased you from town to town.

644
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,953
That poor old man with his lies.

645
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,232
No. You run from the truth.

646
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,478
She knows.

647
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,309
She that washed off that Kiowa paint.

648
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,829
Washed it all off!

649
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,069
Though she still be
as brown as the bark of a tree.

650
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,354
I hanged him! I hanged him!

651
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,552
Abe Kelsey won't go on
to destroy no-one else with his lies.

652
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,911
It's finished, and high time.

653
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,072
Jude! Boys, lift me up.

654
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,554
I want to look at the man's face.

655
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,952
Can a man lie
when he goes to meet his creator?

656
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,832
He wasn't lying, Zeb!

657
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,919
I told you that! And now you know it.

658
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,310
Rachel! Come here.

659
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,509
Come on, child. I ain't gonna hurt you.

660
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,676
Rachel! No!

661
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,356
I ain't scared, Mama.

662
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,834
You're dark. Darker than most.
But that could be the sun.

663
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,632
We have to look at your body.

664
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,675
- You leave her be.
- Strip her down! Strip her down naked!

665
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,918
Let the women
take her in the house and undress her.

666
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:00,431
Anyone touches her, I'll put a bullet
through their God-fearing gut!

667
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,078
Ben, I've loved you
as well as I've loved my own sons,

668
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,475
but we're finished.

669
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,354
Unless you pack this girl back
to the Kiowas, we're partners no more.

670
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,396
Cash. Andy.

671
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,511
We're leaving.

672
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,592
<i>Five years' work gone for nothing.</i>

673
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,473
You'll lose every cent
tied up in the cattle.

674
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,909
That's what you're doing, Ben.

675
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,080
Not a man here'll stand up with you.

676
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,111
Not one, Ben.

677
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,674
Early in the morning
we'll cut out your herd.

678
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:47,195
May God help you, Ben.

679
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,993
Nobody here will.

680
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,312
Ben.

681
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,356
I smell Injun.

682
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,676
Rachel, Mama, don't move.

683
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,508
Let in some light, Cash.

684
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,436
What is it?

685
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,270
It's Kiowa.

686
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,960
A page out of their Bible, like.

687
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,757
Like chronicles.

688
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,474
This is old, Ben. Feel it.

689
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:55,599
30-odd years recorded here.
Winter by winter.

690
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,835
What does it say?

691
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,472
Falling stars.

692
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,068
The year of the falling stars.

693
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,556
Baby girl strapped to a cradle.

694
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,910
- Burn it!
- Don't touch it, Mama.

695
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,270
Burn it, Ben! I won't have it in my house!

696
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,834
Please, Mama.

697
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,110
Read what it says, Ben.

698
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,996
Read it, Ben.

699
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,752
Kiowa baby girl stolen from their camp.

700
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,997
By white men, with rifles.

701
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,678
Did Abe Kelsey paint this, Mama?

702
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,359
Did he do this?
Did he put these lies down year by year?

703
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,078
Did he, Mama? Did he?

704
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,034
That man you hanged last night
in Rawlins' yard.

705
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,071
You tell me, Mama.

706
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,680
Answer him, Mama.

707
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,552
Answer him, Mama.

708
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,432
All right!

709
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,551
It's the truth.

710
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,396
<i>My sister's an Injun?</i>

711
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,471
Yes.

712
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,670
Yes.

713
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,870
Yes!

714
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:12,839
If we could only raise some decent
flowers instead of these scrawny things.

715
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,592
Your papa brought me the little girl child.

716
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,869
He put her in my arms as I lay crying.

717
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,875
I'd just lost my own little girl baby
with yellow curls.

718
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,276
Not old enough
to be named when she died.

719
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,790
So I gave her promised name to Rachel.

720
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,638
My ownest Rachel.

721
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,593
My beautiful little Indian baby.

722
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,032
My breasts were hurting with all that milk.

723
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,029
I wish we could raise nasturtiums.

724
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,949
Then we could have a yardful,
like when I was a girl.

725
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,674
I just love nasturtiums.

726
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,869
What you fixing to do, Ben?

727
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,990
Get this wood in.

728
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,830
I mean about everything.

729
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,835
We can't stay here no longer, Ben.

730
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,110
We got to pull up stakes.

731
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,470
Or else send Rachel away.

732
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,275
A man sets down roots, Cash.

733
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,995
He don't like 'em cut off -
by Kiowas or anyone else.

734
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,232
With her out of here
we could at least get our cattle to market.

735
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,190
Cash, you want the cattle that bad,
you take them. All of them.

736
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,709
You tell Zeb
you and me don't see eye to eye.

737
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,796
And that's for truth.

738
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,388
Take that cattle drive and keep the profits.

739
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,590
Don't twist my words around, Ben.

740
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,757
- We've got to get her out of here.
- Where to?

741
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,836
An Injun camp?

742
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,349
Or to squat
outside the garrison at Wichita

743
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,517
and pick up silver dollars
from the troopers, huh?

744
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,236
Why don't you say it, Cash?

745
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,715
Damn you, why don't you say it?

746
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,991
It's not Kiowas or cattle!
It's the Injun in the house!

747
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,999
Get her out of here!
I don't care how! Get her out of here!

748
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,076
I'm staying, Cash.

749
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,873
She's staying.
We're all staying.

750
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,436
I'm not staying.
Not with a redhide nigger!

751
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,956
Get going, Cash.

752
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,917
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy!

753
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,759
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy! Piggy, piggy!

754
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,633
<i>Here, piggy, piggy!</i>

755
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,596
Cash!

756
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,711
Cash!

757
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,238
- Cash!
- I left my family.

758
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,715
- Why?
- They turned.

759
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,435
Indian lovers! Injun lovers!

760
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,074
Can't stay there no more.

761
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,397
Can't stay there no more.

762
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,115
I'm a little bit drunk, Georgia.

763
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,800
You can sleep it off in there.

764
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,436
Or there's the bed in my room,
if you marry me.

765
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,276
I'm drunk, but I ain't that drunk.

766
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,513
Oh, Cash, come on!

767
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,312
Ben!

768
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,472
Ben!

769
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,636
They're coming.

770
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,956
The same three, it looks like.

771
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,992
- Only three?
- That's all that's coming up.

772
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,829
But I figure there's 40 strong
across the river.

773
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,673
You figure they came to parley, Ben?

774
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,473
They'll ask for her first.

775
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,068
Then they'll try to take her.

776
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,156
Rachel?

777
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,070
- Rachel.
- I'm going out there, Ben.

778
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,036
There won't be any fight.

779
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,715
I'm going out to my people,
where I belong!

780
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,431
You're staying here.

781
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,192
You can stop me now,
but I'll go out to them first chance I get.

782
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,356
- Andy?
- Sir?

783
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,357
They still out there?

784
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,551
- They're still there.
- Kill one.

785
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,717
Kill one?
They're under a sign of peace, Ben.

786
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,196
- Kill one!
- No! No!

787
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,510
Go ahead, Andy.

788
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,198
It's done, Ben.

789
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,073
- They'll never turn back now.
- You can bet on it.

790
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:44,188
Not till you're all dead.

791
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,630
Ain't much point in going out now,
is there?

792
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,030
Why didn't you let me go?

793
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,993
Why did you stop me?

794
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:11,074
When Mama told the truth this morning
I wanted to die.

795
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,674
And you wanted to die too.

796
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,156
I could see it in your faces.
You had to turn away.

797
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,596
Why let yourselves be killed
on account of me?

798
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,756
Little Injun.

799
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,430
Little redhide Injun.

800
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,435
- Andy.
- Sir?

801
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:02,074
Turn out that light.

802
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:19,635
That gun shoots a little high, Rachel,
so draw a fine bead.

803
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,393
When they get so close you want
to scream, don't scream, just shoot.

804
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,073
What if I can't do it, Ben?

805
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,312
You can.

806
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,032
I've never killed anybody before.

807
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,196
The gun does the killing.

808
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,033
- My own kind.
- By blood, yes.

809
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,515
But not by anything else.

810
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,469
Funny. I don't remember
all them bushes out there.

811
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,391
- There wasn't.
- How's that, Ben?

812
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,356
One of them's moving.

813
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,199
Slow down, Andy.
You're shooting too fast.

814
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,276
Sister!

815
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,549
We did it.

816
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,114
We beat 'em off!

817
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,310
Just like I said.

818
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:38,111
- I did what you told me.
- You did fine. Real fine.

819
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,275
The music of their flutes.

820
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,075
Magic.

821
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,316
To make them bulletproof.

822
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,675
We'll give them some magic of our own.
Lend a hand, Andy.

823
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,592
Mama!

824
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,636
Play something, Mama.

825
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,079
Make it loud. Good and loud.

826
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,077
Mama, that's enough magic for tonight.

827
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:17,118
Andy, you take over Mama's gunport.

828
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,998
Here they come.

829
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,038
Andy! To the side port!

830
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,796
Still on its hinges, Ben?

831
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,996
Still holding.

832
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,876
What is it?

833
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,150
I hear gunfire.

834
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:44,433
- In your head.
- No, I hear it, I tell you.

835
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:49,156
You couldn't, Cash.
Your house is ten miles away.

836
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,472
Yeah. It's stopped now.

837
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,192
I didn't hear anything
even before it stopped.

838
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,558
- Could be they ran out of ammunition.
- Forget about that.

839
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:14,150
Don't think about anything but me.

840
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,197
I know I could make you happy.

841
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,390
I know it, Cash.

842
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,711
Now, Cash.

843
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,956
Right now.

844
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,719
Georgia, get me some ammunition.

845
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,150
Rim-fires, if you've got 'em.
All you can spare.

846
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,830
- Papa has 'em locked up. He wouldn't...
- I know!

847
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,636
He wouldn't lift his little finger off his Bible
to save a Zachary.

848
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,876
Stay here, Cash.

849
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,793
Don't think about anything
in the whole world except me.

850
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,873
- Andy?
- Sir?

851
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,309
How's the ammunition holding up?

852
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,235
- Not too many, Ben.
- No more firing till they go to break in.

853
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:24,433
And here. Give this to Mama.

854
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,076
Rachel.

855
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,151
Just in case.

856
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,596
Ma!

857
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:52,391
- You've been hit.
- My arm. Nothing much to it.

858
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,034
Get back to your gunport, Andy.

859
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,116
Mama.

860
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,519
Mama,
you better get some rest while you can.

861
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,950
Stop fussing. I've hurt myself worse
with a kitchen knife.

862
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,310
You just lie here a while.

863
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,390
I'll be all right, I tell you.

864
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,916
Keep this by you.

865
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,076
Oh, Mama.

866
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,674
My poor baby. My baby.

867
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,837
- I'm sorry if I did wrong.
- Hush, Mama.

868
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,072
About Cash...

869
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:34,398
Don't mind. He was always
fiery-tempered, even as a little boy.

870
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,715
You don't have to explain Cash to me.

871
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,638
Andy, you still got those lead soldiers?

872
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,355
- I ain't played with them since...
- I know where they are, Ben.

873
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,553
Ain't a very big army
coming to our rescue.

874
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,114
There's one thing I sure regret.

875
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:09,712
That I ain't never got to Wichita
and had me... that glass of beer.

876
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,519
Is it pain to die, Ben?

877
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:34,310
We ain't gonna die, Rachel.

878
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,989
We're gonna live.
We're gonna lick those Kiowas.

879
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,714
We've got to take a trip to Wichita.

880
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,392
- Me too?
- All of us.

881
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,956
You, me, Mama, Andy, all of us.
We'll do it up real good.

882
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,559
Yeah?

883
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,676
We're gonna fit you out in a fancy dress.

884
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,030
A white one, with veils.

885
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,390
- Veils?
- That's what they wear for the occasion.

886
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:07,478
- We gonna have a wedding, Ben?
- We're gonna get a town preacher.

887
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,718
We're gonna hire some music.
We're gonna have a fine old time.

888
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,597
Ben.

889
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,555
Oh, Ben.

890
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,558
Hear that, Mama? Hear that?

891
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,672
We're going to Wichita
and have ourselves...

892
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,549
Get in the root cellar, Rachel.

893
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,592
<i>Mama!</i>

894
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,676
<i>- Andy.
- Mama!</i>

895
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,275
Back in the root cellar. Hurry!

896
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,036
Hole in her side.

897
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,310
Never said a word.

898
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,876
Mama?

899
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,309
Mama!

900
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,675
More coal oil, Andy.

901
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,315
He's coming to, Ben.

902
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:29,311
The fire won't hold them off much longer.

903
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,076
- How's your arm, Andy?
- Fine.

904
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:44,470
- Can you handle your gun?
- I guess so.

905
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,719
Never was much good left-handed.

906
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,708
It's a six-gun!

907
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,909
Could it be Cash? Could it?

908
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,230
It's gotta be Cash! I knew he'd come back!

909
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,749
- I told you, Ben!
- Whoa, hoss.

910
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:37,711
Stay here with Rachel.

911
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,998
Andy! Andy!

912
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,517
Andy.
