1
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,367
Goddamn it.
- Go now.

2
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,362
Jump on the horse.
- I can not find it.

3
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,623
What do you mean? How can
something as big as a horse...

4
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:09,814
...lose it?

5
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:12,501
As you sit on it, you son of a bitch.

6
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:17,218
Down or I'll shoot your head off
, you son of a bitch.

7
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,028
Sons of bitches. Bastards.

8
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,309
I'm hit, damn.

9
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,538
Do not let them escape.
- I love you.

10
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,328
Thief.

11
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,490
My money.

12
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:39,100
Do we here, Em?
- No, we do not hold.

13
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:43,001
We continue riding until we
found a nice place to starve...

14
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:47,274
My leg is killing me.
- I hope that helps bleed, Frank,

15
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,409
because you lose a lot of blood.

16
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:52,053
Stop your ass.
- Why do not you do to yours?

17
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,262
Rufus.

18
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,666
Frank and I will steal a
couple of fresh horses...

19
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,069
..., prepared a banquet for us.

20
00:06:58,225 --> 00:07:00,605
Let no one by moving,
if it is not to be.

21
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,295
Who says that?
- I'll say so Los dismount.

22
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,814
If you say so...

23
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,817
Frank, forward.

24
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,598
Wow, we have already stolen better horses.

25
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,885
What her addiction here?

26
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:48,367
I'm Jim Caulder, station posts.

27
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:51,872
How are you, Jim Caulder, station post?

28
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,842
Pine Bluff is not far, just a mile away.

29
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:57,323
We do not want to Pine Bluff.

30
00:07:57,523 --> 00:08:02,368
Well, here you soak your horses
Dared before she moves on.

31
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,124
Did I get him?
- Yes, totally.

32
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,067
Na, was self-defense.
- Go, seek us something to eat.

33
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,468
And it boil.
- This is women's work.

34
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,179
Do as I say.
- Oh God Damn.

35
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,470
Boil.

36
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,380
Am I a woman or what?

37
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,589
Yes, I'll bake a cake, a horse-apple-pie.

38
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,103
If you wait for there to eat?

39
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,183
Frank Emmeth.

40
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,103
Lots.

41
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,958
Do you have a whiskey there, lady?

42
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,362
Whiskey?

43
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,601
You have too many things.

44
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,872
Turn to me.

45
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,319
Sun, I like it.

46
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,983
The Fountain.

47
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,419
I and my horse need water.

48
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Give me that.

49
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:19,446
You are not married to someone who
stands on its head a price?

50
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,380
You are a bounty hunter.
- I Am.

51
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:25,997
They kill men for money?

52
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,090
Do you know a better reason?

53
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,087
Yes, I certainly do.

54
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:38,835
Is your husband with a
painted woman ran away?

55
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,595
I wish he would.

56
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:49,456
So how do you shoot with the revolver,
you can teach me that?

57
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,206
Why? Would you kill someone?
- Yes.

58
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,939
Horseshit.

59
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,450
Yes you could not even escape from
to an unconscious person.

60
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:06,079
I will learn it.
- Remember that you will learn.

61
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:10,745
What ever happened to you too
is, you will forget it.

62
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,658
The hell I will do.

63
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:17,011
I do not know what your problem is
and it interested me a damn...

64
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,293
...but whatever it is,

65
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,315
you can not solve it with a revolver.

66
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,771
In other words, you want help me then?

67
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:28,987
That's it.

68
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,720
I ask of you not in vain.

69
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,442
I see no pockets in your cape.

70
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:45,066
I have not talked about money.
- God Damn.

71
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:51,613
It seems very important to you
to be to kill someone.

72
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,369
If I teach you the shooting,

73
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:58,456
then you would shoot your ass.

74
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:04,246
It is my ass. - It would be a shame
if he punctured.

75
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:08,766
It is the prettiest on the
I have ever cast an eye.

76
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:15,251
If you are lucky, you throw
more than just an eye.

77
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,904
I play only games of chance,
if nothing else works.

78
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,811
What do you mean?

79
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,449
That you're a bad liar, lady.

80
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:33,295
If I touch you I would get the Winchester
again over the head.

81
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:36,237
My answer is 'No', simply 'no.'

82
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:36,698
No.

83
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,642
No.

84
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,068
God.

85
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,330
How much was it?

86
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,627
Three.

87
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,811
And your husband?

88
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,672
Dead, they murdered him.

89
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:54,853
My nice shirt.

90
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:59,445
Damn, Rufus. - We have
thanks to you, birdbrain.

91
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,272
If my leg is healthy again, I'll kick your ass
from your throat.

92
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:04,826
As always, you two against me.

93
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,570
This would allow her to stay, if
father were still alive.

94
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:09,922
It would still be alive if
you had not killed him...

95
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:13,044
How many times do I have
to say that it happened...

96
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:14,506
...when I cleaned my gun?

97
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:19,003
Hardly a night in which I see not the face of
father before me.

98
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,831
You mean, what was left of it.
Do you think our soldiers are followed?

99
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,839
I know. There they are.

100
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:32,473
Let the bastards by surprise.

101
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,673
Hell, let's get out.

102
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,559
Here, put that on.

103
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:06,821
For more underneath you are
wear than my horse.

104
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,250
My name is Price,

105
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:16,176
Thomas Luther Price.

106
00:25:16,964 --> 00:25:18,964
And my Mrs...

107
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,551
My name is Hannie Caulder.

108
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,187
Good. Go ahead, Hannie Caulder.

109
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,980
Where to?

110
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:30,114
Mexico, where there is an armourer.

111
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,400
Gunsmith?

112
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:37,321
Without a weapon, I can teach you
hardly shooting, right?

113
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:43,062
If you do not mind, with a
death to ride a horse.

114
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:46,487
I do not mind.

115
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,616
Buy yourself some decent pants and boots.

116
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,553
We still have a tough ride ahead.

117
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:20,712
I am in the saloon,
if you need me.

118
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,720
What should I do with the
pants I'm wearing now?

119
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,944
Washing it.

120
00:27:33,577 --> 00:27:35,277
I'm sorry that we do not have your size.

121
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,674
Take a bath so and they shrink to your size.

122
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:42,462
Then they fit. But do not take off
before they are dry.

123
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:23,307
The way you describe the three,
it, everyone could be here in town.

124
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,638
You are brothers. One is called Rufus.

125
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,674
The Clemens. They were last
week here, but just by riding.

126
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,441
Do you know where they wanted?

127
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:36,527
Their stench was already here
before they got themselves...

128
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:39,049
...and has not yet cleared.

129
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:44,014
Thank you Sheriff.
- At any time again. Really any time.

130
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,493
If you can not summon the sheriff
would, then would I need a...

131
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:51,442
Her ass is wet.
- Even your chin.

132
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,719
God has built this guy...

133
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,471
I want to see.

134
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:42,811
Here are your pants, Thomas.

135
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,976
Thomas.

136
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,940
Thomas Luther Price.

137
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,947
That's it.

138
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:26,051
Hannie.

139
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:40,355
Another one?

140
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,510
He has made his choice.
Harrington, Samuel.

141
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,901
Dead or alive.

142
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,075
$ 750, Union Pacific.

143
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:53,123
Good money for 5 minutes work.

144
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,714
If you can prove that he is.

145
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,679
You might know him.

146
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,450
I heard that he was
about a month in your city.

147
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:02,565
So it would have to take yourself...

148
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:05,049
...if you had recognized him.

149
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:08,737
My name is incidentally Price, Tom Price.

150
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:14,382
I'm sorry, Mr. Price.

151
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,159
I had no idea...
- Do you have the money?

152
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,097
A good job, sir, do...

153
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:25,504
...if you refrigerate crooks like him.

154
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:27,852
I wish I was that way.

155
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,772
I mean, just like you.

156
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:35,448
Excuse me, ma'am.
- For what?

157
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,390
He was afraid I I
catch a cold in my wet pants.

158
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,653
That's right, Mr. Price.

159
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
For the funeral.

160
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:48,301
On the way back would I view the grave.

161
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:51,768
It will be there. It will be there.

162
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Yes.

163
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,542
Off to Mexico.

164
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,902
Damn, who is it that Custer?

165
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,895
Anyway, we make it ready.

166
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:38,057
Down. Or do you want your
head get weggeballert...

167
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:43,260
Would it make any difference.
- Listen, I'm tired of your...

168
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,334
Down. Down.

169
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:54,237
I have a plan.
- Which one? They starve?

170
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,550
Good idea.
- Shut up.

171
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,001
How to disappear.
- That's your plan?

172
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,693
Exactly.
- And what do we do?

173
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:04,491
More Flee and stay alive.

174
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,313
Now forward, away from here.

175
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
His name is Bailey.

176
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:52,508
No one knows why he has settled in Mexico
.

177
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,130
First, he was a shop in New Orleans.

178
00:33:55,308 --> 00:34:00,663
After the outbreak of war made it
arms for the Confederate Army.

179
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:05,092
The occupied north of the city
'63, he ran away.

180
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:08,738
The Yankees made life difficult for every,

181
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:12,131
if he was not Abe Lincoln or a whore.

182
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:18,196
And a gunsmith
the rebels they had just executed.

183
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:23,587
Bailey Did you have your gun?

184
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:29,377
No, I have received from someone
who did not need him anymore.

185
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:33,265
But he has repaired it so much,

186
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:36,013
that he has the gun quasi twice rebuilt.

187
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:40,037
Of course it would be more comfortable
if a little more accessible, he would...

188
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,924
...but he married a Mexican woman.

189
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,900
And more children than you
can count on the fingers of...

190
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:53,738
Certainly not a bad life, I think
. A home with children.

191
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,131
A man should leave something
else in the world...

192
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:01,591
...as a grave stone.

193
00:35:03,781 --> 00:35:06,246
The same is true for a woman.

194
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,561
We have visitors, children.

195
00:35:48,527 --> 00:35:51,041
Thomas, good to see you.

196
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,265
You too, buddy.

197
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:55,598
This is Hannie Caulder.

198
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:59,852
Welcome to Mexico, Miss Caulder.
- Misses.

199
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:03,093
Welcome to Mexico, Misses Caulder.

200
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,711
Have you finally gotten
small, the good old Adam?

201
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:06,917
No, everything is fine.

202
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,024
I wanted to see if you
have any more children.

203
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,761
Two. The nights are very cold.

204
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,671
Come into the house.

205
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,571
Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn.

206
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,120
What's going on, Em?
- What?

207
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:37,471
Of course, what is.
- Shut up, Rufus.

208
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:40,045
I tell you what's going on.

209
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:43,897
We shot in two weeks, four things
and have nothing to drink.

210
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,456
And eating.
- We still have some coffee.

211
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:48,278
And three horses, we can eat.

212
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,711
If you just touch her my pet...

213
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:54,812
I would never touch something,
what was between your legs.

214
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:58,397
And what about the kids in Sonora Town?

215
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:00,815
You've done nothing with the
, as you know yourself.

216
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:03,643
Have I not. Not true, Em?

217
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:06,602
Goddamn, how should I know?

218
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,332
Do you remember the
night when I came home...

219
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:11,012
...and I smelled like a lily?

220
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:14,438
This proves nothing.
- Do you call me a liar?

221
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:18,081
Em, he says, I am a liar.
- Are you, too.

222
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:21,232
Give me a single time where
I have not told the truth...

223
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:25,497
For example, when you said that
would be in a stage coach no guards.

224
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,114
To a hair, we were all spent here.
- Yes.

225
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:31,292
That was a mistake, but do not lie.

226
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:36,494
Anyway, I have never said that
I am a flawless human being.

227
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:40,693
I just said...
- Snout, Rufus. I need to think.

228
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:45,783
For What?
- You son of a...

229
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:52,008
That was a joke, Em Have you lost your
damn sense of humor?

230
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:53,876
I'm about to lose my little brother,

231
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:59,187
when this son of a bitch not his mouth:
soon closes and holds closed.

232
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,850
Frank.
- Yes?

233
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,552
Where can we steal some dynamite?

234
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,512
Do we chase the bastard into the air?

235
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:07,422
No, no, we do not want to chase
the bastard into the air...

236
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:09,767
We will again rob a bank.

237
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,744
Do you remember, just as he was of the...

238
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:14,758
What is the city called?
- Sonora Town.

239
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:18,339
Sonora Town. It is I remembered a guy...

240
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,532
A very pretty woman.

241
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:29,992
You want to be a man.

242
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:32,325
This is not her succeed.

243
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:37,937
No, not really.
- We should thank God.

244
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,797
May I ask why?

245
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,604
A long story.
- I Goes to nothing.

246
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:01,393
What now...

247
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,551
Concerns the gun...

248
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:09,035
It must of course be easy to
what we will present problems.

249
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:12,741
The lighter the weapon,
the thinner the steel...

250
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,623
...the more fragile it becomes.

251
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:20,795
Since we will probably have to resort to the
box of tricks.

252
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,453
Thomas?

253
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:34,343
I think that is a cold night.

254
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:37,089
It is probably safe.

255
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,127
Here, take this.

256
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:28,966
Take him to hold up in both hands,
, arms stretched, just like that.

257
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:31,259
Well, take this.

258
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:38,625
Now hold up, at shoulder height. Now reel
, always with a half twist.

259
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:48,761
Good. Well let down,
slow and easy.

260
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:50,971
Do not let slip the wood is not
through my fingers.

261
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:54,332
Just unwound so as have you wrapped it.

262
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,231
Come on.

263
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:58,406
High-keeping. Hold up.

264
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:06,801
Good. Yes, you've done very well.

265
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:10,402
That you will do every
morning and evening,

266
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:13,084
until you make it thirty times.

267
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:14,955
Then I'm ready?

268
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,275
Then we take a slightly larger stone.

269
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,951
He has done three times
as much powder in...

270
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:13,445
...run, as required.

271
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:19,468
If not then it he flies around the ears
, it will never happen to you.

272
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,603
Who is that?

273
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,314
It looks like a preacher.

274
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:16,278
No, he is not.

275
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:18,106
A new chamber.

276
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,281
Two weeks.

277
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,162
Maybe just one.

278
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:02,381
The reason why I'm using the
appearance of a weapon so much trouble,

279
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:05,307
is that I think the
killing may find objectionable.

280
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:08,588
As you look at it,
it is a bad thing.

281
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:12,031
I can only try to give him some style.

282
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,915
Why two copies? - Only a little Bailey Spell.

283
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,740
It saves you tighten the
gun with your thumb to...

284
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,695
Press with the middle finger
of the lower deduction.

285
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:25,251
The firing pin is clamped,
then the second trigger.

286
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:30,105
Never push a weapon from,
if you are not a target anvisierst,

287
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,341
even if it is unloaded.

288
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:35,866
This is your first lesson as a shooter.

289
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:39,554
Comm.

290
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,310
We practice first from here...

291
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,145
...it would not make sense, move closer to,

292
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:06,452
Before you're quick.

293
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,630
Now...

294
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:15,085
Pull the gun from its holster
slowly. And carefully.

295
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,250
No...

296
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:22,562
Slowly and carefully. It was only
we practice it slowly, then rapidly.

297
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:24,842
Okay.

298
00:46:25,094 --> 00:46:27,954
Arm extended above shoulder height.
Right eye targeting over the barrel,

299
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:32,039
both eyes are open, that's important
. I'll explain why later.

300
00:46:32,308 --> 00:46:37,238
Slowly tighten up the resistance,
not simply run through...

301
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:42,139
Well, what? The beats from,
as a stubborn mule.

302
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:44,219
Yes.
- Yes, that's Kaliber45.

303
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:49,022
Kaliber45. The beats here from
away from the strongest man in the legs.

304
00:46:49,322 --> 00:46:51,942
It's gone completely wrong.
- You have the right to be deeply held,

305
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:54,858
it is gone forward into the earth.
That's not bad.

306
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:56,337
Try it again.

307
00:46:56,494 --> 00:47:01,679
This time you add a little sideways,
finally, you're a target.

308
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:06,709
Come on.

309
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:11,922
Again.

310
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,927
Again.

311
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:24,975
Again.

312
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:30,063
Again.

313
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,799
The estimation of distance is
often not taken seriously...

314
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,290
.... It is very important.

315
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:42,387
As the sun casts a long shadow man a,

316
00:47:42,575 --> 00:47:46,235
seduces the to the
distance estimate is too large.

317
00:47:46,494 --> 00:47:49,874
There is no shadow at noon,
the sun is directly above you.

318
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:52,702
Since you think you could
touch him with outstretched arms.

319
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,256
If you're close to your opponent
, you see too much of him.

320
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,960
You see how he sweats,

321
00:47:57,128 --> 00:47:59,148
moistened his lips, squinting.

322
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:02,319
And while your eyes that capture
all that he can kill you.

323
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:03,889
Take distance...

324
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,359
...see all of him,

325
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,144
and nothing.

326
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:10,725
Meet And then it just here,

327
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,890
right here.

328
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,129
After you've shot, get moving immediately.

329
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,771
Come on.

330
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,490
Move it immediately, he shoots too for you.

331
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:32,638
In addition to the distance you have to
also assess the true human nature...

332
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:36,903
Well, over there is a
man, slightly left of you.

333
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,499
It looks bad,

334
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,859
stands erect in the sun.

335
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:46,644
Casual thumb in his belt, hat pushed into
neck, legs wide.

336
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:49,199
Over there, right by you,
is a man whose face...

337
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
...you can not see,

338
00:48:50,547 --> 00:48:54,927
hat over his eyes, you turned away, as if he
not you noticed.

339
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:56,518
You have to kill them both.

340
00:48:56,677 --> 00:49:00,937
It would be good if you are the faster
would turn first.

341
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:03,223
Try it.

342
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,681
Here.

343
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:20,581
Right here. Continue practicing.

344
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:27,516
He does not look like a man whose craft
the killing.

345
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:14,555
Bailey.

346
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:17,432
Here comes clientele.

347
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:27,163
On the clientele I can do without.

348
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:06,805
Children into the house.

349
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,350
Hurry.

350
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:43,086
Winchester.

351
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,697
Bailey.

352
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:53,319
Again, Hannie.

353
00:56:53,456 --> 00:56:55,456
Again, Hannie.

354
00:57:53,787 --> 00:57:56,207
Rufus, down.
The Safe flying in the air.

355
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:58,414
I like.
- Down, moron.

356
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,791
I said, I...

357
00:58:15,805 --> 00:58:17,805
You've blown the money.

358
00:58:17,963 --> 00:58:20,367
You moron. You moron.

359
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,060
Forward, Rufus.

360
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:26,424
Set me free.
- My God.

361
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,986
Thank you, Em.

362
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:31,217
The bartender said,
he had seen.

363
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,470
Yesterday in Congress.

364
01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:37,247
Do they have taken this path,
they could be here this afternoon.

365
01:00:37,506 --> 01:00:40,991
I tell you yet again: Give it up, Hannie.

366
01:00:41,884 --> 01:00:45,064
I can not do.
- You mean you do not want.

367
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:47,304
I mean, I can not do.

368
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:52,511
You will get what they deserve.
- But you do not.

369
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:55,309
Whether you win or lose, you will lose.

370
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,940
You will no longer be the same person.

371
01:00:58,147 --> 01:01:01,802
I certainly hope so.
- It's your life, lady.

372
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,307
What a life it is when
every man who looks at me...

373
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:06,986
I look at you.
- And what do you see?

374
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:11,536
The woman that I was persuaded I
, out damned selfishness.

375
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:14,326
I wish I had you there then left alone.

376
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:16,746
I should now also be done.

377
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:21,281
Go. I do not need you anymore.

378
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:29,431
You've just used me, is not it?

379
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,966
It is so.

380
01:01:37,555 --> 01:01:39,555
As I said,

381
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:43,526
you're a terrible liar, Hannie.

382
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:27,294
How come you do not have money? What
have you done with your last...

383
01:02:27,492 --> 01:02:28,492
...share it?

384
01:02:28,638 --> 01:02:30,698
What percentage?
No money does not last long.

385
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,110
Frank is right, Emmeth.
Women cost money.

386
01:02:34,352 --> 01:02:35,218
What do you want with women?

387
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:36,812
You have so much in his
pants, as in the head.

388
01:02:36,979 --> 01:02:39,559
Shut up. Em, he should
keep his mouth shut.

389
01:02:39,773 --> 01:02:41,233
Shut up.

390
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:43,399
Two is better.

391
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:09,666
You stink far,
Frank. Do not turn around.

392
01:03:13,092 --> 01:03:15,812
If you are doing now what I say,

393
01:03:18,263 --> 01:03:21,153
your life will be a little easier.

394
01:03:22,725 --> 01:03:24,725
And more especially.

395
01:03:25,394 --> 01:03:27,859
Schnall your revolver from...

396
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:33,816
...and let it fall.

397
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:39,598
Sliding off it and spin around to face me.

398
01:03:40,532 --> 01:03:42,532
Frank Clement, right?

399
01:03:43,617 --> 01:03:47,442
That's it.
- On your head is exposed to $ 100.

400
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,372
's What I call inflation.

401
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:56,333
The Office of the Sheriff's
right here on the pitch.

402
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:58,941
Let's see if we get there.

403
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:18,068
Thomas.

404
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:22,948
Thomas.

405
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:27,379
Hannie, creating me out of here.

406
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:39,636
You were right.

407
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:43,014
I am a pathetic liar.

408
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:48,322
Just as pathetic as the revolver.

409
01:06:49,145 --> 01:06:51,145
And who's lying now?

410
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:54,359
They will kill you, Hannie.

411
01:06:55,192 --> 01:06:57,192
They will try.

412
01:07:01,322 --> 01:07:03,322
Promise...

413
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:13,760
Promise me that Beac..

414
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,460
Hannie...

415
01:07:19,837 --> 01:07:22,226
Holy shit...

416
01:08:31,814 --> 01:08:33,814
Yes, Mam?

417
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:37,417
The Clemens brothers,
you know where you are?

418
01:08:37,651 --> 01:08:42,411
I do not know where the others are
, Frank is in room 22.

419
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,505
This is enough to get you started.

420
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:55,696
Hey, I do not remember
to have stopped you.

421
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:59,402
You do not have.
I am looking for someone.

422
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:03,611
Yes, if the above my, is not worth that.

423
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:06,090
Yes it does.

424
01:09:16,434 --> 01:09:19,174
Yes you start early, Herman.
- And listen up late, ma'am.

425
01:09:19,394 --> 01:09:22,830
We go a bit in the sun.
- Yes, ma'am.

426
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:41,327
Get up.

427
01:09:52,964 --> 01:09:54,964
Strap him to.

428
01:09:55,549 --> 01:10:00,224
Can I wear my pants?
- It is not worth for a short time.

429
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,720
What the hell is this?

430
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:05,681
I will kill you.

431
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:13,896
You mean you'll try it.

432
01:10:26,324 --> 01:10:28,619
Any time when you're ready.

433
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:36,790
Again, Hannie.

434
01:10:38,084 --> 01:10:40,084
Again, Hannie.

435
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,920
Again.

436
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:54,498
Your hotel sign seems to have fallen down.

437
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:05,156
Please. Just $ 100.

438
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:09,864
Damn, lady, you had to shoot him
absolutely have to pieces?

439
01:11:10,111 --> 01:11:12,491
The pieces fit together yet.

440
01:11:13,613 --> 01:11:17,367
Here, for the funeral.
- Well...

441
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:21,211
That is a very unusual gesture.

442
01:11:22,121 --> 01:11:25,266
I've learned from a very unusual man.

443
01:11:26,624 --> 01:11:29,684
I expect that everything will
be used for the burial of...

444
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,259
Do you think I like it,
what you mean by that, Mum?

445
01:11:32,463 --> 01:11:34,883
It is not like them, it will remind you.

446
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,950
Reluctantly I want to be if
learn both the Clemens brothers.

447
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:42,108
And I want you to be at any price.

448
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:56,232
I stole a Bible, Em.

449
01:11:56,899 --> 01:11:59,639
Do you not read Frank for something?

450
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,840
You know perfectly well that I can not read
. To hell with him.

451
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,657
That you would have to do
not know Em Well maybe...

452
01:12:05,871 --> 01:12:07,165
...have you made God angry...

453
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:11,184
Shut the fuck up.
- I want to say but what about Frank.

454
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:14,013
Do tell, but hurry up.
- Good.

455
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
Frank,

456
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
you're dead.

457
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:28,715
God...

458
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:33,652
Damned if you do not already now
miss you, you bastard stupid.

459
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:35,490
Rumzuquatschen Instead here,
should you like to search for...

460
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,660
...this whore.

461
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:39,987
I have. I've been looking
for it like a goddamn...

462
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:43,567
Forgive me, God...
such a fucking bloodhound.

463
01:12:43,813 --> 01:12:46,513
Em, they tried to destroy our family.

464
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:51,031
How did you get it, dammit?
- But we will chill her ass.

465
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:54,231
We'll find her and her ass chill.

466
01:12:55,657 --> 01:12:57,867
What are they doing there?

467
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,100
How do I know?
- Go over and ask, dammit.

468
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:13,354
Thank you. They say they raise
because of two graves.

469
01:13:13,796 --> 01:13:15,456
Someone has asked to do so.

470
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:18,436
Who has it?
- A woman in the city.

471
01:13:19,884 --> 01:13:21,884
A woman in the city...

472
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:25,088
Tell them they should just dig a
, it will not need more.

473
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:28,503
You?
- You. Their ass cool we are.

474
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,018
Give me a liter.
- We do not sell whiskey, Mam.

475
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:47,185
But, we have a slightly larger bottle there.

476
01:13:50,243 --> 01:13:52,552
Let the damn bottle fall.

477
01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:58,789
Hello, Rufus.

478
01:14:01,377 --> 01:14:05,917
You've probably pretty much
done since our last meeting...

479
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:08,339
Funny, you are not a bit.

480
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:11,078
This was...

481
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,255
A good time, right back in your house
is not it?

482
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:19,939
It depends on which side
you were back then...

483
01:14:20,184 --> 01:14:23,142
I recognized you immediately,

484
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:27,132
because you are wearing clothes this time.

485
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:33,329
Do you know Emmeth and I are
really upset about the...

486
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:35,610
What you did with Frank.

487
01:14:35,864 --> 01:14:37,864
He was our brother...

488
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:40,537
...brothers and one can
not pluck from the trees.

489
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,042
And now I tell you what we do.

490
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:47,088
You, me and Emmeth, we will
celebrate our reunion...

491
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:48,953
...first, as it was then.

492
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:53,290
And then we'll cut your
head off your shoulders...

493
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:56,337
Los sweetness,

494
01:14:56,923 --> 01:14:58,923
Get your ass.

495
01:14:59,758 --> 01:15:01,758
I said, get your...

496
01:15:21,277 --> 01:15:24,677
For the funeral.
- That's enough for two.

497
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:25,771
Exactly.

498
01:15:25,913 --> 01:15:28,655
Would you do me a huge
favor by Miss Caulder,

499
01:15:28,876 --> 01:15:31,246
if they would disappear from my town,

500
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:33,871
before innocent people
get into your crossfire.

501
01:15:34,078 --> 01:15:36,138
Why did not you also say
the Clemens brothers?

502
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,830
The molesting anyone, even
if they are looking for...

503
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:43,503
Other hand, you shoot around here.
- I tell you what, Sheriff.

504
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:48,173
Tell the last Clemens that Hannie Caulder
waiting for him in the old jail.

505
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:53,481
There I'll settle my affairs
, without interrupting further.

506
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:57,824
You are a hard woman, Hannie Caulder.

507
01:15:58,432 --> 01:16:00,432
As someone once said:

508
01:16:00,611 --> 01:16:04,011
'There is no hard women, only soft men.'

509
01:17:09,115 --> 01:17:10,775
This whore.

510
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,945
What is the a,
paid to the funeral of my family?

511
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,069
Where the hell is she?

512
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:18,346
Goddammit, where is she?

513
01:17:18,498 --> 01:17:20,838
You wait outside, in the old jail.

514
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,041
Oh, she does, yes?

515
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,705
Look at just that it looks like self-defense.

516
01:21:37,837 --> 01:21:39,857
If you're too close to your opponent,

517
01:21:40,047 --> 01:21:41,707
you see too much of him.

518
01:21:41,882 --> 01:21:43,882
You see how he sweats,

519
01:21:44,092 --> 01:21:45,312
to moisten the lips,

520
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:47,088
winks.

521
01:21:47,262 --> 01:21:50,747
Pay attention to his hands,
keep his eyes.

522
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,376
Remember, you're a target.

523
01:21:54,559 --> 01:21:56,559
Target on him.

524
01:21:56,853 --> 01:21:58,853
Go, Hannie, be ready.

525
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,980
Now.

526
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:12,600
Again, Hannie, again.

527
01:22:36,677 --> 01:22:40,927
Whether you win or lose,
Hannie Caulder.
