1
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:15,928
Come on! Stay put now! Dr. Mike's 
gonna make you feel better, I promise!

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,301
How many pennies did you
say he swallowed?

3
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,863
Seven! Is he gonna be alright?

4
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,385
He's gonna be fine.

5
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:24,770
Just give him some of 
this castor oil tonight.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,895
It comes with a money back guarantee.

7
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:28,978
- Oh my gosh!
- Get down!

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,979
- Where'd it come from?
- I don't know!

9
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:37,474
Don't turn your back on me, old man!

10
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:39,855
Come back here!

11
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:51,041
You coward! You afraid 
to face me?

12
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,086
Turn around!

13
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:58,361
What for?

14
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:02,062
So's I can be the one
 that shot Kid Cole.

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,813
I said turn around, old man!

16
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:06,747
Somebody get the sheriff.

17
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,523
There ain't no sheriff!

18
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,554
Then somebody better get a doctor.

19
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:29,231
You got your mind 
set to draw on me...

20
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:31,987
Go ahead and draw.

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,470
Sorry, ma'am. Is he your feller?

22
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,939
No. As of now, he's my patient.

23
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,069
Sorry, ma'am. I made sure 
not to hit no vital organs.

24
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:22,143
Well, I'm sure he appreciates that.

25
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,777
It's an honor to see you 
shoot someone, Mr. Cole.

26
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,608
No honor to it.

27
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:30,097
My cousin Leonard saw you
 shoot a fella in Juarez.

28
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,490
Never been to Juarez.

29
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,726
Somebody help me bring him in.

30
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,088
Never met no lady doctor.

31
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:40,562
Then we're even, Mr. Cole. I
never met a gunfighter.

32
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,616
Stand up, boy.

33
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,364
How much I owe ya?

34
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,971
5 dollars.

35
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,010
Would've been cheaper
to bury him.

36
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:20,813
He may still have that opportunity,
Mr. Cole. He's very weak.

37
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,080
Excuse me, ma'am, but I
don't wish any man's death.

38
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,230
Then why did you become
a gunfighter?

39
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,087
Wasn't by choice. I killed a man
 in Texas a long time ago.

40
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:38,082
He had a reputation for being
fast so...I got one too.

41
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:44,735
Then people started coming after me.

42
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:54,178
How's the air around here?

43
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:58,075
Good for consumption.

44
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,369
How'd you know that?

45
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,249
I recognize the cough.

46
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,200
Here. This should help some.

47
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:16,465
The doctor in St. Louis said it
wasn't so bad.

48
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:25,234
Said if I'd settle down, take it
easy that...I should be okay.

49
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,091
Sounds like good advice.

50
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:32,021
Thanks.

51
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:44,169
This seems like a nice town.
Peaceful-like.

52
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:51,061
And you can't beat the view.

53
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,637
I know what it's like to
be new in town, Ingrid.

54
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,885
You're the first girl Matthew's
 ever brought to supper.

55
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:10,852
Colleen!

56
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:13,397
It's time we got to know
each other better.

57
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,429
Where's Brian?

58
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,283
He said he was too excited to eat.

59
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,069
He's going hunting with Sully tomorrow.

60
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,638
He's got ants in his pants.

61
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,601
Yes, Matthew.

62
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,295
Where are you from in Sweden, Ingrid?

63
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,474
Stockholm.

64
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:31,592
Do please tell us about it.
I hear it's lovely.

65
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,041
Matthew -- the blessing.

66
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:42,727
Dear Lord, please bless the
food that is in front of us

67
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:46,762
and please bless us and our
guest. Amen.

68
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,554
Amen.

69
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:55,595
So, I understand you and Matthew
met at the church.

70
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:02,581
He's spoken of you...
a great deal since then.

71
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:17,961
Wait.

72
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,214
Are you alright?

73
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:29,007
Drink this.

74
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,803
I'm so sorry.

75
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:34,901
I eat too fast.

76
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,470
I'm sure that's what it was.

77
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,638
Let's go back to the table.

78
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,365
What happened? Is she okay?

79
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,699
She's malnourished, Matthew.

80
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,751
Her stomach reacted to the fact 
that she hasn't been eating.

81
00:07:58,054 --> 00:07:59,748
She's starving?

82
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,390
Yeah.

83
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,032
Just eat slowly.

84
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,377
- That oughta be enough. 
- Thanks for the job, Miss Olive.

85
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:38,522
Well, now, a young man could use
a little change in his pocket.

86
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:40,773
We'll settle up when you get done.

87
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,580
You'll be back by dark?

88
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,723
- Close to it.
- Olive!

89
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,234
I got something for ya.

90
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,925
Excuse, please.

91
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:52,597
What can I do for you?

92
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,272

I'm sorry. We can't help you.

96

You know I'm even gonna have
to close down store credit.

97
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,479
We don't want 'em here anyway.

98
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,017
In case you get hungry, I 
made you a little something.

99
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,132
Thanks.

100

Looks like somebody shot her.

It's alright. It's alright.

What's that?!

115
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,646
I'm asking the deer's permission
to take her earth life.

116
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,524
No! She doesn't give her 
permission! She's just hurt!

117
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,666
She's in pain. I can't let her
stay that way, Brian.

118
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,028
Cheyenne say if you inhale
 the deer's last breath

119
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:32,081
you can keep her spirit alive.

120

Go on.

can't run. Some coyote is --

and it's as good as new!

- Put her breath back!

Don't worry about that.

I'm just worried about you.

00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,059
[speaks louder]
Byron!

166
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,073
Byron?!

167
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:30,622
Hey, Byron.

168
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:51,653
- Water?
- Ja.

169
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,572
You like Ingrid, ja?

170
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,099
Ja.

171
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:09,590
Yeah!

172
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,511
She's nice.

173
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:12,929
Ja.

174
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:20,020
- Here.
- Thank. For my sisters -- eat.

175
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,277
So many! For one person.

176
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,667
One cow. One cow would 
feed you all.

177
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,238
Ja.

178
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,292
Got something to show ya.

179
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,617
- A wolf do that?
- No, that wasn't a wolf!

180
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,069
That cow's been butchered!

181
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,027
Who the heck --

182
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,861
- Immigrants.
- Now, Loren...

183
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:25,850
I'll get my gun.

184
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,986
We can't be sure it was them!

185
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,302
Aw, who are you kidding? We
both saw those scroungers!

186
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,488
Cattle hustling is a serious offense!

187
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:36,649
And not something you can let
somebody get away with.

188
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:57,097
How old are you? Seven? Eight?

189
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,126
Ten.

190
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,426
What's going on here?!

191
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:15,274
There!

192
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:20,824
- Go get that fella! Get him!
- Somebody killed one of Olive's cows.

193
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,397
Here's your man!

194
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,179
Found this in his tent.

195
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,474
String him up!

196
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,028
Hold on a minute here!

197
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:29,717
You can't just hang a person!

198
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,579
Yeah? Watch us!

199
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,763
Somebody get a rope!

200
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,690
No! No! Please, no!

201
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,516
Where are the children?

202
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:47,121
Olive! You've gotta stop them!

203
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,774
I can't!

204
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,419
Just get inside!

205
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:25,700
Move aside, Reverend!

206
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,493
He's a child!

207
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,087
He's a cow thief!

208
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:31,159
He's a boy who's asked for sanctuary
in the Lord's house and he's gonna get it.

209
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,221
He's gonna meet the Lord alright, 
just as soon as he's jerked up to Jesus!

210
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,268
You can't kill a man for trying
 to feed his family!

211
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:40,094
Yeah?

212
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,911
Reverend, you'd better step aside.

213
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,126
I'm sorry, Olive.

214
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:51,231
If you want me to move, you're
gonna have to make me move!

215
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:54,993
Me too!

216
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,693
Me too!

217
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:10,325
Go home!

218
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,222
We'll be back.

219
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,319
You can't keep him in there forever.

220
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:32,379
Peaceful little town, huh?

221
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,902
What happened?

222
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,940
They say he stole a cow.

223
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,194
He's lucky the bullet
 went right through.

224
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:56,757
It's Sully.

225
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:03,732
I heard you had a little trouble.

226
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:08,564
I think we should wire Denver
for a Marshal.

227
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,914
For one stolen cow? They'd sooner
 come out for a toothache.

228
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:14,496
What we need is a sheriff.

229
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,228
You're absolutely right. We 
should look into getting one.

230
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,015
And how're you gonna pay
for the sheriff?

231
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,549
Well, I suppose we could
take up a collection.

232
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:25,386
That's a good idea. Should we
put out an advertisement?

233
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,302
I guess we should.

234
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,571
What, you're going now?!

235
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,985
Those people are ready to hang him!

236
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,123
No! No, please stay with him. 
They might come back for him.

237
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:55,665
Hey, doc! Got some advice for you. You
best watch your step, you hear?

238
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,298
You best watch yours, you hear?

239
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:07,631
Thank you, Mr. Cole.

240
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:11,449
My pleasure, ma'am. You know I 
don't like poor manners.

241
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:14,395
- Horace, I'd like to place an ad.
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,370
And I want you to make sure it's
posted throughout the territory.

243
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:18,760
What'd you like it to say?

244
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:26,080
Help wanted - sheriff. Must be of strong
moral fiber, have knowledge of the law.

245
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,291
There go most of your 
candidates right there.

246
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:32,454
I don't suppose you'd be
interested in the job?

247
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,104
I'm retired.

248
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,317
So I see.

249
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:37,423
Good day, Horace.

250
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,307
Good day, Mr. Cole.

251
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:39,076
Ma'am.

252
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,347
It's dangerous bringing her here.

253
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:09,780
Ingrid...

254
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,486
I had to.

255
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,252
I'll watch the front.

256
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:40,379
- You gotta let me tell them it was my idea.
- [translates to Swedish]

257
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,112
No.

258
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,248
It's not for you to take
all the blame.

259
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,778
[responds in Swedish]

260
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:55,736
Jon says they take you and then no one 
left to take care of sisters. You help.

261
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:03,416
He ask promise. Promise
you no tell.

262
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:06,900
I don't feel right about this.

263
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:16,551
- [speaks Swedish]
- [translates ]Promise.

264
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,584
Promise.

265
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:35,296
What are your qualifications then, sir?

266
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:40,944
Let's see now. Well, I've rode with the
 Younger gang and the James gang.

267
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:43,829
Oh, I rode with the Dalton gang
for a spell, too.

268
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:53,339
So if any of those showed up in town and
 caused a ruckus, I'd recognize 'em right off.

269
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:54,471
And you, sir?

270
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:58,413
I got my own gun. Would I get 
to wear a badge?

271
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:03,863
My qualifications?

272
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,959
I've killed me 12 men already.

273
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:09,640
I ain't afraid to use force
if I have to.

274
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:14,780
So, say someone was accused of
disturbing the peace?

275
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,025
How would you handle that?

276
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:19,039
I reckon I'd have to shoot 'em.

277
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:23,640
If someone stole a piece of candy out 
of a store, what would you do then?

278
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:26,432
I'd have to shoot him too.

279
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,100
Gentlemen, prepare to fire.

280
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,776
Ready!

281
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:40,512
Fire!

282
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:04,861
Shootings fine be accuracy is finer.

283
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:09,088
Looks like the only way
 I'm gonna have me

284
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,141
a quiet, peaceful town is 
to make me one.

285
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,942
I'm surprised you'd be interested
in such a position.

286
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,885
Well, truth be told, all I 
really wanted to do

287
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:19,007
was find a quiet place to
put out a few rose bushes.

288
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:22,374
Maybe break up a saloon fight
once in a while...

289
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:26,899
Mr. Cole, would you excuse us
just for a moment?

290
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,211
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:39,141
Well, thank you all for
showing up.

292
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:42,049
The committee has 
reached a final decision

293
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,106
And we're going to hire Mr. Cole.

294
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,375
Sorry, fellas.

295
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,730
We'd like you to start immediately.

296
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,884
By moving the boy to the
safety of the jail.

297
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,633
What's the salary?

298
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,518
Say, uh...2 bits a day?

299
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,674
Make that 4 bits a day
 and we got a deal.

300
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,946
Then we're agreed, Mr. Cole.

301
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:09,845
Ah, just one thing else.

302
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:12,343
You ain't gonna be my
boss, are you?

303
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:55,514
Hold on there, son.

304
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:09,563
You get out of here.

305
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,871
Where'd you learn to
fight, Bradford?

306
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:15,568
You sure you're alright?

307
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:23,864
Come over here. I've
got something for you.

308
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:34,419
Here. Take this.

309
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,603
It's for your people.

310
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,350
Come on, son. Thanks, ma'am.

311
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,523
I'll take care of it.

312
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:45,361
They want food, they ought
to hunt for it.

313
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,619
Just like everybody else.

314
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,049
They're miners and farmers.

315
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:51,031
They don't know how to hunt.

316
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,340
Besides, they don't own any guns.

317
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,133
Are you gonna pay 
for their guns?

318
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,415
Nobody asked them to come here.

319
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,599
Nobody asked any of us
to come here.

320
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,136
Why were they beating
up on that boy?

321
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:11,276
He do something wrong?

322
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:14,868
Some people don't like other people
because of where they come from.

323
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,336
There's something I gotta tell you.

324
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,506
What is it?

325
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:23,115
Tell them to go back
to where they came from!

326
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,558
[shouting]

327
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:28,653
Immigrant lovers!

328
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:32,305
Matthew, the fire!

329
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:44,492
Matthew, no!

330
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,352
I was with Jon.

331
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:59,208
It was my idea to kill the cow.

332
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,741
I helped him slaughter it
 and bring it back.

333
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:07,538
I'm as guilty as he is.

334
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:15,562
How could you, Matthew?

335
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,643
How could you steal that cow?!

336
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:21,546
The town blames the immigrants

337
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:22,593
and now they're ready 
to hang a boy!

338
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,345
You'd have done the same
 thing if we were hungry.

339
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:31,148
These people are starving. I
just thought I could help.

340
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,230
Why did you wait until
now to tell me?

341
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,024
Because Jon made me promise.

342
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,433
It was wrong of Jon to make
you make a promise like that.

343
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,572
If anything happens to Jon

344
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,207
his sisters got no one to
look after them.

345
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,196
I can't stand the thought of
her going hungry!

346
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:56,373
- If I can get Miss Olive to listen...
- No!

347
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:57,088
- I can explain --
- No!

348
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:00,551
No, you let me handle this.

349
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:04,194
I'll offer to pay for the cow.

350
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:08,567
And you'll get a job to 
earn the money.

351
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,129
Here's the money for the cow.

352
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:25,515
Take it.

353
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:27,368
I will not.

354
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,231
Why not? Isn't it enough?

355
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:31,850
There's enough there for 2 cows.

356
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,361
Then take it!

357
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,211
I can't!

358
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,351
It weren't you that stole it.

359
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,014
- What if it was?
- Matthew!

360
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:40,155
You wouldn't do something like that.

361
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,179
But if I did?

362
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:45,068
Then we'd have to hang 
you too. Wouldn't we?

363
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:47,519
That's the only way to keep
order around here.

364
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,267
No exceptions to the law.

365
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,702
And what law are you referring to?

366
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,462
I'm referring to the law of
the land out here.

367
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,520
This ain't Boston, you know.

368
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,932
We're doing what needs to be done.

369
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,476
If you hang that boy

370
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:08,661
it's going to be murder -- not justice.

371
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,925
No! Pup pup!
No! Pup pup!

372
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,615
Brian?

373
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:24,692
Brian!

374
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:31,226
Brian! Push harder, Brian!

375
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:34,481
Push, Brian.

376
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,076
Oh, no!

377
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,536
I told you something like this 
was gonna happen, didn't I?

378
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,054
She won't do it again!

379
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:57,630
Yes, she will!

380
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,388
She's a wild animal! You can't
 control her like a dog!

381
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:02,168
I promise! I'll take care of her!

382
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,695
I'm sorry, Brian.

383
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:06,230
But that deer has got to go 
back to where she came from.

384
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,228
She doesn't belong here.

385
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,492
You can give me a spanking if
 you want, but please...

386
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:13,762
let me keep her!

387
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:25,283
You must keep her tied out
there, you hear me?

388
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:26,615
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:42,983
What do you think you're doing?!

390
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,960
Did you see what they're doing?

391
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:13,839
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:16,680
They're getting ready to
set fire to that!

393
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,896
Sorry, ma'am. There's no law
against string up a dummy.

394
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:22,383
You're not going to do 
anything about it?!

395
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:23,844
Nope.

396
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:24,866
Then I will!

397
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,658
Come on, ma'am. Come on, now.

398
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:28,301
Tell them to take it down!

399
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,443
I can't do that.

400
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:32,321
They don't plan to wait on a trial!
They're going to hang him!

401
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,862
Little lady, you got my word. 
There's going to be a trial.

402
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:39,134
It's just them boys are 
pretty sure of the verdict.

403
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,566
A bag of beans...

404
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,820
And a couple of candies
for the little ones.

405
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:03,909
That's, uh, 1 dollar and 25.

406
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:06,734
Please put it on my account, Mr. Bray.

407
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,222
You account's been closed.

408
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,735
I've always paid you on
time, have I not?

409
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:26,749
My children are hungry.

410
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:42,157
Here. I have 50 cents.
 I'll get you the rest.

411
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,972
You've got no credit here!

412
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,341
Hey, you!

413
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:48,723
Stop right there!

414
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:52,741
Stop him! He's stealing this! Get him!

415
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,649
They think they can take 
whatever they want!

416
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,429
Let's go, Jake!

417
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:01,930
What are you waiting for?!

418
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,812
It all started with that cow thief!

419
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:05,856
Let's go!

420
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,378
Don't make me shoot you, boys.

421
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:18,592
You ain't getting more than one
of us before we get you.

422
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:26,984
Let's go!

423
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:33,296
You're the sheriff!

424
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,316
Nothing I can do, ma'am.
We're outgunned.

425
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,082
You can stop this!

426
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,906
It ain't just one cow. One cow
will turn into a dozen,

427
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:03,712
And a dozen will turn into a whole herd!

428
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:05,336
Where do you draw the line?!

429
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,166
This here's a trial --

430
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,081
And the verdict is guilty!

431
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:08,204
Yeah!

432
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,578
No! Listen to me!

433
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:12,326
It's not your affair!

434
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,227
May God have mercy on
your sorry soul.

435
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,471
I know I'm new in town

436
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:30,957
but it would've been nice to
have been invited to your party.

437
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,691
Bring him down, now.

438
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:35,544
The judge is coming tomorrow.

439
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,070
There's gonna be a trial.

440
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:45,600
Wrap it up. Go home!

441
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:49,048
All of you!
Go home!

442
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,872
So when will the judge be arriving?

443
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,011
He ain't!

444
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:16,824
I just got word he can't come. Something
about a double murder up in Boulder.

445
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,109
He said you should do it.

446
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:21,358
He made you something called a proxy.

447
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:24,429
That means he's appointed you
 his official representative.

448
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,278
Now, hold on! I ain't no judge!

449
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,483
You are now.

450
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,027
You ever been through a trial?

451
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:34,125
Yes, ma'am, but I ain't never
 been on this side of the law.

452
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,953
You don't steal a man's horse, 
his cattle, his water, or his wife.

453
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,705
And you don't shoot a man in the back.

454
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,586
You do any of those 
things -- you get hung.

455
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:50,643
Everybody knows that.

456
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:55,474
Hey, remember last year when 
Franklin dug that illegal well?

457
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,040
He didn't argue none 
when we hung him.

458
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:02,836
Well, he didn't have that much choice
 then, did he? Some of us argued plenty.

459
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,658
What are we fooling around for?
He already said he did it!

460
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,497
Yeah!

461
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:13,248
As official judge, I wanna hear
both sides of this story.

462
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:16,323
Oh, you heard from everyone what happened!

463
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,343
I haven't heard from the
fella on trial.

464
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:22,545
He gets to speak his peace.
The rules say so?

465
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,783
Ladies and gentlemen...
I did wrong.

466
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:45,391
What you don't know...
how it is to lose your...

467
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:46,801
Hope.

468
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:52,425
How it is to lose your hope...

469
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,741
I'm sorry.

470
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,455
Please forgive me.

471
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:10,938
Sit back down, son.

472
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:20,527
Anybody else got something to say?

473
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:22,380
Let's hang him!

474
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:23,838
Yeah!

475
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,220
Wait!

476
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:26,624
I got something to say!

477
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:28,406
No!

478
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:31,312
I helped Jon kill the cow!

479
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:32,387
No!

480
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:33,816
And I helped him bring
 it back to town!

481
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:36,166
If you're gonna hang someone, hang me!

482
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:43,314
I don't know if anyone
 will listen to me.

483
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,453
My views aren't always
the most popular.

484
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,584
But I do wish you'd listen to Matthew.

485
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:56,493
He and Jon stole a cow.

486
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,760
They know what they did was wrong.

487
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,895
But they did it because someone
they both cared for...

488
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:08,111
was starving!

489
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:16,689
I don't know what it's
like to be hungry.

490
00:41:19,496 --> 00:41:21,282
So hungry, I'd steal.

491
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:24,630
I hope I never know.

492
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,124
If that day came, 

493
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:34,156
I'd hope that my friends
and family would...

494
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:36,550
would see me in need and help me.

495
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:41,389
I've come to love this town.

496
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:45,116
And the people in it.

497
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:50,436
I want it to be a good,
safe place for my children.

498
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:55,430
And what we're deciding today is what
kind of place this town will be.

499
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,134
A place where we all look
out for ourselves?

500
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,728
Or a place where we all
look out for one another?

501
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:08,698
And that means all of us!

502
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,497
Whether we've been here for 10 years

503
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:15,849
One year.

504
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:20,498
Or 1 month.

505
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:29,944
Whether we're from Ireland
 or Sweden...or Boston.

506
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:38,093
Mighty nice speech, Dr. Mike.

507
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:41,796
Anybody got anything else to say?

508
00:42:42,323 --> 00:42:43,694
I got something to say.

509
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,280
I'm dropping the charges.

510
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,108
What?!

511
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,267
You can't do that!

512
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,409
Can't I?

513
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,713
If she brought them up,
she can sure drop them.

514
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,380
It's all over. You're free to go.

515
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:02,623
I always wanted to say that!

516
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,807
Hold on there, boys.

517
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,693
Now, you're gonna work off that cow.
I wanna see you at the ranch at 

518
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,859
6 in the morning to start mending fences.

519
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,000
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:30,032
Thank you, Olive.

521
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,580
You'd make a very fine lawyer.

522
00:43:58,656 --> 00:43:59,978
Could I have a word with you?

523
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:06,742
Now, don't get me wrong, Dr. Quinn,

524
00:44:07,634 --> 00:44:09,467
You got a lovely little town here.

525
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:13,566
But I'm real sorry. I just can't stay.

526
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,641
You're quitting?

527
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:17,501
It hasn't even been a week!

528
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,826
I may not be a gunslinger, but
I sure ain't no lawman, either.

529
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:26,382
Guess I'm gonna have to learn me a trade.

530
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,959
Maybe I oughta go to medical school.

531
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,006
So long, ma'am.

532
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:07,250
Matthew.

533
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:11,273
Brian...

534
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:14,948
You remember what I told
you when we were hunting?

535
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:19,745
That the Cheyenne believe that
 a wild animal should be free?

536
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:22,929
We should only take what we 
need for food. Remember that?

537
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:27,062
You think this deer's going to
be happy here like this?

538
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,455
For the rest of its life? No freedom to
run and play? 

539
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,350
Be with its family?

540
00:45:49,386 --> 00:45:53,443
There. Now you have my spirit.
