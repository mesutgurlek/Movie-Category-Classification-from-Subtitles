00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,151
<i>If I had a remembrance book,
I would surely write about the day we came to Plum Creek, </i>

1
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:10,438
<i>and first saw the house in the ground.</i>

2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,304
<i>I can remember Pa, and Mr. Hanson. </i>

3
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:47,075
<i>And how they walked, and looked, and talked.</i>

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,953
<i> And how we wondered what they said. </i>

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,079
You know, there is no hurry Mr. Ingalls.
If I were in your boots, I would think on it, and sleep on it.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,320
Nothing to think about Mr. Hanson. my mind's made up.
I'll be in Walnut Grove tomorrow mornin' to sign the papers.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,395
I'll be at the Mill.
- I'll see you then.

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,159
Well, Ingalls family as soon as you get done soakin' your feet,
we got a wagon to unload.

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,263
We're home?

10
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:28,989
We're home.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,251
<i> Pa left Plum Creek at daybreak, and</i>
<i>worked all day in Hanson's mill</i>

12
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:04,269
<i> earning lumber he needed to build us a house.</i>

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,075
<i>Pet and Patty, our team horses weren't big enough 
to pull the plow Pa needed to break the prairie sod.</i>

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,797
<i>Though we were sorry to see them go,
Pa swapped them to Mr. Hanson for a span of oxen. </i>

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,189
<i> Strong enough Pa said, to pull the 
state of Iowa 10 miles into Minnesota </i>

16
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,752
<i>Pa came home at sunset,
and then he worked by lantern light.</i>

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,590
<i> Ma said he ate his supper while he was working </i>

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,238
<i> Because it happened mostly in the dark,
our house grew like the mushrooms we found in the woods </i>

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,015
<i>It was kind've like we were all holding our breaths.</i>

20
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:54,956
<i>And then one day our new house was there.
All done.</i>

21
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,992
<i>And it was moving-in day!</i>

22
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,995
Can we go in now?!

23
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,949
No, not just yet!

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,965
Charles!

25
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,878
We've all been in the house a hundred times!

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,930
But not today.

27
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,912
Today's special!

28
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,035
Can we go make our bed?
- Of course.

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,071
Don't forget your pillows.

30
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,472
Our new bed is way bigger than our 
other one, and softer too!

31
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,752
We have our own window,
and we can see the stars!

32
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:53,853
<i>Debbie Downer</i>

33
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,290
We're supposed to be sleeping 
when the stars are out!

34
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,698
And it will sure be nicer to hear the rain on the roof,

35
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,075
than to have it get us all wet.

36
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,062
Come on! You're supposed to be helping me make the bed!

37
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,158
Our own window.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,382
A board floor.

39
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,983
Real glass windows!

40
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,954
A room for the girls, and one for us!

41
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,512
And don't forget, a door that locks.

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,357
Now if I hear wolves at night,
I won't be afraid.

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,621
Lots of times before, if you 
were afraid and I never knew it.

44
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:28,093
I was, but I won't be now.

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,490
At least we don't have to fear the weather.

46
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:33,257
Still have a mountain of work to do,
and lots of things we need.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,272
A plow, a harrow and seed.
Carrie!

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,189
Come on now,
your room is downstairs.

49
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,039
I'm not too worried about the harrow.
I can make one that will work until I get store-bought,

50
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,588
But plow and seed, I'm going to have
to work that out in town tomorrow.

51
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,297
But how, we have no cash.

52
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,076
I'll work it out. You let me 
worry about it, all right?

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Carrie!

54
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,195
I'll get her.

55
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,529
You're not supposed to be up here.
-How'd she climb the ladder?

56
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,076
What are you climbin' around the house for?
You know you're not supposed to do that.

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,595
Is the bed all right?

58
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,492
It's soft!
-I love it Pa!

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Here, let me try it.

60
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:24,005
Hey, that's pretty nice
if I do say so myself.

61
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,432
How do you like your room?
-It's wonderful!

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,020
And I've decided something

63
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,552
What's that half pint?

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,984
"Home" is the nicest word there is!

65
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:36,152
One of the nicest,
that's for sure!

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,439
Do you like home?
Good, because we got one now!

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,918
Morning, working hard?
-Morning Ingalls, not too hard.

68
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,957
Mr. lngalls, good morning.
-Mr. Oleson, how are you doing?

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,192
Missus this is the fella I told you about,
I ran into over at Hanson's mill.

70
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:29,417
Ma'am

71
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,580
What can I do for you?

72
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,167
Well, I'd like a plow and wheat seed,
enough for 100 acres.

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I understand you're building a house out there.

74
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:39,756
I  got it all finished yesterday.
I'll start breaking sod, soon as I get that plow.

75
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,478
I don't have any money right now.
I'd like to pledge a share of my first crop.

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,938
We do give credit to a few farmers
that we've known for a long time,

77
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,411
but, only to a few.

78
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,479
There is a reason.

79
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,659
You see, we need the money to buy
the things we need to keep in business.

80
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,944
I understand, cash on the barrel,
and that's the way I like to deal and wheel,

81
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:01,253
just as soon as I get that first crop to sell.

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,915
Mr. Ingalls, do you know how many families move out here,

83
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,050
and plant their crops and run up more
bills than they can hope to pay for

84
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
then skip out in the dead of night? Hmm?

85
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,168
Now, I can show you a whole drawer full--

86
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,698
Mrs. Olsen, I can assure you I had no intention 
of running out in the middle of the night.

87
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,637
Thank you.

88
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,806
Mr. Ingalls, there's really no way that I--

89
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,930
I understand!

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,636
Lookin' at my fine plows are ya'?

91
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:47,249
Yeah.
-Would you be needin' one?

92
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,036
Sure could.
Name's Ingalls.

93
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,266
I need a plow and seed,
enough for a hundred acres.

94
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,075
Well, you've come to the right man.

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,158
I don't have any cash.
- Then I'll thank you for not wasting my time.

96
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,477
But I've got something you need more than money.

97
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,249
What is it that I could need or or use more than money?

98
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,993
Know-how! Enough to put a new roof on that shed.

99
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,080
Had it been built proper, it'd 
never have caved in.

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
I bought this business for cash.

101
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:23,012
And I had no sooner turned the money over when the last
snows of winter came, and they crashed in the roof.

102
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,710
I'll build you a roof that'll support
under any snow.

103
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,458
For plow and seed?

104
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,789
That's right.

105
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,013
And who'll be supplyin' the material?

106
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,718
Well, you will.

107
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,110
Well, in that case m'lad,
I be needin' a bit more on my side, to make the bargain even.

108
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,508
I'm freightin' in some sacks of grain from Mankato.

109
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,753
You'd be stackin those in the shed, and neatly too.

110
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,791
Consider it done.

111
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,428
Satisfy me on one thing more,
and we can shake hands on it.

112
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,673
I see you workin' at Hanson's everyday.
How you gonna get loose to work for me?

113
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,710
I've already arranged for that.

114
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,209
Work for you in the morning, 
work for Hanson in the afternoon.

115
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,301
Bitin' off a big piece.

116
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,273
I'd be after wanting this done 
in ah, three weeks.

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,438
It'll be done.

118
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,831
Sayin's one thing, but doin's another.

119
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:12,792
You got my word on it.

120
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,343
But if something goes wrong, your word is
not going to keep the rain out of my shed.

121
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:20,209
I'm thinking I'll be needin' a bit of collateral.

122
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,152
Like what?

123
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,352
I see you drivin' a fair yoke of oxen.

124
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,180
Now just keep it business-like,

125
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,381
You sign a chattle mortgage, leavin' the animals to me
in case you don't do the work as promised.

126
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,662
Now no offense Ingalls.
No offense meant at all.

127
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:37,494
It's just that bein' burned once, you fear the fire.

128
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,550
I was a believin' man once, until a shed 
sworn to be sound, fell down.

129
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,368
I'll build the roof and stack the grain.

130
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,656
In three weeks?

131
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,375
In the three weeks.

132
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:53,477
My hand on it.

133
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,232
And I hope you be keepin' your promise.

134
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,399
There's nothing to worry about. The house is all finished
except for a cupboard and a few shelves.

135
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,192
Let's not worry about those.

136
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,471
So I work at O'Neil's for 6 hours.
I work 6 hours at Hanson's.

137
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,452
That's 12 hours.

138
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
That gives me plenty of time for the plowing and the rest of the chores.

139
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,513
With going and coming, and eating your lunch,
it's more like 15 hours!

140
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,916
Farm work on top of that,
you won't have any time to rest.

141
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,262
It's only for three weeks.

142
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,518
That's a long time to walk in your sleep.

143
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,160
I can do it.

144
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,231
I believe you can.

145
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,760
Mary, cut up Carrie's pancakes for her please.

146
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,774
Laura's right there, why can't she do it?

147
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Because she's going to set a place for her father.

148
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,000
Whoa! I haven't got time to eat.
I'm late for work already.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,257
Oh Charles, you have to eat!

150
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,536
I had some corn bread this morning.

151
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,334
Wait.

152
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,360
You can eat these on the run.

153
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:08,715
All right, fine.
See you tonight!

154
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,636
<font color="#c0c0c0"><annoying gibberish></font>
I want Molasses!

155
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,195
Yes, dear.

156
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,790
Your father forgot his lunch!
Here Laura, run!

157
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,116
Pa! Pa!
You forgot your lunch!

158
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,317
Oh, thank you darlin'.
Have a nice day!

159
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,878
Morning!

160
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,974
Ingalls. I'm Doc Baker.
We haven't met, but Hanson pointed you out to me.

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,495
Oh, pleasure to meet ya'.
Havin' a little rim trouble, ah?

162
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,882
The whole wheel's fallin' apart.

163
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:04,633
Well, I can wedge it for ya', for now.

164
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You can?

165
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,761
Sure

166
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:07,963
I'd be in your debt.

167
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:09,754
No trouble at all.

168
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,396
And I thank you for not pointing out that it wouldn't have happened,
if I had remembered to soak the wheel and swell the wood.

169
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,909
It happens to all of us.

170
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,276
I was about to start walking.
Not looking forward to it, having been up all night with a new mother.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,202
I'd be happy to pay you for your time.

172
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:34,552
No, thank you.
Just a ride to Walnut Grove would be fine.

173
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,477
You got it!

174
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,238
Hanson told me you were a good man to have around.

175
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,753
Told me you were going to start repairing O'Neil's shack.

176
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,738
Word gets around fast.

177
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,675
In a town the size of Walnut Grove,
quicker than scat.

178
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,436
I think you're a welcome addition to our community.

179
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:55,315
Thank you.

180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,610
I hear you have a nice family too.

181
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:00,195
I think so.

182
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Ingalls!

183
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,810
Hey Doc!

184
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,320
You know it's only by the grace of God, 
 a country doctor doesn't cackle when he talks?

185
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,069
You'll never guess how many times 
my patients pay their bills with chickens.

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,872
I couldn't begin to guess.

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,710
Could be I'm perpetuating the system.
I've started more flocks than I can remember.

188
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,479
I hope you can use these.

189
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,878
No come on, it's just a little added thanks
for your help this morning.

190
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,878
Look, it's not that we can't use th--

191
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,370
Go ahead and take them Ingalls!
Make the old man happy!

192
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
You know he wouldn't dare
keep those chickens.

193
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:06,814
Because they would die on him,
and then folks would know he's a fraud.

194
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Fraud!? Why you old billy goat!
You can't even blow a whistle on time!

195
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,710
He's 3 minutes late.

196
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,394
Nay! You are 3 minutes early!
It's that cheap watch of his.

197
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,502
Cheap, is it?

198
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:25,571
Ingalls, I'll have you know this is a very expensive chronometer, 
given to me when I graduated from medical school.

199
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,832
Ohh, well if it's that old, 
it's an hourglass.

200
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,997
When he graduated, 
they didn't have watches.

201
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,073
You and your watch you 
are both older than I am you-- <Whistle blows>

202
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,117
Ma, the whistle's blowing!

203
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,520
Laura, don't let the stew boil dry.

204
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:50,021
As soon as I get the oxen yoked up,
I want you and Mary to take them to the field for your father.

205
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,556
<i>In my remembrance book, I put down how Pa used 
every minute of daylight, and a lot of the dark.</i>

206
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,993
<i> He said he was counting the days until he could stay home,
and just work the farm. </i>

207
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,877
<i>The rest of us only counted the days to Sunday,
the Lord's day, when Pa took us all to church </i>

208
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,194
As I look out on our congregation, I must say I'm distressed.

209
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,230
I see many familiar faces, 
but I also see the absence of many others.

210
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,110
I see many wives here without their husbands.

211
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,275
I'm sure if they had lost a loved one during the week,
I'd have heard about it.

212
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,590
Now are all of us sinners?

213
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,191
Some to a lesser degree than others.

214
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,873
It is only by going to church, and asking the Lord's forgiveness,

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,468
that we may be cleansed of our sins.

216
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,513
Think upon that, 
as we sing our closing hymn

217
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,110
'' Come, sinner. Come.''

218
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,159
Come, sinner. Join

219
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,559
Come, sinner. Join

220
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,796
tarriest Why not?

221
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,797
Jesus loves you

222
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,832
His love is holy

223
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,192
He will never abandon you

224
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,593
Today I did not to the church
as much as the Sunday school.

225
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,393
Why did not you?
- Otherwise only.

226
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,992
The Reverend Alden said that
is a sin not to go in the church -

227
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,917
, and sinners will be punished.

228
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,875
It was a question of those who will never
go to church. - Do not punish the father?

229
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,391
Your father's a good man.
He's worn out. He needs to rest.

230
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,003
More than he needs church?

231
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:57,974
Yes. He is tired.

232
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,072
There's Pa!

233
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,355
You girls catch up with Carrie!

234
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,238
Charles lngalls !

235
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,231
Caroline!

236
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,245
Oh you're back already, huh?

237
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,878
Earlier than expected, obviously!

238
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,428
Well what are you talking about?

239
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,312
You couldn't stay awake to go to church,
and here you are working!

240
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,191
Caroline, I woke up and you were gone.
I just couldn't sit around the house doin' nothin'.

241
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,857
The Lord's day is set aside for worship, and for rest!

242
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,454
Caroline, I've got a field to plow.
Now, God isn't gonna plow it for me!

243
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,555
That is sacrilegious!

244
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,868
Well to you maybe, but not to God!
He understands farmers!

245
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,425
I'm sorry, I didn't go to church.

246
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,676
You should have gone to church.

247
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,519
That's why I just said I'm sorry I didn't go to church.

248
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,911
It's not church I'm worried about, it's you.

249
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:45,432
You're working much too hard.

250
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,633
The worst part of it is over,
it's just a little while now.

251
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,594
C'mon bear with me, huh?

252
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,190
Time spent being angry with you is such a waste.
I'm sorry.

253
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,676
So am I.

254
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,277
Ingalls!

255
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,996
Ingalls!

256
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,397
Ingalls!

257
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,508
Yeah?!

258
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,197
I've been lookin at your time sheet, 
the days and hours that you worked, and your lumber bill.

259
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,633
Today, at quitting time, I owe you
half a dollar! Surprised!?

260
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,029
No not surprised. Please is the word!
I've been keepin' track myself.

261
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,116
I am pleased too.
You've been working hard.

262
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:38,409
How's the work coming at O'Neil's?

263
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,158
All but finished.

264
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,671
I tell you what, when you get finished over there
and you get yourself a rest,

265
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,794
if you want to, come and work half days for me.
I would like that.

266
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,133
I'd like it too.

267
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,832
Good!

268
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,996
Thank you!

269
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Caroline!?

270
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,301
What is it?

271
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,215
I am home, that's what it is!

272
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:18,678
I am starvin' woman.
Get my supper while I wash up.

273
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,822
You're really feeling good.

274
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:33,891
Mmm hmm! Oh it was a fine day!

275
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,020
Where are the girls?

276
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,221
In bed.

277
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,371
The sun's hardly down.

278
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,109
It's a little bit early to be putting them into bed, isn't it?

279
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,009
I don't know, it just seemed easier and quieter
if they weren't underfoot.

280
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,659
I'll get your supper.

281
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,032
Have I been that bad?

282
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,675
I do remember telling them to 
be quiet a couple of times.

283
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,839
A couple.

284
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,109
A few.

285
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,767
Four.

286
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:06,810
I'm sorry.

287
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,639
Why don't you get my supper,
and I'll be down in a minute.

288
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,951
Welcome home.

289
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:16,594
Get my supper.

290
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:17,295
<font color="#c0c0c0"><i>Seriously, don't make me ask you again, woman</i></font>

291
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,034
It's kind've early to be asleep isn't it?

292
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,684
Well, we weren't quite asleep, Pa.

293
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:54,468
Oh, that's good!
I thought I might tell you a story.

294
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,591
Oh please, Pa!

295
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,310
All right, let me see.

296
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,635
Oh yeah, I've got one
about a grumpy farmer.

297
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,194
See this grumpy farmer used to get up every 
morning before sunrise and stomp off to work.

298
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,599
Sometimes he'd even forget to say goodbye 
to his wife and 3 pretty little girls

299
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,074
And every night when it got dark, his wife would
put his 3 pretty little girls to bed real early,

300
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:21,773
so he wouldn't grump at em' when he got home.

301
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,394
That made the whole family feel kinda sad because

302
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,834
they could remember when he used to have time for his wife,
and to play games with his 3 pretty little girls.

303
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,872
Even take em' to church.

304
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,039
So one day that farmer looked around, 
and said to himself, 'Farmer you're a grump!'

305
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,755
He finished all of his work-- almost all of it.

306
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,156
He ​​came home and told his pretty wife and his 3 pretty girls,

307
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:51,628
that tomorrow he was gonna take them on the 
biggest, best-est, all-day picnic of all time.

308
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,856
Oh thank you Pa!

309
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:57,888
I promise not to be a grump.

310
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,715
Hurry up! Last one down's a rotten egg!
C'mon Jack, we're gonna win!

311
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,271
Hey! Look!

312
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,528
It is higher than some of the birds.

313
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,869
A lot higher.

314
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,473
I didn't know that Pa could fly a kite.

315
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,431
I didn't either, Mary.

316
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,352
I'll get it.

317
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,718
Charles!

318
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,558
Don't move!

319
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,118
Laura, run and get Mr. Hanson.
Tell him Pa needs Doctor Baker, and a wagon!

320
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,992
Hurry!

321
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,590
It never ceases to amaze me, 
the ways man can find to hurt himself.

322
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,236
Climbing trees?!
It's a wonder you didn't break your neck!

323
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,511
It couldn't hurt any worse than this does.

324
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,597
Now into bed!

325
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,213
Painful, huh?

326
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:01,838
Just a wee bit, Doc.

327
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,353
Well, that's to be expected, with 4 broken ribs.
But you'll mend fast.

328
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,638
You'll be up and movin' around in a week - 10 days

329
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:12,918
Yah, the rest will do you good.

330
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,410
I can't spend a week in bed.
I've got a lot of work to do.

331
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,798
You do what the Doc tells you!
I will talk to O'Neil.

332
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,280
It's not just stackin' the grain.
I've got plowin' to do. I've got work in the barn.

333
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,276
It will have to wait.

334
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:31,355
I'll check back in a couple of days, Mrs. Ingalls.

335
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,233
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll see you out.

336
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,870
You stay in bed.

337
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,670
Girls, don't let the cornbread burn.

338
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,097
You're looking better.

339
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,069
I'm feeling better.

340
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,916
That soup smells good.

341
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,471
Can I ask you a favor?
I don't want you to go out and do any plowing anymore.

342
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,240
We've already talked that out.

343
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:45,795
No, I talked, but you didn't listen.

344
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,449
The field has to be harrowed
before it can be planted.

345
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,155
Now God isn't going to do it.

346
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,104
Corn bread's done Ma!

347
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,295
Coming dear!

348
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,196
That isn't sacrilegious.
You said it.

349
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:01,691
If God understands farmers, 
he understands farmer's wives.

350
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,202
Mrs. Ingalls?

351
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:39,951
Yes?

352
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,849
I am Liam O'Neil.
Your husband contracted to do some work for me.

353
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,890
Yes, How are you?

354
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:50,318
Troubled Ma'am.
You're husband left a sight of work undone.

355
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,672
He was hurt and Doctor Baker told him to stay in bed.

356
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,794
Yes, sorry that I am to hear that,
but that has nothing to do with the matter at hand.

357
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,920
A chattle mortgage Ma'am. 
Your husband signed it.

358
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:08,016
Guaranteein' that the work'd be done on time,
or the yoke of oxen would forfeit to me.

359
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:10,710
Well, the work wasn't done,
and that's the plain and simple fact.

360
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,997
I know, Mr. O'Neil. 
But Mr. Hanson was supposed to tell you my husband was hurt.

361
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,545
Well, 'hurt' has nothin' to do with the matter.

362
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:24,519
Your husband failed to do as he promised, and now
the oxen are mine, so I've come to pick them up.

363
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,154
Please, don't do this.

364
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,986
I know how you feel, truly I do.

365
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:35,394
But if your husband were in my position,
he'd do exactly the same thing.

366
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,073
I'm sorry.
Sullivan!

367
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,038
Doctor Baker said you weren't to get out of bed!

368
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,680
He said lots of things.

369
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,155
Please just tell me what O'Neil said
when he showed you the mortgage.

370
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,102
He said you hadn't done the work
and that the oxen were his!

371
00:34:13,103 --> 00:34:16,835
And there wasn't anything that I could do about it!
There isn't anything you can do about it!

372
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,460
I never should have signed it!

373
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:20,297
But you did sign it!
And you can't fight it!

374
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:22,460
Now, please go back to bed
before you hurt yourself!

375
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,361
No Mr. O'Neil and I are going to have a little talk.
This isn't over.

376
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:26,311
But it is!

377
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,617
No it isn't! Because I'm not going to let it!

378
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:32,176
If we lose those oxen, I can't make a crop!
If I can't make a crop, we lose everything!

379
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,449
That's what happened to me in Kansas!
That's not going to happen here!

380
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,752
Go home, Jack.

381
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,398
Go Home.

382
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,878
Doerfler, if it's alright with you,
I'll give you some chickens in payment for this shoeing job.

383
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,120
I've got more chickens now than I can use.
Half of my customers been payin' me in chickens.

384
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,791
I never thought of that.

385
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,796
Well, look who's here.

386
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,863
Ingalls? I thought you said he was gonna be in bed for a while.

387
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:49,336
That's where he should be.

388
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,979
Well, Ingalls.
You're lookin' poorly, lad.

389
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,577
I didn't come here to talk about my health!

390
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,262
It was only a politeness

391
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,971
I want to see the mortgage.

392
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,242
You did when you signed it, lad.

393
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:01,696
And I'll see it again now!

394
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,519
Ahh tis' the date you're wonderin' about!
The contract expires tonight.

395
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,073
Then the oxen are still mine.

396
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,438
Oh for a few wee hours more.
Til' midnight.

397
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,560
I was out your way on another matter.
I knew that you wouldn't be able to keep your promise here.

398
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,438
So you stole the oxen?

399
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,329
No Lad. I was just doin' you a favor.
Savin' you a trip into town.

400
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,715
You want to do me a favor, 
you give me a couple more days.

401
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,194
Sorry as I am, 
By the look of you, it'd take a lot more than that.

402
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,314
Besides, when a bargain is struck and a paper signed,
all parties have to abide by it.

403
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,833
Well I intend to. 
I got til' midnight to keep my end of the bargain.

404
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,918
I got a lot of stackin' to do.
I best get at it.

405
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,989
Wonder what he's up to.

406
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,590
It looks like he's going back to work.

407
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,676
Pa!

408
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,352
Mary, Half pint,
I want you to go home.

409
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,271
Do you hear me?
I want you to go home!

410
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,510
Come on!
We'll do it!

411
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,230
Now fellas, this is all a mistake.

412
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,668
I never meant to take advantage.

413
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,158
It was a business deal. Now that's all it was.
It was just business.

414
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,692
When I saw the poor lad fall down,
and him and that sack.

415
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,953
and then the wee ones, they're comin' to help their pa.

416
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,871
I swear, on my mother's grave
 I was going to the oxen back!

417
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,861
Go slowly now Ingalls

418
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:37,630
That's the way the oxen like it.

419
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,234
My thanks to all of you.

420
00:43:39,235 --> 00:43:42,709
Oh, it did us good to sweat a little.

421
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,370
I just wish there was some way I could repay you,
someth--

422
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:49,734
Uh ya, there is something.

423
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,075
We've been thinking of holding a plowing and harrowing contest
after church on Sunday,

424
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,591
and it would be a favor to us, if we could use your land.

425
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,810
You got a deal!

426
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:09,717
Deal.

427
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,117
Thank you.

428
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,190
Come on, let's go home.

429
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,514
You're still 3 minutes early.

430
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,598
<i> That was our happiest homecoming ever </i>

431
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,349
<i> Pa said he was glad we'd come to live
on the banks of Plum Creek, </i>

432
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,837
<i> because here, he'd harvested a crop
he didn't know he'd planted, </i>

433
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,428
<i> A harvest of friends. </i>
