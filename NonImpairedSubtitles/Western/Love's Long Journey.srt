1
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:35,593
- But I'm tired!
- It's the beginning of the day now. Come on.

2
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,829
All right.

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,314
You're it.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,825
Forward!

5
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,660
- Mama.!
- You stay with Pa.!

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,665
Now hold up.

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,034
Dear Ma and Pa.

8
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,404
The Bible says, for everything,
there is a season.

9
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,409
And after two years
of marriage...

10
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,570
the time has finally come
for Willie and me...

11
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,114
to put down roots
on a ranch of our own.

12
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,275
Ho.!

13
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,215
- So long.
- We left the wagon train today...

14
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,224
and are heading out alone through
desolate and beautiful country.

15
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,964
It's not green like the farm.
More golden.

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,364
As you can tell by my handwriting,
the way is pretty bumpy.

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,770
Willie's worried we got
a late start leaving Denver.

18
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,072
August is not a good month
to start up a ranch.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,511
I did get a full year of teaching in,
and we can use the money.

20
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,311
We also may be starting up
something else.

21
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:02,320
Namely,your first grandchild.
I haven't told Willie yet.

22
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,652
He's got so much
on his mind already.

23
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,887
There will be plenty of time
to tell him after we've settled.

24
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,452
For everything,
there is a season.

25
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,597
Willie, can you pull up
for a minute?

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,391
Feel better?

27
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,794
Yes.

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,739
You're bound to get sick
pitching around in that wagon.

29
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,745
There's still a couple of hours left
of daylight. We can keep going if you want.

30
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,579
Nah, that's okay.
We'll get an early start in the morning.

31
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,820
Come on. I'll help you
get supper started.

32
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:21,266
Looks like they're alone, Trent.
Just out for a little romantic ride in the country.

33
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,770
Shouldn't we do a roundabout,
make sure they ain't part of a wagon train?

34
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,096
I'm tired.

35
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,462
What I'd like'd
be a hot bath...

36
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,467
a bottle of whiskey
and a woman.

37
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,265
- Well, one out of three ain't bad.
- What do you say?

38
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,136
Enough talk.

39
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,141
Let's make me rich today.

40
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,319
- The sodbuster ties his gun down.
- So do we.

41
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,825
But your average rancher
don't tie his gun down, Mason.

42
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,628
- What do you say, Trent?
- Some other time maybe.

43
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,867
Willie, bring
some forks when you come.

44
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,018
- Welcome, folks.
- Thank you, sir.

45
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,854
Frank Taylor. Proud owner of the greatest
general store in this parts.

46
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,383
Oh, Missie LaHaye.
And this is my husband, Willie.

47
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,226
Pleasure. You folks
just passing through?

48
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,699
- We're figuring on staying.
- Well, that's good news to Texford Junction.

49
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:41,134
Well, if you could just show us
the land offices, Mr. Taylorson.

50
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,266
Yes, sir.
About two doors down.

51
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,277
Good-bye.

52
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:51,076
This is the track you'll be homesteading.
Just north of McClain Place.

53
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,608
See? There's the main creek
threading through the middle...

54
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,019
with plenty of branches
for the cattle to water.

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,253
It's a good place to start a family.
Here's the deed.

56
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,727
I wish you folks
the very best of luck.

57
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,094
Many come. Not many last.

58
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,601
- We'll last.
- With hard work and a lot of prayer.

59
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,357
What are you doing?

60
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,004
Next to marrying you,
this is the happiest day of my life.

61
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,977
- Our life.
- Missie LaHaye...

62
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,173
as God as my witness,
I swear to work harder...

63
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,547
than any man to build you
a home on this land.

64
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,416
And we'll raise a family...

65
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:05,150
and watch generations after generations
of LaHayes thrive and prosper.

66
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,789
Well, Willie, I have something
to say about that.

67
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,026
- Hey, get back here. Get back here.

68
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,126
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I didn't see nothing, mister, honest.

69
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,371
Chicken thieves start early
in these parts.

70
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,377
That's the first child
I've seen.

71
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,848
Yep. Glad you brought
all those books just for that one.

72
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,975
I'm sure there are more.

73
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,813
First the ranch.

74
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,551
Then teaching.

75
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,025
- Then everything else.
- Everything else?

76
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:47,157
You know what I mean. What were you gonna
tell me before that chicken butted in?

77
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:52,500
Just that, uh-
that I'm happy too, Willie.

78
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,215
- Hello, young man.
- Howdy.

79
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,255
I'm Missie LaHaye.
What's your name?

80
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,087
-Jeff Huff, ma'am.
- How old are you,Jeff Huff?

81
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,753
- Twelve years old, ma'am.
- Did you catch that chicken?

82
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,286
No. Got distracted
by your smooching.

83
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,131
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I'm sorry we caused you
to lose your chicken.

84
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,638
Oh. Weren't mine, anyway.
Just fooling around.

85
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,999
- Willie.
- Sonny! Sonny!

86
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,235
Where you been? I been waiting
so long for you to come back.

87
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,177
Where have you been?
Sonny? Where you been, Sonny?

88
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,407
"Where you been, Sonny?''

89
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,846
- Ow.
- Leave him be. I mean it.

90
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,481
I'm just having a little fun
with your little brother, Sonny.

91
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,582
Take it easy, Mason.

92
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,026
Why don't you and I
go in and have a drink?

93
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,664
Sonny...

94
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
you can go play.

95
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,138
- Don't go embarrassing me like that!
- Sorry, Sonny.

96
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,445
Got you something.

97
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,696
Easy there,Jeff. Don't that widow feed you?
I pay her good money.

98
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,225
I don't like it there, Sonny.
I wanna go with you.

99
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,034
Yeah, well, you can't.

100
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,575
I told you that
a hundred times.

101
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,848
Whoa.

102
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,832
I'll build you a house
a lot better than that one.

103
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,858
Oh, no. Willie,
this house is just fine.

104
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,669
Let's go take a look.

105
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:16,567
Humble as it may be, sweetheart, this is
the first home of our own that we've ever had.

106
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,199
- No stove.
- I can use the fireplace.

107
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,440
My cooking can't get
any worse than it is right now.

108
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,248
Lord, bless this house
and all who enter.

109
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,314
Amen.

110
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:35,279
Dearest family,
I miss you and the small creature comforts.

111
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,757
Sometimes I can almost hear
your voices in the soft prairie wind.

112
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,144
I worry about Willie.

113
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,581
He works with a ferocity
that sometimes scares me.

114
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,211
He's so concerned
we won't be ready for winter.

115
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,824
I've still not found the right time
to tell him about the baby.

116
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,199
Willie and I went riding
over our land.

117
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,109
What a beautiful country
the Lord has made.

118
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,412
Just the other day,
we saw Indians on our ridgeline.

119
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,919
Willie is very concerned
for my safety...

120
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,518
though there hasn't been any Indian attacks
in years in these parts.

121
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,081
Willie and I are sending you a treasure map
to our hard-earned savings...

122
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,649
which wejust buried in
the wilds of our new ranch.

123
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,444
I certainly hope
you never need to use it.

124
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,141
Willie doesn't trust
banks out here.

125
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,344
But then, this is
a strange and wild place.

126
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,116
I've been punching cattle
over three years, Mr. LaHaye.

127
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,129
I'm not as experienced as some,
but more than others.

128
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,429
- Where you hail from, Henry?
- What does that matter? I'm here now.

129
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,603
All right.

130
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,938
I suppose it's none
of my business anyway.

131
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,944
- No offense.
- None taken...

132
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,175
if... you give me a job.

133
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,007
How.

134
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,577
Uh, I'm Missie LaHaye.

135
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,178
My husband and I,
uh, homestead this place.

136
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,279
We raise, uh, cattle.

137
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,396
This "how", what is
that supposed to mean?

138
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,557
You speak English?

139
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,430
That's what they tell me.

140
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,732
I'm Miriam Red Hawk McClain.

141
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,034
Married to Sean McClain?

142
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,076
We homestead the next tract
to the south of here.

143
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,306
- Oh, we're neighbors.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.

144
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,940
Oh!

145
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,950
Please. Please come in.

146
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,514
- I don't understand, mister-
-Just Scottie's fine.

147
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,284
Been cowboying
since I was a kid.

148
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,294
I've done everything
there is to do.

149
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,990
How come you haven't been hired
by one of the big outfits?

150
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:21,570
I can't use this no more,
so most people think I'm washed up.

151
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,504
But I learned
to get by with my left.

152
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,338
You take me on, Mr. LaHaye,
and I won't let you down.

153
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,248
You got yourself a job.

154
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,331
Uh, I'm just getting started.
Trying to make this place into a home.

155
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,931
Please, sit.

156
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,140
I think I have one lastjar
of strawberry preserves...

157
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,509
that I've been saving
for just such an occasion.

158
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,383
Please, here.

159
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,623
Now, this here is a county fair
blue ribbon winner.

160
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,072
Mm. Mm.

161
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,845
This is very good. You must teach me
how to make this.

162
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:40,647
Oh, my mother made it.
I'm not a very good cook.

163
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,018
When I was growing up,
I mostly helped out my pa-

164
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:48,025
riding horses, plowing the field,
tending to the chickens.

165
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,391
Then you will do
very well here.

166
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
Many women who come here
are soft.

167
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,830
They don't know how to do
these things. You do.

168
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,166
Still, I feel that my husband
would prefer a good meal.

169
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,706
I brought you some things.

170
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,007
It is too late to start a garden this year,
so corn, potatoes, beets.

171
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,675
- Oh, thank you, Miriam.
- We are neighbors.

172
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,846
The last family was here, well,
they could have asked us for more help...

173
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,187
but... I think
they feared my Shoshone ways.

174
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:25,663
Oh, well, my husband and I will be grateful
for whatever help we can get.

175
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,961
Um, what is in there?

176
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,402
- The secret to flaky biscuits.

177
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,099
- Pig lard.

178
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,610
Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.

179
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,052
- What do you think about these?
- You could breed 'em.

180
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,437
- Would you be Mr. LaHaye?
- I would.

181
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,134
Well, I'm Fyn Anders.
I would like job, sir, if please.

182
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,677
Uh, what kind of foreigner
is you, son?

183
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,871
I come from Norway on boat...

184
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,348
to find adventure
in the big, wide open spaces.

185
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,351
Well, you have any experience
around cattle?

186
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,356
No, sir. But I am big,
strong. Own horse.

187
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:30,691
Well, Fyn Anders from Norway,
this'll be strictly trial basis.

188
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,190
- Hope you learn fast.
- Don't worry, Mr. LaHaye.

189
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:40,170
I learn good and fast.
You betcha.

190
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,704
- What do you think?
- Probably 40 or 50-

191
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
Good cow.

192
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,108
The boys will love the jam.
And so will their pa.

193
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,675
Sure I can't give you
any biscuits.

194
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,448
No.

195
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,857
Thank you, though.

196
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,156
Well, maybe next time
I'll make them with the pig lard.

197
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,221
If I don't retch.

198
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,997
When you're ready to bring this little one
into the world, I will be there.

199
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,476
- I've delivered many babies.
- Oh, Miriam, thank you!

200
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,654
- I'll bring some books for the boys.
- Good.

201
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,597
I don't want them growing up
illiterate like their pa.

202
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,692
Very nice to meet you,
neighbor.

203
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,498
You too.

204
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,749
Here comes trouble.

205
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,025
I, uh, heard you were
hiring some cowpokes.

206
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,190
Jobs are filled.

207
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,962
Oh, this is the bunch
you hired.

208
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,601
You're really scratching
the bottom of the barrel.

209
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,234
Too bad you just couldn't have waited
a bit, hired some real men.

210
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,244
Just where would I find
these real men?

211
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,212
Me.

212
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,772
Me and my boys.

213
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,111
Not only can we rope
and ride...

214
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,388
but most important,
we can shoot.

215
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,454
Hey, mister. I bet you can't
shoot worth nothing.

216
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,591
Why don't I start with you?

217
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,228
Trent, come on.
Let's get out of here.

218
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,851
Well, we got some cows to drive,
so watch them, and do likewise.

219
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,045
You betcha, boss.

220
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,055
Mr. LaHaye.

221
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,320
How would you feel about hiring
on another broke-down old cowboy?

222
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,124
Well, I suppose I wouldn't feel
so good about that, mister-

223
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,188
- My name is Cookie.
- You're a cook.

224
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,598
You're real quick.

225
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,693
Afraid I can't afford
another hand right now.

226
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,001
Strictly on a trial basis.

227
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,956
Come on! Get up there!

228
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,536
Get it up there!
Move it now! Ha!

229
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,873
It's a beautiful herd,
Willie.

230
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,176
Move it.! Come on. Move it.!

231
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,218
This- This way. Come on.

232
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,523
Hyah.! Hyah.! Come on.!

233
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,396
This way. Hyah!

234
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,039
How do, Miss LaHaye?

235
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,221
My dearest Missie,
the prospect of being grandparents...

236
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,698
fills us
with such joy and pride.

237
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,793
I can only imagine
how happy you must be.

238
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:11,036
And by now, I'm sure you've shared the happy
news with that hard-working son-in-law of mine.

239
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,476
I can still remember
the exact moment...

240
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,707
when your mother
told me about you.

241
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,443
I was standing in the kitchen
eating breakfast...

242
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:24,922
and most of all, I remember how radiant
your mother looked when she told me.

243
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,628
And as for you, my strong daughter,
I hope you are feeling well...

244
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,632
and that it is
an easy pregnancy for you.

245
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,669
I love you, darling.

246
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,667
My wife and my initials.

247
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,133
Fine idea, including her.

248
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,938
All this would be nothing
without her.

249
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:24,880
Therefore, a man shall leave his father
and mother and cleave to his wife.

250
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,180
They shall be as one.

251
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,379
Genesis.
You know your Bible.

252
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:33,948
Yes. Yes, good reading material.
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

253
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,016
A good marriage, that's...

254
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,129
something to be treasured.

255
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,791
Speaking from experience?

256
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,135
- Scottie!
- What?

257
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,798
- Ready for another one?
- Notjust yet.

258
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,864
Hold on.

259
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,973
Where you off to?

260
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,016
I'm taking some books
to our neighbors, the McClains.

261
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,316
Be back in a couple
of hours.

262
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,728
She sure is
a better rider than I am.

263
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,427
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

264
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,509
Buffalo.

265
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,345
It ain't done
by white men neither.

266
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,885
White men
only take the pelt.

267
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,887
Injuns usejust
about everything-

268
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,719
the hide, the meat, the horns,
some of the bones.

269
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,852
Yeah, Missie and I saw some Indians
riding south last week.

270
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,863
All this beef is better than
this buffalo meat any day.

271
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,730
There ain't been Injun trouble
in these parts for quite a while.

272
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,963
Let's tell the boys.

273
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,004
Lord, give this horse
wings to fly. Hyah!

274
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,164
- Fyn.

275
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,302
Go spell Scottie. There's some sick cows
that need to be brought in.

276
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,932
- Yes, boss.
- Mrs. LaHaye in the house?

277
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,967
No, sir. She up and took some books
over to your neighbors...

278
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,139
- the McClains.

279
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,451
Boy, she sure can ride.

280
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,529
Miriam!

281
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,597
You are safe here,
Mrs. LaHaye.

282
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,365
- I'm so sorry.

283
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,667
You're putting a scare
into this poor woman.

284
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,713
We were just having
a little fun.

285
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,216
You listen to Sharp Claw!

286
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,547
Is it trouble
you want for us?

287
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,857
My apologies, Mrs. LaHaye.

288
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:31,452
Missie, this is
my brother, Sharp Claw.

289
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,365
I give you my word, Mrs. LaHaye,
my young hunters meant no harm...

290
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,369
except to laugh
at your expense.

291
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,133
Their proper behavior
when they saw you...

292
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,735
should have been to make sure
that you arrived at your destination safely.

293
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,144
Especially a woman
in your condition.

294
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,079
Oh.

295
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,319
And this is
my husband Sean.

296
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,553
- It's a pleasure to meet you, madam.
- Nice meeting you.

297
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,395
And Robert and Bruce.

298
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,560
Hello, boys.

299
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,627
Please.

300
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,842
- Can we take our books?
- Yes, they're yours.

301
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,176
Now, children,
these are the same books...

302
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,482
used in almost every school
in America.

303
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,715
Who is this McGuffey?

304
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,520
An Ohio schoolmaster
who felt a burden from God...

305
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,562
to teach all American children
how to read.

306
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,690
- American children?
- Yes, sir. And that includes those...

307
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,964
whom our late President Lincoln
called Native American.

308
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:25,135
Thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.
Now, you all have your books.

309
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,200
All you men
and children out.

310
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,872
We have women's business
to talk about.

311
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,171
Yes.

312
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,632
Sharp Claw!

313
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,101
Over there.
Someone's coming.

314
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,246
Willie.

315
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,807
This is Miriam...

316
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,616
and her husband, Sean,
and her brother, Sharp Claw.

317
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,892
We're on our way
to the mountains.

318
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,259
We intend only
to take some buffalo.

319
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,426
I have given strict orders that no cattle are
to be harmed, and those orders will be obeyed.

320
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:02,204
Are you ready to go home, Missie?

321
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,036
Mr. McClain, Mrs. McClain.

322
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,111
Sharp Claw.

323
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:20,116
- Good-bye. Thank you.
- Good-bye.

324
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,250
Thank you.

325
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,504
- Hold her down.
- Uh-huh.

326
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,242
She'll be good
in a couple of weeks.

327
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:55,315
- First time I ever seen 'em go on like that.
- Well.

328
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,830
Just what did you think
you were doing, Missie?

329
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,967
I was taking some McGuffey readers
over to the McClains.

330
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,512
Miriam asked me to teach
her children how to read.

331
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,707
How come you never told me
about Miriam's visit?

332
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,752
I'm worried about you
riding alone.

333
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,753
It's too dangerous. You won't
be doing this again, Missie.

334
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,483
- Oh,yes, I will.!
- Oh, no, you won't.

335
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,219
Oh, yes, I will!

336
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,561
Missie. Sweetheart.

337
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,707
Do you miss teaching
this much?

338
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,546
No, that's not why
I'm crying.

339
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,378
Then why?

340
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,351
Because I truly believe...

341
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,855
that the Lord sent
Miriam McClain to us.

342
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,954
And why would he do
a thing like that?

343
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:07,529
To bring our baby
into the world...

344
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,633
healthy and hardy.

345
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,629
Our baby?

346
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,046
Missie.

347
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:27,073
Please, Willie, don't worry.
Miriam will be my midwife.

348
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,279
She's delivered all the babies
in her village for many years.

349
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,219
Our baby?

350
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,555
Oh, Willie,
aren't you happy?

351
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,459
I'm the happiest man alive.

352
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,837
Good grub, Cookie.

353
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:53,138
- Very good.
- Perfect for a brisk night like this.

354
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,736
Here's a blanket
to keep off the cold.

355
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,281
Don't give her
that old horse blanket.

356
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,341
You, uh-You take mine,
Mrs. LaHaye.

357
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,947
Oh, no. Well, thank you both,
but I'm fine.

358
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,923
You told them?

359
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,421
I'd like to raise
a coffee cup to, uh-

360
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,830
seeing as this is the strongest we got-
to Mr. and Mrs. LaHaye...

361
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,926
and their happy news.

362
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,598
- So say we all.
- Hear! Hear!

363
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,607
Thank you.

364
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,342
Willie.

365
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,282
Hmm?

366
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,322
What is it? I'm awake.

367
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,348
They were just so kind
and concerned tonight.

368
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,323
- The hands?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,389
Yep.

370
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,036
What about their families?

371
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,837
I really don't know
much about them.

372
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,376
But they're good workers.

373
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,348
And that's the most
important thing.

374
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,580
Shouldn't we know
if they have families or not?

375
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,054
Missie, lots of times...

376
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,459
cowboys come out here
to get away from things.

377
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,855
You gotta respect that.

378
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,967
Still, it seems like
such a lonely life.

379
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,641
- You're gonna be a wonderful mother.

380
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,111
So?

381
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,083
Well, looks like they figured it
all by their lonesome.

382
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,382
Let's make me rich today.

383
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,806
Willie says you know
the good book.

384
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,469
Sunday mornings, my husband
and I read the Bible and pray together.

385
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,876
You're invited tojoin us.

386
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,439
Well, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye,
but, uh, I don't think so.

387
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,647
- Aren't you a churchgoing man?
- Actually, I used to be a preacher.

388
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,623
- A preacher?
- Yeah, well...

389
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,160
the Lord giveth...

390
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,589
and the Lord taketh away.

391
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,664
What did he take away
from you?

392
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,027
Something very special.

393
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,596
My wife.

394
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:25,917
Fyn. Come here.

395
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,652
- Need you to reshoe this horse.
- Yes, boss.

396
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,747
Morning, Mrs. McClain.

397
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,649
Mr. LaHaye.

398
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,250
- You and Missie going into town today?
- Yes, we are.

399
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,554
Mrs. McClain, I know
when we first met I was-

400
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,429
Out here, neighbors need
one another, Mr. LaHaye.

401
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,230
I couldn't agree more.

402
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,397
- Please.
- Thank you.

403
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,534
Basically,
you just take it up-

404
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,899
You make it look
so easy, Sonny.

405
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:57,444
Well, practiced lots of hours
to make it look like that.

406
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,075
Okay, come here.
Remember how I showed you.

407
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,052
You coil it in your left hand, like that.
Make sure there ain't no kinks in the line.

408
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,817
This is the noose.

409
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,553
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,686
Let's see what you got.

411
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:19,668
Now loosen your wrist.
When you're ready, cast it off.

412
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,997
Oh, missed again.

413
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,635
That's all right. Keep practicing.
I'll get another rope.

414
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,086
Good day.

415
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,282
I'm Missie LaHaye.

416
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,757
He seems like a nice boy.

417
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,760
My brother.

418
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,956
I'm glad to hear
that he has family.

419
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,092
- I've been a little worried about him.
- He's fine.

420
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,194
And your mother and father?

421
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,139
They're gone.

422
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,765
No offense, ma'am...

423
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,141
but it ain't your business worrying
about someone's not your kin.

424
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,613
It's just Christian charity,
Mr. Huff.

425
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,848
I hope we're not
interrupting you, ma'am.

426
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,288
What do you want, Trent?

427
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,885
I think you'd better
get saddled up.

428
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,590
We got some riding
to do.

429
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,538
Sonny. I did it.
I roped the post.

430
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,940
Gotta go now.

431
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,376
Behave yourself.
Keep practicing.

432
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,439
- You'll be back though.
- You know it.

433
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,212
You got my rope.

434
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,661
Is Sonny gone a lot?

435
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,297
It's his job.

436
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,536
He's making money so we can have
a ranch of our own someday.

437
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,077
He sounds like
a very good brother.

438
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,062
Got yourself a strong breed.

439
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,624
And we'll know more after roundup.
Let's call it a day.

440
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,040
Now, children...
and Mr. McClain...

441
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:46,378
I want you to write
these letters on your slates...

442
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,475
and then sound them out.

443
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,486
And when you know them...

444
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,250
you'll have mastered
the entire alphabet.

445
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,957
Help each other out now.

446
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,925
The weather's turning cold...

447
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,469
and Sharp Claw and his camp
will be leaving tomorrow...

448
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,734
and you probably shouldn't
get a chill riding over.

449
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:13,106
So, this is my last class
for a while?

450
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,169
The children have learned
much from you, Mrs. LaHaye.

451
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,155
Keep at it,
Mr. McClain.

452
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:34,288
Having a turbulent time
finding a word that starts with an ""X.''

453
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,298
That is a difficult letter.

454
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,802
Sean's always
used an "X" to sign his name.

455
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,964
Well, not
for much longer.

456
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,869
Thank you.

457
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,147
Snow'll be coming soon.

458
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,618
Now remember, really sound out
the words with them.

459
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,357
And when you come back, they'll be
ready for the advanced readers.

460
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,559
I'll keep them on it.

461
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,102
Good.

462
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,695
God go with you
and your family, Sharp Claw.

463
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,900
Thank you.

464
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,308
And, Miriam,
I'll be seeing you.

465
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,642
Yes, you will.

466
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,648
Safe travels.

467
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,514
Thank you. Good-bye.

468
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,979
Come on!

469
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,028
Willie and the ranch hands
have worked hard...

470
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,496
to ensure the livestock
survive the long winter.

471
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,399
And that over there
is gonna be all your peas.

472
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,235
Cookie and I have prepared the soil
for a large garden next spring.

473
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,332
I so enjoy his companionship
and his cooking.

474
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,175
Here I just might make
a- a sweet tater patch.

475
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,510
- Oh.
- Have large taters in here.

476
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,655
It's all coming together.

477
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:12,456
It's beginning
to feel like... home.

478
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:26,398
Now, as we wait for snow, the ranch hands
have time to go into town...

479
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,001
for some well deserved
relaxation.

480
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,879
- This time I got a better hand-
- Don't tell us what you got.

481
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,475
- How many?
- Three.

482
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,792
As for Willie, he still works
harder than anyone.

483
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,798
Maybe more now,
knowing the baby's coming.

484
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,810
As we prepare for winter...

485
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:05,645
I'm reminded of Isaiah preparing
the way for our savior's birth...

486
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,208
and I think warmly of all of you
as Christmas approaches.

487
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,090
Are you warm enough?

488
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,157
I'm fine.

489
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,693
Why are you always so warm?
Even your feet.

490
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,673
Well, someone's gotta warm them
icy toes of yours.

491
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,670
I guess that's why
we're a perfect match.

492
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:42,614
The sky looks like snow.
We're lucky it held off this long.

493
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,549
You know,
I was thinking today...

494
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,114
this is gonna be our first Christmas
in this house, Willie.

495
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,155
I bet you miss your family and all those
family traditions you talk about.

496
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,828
Yeah, sure, I miss them.

497
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,098
But we'll start
new traditions here.

498
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,367
Well, with the weather
settling in...

499
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,070
this might be our last chance
getting to town for a while.

500
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,477
Better tell Santa
what you want for Christmas.

501
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:15,382
No, nothing store bought.
That would be just a waste of money.

502
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,818
Well, what then?

503
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,048
All I want for Christmas
is to be surrounded...

504
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,992
by the people
we care about.

505
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,999
This here's mine.

506
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,567
No.

507
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,905
You got the watch.

508
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,283
I got the watch...

509
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,050
because mine broke.

510
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:56,854
It's a practical thing.
I have to know the time...

511
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,395
in order to steal.

512
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,890
Gimme more money.

513
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,564
No.

514
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,127
You got two brooches
and a watch, and I don't got none of that.

515
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,733
You got two salt
and pepper shaker, and, uh-

516
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,573
You ever wish you had
a place to call your own?

517
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,659
More coffee?

518
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,389
Thank you.

519
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,769
Men...

520
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,901
Mrs. LaHaye would
like to say something.

521
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,004
Well, as you all know...

522
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,413
Christmas will be here
before we know it.

523
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,816
Santa Claus will never find us
all the way out here, I bet.

524
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,653
Well, he will if my wife
has anything to say about it.

525
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:05,024
Willie and I would like to cordially invite
you all to Christmas dinner.

526
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,664
Unless you have
other places to be.

527
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,300
Well, then that settles it.
Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.

528
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,309
Trimmings?

529
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,845
Now, where do you
rustle up some of those?

530
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,711
Well, I was hoping you
might help me, Cookie.

531
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,358
I got that.

532
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,986
Mrs. LaHaye! Mrs. LaHaye!

533
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:42,361
-Jeff. What is it?
- Mrs. LaHaye, I got something.

534
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,195
- From Sonny.
- What's it say?

535
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,296
Not sure.

536
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,362
Come here.

537
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,979
"Dear little brother,
it's real hot here.

538
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,856
"I'll bring you some beans
that jump all by themselves.

539
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:13,828
"Stay good, and I'll
see you after Christmas.

540
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,922
Sonny."

541
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,302
Best be going, Missie.

542
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,704
Well, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye.

543
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:43,017
That boy's got
one speed- runnin'.

544
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,963
By the time this arrives,
I expect it will be nigh onto Christmas.

545
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:54,902
I think on how long the world
lay in darkness...

546
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,634
before the light of the world
was born in that humble little stable.

547
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,940
We have been blessed
to receive his light.

548
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,973
Not only to live in hope ourselves,
but to take hope to others.

549
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:13,648
I am sending you something which I know
you'll remember from many Christmases past.

550
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:17,284
May it start a new tradition
in the LaHaye household...

551
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,227
and remind you
we are there in spirit...

552
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,733
sharing your first
Christmas on the ranch.

553
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,734
And know we will miss you...

554
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:29,135
but our hearts are forever
knit together in love.

555
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,809
Round. Take it
round there, Henry.

556
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,856
Round. Here.

557
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:50,086
Here. Fyn.
Come on, Fyn. Hurry up.

558
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:58,358
I just don't understand why Willie had to
go into town on Christmas Eve.

559
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,495
Oh, I'm sure he'll
be along shortly, ma'am.

560
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,841
Wow.

561
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,945
Willie LaHaye, where have you been?
It's Christmas Eve!

562
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,040
I know.

563
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,176
There's gonna be one more
for Christmas, Missie.

564
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,948
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. LaHaye.

565
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,550
Merry Christmas,Jeff.

566
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,893
Please come in.
Come in.

567
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:46,273
There's just
one thing missing.

568
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,028
This star
stood on top...

569
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:03,327
of every Christmas tree
we had when I was growing up.

570
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,834
Go ahead.

571
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,729
Here you go, little man.

572
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,942
Come on.

573
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,593
Oh, that was good.

574
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,730
Mm, thank you,
Mrs. LaHaye. This is...

575
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:48,107
the finest Christmas dinner
I've had in many a year.

576
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,614
Many a year?
It's the best one I ever had.

577
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,981
Well, thank you, but I couldn't have
done it without Cookie.

578
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,543
Well, thank you, ma'am.

579
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,124
Now is it time
to open presents?

580
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,989
Presents?

581
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,325
Yes,Jeff, I think now
it's time to open presents.

582
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,329
All right.
Let's see.

583
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,897
Uh, Fyn.

584
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,811
Scottie.

585
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,783
Henry.

586
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:33,016
And Je-
Oh, me.

587
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,580
And Cookie.
Here ya go.

588
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,694
Well, go ahead.
Open 'em up.

589
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,667
Oh.

590
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,013
Thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.

591
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,313
This is the best Christmas
I ever had.

592
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,379
Me too.

593
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,494
What is it, Scottie?

594
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,529
This is the...

595
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,030
first Christmas
present I ever got.

596
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:29,706
Well, gentlemen, I know how you all
feel about Bible reading...

597
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,304
but it wouldn't be
Christmas without it.

598
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,146
So, you are welcome to stay,
but if you want to leave-

599
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,847
I- I believe I'd
like to stay, ma'am.

600
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,891
Yeah, I'd like to stay too.

601
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,051
Me too, ma'am.

602
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,434
Gospel,
according to Luke?

603
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,046
"And so...

604
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,047
"Joseph went up
from Galilee...

605
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,549
"to the city of Nazareth,
to Judaea...

606
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,348
"to be enrolled with Mary,
his betrothed...

607
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,389
"who was with child.

00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:17,187
"And while they were there,

and laid him in a manger.

620
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,285
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.

621
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,657
- Amen.
- Amen.

622
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,060
Amen.

623
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,765
How.

624
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,104
I've missed you, neighbor.

625
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:38,004
I missed you too.

626
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,154
Sonny! Sonny!

627
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,401
Oh, now,
isn't that sweet?

628
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,233
Is there nothing good
and decent with you guys?

629
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,637
Hey, Mason, come on.

630
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,199
Let's give them
some privacy.

631
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,643
Oh, well, that's just
real nice of you, Trent.

632
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,879
- Come here.
- How's it goin'?

633
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,787
Oh, I- I really got a lot of stuff
to tell you about.

634
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,384
Um, it's kinda hard
to know where to start.

635
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,625
Read 'em and weep.

636
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,668
I'll go around back
to get that for you.

637
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,500
Now, deal, boys.

638
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,201
As long as the old man
don't blow it.

639
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,108
That's a pair right there.

640
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,112
Mind if I sit in?

641
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,413
Uh, we're just about to leave.
Uh, I'm out.

642
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,646
Oh, come on, Scottie.
Just a few more hands.

643
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,745
I can win it all back.
I feel it.

644
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,086
Uh, let's go, Fyn. You're almost
out of money anyway.

645
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,752
- LaHayes doesn't pay you.
- Well, like all cowboys...

646
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,625
we get paid
when the cattle is sold.

647
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,928
No, no, no.
Mr. LaHaye pay us anyway.

648
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,902
He dig up a tin of
dollar bills just to pay us.

649
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:17,769
It's like a-
a buried treasure.

650
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,070
Don't listen to him. He's drunk.
Now come on, Fyn!

651
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,143
Just like buried treasure.

652
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:54,076
Old Henry's going to
Sunday morning meeting.

653
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,737
Well, maybe I should
be going too.

654
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:03,210
If believin' the way they does
makes them the way they is...

655
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,345
it bides
looking into sometime.

656
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:14,028
Henry, will you be so kind
as to lead us in prayer?

657
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,599
I don't know, ma'am. I'm-

658
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,192
I'm afraid I'm
out of practice.

659
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,899
Kind of-
Kind ofhard to...

660
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,169
start.

661
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,212
It's okay to stumble.

662
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,213
He's ready to catch you.

663
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:46,785
Lord, sometimes...

664
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,993
we look
but don't perceive.

665
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,068
Sometimes we listen
but don't understand.

666
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:02,305
Please, open our ears
and eyes...

667
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,369
to your truth.

668
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,739
- Amen.
- Amen.

669
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,217
- Amen.

670
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,050
It's open to
everyone on Sunday.

671
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:19,350
Oh, Fyn. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Please come in.

672
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:30,064
Sorry, boss.
He got the jump on me.

673
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,266
- What do you want?
- I want your money.

674
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,607
Let's go.
Follow him.

675
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,646
Get up.
Move it out.

676
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,251
Hey, there, come on.!

677
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,684
Let's go.
Come on.

678
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,746
Come on. Come on.
Good Sunday morning to y'all.

679
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,438
Sonny?

680
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,811
Jeff, I- I didn't know.
I thought you was in town.

681
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,110
What ya doing?

682
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,776
Ain't this sweet?

683
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:20,050
All right,
all of you, sit down.

684
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,215
Come on.

685
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,152
You too, kid.

686
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,494
Just do as the man says.

687
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,131
I'll just go over
and get my treasure map.

688
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,798
Leave her alone!

689
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,300
Now...

690
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,744
I missed on purpose,
but I won't do it twice.

691
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,782
Please. You can see
she's expecting.

692
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,783
So am I.

693
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,649
I'm expecting to come back here
with more money than I left with.

694
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,451
I don't know what makes you
think that there's any money.

695
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:59,517
Well, your Norwegian cowpoke...

696
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:03,531
has a tendency to run off at the mouth
after a couple of pints.

697
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,090
Showing off his money,
and bragging about...

698
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,831
how his boss has a treasure
buried on his land.

699
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,272
Tie him up.

700
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:20,514
You do as he says, Missie,
you'll be all right.

701
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,143
You remember where
we dug that hole?

702
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,279
- I think I remember.
- You'll be fine.

703
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,186
All right.
Enough said.

704
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,285
Let's make me rich today.

705
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,330
Hyah.!

706
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,802
Hurry it up.

707
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,247
- I need something to dig with.
- Well, then use your hands.

708
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,478
Make it quick.

709
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,454
Is that it or not?

710
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,560
Well, then toss it over.

711
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,393
You're gonna have to show me where
the rest of the money is.

712
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,954
But y-you have all the money.
There is no more.

713
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,500
No, I don't have
all the money.

714
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:49,732
'Cause that Norwegian,
he wasn't spending silver.

715
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,239
He was spending cash.

716
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,112
I could just about eat me
a whole side of beef right now.

717
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:09,624
Well, if you turn me loose,
I'll cook you whatever you want.

718
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,957
- Like rat stew.
- Oh, and now how stupid you think I am?

719
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,554
You're working for Trent,
ain't you?

720
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,963
Equal partners is what we is.

721
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,002
That right, Sonny?

722
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,731
You equal partners
with these lowlifes?

723
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,501
Shut your mouth!

724
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,905
Ooh.

725
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,810
Why don't you tell
your brother, Sonny?

726
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,246
Why don't you tell him what
you do to make money?

727
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,582
Tell him how all you do
is rob innocent people.

728
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,588
Probably been involved
in a murder or two.

729
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,453
That's a lie!

730
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,585
Tell him he's wrong, Sonny.
You ain't never killed nobody.

731
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:49,495
Tell him, Sonny. Tell-Tell him
you ain't like these other bad men.

732
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,261
I ain't never
killed nobody. Never.

733
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,036
Don't you see?

734
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,578
I'm doing this
for us,Jeff.

735
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,342
Our future. You and me
and the life we're trying to have.

736
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:10,146
No, Sonny.
You can't mean that.

737
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,517
What would Ma and Pa say
about your thieving ways?

738
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,647
They'd say,
"Good for you, Sonny.

739
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,954
Trying to make a life for
you and your little brother."

740
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,086
So you think...

741
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,689
they're looking down from heaven
right now, and they're proud of you?

742
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,758
Aren't you tired of living
in that boardinghouse?

743
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:30,704
Huh? No place
that's really yours?

744
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,741
I want a better life
for us,Jeff.

745
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,833
That's why I'm doing this.

746
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,936
These folks are
my friends, Sonny.

747
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,379
Mrs. LaHaye been
teaching me to read.

748
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,146
Mr. LaHaye fetches me for the Sunday
meetings, and he's teaching me ranching.

749
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,953
These are the kind of people things always
work out for. They'll be fine.

750
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,255
We ain't taking nothing from them
they can't get back 1 0 times over.

751
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:00,663
When this is over, you and me
can spend all the time you want together.

752
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,024
Get it out of there.

753
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,863
Toss it to me.

754
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,812
- You got a key for this?
- No.

755
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,993
Don't you trust
nobody anymore?

756
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:13,131
Oh, my,
isn't that pretty?

757
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,336
- Whoo-wee.

758
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,140
Put your hands in the air.

759
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,649
You know how to use that?

760
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,652
I missed on purpose.

761
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,989
I won't do it twice.

762
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,325
Shooting a man's
a different story.

763
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:38,162
A good Christian woman
like yourself wouldn't hurt anyone.

764
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,202
So what you gonna do?

765
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,543
That's two more shots.

766
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,682
Sonny,
I could use a little help here.

767
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,147
This is for your own good.

768
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,187
Look.

769
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,055
Where's the woman, Trent?
What did you do?

770
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,758
Mi-

771
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,027
Where is she?
Go get her! Go find her!

772
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,865
- What are you doing here?
- It's all right,Jeff. I will. I will.

773
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:51,030
- Get her.
- Jeff,it's all right.

774
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,404
Listen to me.
Listen to me. I will,Jeff.

775
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,670
What'd you do with that girl?
Where is she?

776
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,508
It's all right.
It's all right,Jeff.

777
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,605
It's all right.
Where is she, Trent?

778
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:05,052
You'd better tell me
she ain't hurt, or so help me.

779
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,684
Stand up slowly.

780
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,353
Drop your gun, Sonny,
or he's dead.

781
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:18,457
Missie.

782
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,364
- Missie?
- Sonny, go cut Willie loose...

783
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,406
and don't you
so much as nick him.

784
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:34,312
Find it hard to believe
you got the drop on Trent.

785
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,647
I got his gun
and his dignity.

786
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,393
Missie, pick up the gun,
and move away from him.

787
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,840
Looks like you got me.

788
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:11,181
Sonny, tie him up.
Just like you did us.

789
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,017
Then maybe we'll ask
the law to spare your life.

790
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,961
Here, let me help you
with that, Sonny.

791
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,031
Sonny!

792
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,108
It's okay.
Just don't go away, Sonny.

793
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,114
Don't go.

794
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,047
Don't go away.

795
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:46,186
Fix him up, won't ya?
He wouldn't have hurt ya.

796
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,622
Oh, I would fix him if I could.
I knew he wouldn't hurt me.

797
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,122
I'm so sorry for
what I done, ma'am.

798
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,132
Please forgive me.

799
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,499
Don't hold my deeds
against him.

800
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,538
He's got no one now.

801
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,971
He's got nobody.

802
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,373
Oh, no, forgiveness
is yours, Sonny.

803
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,742
He'll be with us now,
I promise.

804
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,380
You grow up to be a man...

805
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,757
that Pa would be proud of,
you hear me,Jeff?

806
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,422
I will.

807
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:33,332
And you promise me you won't
spend your days missing me.

808
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,768
Ask me no questions...

809
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,931
I'll tell you no lies.

810
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,575
I'll pray for you, Sonny.

811
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,046
Now, don't go wasting
your prayers on me, ma'am.

812
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,686
I done too many bad things
for God to be forgivin'.

813
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,747
Long ago,
there was a thief...

814
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,055
left on a cross to die,
just like you, Sonny.

815
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:05,088
But then he heard the glorious words
of the Lord about redemption.

816
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,193
And he knew that very day
he was gonna be in paradise.

817
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,606
He's waiting
for you, Sonny.

818
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,143
Go with God.

819
01:15:55,284 --> 01:16:00,620
"Thou anointest my head with oil,
and my cup runneth over.

820
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,180
"Surely, goodness and mercy...

821
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:07,490
"shall follow me
all the days of my life-

822
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:12,091
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever."

823
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,328
Amen.

824
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:36,383
Jeff s part of
our family now.

825
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:40,459
Yep.

826
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,861
If someday he wants to
take the LaHaye name...

827
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,592
I'd be fine
with that too.

828
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,195
That would
be nice, Willie.

829
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:00,545
We are gonna need
a bigger house.

830
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,050
I was thinking I could
knock out this back wall...

831
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,086
maybe put in
a bedroom or two.

832
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,087
- Maybe
- Willie.

833
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,528
- Yeah?
- I think maybe you should put your boots back on.

834
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,828
It's time.

835
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,892
But Miriam said we were
still a few weeks away.

836
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,666
No, I think you'd best
be getting Miriam.

837
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,038
Now.

838
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,043
What's the matter?

839
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:35,109
You're gonna sleep in the bunkhouse
tonight,Jeff,just like a real cowboy.

840
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,513
I'm having the baby.

841
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,869
Maybe I'll go, uh,
check on those cattle.

842
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:05,037
Okay, sure.

843
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,206
I'll go with you.

844
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:09,807
Uh, maybe I'll wait
a little bit.

845
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,654
Okay.

846
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,485
Yeah, I'll wait.

847
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,492
It ain't your firstborn
you're worrying about.

848
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,051
Now quit it.
You're making the boss crazy.

849
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,631
It's gotten
awfully quiet in there.

850
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:49,479
- It's a boy!

851
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,493
Willie.

852
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,925
Come and meet your son.

853
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,356
We never did get around
to deciding what to name him.

854
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,226
I was thinking...

855
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,231
"Matthew."

856
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,290
After your brother.

857
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:38,031
Matthew Isaiah LaHaye.

858
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,843
Mattie.

859
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,081
It fits.

860
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:58,018
Shoo. Shoo.

861
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,152
She needs her rest.

862
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:02,162
It's all right, Miriam.

863
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,164
You can come closer.

864
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,251
Hello.

865
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,617
I remember thinking that day...

866
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:29,919
we had finally reached
the end of ourjourney.

867
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:34,257
But now I know that thejourney's
long and lasts a lifetime.

868
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,923
Each day on the ranch,
I am reminded of God's plan...

869
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,660
and the never ending
circle oflife.

870
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,898
Come on.! Hyah.!

871
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,421
I love you.

872
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,759
Bye, Willie.

873
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:18,505
Your grandsons grow bigger
and stronger each day.

874
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,768
Matthew has your eyes...

875
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,640
- and hopes to see his granddaddy soon.
- Bye, Henry.

876
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,613
Jeffhas thrived, and 
Willie and I are very proud...

877
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,479
he has taken
the name of LaHaye.

878
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,179
Bye-bye, Scottie.

879
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,968
You take care, Mrs. LaHaye.
We'll be back pretty soon now.

880
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,801
- See you, Cookie.
- Take care.

881
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,670
Safe travels.

882
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,973
The herd has increased 
by another 40 head...

883
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,503
and Willie and the ranch hands
are driving some of them to the market.

884
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:14,657
Whoa.
Look at this one.

885
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,959
- Oh, wow.
- This is huge.

886
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,192
- Will you bring it in?
- Okay.

887
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,067
The garden has given us a
bounty of vegetables...

888
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,073
to put up
for the winter.

889
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:28,666
Who knows what
the next year will bring.

890
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:33,009
I am confident the love of God
and family will light our path.

891
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,413
And a renewed faith
in the words...

892
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,815
"For everything,
there is a season...

893
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:41,754
and a time for
every matter under heaven."
