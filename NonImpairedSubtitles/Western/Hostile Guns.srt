You gonna?

00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,067
Yeah, I'm gonna.

7
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,433
Today?

8
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,333
Today.

00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,067
Well, back pay
and everything?

10

Every last simoleon.

11
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,433
I think Uncle Joe
knows you're gonna.

12
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,567
So he knows.

13
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,300
You shouldn't
have told everybody
on the spread.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,267
Then you could've
jumped him sudden
and surprise him,

And maybe
from behind.

It's no surprise.

17
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,667
Right to his ugly face.

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,367
Uncle Joe.

19
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Uncle Joe, I got something
to tell you.

20
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,600
This here's
a free country.

21
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,467
If all the ugly people
in the world was thrown
in a heap...

22
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,567
You'd be on top.

23
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,933
I always liked the top.

24
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:49,067
You're meaner than a grizzly
with ticks in his ears.

25
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,267
I'm a grizzly bear,
all right.

into his tepee,

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,700

would move out

'Cause he couldn't
stand the smell.

30

Uncle Joe, you stink.

Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

32

But names
will never hurt me.

too far, boy!

you took me in

Out of Christian kindness
when my folks died.

39
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:29,067
"Poor orphan nephew,"
you told around.

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,567
Why, I punched
1,000 cows for you

41
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,500
When it was so hot
you could fry an egg
on a rock.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,433
Only you're too mean
and stingy to buy grain
to keep a few chickens.

43
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,500
And I punched 1,000 cows
in winters so cold,

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,367
You had to chip the ice
off a horse's back

45

Before you could
saddle up.

I want my money.

that's what I'm getting at.

give me strength
to bear my load.

All right, boy.

I just ain't
got it in me

54
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,467
To strike my own
flesh and blood.

open that gate
and come see.

163
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,733
You know, I sent
a couple of telegrams

164
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,567
About getting
you a deputy.

165
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,067
Would you mind
holding down the fort
for a minute?

166
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,233
Sure.

167
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,067
Oh, would you mind,
uh, packing my wagon

168
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,333
With some guns,
blankets, some grub?

169
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,633
- Get right on it.
- Thanks.

170
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,200
What's on your mind?

171
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,700
Investigating.

172
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,067
Investigating what?

173
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,400
How tough you are.

174
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,933
You got a gun on.

175
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,933
Not now, I ain't.

176
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,733
(CHUCKLES)
That don't make sense.

177
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,500
I mean...

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,833
Well, I ain't scared of you.
You know that,
don't you?

179
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,600
I mean,
I know I was wrong.

180
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,233
I shouldn't
have acted
the way I did,

181
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,400
But you understand
I ain't scared of you,
don't you?

182
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,700
When I was your age,
it was real important

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,367
That nobody think
I was scared of anything.

184
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,733
Then I, uh,
I grew up.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Come on out.

186
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,433
I'm doing 10 days.

187
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,133
Or $50.

188
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:28,233
I'm offering you a job
that you can earn $100 on.

189
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,633
A hundred?

190
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,333
Also, you can get
yourself killed.

191
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,133
But of course, you're
not afraid of anything.

192
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,433
What do you
want me to do?

193
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,667
What I tell you to.

194
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,133
All right,
start telling.

195
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,633
Well, first you can
get us a couple
of cups of coffee.

196
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,567
You're Bill Reno's boy,
aren't you?

197
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,900
Yeah. Why?

198
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,233
I knew Bill.

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,633
Yeah, I hear you
whipped your Uncle Joe.

200
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,467
Yeah.

201
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,867
Made him holler uncle.

202
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,533
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,933
Aw, he must
be getting old.

204
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,700
The mean old
bull buffalo

205
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,333
Could've whipped
a dozen like you
in his prime.

206
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,800
He even whipped me once...

207
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,367
And I could always handle
at least 11 like you.

208
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,067
Coffee's good.

209
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,233
I just don't
make you out.

210
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,400
You'll grow.

211
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,767
You giving me
this break
because, uh...

212
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,467
'Cause you liked
my old man?

213
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:55,100
I heard a lot of lead
whistle while your pa
was at my elbow.

214
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,167
So I'm putting
a stack of chips

215
00:13:57,267 --> 00:14:00,933
On the proposition that
you're not all big mouth...

216
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,367
There's a streak
of man in you.

217
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,567
(CHUCKLES)

218
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:12,100
I guess I gotta take
that kind of talk
from you.

219
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,567
You're doing me
a big favor.

220
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,300
You don't have to take
anything from me

221
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,967
If you feel that
you're man enough
to handle it.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,567
No luck on that
deputy thing.

223
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,267
Hey. He's supposed
to be in that cell.

224
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,600
Yeah, I know.

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,300
Well, I'm sorry
about the deputy.

226
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,233
- I got my dep.
- What?

227
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,933
He's it.

228
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,467
Are you crazy?

229
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,367
Well, possibly.

230
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,300
My ear sure hurts.
Know who belted me?

231
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,333
Yeah. I did.

232
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,400
Mike, would you
get the marshal
a cup of coffee?

233
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,867
Never mind.
I'll get it.

234
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,100
Mike, would you
take a look and see
what's outside?

235
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,233
How much
you paying him?

236
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,567
Oh, the usual.
100.

237
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,367
I know human nature.

238
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:21,067
I got another 100
that says that kid won't
come through for you.

239
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll take that bet.

240
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,733
Might as well
load him up.

241
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,667
Never seen anything
like it before
in my life.

242
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,767
Yep.

243
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,267
What kind of a rig
do you call that?

244
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,733
Had it built special
right here
in San Carlos.

245
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,533
We got trouble.

246
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:56,500
He says he won't
leave that cell alive.

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,533
Afraid of hanging, huh?

248
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,333
Well, those kind
usually are.

249
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,200
Big, tough,
rough murderers,
afraid to die.

250
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,200
So that's why you
built that wagon.

251
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,367
And that's why you want me
to help you haul prisoners
to the pen in Huntsville.

252
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,667
- That's right.
- Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,233
You didn't ask me.

254
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,900
Say, McCool, if it's all
the same to you...

255
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,067
Well, it isn't the same.
You gave me your word.

256
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,167
All arrangements
have been made.

257
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,700
I'm notifying the warden
and the governor.

258
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,467
I don't figure you
for a welcher.

259
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,100
I wasn't figuring
on welching.

260
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
I just figure you can
get someone else.

261
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,767
Well, I'm sorry,
Mike, I can't.

262
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,933
Now, are you gonna
give us a hand?

263
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah.

264
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,067
All right.
Just don't take
any chances.

265
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,067
This prisoner's
a murderer.

266
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,367
Killed a 12-year-old boy,
among others.

267
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,067
So you got help,
did you?

268
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,233
Well, you'll need it.

269
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,533
You come in here,
somebody's
gonna die.

270
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:02,867
I'm warnin' you.
I'll kill you with my boots,

271
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,900
My hands,
my bare feet
if I have to.

272
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:11,300
All right, Pleasant, let's go.

273
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,500
You're next, boy.

274
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,900
I'll break you
like a stick.

275
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,467
Come on.
Come on.

276
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,900
I want to hear
your back snap.

277
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,667
(BOTH GRUNTING)

278
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:22,300
Get up!
Get up.

279
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,367
I ain't leavin'.
I ain't leavin'!

280
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,867
Get up!

281
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,700
You got those handcuffs?

282
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,567
(PANTING)

283
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,133
All right.

284
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,933
Well, he's earned
his money already.

285
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,700
(GRUNTING)

286
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Aah! Why don't you
just shoot me here?

287
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,933
I don't want to hang!

288
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,200
We might just
oblige, Pleasant.

289
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,667
Now, you come on.
Climb aboard.

290
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,867
Thanks for
softening him up.

291
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,900
You behave yourself,
Pleasant, for
a couple of days,

292
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,467
And I'll fit you
to a nice comfortable
Oregon boot.

293
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,833
Ain't no such thing
as a comfortable
leg iron.

294
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,367
Thanks, Marshal.

295
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,700
Good luck, kid.
Wire me when
you get there.

296
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,500
That 100 I'm paying
the kid looks mighty safe,
doesn't it?

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,567
I wouldn't be
in his boots
for 1,000.

298
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,033
I'll see you
when I pick up the 100.

299
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,633
Looks like they
give old cousin Hank
a good pastin'.

300
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,667
Nobody does
that to my brother.

301
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,167
Took all of 'em,
for sure.

302
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,367
Yeah, all of them.

303
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:20,500
Shoot.

304
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,733
Somewhere between
here and Huntsville,

305
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,500
We're gonna
spring Cousin Hank
from that wagon.

306
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,767
In the meantime,
let's pay a call
on that marshal

307
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,933
That helped them
gang up
on Brother Hank.

308
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,933
Afternoon,
gentlemen.

309
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,867
I understand strangers
have to check their guns
when they're in town?

310
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,433
That's right.
Here, I'll take them.

311
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh!

312
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,967
Sure parted his hair,
Cousin Aaron.

313
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,600
He got off easy.

314
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,733
Where you figuring
on camping tonight?

315
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,767
That little valley
looks good.

316
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,700
I need some water.

317
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Drink?

318
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,800
Got any whiskey?

319
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,533
- I'll lead
the way out.
- All right.

320
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,067
(WHISTLES)

321
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,767
They're movin' again.

322
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,433
Your blanket's
right over here,
Pleasant.

323
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,100
Sorry you didn't
find my food
too appetizing.

324
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,533
The thought of hangin'
kind of takes
my appetite.

325
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:38,067
Never could understand
that "hearty breakfast"
stuff about prisoners.

326
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,100
Neither could I.

327
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,533
You bed down
over there.

328
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,567
How do you feel?

329
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,167
I'm all right.
A little sleepy.

330
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,900
Hey, hold on there.

331
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,067
What do you think
I've got you along for?

332
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,733
You expecting trouble?

333
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,967
Yeah. Any prison wagon
is trouble.

334
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,600
All the time.

335
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,600
On every trip.

336
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,167
Now, there are those
that would spring a prisoner

337
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,700
If they could just for laughs.

338
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,233
Then there are the others
that are relatives,
friends that...

339
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,433
Well, they're just bent
on beating the law
out of what's theirs.

340
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,767
So one of us
has to stay awake.

341
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,433
Yeah, that's right.

342
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,133
You can take
the first watch.

343
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,400
Yeah, right up
between those two rocks,
that looks pretty good.

344
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,700
That way you can see
anybody coming up,

345
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,700
And they can't take
a free shot at you.

346
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,700
Better keep this fire
going, too.

347
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,667
I'll spell you
in about four hours.

348
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,933
Oh, by the way,
I'll be in the wagon.

349
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:38,067
That way, the prisoner
won't be able to tell
whether I'm watching or not.

350
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,300
I can take
that fella
on the horse.

351
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,467
Suppose you
just wound him.
Suppose you miss him.

352
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,467
They'll kill Hank.

353
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,367
And we'd be in
for a wing-ding fight.

354
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,733
Time and place
ain't right yet.

355
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,533
Gotta get 'em both.
We gotta be sure.

356
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,500
Well, we're still
ahead of 'em.

357
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,300
She ain't been by yet.

358
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,633
Looks like we'll have
some waiting.

359
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,967
If you like, you can
get out and stretch.

360
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,267
You heard him.
Get on out.

361
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,267
Saw some prairie hens
about a quarter mile back.

362
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,100
Maybe we can scare up
a few around here.

363
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,967
Yeah.
We can roast 'em.

364
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,833
I like mine fried.

365
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,167
They're splitting up.

366
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:06,733
Now we can take them.

367
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,100
Get him
on the first shot.

368
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,833
No need to worry
about the other one.

369
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,067
- He's headed
right this way.
-(GUN COCKING)

370
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,300
That makes it easy.
Just leave him to me.

371
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,600
Shoot him
in the belly.

372
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I want him
to die hard.

373
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,133
You head around to the wagon
and kill the other one.

374
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500

(STAGECOACH APPROACHING)

00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,267
McCool?

379
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,367
He'll be along.
My name's Reno.

380
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,667
All right.
Everybody out, gentlemen.

381
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,967
Hurry it up.

382
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:51,467
Transfer to
the Huntsville wagon.

383
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:52,700
Come on. Move.

384
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,700
Amigo,
it's a privilege.

385
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,233
The name is
Angel Dominguez.

386
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,500
Hello, Angel. They, uh,
clipped your wings, huh?

387
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,733
Ah, si.

388
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,367
- McCool?
- That's right.

389
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,267
I'm Travis.
I brought your prisoners.

390
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,900
Sign.

391
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,200
R.C. Crawford,
Angel Dominguez.

392
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,533
There you are.

393
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,200
Here's the key.

394
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,200
You Crawford?

395
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,267
R.C. Crawford
is the name.

396
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,600
This is a disgrace...

397
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,733
A railroad commissioner
shackled to a goat stealer.

398
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,467
Someone will pay for this.

399
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,467
All right, Mike.

400
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,833
Water 'em down,
fit 'em with a Oregon boot,
and get 'em loaded.

401
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,167
It's a good thing
you didn't shoot.

402
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,967
That sure was close.

403
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,533
Now, you remember
about that Gid.

404
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,533
He's the best gun
in 10 states.

405
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,967
He would've been
the best dead gun
in 10 states

406
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,167
If that stage
hadn't shown up.

407
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:07,567
People tried to take
prisoners away from him
before and they died.

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,033
Maybe with more prisoners
to look after,

409
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:16,367
We'll have a better chance
to get at him.

410
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,533
How's it going?

411
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:22,100
Well, no problem...
So far.

412
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,567
Could that be
Mike Reno?

413
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,467
Could be.

414
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:29,733
Heard about him.

415
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,067
Kind of
hot to handle, isn't he?

416
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,667
Well, we got a
hot prisoner along.

417
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,233
Sort of
evens things out.

418
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,667
Hank Pleasant.

419
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,533
- That's right.
- Good luck.

420
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,067
Only luck you have
with the likes of him

421
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,767
Or any other prisoners
is to keep 'em in chains.

422
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,800
All safe and secure, huh?

423
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,200
You betcha.

- Gracias, senor.

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,300
Whoa! Whoa!

478
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,967
(ANGEL CHOKING)

479
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,633
Pleasant! Cool off!

480
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,633
- You just cool off.
- He was makin' fun of me!

481
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,067
No reason to kill him.

482
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,600
He knows they're
gonna hang me.

483
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
Man's sensitive.

484
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,400
He's probably afraid
of rope burns.

485
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,800
You do that once more,
I'll pop your eyes out
of your head!

486
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,433
You try that once more,
Pleasant, and you're never
gonna reach Huntsville.

487
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,933
Do you hear me?

488
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,633
Now you keep quiet.

489
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,067
(COUGHING)

490
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:49,067
But I was only
telling the story
about my cousin Tico.

491
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,733
You saw him hang?

492
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:52,933
Many people did.

493
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,700
They come
from all over.

494
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,367
The marshal,
he even charged
admission.

495
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,067
Will you shut up?

496
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,600
It seems so barbaric.

497
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
They let my cousin Tico
say his last few words.

498
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,667
What did he say?

499
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,733
He say he was very happy
that so many people came.

500
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,067
I'm warnin' you.

501
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:12,667
It make feel him
very important.

502
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,467
One more word.

503
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:18,367
He had very seldom
ever felt important before.

504
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,433
(GROWLS)

505
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,367
(WHISTLES)

506
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,933
Whoa. Whoa.

507
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,700
Keep an eye on 'em.

508
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:11,067
Sorry to
inconvenience you,
gentlemen.

509
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,967
We're going to be
making a stop
at Stone Junction.

510
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,900
You just might have
some friends there.

511
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,733
Indeed I do, Constable.
I have friends
everywhere.

512
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,867
They will be shocked at
this shoddy treatment.

513
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:27,400
The reward
for five years
of public service.

514
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,067
A reward?
For why such
a strange reward?

515
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:34,400
Because those big brains
of his weren't working
quite fast enough.

516
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,067
CRAWFORD:
The greatest brain
is of no avail

517
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,633
Against treachery
and broken promises,

518
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:43,667
But this gross wrong
will soon be righted.

519
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,267
Me, too, senor.

520
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,267
Only one year.
Like my uncle,

521
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,867
I learn to be a cook
in the prison kitchen.

522
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:53,200
Then maybe I can get
a job in Huntsville.

523
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,067
Amigos, this is
a big privilege
for a poor man like me.

524
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,833
Hyah!

525
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,367
(WHISTLES)

526
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,067
Whoa.

527
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:45,800
Keep an eye on 'em.
I'll go in and
get the prisoner.

528
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,633
Hope we have to
make no more stops
after we leave this place.

529
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,400
Nothin' between here
and Huntsville

530
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,433
But rattlesnake
and sagebrush.

531
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:00,067
What a beautiful pueblo.

532
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:01,933
It's the ugliest place
I ever seen.

533
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,233
So many friendly people.

534
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,667
Uh, these poor people
having to eke out a living

535
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,100
In this god-forsaken place.

536
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,533
What're you looking for,
a brass band?

537
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:15,233
Someday I'll have one,
my friend.

538
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,100
The crowd
will be shouting,

539
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,900
"R.C. Crawford
for governor," they'll shout.

540
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,867
MAN: Hey, jailbird,

541
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,133
Why don't you
flap your wings and fly?
Huh?

542
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,733
ALL: (LAUGHING) Yeah, fly!

543
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,300
They're shouting, all right.

544
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,600
Yeah! Free transportation
to Huntsville

545
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,200
And free board
when you get there.

546
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,967
Pretty soft.

My friends!
My friends!

R.C. Crawford
is the name.

549
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,800
You have probably
heard of me.

(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

551
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,467
Now, because
of my interest
in the public welfare,

552
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:53,533
I have been framed
by some crooked
politicians,

553
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,800
But I will prove
my innocence!

554
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,300
Are you giving back
all that graft money?

(LAUGHING)

556
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,600
That money
that you refer to is a myth.

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,933

campaign speeches
all the way?

into the wagon.

that you take her with you.

know about it?

- This is Hank Pleasant,

- That's a lie.

Wouldn't surprise me none

with him.

634
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,067
I'm sorry, Miss Manon.

635
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,300
I know how you feel,
but I could tell you
some things about him.

636
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:02,900
Please don't.

637
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:04,567
Bradley Weddington.

638
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,733
Didn't he get himself killed?

639
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,667
Listen, I'm quite certain
that he deserved it.

640
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:13,367
However, I honor
his taste in the opposite sex.

641
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,800
Yeah, sure.
Lady friend done him in.

642
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,300
Dance hall entertainer.
Got three years.

643
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,200
Ah, you keep quiet,
Pleasant.
Where's your tact?

644
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,967
Don't say that to me.

645
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,833
You know, amigo,
I'm only from a
little pueblo,

646
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:29,233
But I know what you mean.

647
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,967
So she's the one
who killed Weddington, huh?

648
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:35,567
Good for you, Duchess.

649
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,200
I like a woman
with gumption.

650
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,167
I'm not sure that it took
gumption, Miss Manon.

651
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:44,433
You see, I've known
about Weddington for years.

652
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, socially
prominent family,

653
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,567
Important influence
in Washington,

654
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:54,633
Rich, charming,
pillar of society,
philanthropist,

655
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,500
And the biggest
double-crosser
in the world.

656
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,433
Oh, I don't mind
the hypocrites

657
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:04,433
As long as they don't
hurt other people,
but he did.

658
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:07,067
Yeah, I remember
once I hired out
to help bust up a press,

659
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,067
Burn down a newspaper office.

660
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,767
I heard that Weddington
paid for the job.

661
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:14,300
The newspaper probably
printed something
he didn't like.

662
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,967
Could've been
50 different people
killed Weddington.

663
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:19,200
You had to take the blame
for killing a slob like him.

664
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,767
I know how you feel.

665
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:23,867
How would you know?
You've been killing
since you were 15.

666
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,967
Yeah, but this time
I was railroaded.

667
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,400
How did I know
it was a kid?

668
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,967
It was dark.
I thought he was
coming after me.

669
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:34,767
I think if any of us
was railroaded,
it was Miss Manon.

670
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,500
Yeah. Me and her both.

671
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,300
And the jurors' wives
belonged to
the purity league.

672
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,433
If they'd brought back
a verdict of not guilty,

673
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:48,333
Their old ladies
would've locked 'em out.

674
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:51,133
I think I can hear them
hatchet-faced biddies
yelling at her.

675
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:55,700
Ah, it's an old story
in the west.

676
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,300
A man steps
a little too hard

677
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,067
On somebody's toes or neck.

678
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,733
A bullet fixes that,
and then they find
somebody convenient...

679
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,700
In this case,
Miss Manon...

680
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,333
To throw to the lions.

681
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,467
Chihuahua.
It don't seem right,
you know?

682
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,267
I was sent
to the calaboose
for stealing goats.

683
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,300
That I do not mind,

684
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,933
For I want to be a cook
like my uncle,

685
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:29,133
But a beautiful lady
killing her man
in a quarrel of love?

686
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,200
This is the way of life?

687
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,067
This is the way lovers act?

688
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,067
Angel...

689
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,833
I feel exactly
as you do,

690
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:41,300
But I'm afraid
you've missed the point.

691
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,633
Si?

692
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:46,133
How about telling us
what really happened,
Duchess?

693
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,900
Can't we talk about
something else?

694
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,333
Sorry. It sometimes
helps to talk.

695
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,667
He ought to know.
That's all he ever does...
talk, talk, talk.

696
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,967
Senorita, I will
do something
better for you.

697
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,800
I will sing you
a song so sad

698
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,833
That you will feel happy.

699
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:06,833
Thank you, Angel.
I'd love to hear one.

700
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,067
Si, senorita.

(WHISTLES)

709
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,533
Got about another hour.

710
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:18,567
Yeah, we'll make camp
the other side
of that hill.

711
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,833
Would you like
a drink, ma'am?

712
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,833
No, thank you,
Mr. Reno.

713

a pretty gal, ain't you?

You heroes

Either pushing
somebody around

717
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:38,667
Or makin' a play
for a poor gal
who can't help herself.

718
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,767
How can you
say that, amigo?

don't talk to me.

Pleasant, you're
not only a coward,
you're a dirty liar.

Pleasant!

724
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,367
I warned you
about laying hands
on the prisoner.

What did I tell ya?
Gangin' up on me.

726
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,933
McCool, as a personal
favor, let big mouth
out of that wagon.

727
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:04,900
I've got a feeling he'd rather
have you let the lady prisoner
out of the wagon, Marshal.

728
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,733
I'll let out
some of your blood.

Now I'm gonna have to
warn you about laying hands
on the prisoner.

731
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,867
Besides, you've
already taken him once.

732
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:18,167
Yeah, and I ain't about
to forget that.

733
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:20,400
I told you
I'd cause trouble.

734

He isn't trouble.
He's just hot air.

735
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,700
It'll all be over

736
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,100
When they take that
little rope and put it
around your neck.

(VOCALIZING)
And hang you.

See what I mean?

00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,533
You give 'em a badge,
they ain't human.

Anyone ever
call you human?

You just simmer down.

and you know it.

where that road
could wash out?

756

There's a wash
about three miles ahead.

757
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:46,667
Sure like to
take a look at it.

758

You know where
that detour goes?

764
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:06,867
Well, it must go
through that canyon.

765

Well, what do you think?

766
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,833
I think we're acting
like a couple of old hens
with one chick.

I see something.

Yeah, it's them.

- Say, McCool,
you notice that...
- Yeah, I know.

773

Something happened
to the sleigh tracks.

774
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:34,933
Maybe the, uh,
Indians camped off the trail.

775
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,233
Maybe that's what
they want us to think.

776
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,767
Could be
it wasn't Indians.

You're sayin'
every now and then
on these trips someone...

778
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:44,433
Tries to
set up a bushwhack?

Yeah, every now and then.

780

a little look around.

Right now,
I'm afraid so.

Who do you suppose
they were?

830
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,933
They were probably friends
of Pleasant.

00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,833
Crawford's pretty sure
about his connections.

Don't overlook
Miss Manon.

She probably has friends
who'd give their eye teeth
to deliver her.

I can't say
I blame them.

You on her side?

00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,833
It just doesn't seem right
that she should do time

For killin' some
pigheaded crook.

838

You've been listening
to Crawford.

about this Weddington
or whatever his name was,

It could be
that Crawford was lying,
didn't even know him.

843

What you're saying is
that the law's perfect.

844
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:44,833
She's guilty
and should be put away.

845
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,700
Well, now, not exactly.

846
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,500
You're saying that
she shouldn't be.

847
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,400
I'm not saying anything.

848

No more shoots.
Maybe no more bullets.

850
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,600
Maybe they're both dead.

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,767
Oh, no, senor.
Here they come.

852

must be dead.

I'll take you along.

as well settle here

to relax now.

He's quite young, isn't he?

been what she was.

Well, that's what
I found out later...

That it really
didn't matter.

your hurt pride
drove her away, hmm?

Oh, if only you hadn't
said the things to her
that you did say.

If you're thinking, uh,
about getting around me,
it won't work.

All right, let's

Didn't ask me
how I slept.

I assume.

as bad medicine.

01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:24,600
* Luz de mis ojos

947
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:30,733
(CONTINUES SINGING
IN SPANISH)

948
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:34,300
We're getting closer.

949
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,467
We'll be in Huntsville
by tomorrow night.

950
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:40,233
Not if my kin
got anything to say
about it.

951
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:44,667
The warden will realize
who R.C. Crawford is.

952
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,133
Sure.

953
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:49,067
Probably turn
the whole place
over to you.

954
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:56,800
I hope the trip
hasn't been too much
for you, ma'am.

955
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,700
No worse
than I expected.

956
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,467
Well, it should
be over tomorrow.

957
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,700
Yes,
I guess it will.

958
01:07:06,867 --> 01:07:08,667
That should make you
real happy, Mike.

959
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:10,467
Hmm?

960
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:14,800
Oh, uh, I haven't
minded it too much.

961
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:22,933
Wonder what jail's
going to be like.

962
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:25,933
Well, it won't be
much like a saloon.

963
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,067
No, I suppose not.

964
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,400
No noise. No laughter.

965
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,400
MCCOOL: No broken-down
piano playing
sad songs.

966
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,467
That's right.

967
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,500
Good night, gentlemen.

968
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:41,067
Night.

969
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,667
What are you trying
to do to her?

970
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,333
Maybe say goodbye.

971
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:57,567
How come you
hate her so much?

972
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:01,633
Reminds me of someone.

973
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,400
In about three minutes,
for me it'll be
about four hours later.

974
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:14,367
Yes, sir, I'd sure
like to see Willett's face
when he pays off.

975
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,833
(HORSE WHINNYING)

976
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,967
Don't ever come
sneaking up like that.

977
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:57,400
Sorry. I...
I couldn't sleep.

978
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,667
You might've got
yourself shot at.

979
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:02,833
May I sit down?

980
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:07,867
I don't know why
he lets you
wander around free,

981
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,300
Even if you couldn't
get too far
in this country.

982
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,067
I almost wish
you had shot me.

983
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:20,200
Don't say that.

984
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,067
It might be better.

985
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:25,067
How do you think
I'd feel about it?

986
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,433
I mean...
I mean, about
killing a woman.

987
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,933
A no-good woman?

988
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,767
I heard different.

989
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:40,467
What you heard
was that I killed
a no-good man.

990
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,700
Why don't you
go back to where
you were sleeping?

991
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,867
I'm not sleepy.

992
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:47,933
Well, you can't stay
around here.

993
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:51,267
You afraid I might
take that gun
away from you?

994
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:55,367
(CHUCKLES) No, of course not.

995
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:58,933
Then why can't I stay?

996
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:01,267
All right, stay.

997
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,800
We could talk a little.

998
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,533
Go ahead, talk.

999
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:14,333
Certainly does get
lonesome out here.

1000
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,767
Yeah, it sure does.

1001
01:10:27,133 --> 01:10:29,033
Mind if I call you Mike?

1002
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,500
You just did.

1003
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,200
You call me Laura.

1004
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,033
Laura.

1005
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:45,167
Mike, I've noticed
the way you
look at me sometimes.

1006
01:10:45,267 --> 01:10:46,967
I look at everybody.

1007
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:49,733
In that same way?

1008
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,233
Yeah. I stare.

1009
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,133
Look,
let's talk about
something else, huh?

1010
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,467
I always look back,
don't I?

1011
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:01,133
I, uh...

1012
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,333
I didn't notice.

1013
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:10,600
Why don't
you notice, now?

1014
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:26,800
You're not going to jail.

1015
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:30,233
You don't deserve that.

1016
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,167
Three years
won't be too long.

1017
01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:34,767
Three years?
That's like 300.

1018
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,267
The time will pass, and...
Someday, maybe...

1019
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:48,333
You're not gonna
do any time.
I'm gonna see to that.

1020
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,700
Mike, Mike,
that's not possible.

1021
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,533
I'm gonna
make it possible now,
while they're asleep.

1022
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:56,800
I'm coming along.

1023
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,533
Oh, no.
That'll be dangerous
for you.

1024
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,800
Besides, how?

1025
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:07,567
I'll... I'll break
the firing pin
in McCool's gun.

1026
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:10,233
You can take my horse.
I'll take one of the mules.

1027
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,733
You'll be a wanted man.

1028
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,233
It doesn't matter.

1029
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,700
MCCOOL: It matters to me.

1030
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:31,200
Looks like Willett
collects his bet.

1031
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,467
You're not gonna
stop me or her.

1032
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:35,067
(COCKS HAMMER) I think I am.

1033
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:42,800
Things haven't
changed a bit,
have they?

1034
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,167
Same Laura.

1035
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:49,167
You haven't changed
either, Gid.

1036
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:51,567
Time has.

1037
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,533
You knew her before?

1038
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:56,067
Yeah.

1039
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,200
Once.

1040
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,667
It's not the way
it looks.

1041
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:01,933
It never is.

1042
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:03,333
You've got
to believe me this time.

1043
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:04,900
Why?

1044
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,067
Ask him.

1045
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:11,900
Nothing has changed.
The same game.

1046
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:14,767
Why didn't you say
something about it?

1047
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:18,067
We decided back
in the jail that it'd be
better not to.

1048
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,267
Gid, Mike and I just...

1049
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,633
I just wanted to be
free. I don't want
to go to jail.

1050
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:31,667
Surely you can
understand that.

1051
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:34,567
I shot Weddington
in self-defense.

1052
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,100
He was going to kill me.

1053
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,233
That's what
you told the jury.

1054
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,533
I shouldn't have
to serve time.

1055
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:42,067
I agree.

1056
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,067
The judge
thought different.

1057
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:49,633
Look, I don't care
when you knew her or
why or how. That's past.

1058
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:53,233
Now I say she isn't gonna
do time in some prison.

1059
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,967
My orders read,
"Deliver the prisoners."

1060
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,500
I'd better take
that gun belt.

1061
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,733
Now.

1062
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:23,633
They will
kill each other.

1063
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:27,233
If they don't,
I will.

1064
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,400
(GRUNTING)

1065
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:40,233
They're fighting
like a couple
of animals.

1066
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,700
The winner gets
the girl.

1067
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,567
They don't know it yet,
but I'm gonna be
the winner.

1068
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,067
They do not see
Senor Pleasant.

1069
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:29,833
Good. Maybe
he'll kill them both,

1070
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:32,100
Then we'll get away,
the four of us.

1071
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,900
But... But you
are innocent.

1072
01:15:35,067 --> 01:15:36,400
There were appeals
for you.

1073
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,233
There are no appeals.
I'm not innocent.

1074
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:43,800
But senor, you told us
that you were innocent,
and you're guilty?

1075
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,533
(GRUNTING)

1076
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:11,400
You're not the first
to let a woman make
a fool out of you.

1077
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:15,867
This isn't gonna
change anything.

1078
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,567
You're gonna make
the rest of the trip
in shackles.

1079
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:21,833
Let go of him.

1080
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,967
Get up there.

1081
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:26,633
Don't make me shoot.

1082
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,267
You go right ahead.

1083
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:40,633
(SHACKLES CLINKING)

1084
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:45,400
I know you think
you're still right.

1085
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,967
You get the chance,
you'd probably
try it again.

1086
01:16:50,067 --> 01:16:53,233
Well, you're not
gonna be getting
a chance.

1087
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:56,800
You think
she likes you.

1088
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,833
She was just conning you.

1089
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,433
McCool, here's your rifle.

1090
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:16,067
You should've used it.

1091
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,333
You knew I wouldn't.

1092
01:17:19,433 --> 01:17:21,600
You killed one man.

1093
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,667
If you'd have used it,

1094
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:25,967
You two could've
been out of here
by now.

1095
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:28,500
Why don't you
leave me alone, Marshal?

1096
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,967
Get your bracelets on,
Honey.

1097
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,600
All right, you,
get over here.

1098
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,567
Can I make breakfast,
Senor McCool?

1099
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:49,500
There'll be no time
for breakfast.
We're too late now.

1100
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,567
All right,
let's get aboard.

1101
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:03,533
I'm sorry, Angel.

1102
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:06,300
Sorry I didn't thank you
for yesterday.

1103
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,800
Well, thank you
for thanking me,
senor.

1104
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,100
You know, I was thinking,
when we get to the prison,

1105
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,700
I'll talk to the warden
about you.

1106
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,933
Senor Constable,

1107
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:22,233
If you can only
get me a job
in the prison kitchen.

1108
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:24,933
That's not exactly what
I was thinking about.

1109
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,900
I was thinking
maybe the warden would...

1110
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:30,600
Would write to the governor
and they'd get you
a pardon.

1111
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,567
That would mean
they would not let me
stay in prison?

1112
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:38,233
That's right.
You'd be able to get out.

1113
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,067
Oh, no, senor,
that's no good,

1114
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,400
Not until I learn
to cook.

1115
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,167
It would be no good
if I could not cook

1116
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,267
So I can get a job
in the big city.

1117
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,067
We'll see, Angel.

1118
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:54,933
Pleasant!

1119
01:18:56,967 --> 01:19:00,833
One thing I'll say
for you, you sure never
give up trying.

1120
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:03,733
Now get in
the wagon.

1121
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,233
(WHISTLES)

1122
01:19:24,633 --> 01:19:28,067
See, Mike,
I am trouble.

1123
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,067
I'm not complaining.

1124
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,300
Thanks for trying.

1125
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,233
It ain't over yet.

1126
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,733
We'll be in Huntsville
tonight.

1127
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,600
We still got
a few miles to go.

1128
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,867
If your kin
do liberate us,

1129
01:19:42,967 --> 01:19:45,300
Are you still going
to take me with you?

1130
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,367
But Senor Crawford
told me he was guilty.

1131
01:19:48,467 --> 01:19:50,867
R.C. Crawford guilty?

1132
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:53,067
A crook? No.

1133
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,067
I'm a desperate man,
Mr. Pleasant.

1134
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,633
Mr. Pleasant.

1135
01:19:57,733 --> 01:20:00,300
Don't make me beg.

1136
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,600
They liberate us,
I'm going to put you
out of your misery.

1137
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,867
A bullet right through
your big fat mouth.

1138
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:30,067
Bunco, I'm right glad
that you and Alfie agreed
to come along with us.

1139
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,633
Shucks, Aaron,

1140
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:34,300
Me and Alfie's
been beholden
to Hank Pleasant

1141
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,567
For more years
than we can remember.

1142
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:40,800
Aaron, ain't you
forgetting about old Tub
throwing in with us?

1143
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,333
I was just waitin' to see
if he could hold out.

1144
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,767
Don't worry about him.

1145
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:49,100
He may not be
the man that Chig is,
but he'll hold up.

1146
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,833
I know he will.
I was just joshin'.

1147
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:55,000
The main road's
over yonder.

1148
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,067
I'll go on up ahead.

1149
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:00,867
The rest of you stay quiet.
And don't run your horses
until I give the signal.

(ANGEL SINGING IN SPANISH)

1151
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:40,733
Senor McCool,
a man up there!

1152
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:43,867
A man up there!

1153
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:46,200
- Yeah? Where?
- Right up there!

1154
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,433
He is looking at us.
And he had a rifle.

1155
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:50,267
The crazy goat
thief's lyin'.

1156
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:52,967
I swear it, senor.
A man on a horse!

1157
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,233
PLEASANT: He's trying
to spook you, McCool.

1158
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:04,633
Ain't nobody
out there, McCool.

1159
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:08,467
They'll kill us!
They'll kill us all,
except him.

1160
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,567
They're all
right down there.

1161
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,600
This should be easy
as hot pie.

1162
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,933
I didn't see the one
on horseback, though.

1163
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,967
He's more than likely
resting up in the wagon.

1164
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:31,567
I like hot pie
the easy way.

1165
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,300
That's why
we're all here.

1166
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,967
We got him six to two.

1167
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:38,400
They gotta take
the chances, not us.

1168
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,333
Come on, fellas.
Just take care of yourselves
and keep plucking.

1169
01:22:42,433 --> 01:22:45,133
Let's go.

1170
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:01,967
If the wagon is attacked,
you'll help Gid,
won't you?

1171
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:03,400
Why?

1172
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,400
You can't let him
fight alone.

1173
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,433
Why can't I?

1174
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:12,433
Call to him.
Tell him you'll help him.

1175
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:14,800
Not a chance.

1176
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:17,100
Listen, kid,
and listen fast.

1177
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,767
He was right.
I was conning you.

1178
01:23:19,867 --> 01:23:21,733
I'd have done
anything to escape.

1179
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,433
You could've shot him
and you didn't.

1180
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,167
You know why,
don't you?

1181
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:26,567
He does.

1182
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:30,067
I'm in love with him.
Always have been.

1183
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,667
That's why he
turned his back
on the rifle.

1184
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:35,233
He knew
I wouldn't shoot.

You'll ever have
to grow up.

1188

Are you gonna let us
just sit here
and get shot at?

1189
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:13,300
Nobody is shooting
at you.

1190
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,667
I told ya.

1191
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:17,900
I told ya
they'd come.

get killed!

But you're being a chump, too,
if you don't let me help you.

1200
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:45,233
We can take 'em.

Mike.

1202
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,567

than you and McCool
to stop 'em.
