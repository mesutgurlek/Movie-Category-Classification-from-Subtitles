1
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,866
<i>For more than
four long bitter years</i>

2
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,398
<i>this nation
was torn by a civil war.</i>

3
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,272
<i>The bloodiest
and most destructive
in our history.</i>

4
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,205
<i>For it was a war
of neighbor against neighbor,</i>

5
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,880
<i>family against family,
brother against brother,</i>

6
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,345
<i>flag against flag.</i>

7
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:57,349
<i>Nor was the slaughter
confined to the armies
of the North and South alone.</i>

8
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,482
<i>There was a war-bred
outlaw army of guerrillas</i>

9
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,253
<i>masquerading under the flags
of both sides</i>

10
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,818
<i>pillaging, burning,</i>

11
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,659
<i>and killing for private gains.</i>

12
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,695
<i>The most savage
and merciless
among the lawless tribes</i>

13
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,095
<i>whose organized violence
terrorized the country</i>

14
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,741
<i>were the men
who marched, raided and killed</i>

15
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,707
<i>under the ominous black flag
of William Clarke Quantrill.</i>

16
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,123
Well, sir, there she is,
Lawrence, Kansas.

17
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,985
Figure we oughta ride through
or had we better go around?

18
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,721
<i>Well, why shouldn't we
ride through?</i>

19
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,492
Because a town that big
is bound to have a sizeable
troop of Union soldiers in it.

20
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>I ain't scared
of no Union soldiers,</i>

21
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,466
<i>it's them Redlegs
that worries me.</i>

22
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,130
How come a man gets
mean enough
to want to be a Redleg?

23
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,299
<i>My pappy says
there ain't nobody meaner.</i>

24
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>He says they're just acting
like they're working
for the Union Army</i>

25
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,068
<i>so's they have a chance
to kill and rob decent folks.</i>

26
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,275
Well, are we gonna
sit up here all day and gab
or are we gonna move on?

27
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,215
<i>We're riding through.</i>

28
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,984
See how that thing
reads, Frank.

29
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,458
<i>"Scores counted dead
in New York draft riots.</i>

30
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,571
<i>"Fall of Vicksburg.
Mississippi opened
to Union forces.</i>

31
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,769
<i>"Quantrill guerrillas
strike Kansas border
with fire and swords."</i>

32
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,370
Quantrill must be
quite some man.

33
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,879
Looks like these town folks
is kinda jumpy, Jess.

34
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,848
You think
we ought to stop here
or keep on moving?

35
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,913
<i>Don't look like
we're gonna have much to say
about it one way or another.</i>

36
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:50,978
Redlegs!

37
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,366
Which one of you
does the talking?

38
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,562
What do you want to know?

39
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,900
<i>What're you doing
in this town?
Just passing through.</i>

40
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,910
<i>Where to?
We ain't just sure.</i>

41
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,170
<i>If you're so set
on finding out,
you're welcome to tag along.</i>

42
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,274
<i>If they ain't Quantrill's men,
I'm a horse thief.</i>

43
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,450
<i>You're a horse thief.</i>

44
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,849
So Quantrill sent you in
to do a little spying, huh?

45
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,050
Quantrill? Never laid eyes
on the man.

46
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,558
<i>That's not what
I asked you.</i>

47
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,026
You got
your answer, Mister.

48
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,765
<i>Bring 'em down to the post.</i>

49
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,276
What your names? You.

50
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,607
Jesse James.
Frank James.

51
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,312
You brothers?
Yep.

52
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,112
Cole Younger.
Jim Younger.

53
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,123
<i>You brothers, too?
That's right.</i>

54
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,215
Kit Dalton.

55
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,884
<i>What's the matter?
Ain't you got no brothers?</i>

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh, I got
a couple of brothers
back home,

57
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,762
but they were
smart enough to stay there.

58
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,724
How long you fellows
been with Quantrill?

59
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,565
I asked you a question!

60
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,103
<i>Ain't no sense answering,</i>

61
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,900
done that once already.

62
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,975
<i>You fellows
don't seem to realize</i>

63
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,567
<i>that there's a war
going on.</i>

64
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,545
<i>Maybe for you there is,
but it ain't no concern to us.</i>

65
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,206
<i>That's where you're wrong.</i>

66
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,308
<i>In the border country
you're either a Union man
or a spy.</i>

67
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,377
The Union men
get put in the army,

68
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,319
the spies get hung.

69
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,287
<i>Ain't much
of a choice, is it?</i>

70
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,223
<i>That's the choice you got.</i>

71
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,851
When it comes
to joining an army,

72
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,021
<i>we'll just make up
our own minds.</i>

73
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,492
All right,

74
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,432
<i>and we'll see you get
a nice legal court-martial</i>

75
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,833
before the hanging.

76
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,063
<i>Let's hang him now!</i>

77
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,731
Hold it!

78
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,642
<i>What's all this talk
about lynching someone?</i>

79
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,215
<i>We caught these five
snooping around town.
They're Quantrill men.</i>

80
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,478
<i>Is that true?
I been trying' to tell him
we ain't,</i>

81
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,850
but he seems more set
on hanging us than hearing
what we got to say.

82
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,354
Well, what have you
got to say?

83
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,890
<i>Are you Quantrill men,
or aren't you?</i>

84
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:05,946
No, sir.

85
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,716
<i>Turn 'em loose.
Now look here...</i>

86
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,091
Just a minute!

87
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,726
Till I get orders
to the contrary,

88
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,287
<i>I'm in command
of the military here.</i>

89
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,562
<i>What're you trying to do?
Go Quantrill one better,
hanging little kids?</i>

90
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,966
Quantrill never done
no such thing.

91
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,731
<i>See? What'd I tell you?
That's enough.</i>

92
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,329
Get on your way, boys.

93
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,884
<i>Captain, I'm obliged to you
for speaking' up
for us back there</i>

94
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,948
<i>Forget it, son.
I'd like to give you
a piece of advice.</i>

95
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,262
<i>If you are figuring
on joining Quantrill,
don't do it.</i>

96
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,194
<i>Thanks, but we don't want
that kind of advice.</i>

97
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,959
All right,
then take a warning.

98
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,931
<i>Quantrill and what's left
of his guerrillas are as good
as hung right now.</i>

99
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,267
<i>If that's what
you're looking for, go ahead.</i>

100
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,997
I wonder if they would have
really strung us up
back there?

101
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,658
You reckon so, Jesse?

102
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,294
I reckon.

103
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,497
<i>We'd either be swinging
right now or fighting
for the Yankees.</i>

104
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,797
<i>You know that Captain
didn't come in any too soon.</i>

105
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,342
I sure thought we was gone

106
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,310
when old Jess busted out
and stuck up for Quantrill
that way.

107
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,312
<i>I don't like to stand by
and see nobody blacken
a man's name.</i>

108
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,508
<i>To hear you talk,
you'd think you and Quantrill
was old friends.</i>

109
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,617
<i>He's a real man's all I know</i>

110
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,211
A real fighting man.

111
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,356
<i>You know, I'm wondering
why that Captain let us go.</i>

112
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,916
He had a mighty good notion
where we was going.

113
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,861
Yeah, he did.

114
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,260
<i>I'd like to know his name.</i>

115
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,299
<i>I'd kinda like
to remember him.</i>

116
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,235
To hear the Yankees tell it,

117
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,739
<i>Quantrill's got two horns,
two hoofs and a long tail.</i>

118
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,674
He sure must be
a real man at that

119
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,472
Chewing up
that Union cavalry faster

120
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,137
than the Yankees
can send them out here.

121
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,315
Him and 50 men
whipped a whole regiment
at Gainesville, I hear.

122
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>Well, I wonder
if we're getting
near his camp.</i>

123
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,143
<i>It's sure been a long ride.</i>

124
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,687
<i>We're getting near, all right,</i>

125
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,789
<i>or them Redlegs back in town
wouldn't have been so scared.</i>

126
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,257
You know,

127
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,819
riding with a man
like Quantrill,

128
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,292
<i>we're liable to all
be famous one of these days,</i>

129
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,298
that is if the war
lasts long enough.

130
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,166
Might have our own outfits,

131
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,169
a company,
a whole regiment even.

132
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,697
I can see me now,
riding at the head
of 100 men

133
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,504
in a spanking grey uniform
and black shiny boots.

134
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,942
<i>Man, there ain't
nothing' wrong with that!</i>

135
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,342
Nothing, except the pay.

136
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,479
<i>The regular army
ain't no place
for an ambitious man.</i>

137
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,107
I suppose
you expect to get rich.

138
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,242
Uh-huh.

139
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,149
<i>How're you gonna get rich?
Fighting Yankees?</i>

140
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,687
<i>Where's your brains, boy?</i>

141
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,116
<i>Don't you know them banks
in them Yankee towns
are just bulging with money?</i>

142
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,658
<i>Yeah,
but that'd be stealing.</i>

143
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,490
With the regulars
it would,

144
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,962
<i>but not with
a guerrilla outfit
like Quantrill's.</i>

145
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,332
Well, what do you know?

146
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,592
What do you say
about that, Jesse?

147
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,234
<i>Well, the bank's got
plenty of money in it,</i>

148
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,535
no harm taking
a little of it, I guess,

149
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,632
in war time, anyway.

150
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,100
<i>What's that?</i>

151
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,670
Looks like our Mr. Quantrill
is close by these parts
sure enough.

152
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,108
<i>They must've been spies.</i>

153
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,111
<i>Well, they couldn't have known
much about their trade.</i>

154
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,010
nosing around
a Southern guerrilla outfit
dressed up like Redlegs.

155
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,243
Well, if they were spies
they got just what was
coming to them.

156
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,980
<i>Maybe he's the kind of a man
that likes a hanging
every so often.</i>

157
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,255
Hello. Can we be
of any further help to you?

158
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,884
That trace pulled loose.

159
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,792
Would you mind
hooking it up for me?

160
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,022
Kit.

161
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,628
<i>Don't believe
I've seen you boys
around here before, have I?</i>

162
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,689
No.

163
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,701
Just drifting, huh?

164
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,762
<i>Wouldn't be heading
for Quantrill's headquarters,
would you?</i>

165
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,100
Maybe.

166
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,506
<i>Anywhere's near?</i>

167
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,475
<i>What do you think
he's running,
a nursery school?</i>

168
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,674
<i>I wouldn't know, ma'am.</i>

169
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,182
Thanks anyway.

170
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,977
More recruits
for the butcher brigade.

171
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,756
<i>That's a funny way to talk.</i>

172
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,802
<i>Don't you know about women?
They can't talk no other way.</i>

173
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,539
<i>She could be real pretty
if she weren't looking so mad.</i>

174
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,632
<i>Well, we'd better get going,
or the war'll be over</i>

175
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,870
<i>and we'll be old men
before we even see Quantrill.</i>

176
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,571
<i>Yeah, come on, Jesse,
let's go</i>

177
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>It's about that time,
ain't it?</i>

178
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,085
<i>It's long past.
He's late today.</i>

179
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,516
Looks like a bad day
for them Yankees.

180
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,127
<i>Every day's a bad day
for them Yankees
when Quantrill holds court.</i>

181
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,632
<i>Court's in session.</i>

182
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,814
All right.
Follow me!

183
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,550
Come on,
step out. Come on.

184
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,128
Come on there,
come on!

185
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,400
All right, right in here.

186
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,035
Line up, come on.

187
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,733
Get in there.
Come on, get in line
over there, come on.

188
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,034
Right over there,
come on!

189
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,463
<i>You're under military arrest
as enemy spies.</i>

190
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,736
But it has always been
my policy to permit
my enemies

191
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,502
to speak in their own defense
before pronouncing sentence.

192
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,737
<i>We're not enemy spies!
We're soldiers, sir,</i>

193
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,369
in the uniform
of the Northern Army.

194
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,006
We were ambushed by your men
while on a scouting mission

195
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,074
We demand
the customary treatment
accorded prisoners of war

196
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,977
<i>You'll get
the customary treatment
of enemy spies.</i>

197
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,888
<i>That's it, Willis.</i>

198
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,756
All right, move out,
Come on!

199
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,158
Step out there.

200
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,475
<i>Well, fella,
what've you got to say?</i>

201
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,638
<i>They ain't nothing I could say
that'd bring back my wife
and children, is there?</i>

202
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,840
You fired on my soldiers!

203
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,247
<i>Not till after they murdered
my family, I didn't.</i>

204
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,410
Fortunes of war, mister.

205
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,453
<i>Women and babies
don't fight nobody.</i>

206
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,421
That man led
your drunken raiders
onto my place

207
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,889
<i>and shot 'em down
when they was running
for safety.</i>

208
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,688
You call them soldiers?

209
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,759
<i>They're cowardly,
thieving killers!</i>

210
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,391
Robbing, burning,
shooting at anything
or anybody

211
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,864
without a chance or warning.

212
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,163
You call that war?
Put that away, Tate.

213
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,856
Mr. Anderson,
whom have we here?

214
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,451
Prowlers, Colonel.
The dangerous kind,
Colonel.

215
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,360
Probably in the pay
of the Redlegs,

216
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,399
I suggest we get rid of them
along with the others

217
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,094
<i>They're boys, mere boys.</i>

218
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,159
Yeah, plenty young
and plenty fresh.

219
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,400
They look like
good boys to me.
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,135
We came to join up.

221
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,100
Can you ride?
Can you shoot?

222
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,706
We do fair.

223
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,741
Can you fight?
Do you want to fight?

224
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,613
<i>Well, that's what we rode
all the way from Missouri for,
Mr. Quantrill.</i>

225
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,314
Colonel Quantrill.

226
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,617
<i>Well, you'll sort of have to
excuse us, Colonel,</i>

227
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,385
<i>we ain't had
too much experience
with uniforms.</i>

228
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,720
<i>It's all right.</i>

229
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,984
So you want a fight, huh?

230
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,724
<i>Well, we'll see.</i>

231
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,560
This is
my second-in-command,
Mr. Anderson,

232
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,903
my third, Rudolph Tate.

233
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,703
Five of you, huh?

234
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,273
<i>Well, we'll swear 'em
in tonight.</i>

235
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,207
<i>In the meantime,
they're all yours, Mr. Tate.</i>

236
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,266
All mine, sir?

237
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,938
Within reason.
Yes, sir.

238
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,272
Come on.

239
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,245
Where you kids come from?

240
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,051
Just told you,
down Missouri way.

241
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,582
<i>I didn't know they let you
put on long pants
so young down there.</i>

242
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,458
What you boys figure
on doing in this outfit?

243
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,191
Mind the horses
while the men do the fighting?

244
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,562
We figure on minding
our own business

245
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,157
if others
will do the same.

246
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,223
What you mean
by that, boy?

247
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,167
<i>Look, mister, why don't you
go on about your chores</i>

248
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,228
and stop making out
such a hard case.

249
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,171
<i>Maybe you think
I ain't a hard case.</i>

250
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,640
<i>We don't know.</i>

251
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,771
You look hard enough
on the outside,

252
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,109
<i>but that don't say
what you've got
on the inside.</i>

253
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,547
Well, this is where
you get your chance
to find out, sonny.

254
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,614
<i>Looks like somebody's gonna
have to fight the man.</i>

255
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,314
<i>I'll take him, Jesse.
Let me fight.</i>

256
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,378
No.

257
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,285
<i>Looks like I'm the one
he's taken a hankering for.</i>

258
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,189
Just you name it,
sonny.

259
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,354
All right, I may as well
make it for keeps.

260
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,331
<i>Looks like that's the only way
we're gonna have
any peace around here</i>

261
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,368
Frank, find us
a couple of knives.

262
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,299
<i>He's got a lot of nerve,
that kid.</i>

263
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,438
I once seen a couple fellas
cut each other to pieces

264
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,412
in one of them
handkerchief fights.

265
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,473
You know the rules.

266
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,177
First one that lets go
of the handkerchief loses.

267
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,549
I know, I know!

268
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,316
<i>I just hope you know 'em
'cause you gonna need 'em
when I get through with him.</i>

269
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,788
Take your time, Mister,

270
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,224
<i>you ain't likely to have
too much of it left.</i>

271
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,366
All right, Tate,
show him how tough you are!

272
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,403
That youngster meant it
when he said
he wanted to fight.

273
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,072
Yeah.

274
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,893
<i>Kill 'em and bury 'em.</i>

275
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,926
<i>All in day's work, huh?</i>

276
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,298
<i>You've got
the wrong idea, ma'am.</i>

277
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,891
It was either him or me.

278
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,338
<i>Besides, it didn't look like
none of his friends
was gonna bury him.</i>

279
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,929
<i>He didn't wanna kill you.</i>

280
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,941
Quantrill told him
to pick a fight with you

281
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,374
to test your mettle.

282
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,741
<i>Didn't you know that?</i>

283
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,274
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

284
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,807
<i>He could've stopped it,
couldn't he?</i>

285
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,409
<i>Why don't you go home?
Go home and take
your kid friends with you.</i>

286
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,450
<i>First off, we don't have
no homes left to go back to.</i>

287
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,387
The Yanks took care of that.

288
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,790
<i>That's why
the Colonel's enemies
are ours.</i>

289
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,953
<i>Do you think
Quantrill's fighting a war?</i>

290
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,964
<i>You heard that farmer talk
about his murdered family,
didn't you?</i>

291
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,660
You know about the robbed
and burned-out homes.

292
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,498
<i>Quantrill's responsible
for that,</i>

293
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,800
for all of it.
He ordered it!

294
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,730
<i>I don't think the Colonel
would do a thing like that.</i>

295
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,469
<i>I think he's a fine man.</i>

296
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,772
<i>The Colonel's a fine man,</i>

297
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,008
and so was Rudolph Tate.

298
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,158
The troops are mounted
and ready, sir.
Very good, Lieutenant.

299
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,355
Any word from
the reconnaissance patrol?
No, sir.

300
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,990
<i>The patrol's
six hours overdue.
I don't like it.</i>

301
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,159
<i>Think they might've
been trapped
in a guerrilla ambush, sir?</i>

302
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,293
<i>That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

303
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,065
We could get there
a lot faster, Captain, if we
knew where we were going.

304
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,437
<i>We should've
had that information
two hours ago.</i>

305
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,033
<i>Information that would
lead us straight
to Quantrill's headquarters.</i>

306
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,145
Give him
a half-hour more.
Him?

307
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,909
<i>We've got a man in their camp
in the pay of the Union Army.</i>

308
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,951
<i>You mean, sir, we've got a spy
in Quantrill's camp?</i>

309
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,384
<i>That's right.
He's one of Quantrill's
right-hand men,</i>

310
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,921
Rudolph Tate.

311
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,726
What kind of show
you figure this is
gonna be, Jesse?

312
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,165
<i>I don't know,
but it looks like
we're gonna find out</i>

313
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,971
<i>Maybe the Colonel's fixing
to roast a couple of Yankees
for his supper.</i>

314
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,268
I heard when Quantrill
swears anyone in,

315
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,831
he likes it
kinda fancy-like.

316
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,268
All right, on your feet!

317
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,425
Where are the candidates?
Right over there, sir.

318
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,865
You five, down here.

319
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,637
Comrades and fellow soldiers,

320
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,181
we are gathered here
to take into our midst,

321
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,909
if they be worthy,

322
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,582
<i>five volunteers
in the service of
Quantrill's Guerrilla Arny.</i>

323
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,550
Are those five prepared
to take the oath?

324
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,285
We are.

325
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,359
Do you swear never to betray
a comrade of this band

326
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,496
or ever to reveal
a single secret
of this organization

327
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,803
or a single word of this,
your oath?

328
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,997
We swear.

329
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,904
Do you further swear

330
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,637
never to desert
a comrade who is in peril,

331
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,976
or ever, even in the face
of certain death

332
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,412
permit him to fall into
the hands of our enemies?

333
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,676
We swear.

334
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,211
Then Frank and Jesse James,

335
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,646
Cole and Jim Younger,

336
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,781
Kit Dalton,

337
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:51,553
you are henceforth
and forevermore sworn comrades
and blood brothers

338
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,766
<i>of this, the company
of Quantrill's Guerilla Army.</i>

339
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,862
<i>Congratulations, Mr. James,
you're now one of us.</i>

340
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,168
Thank you, sir.

341
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,072
<i>You're the leader
of this group, I presume?</i>

342
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,440
<i>Well, I wouldn't
say that, sir.</i>

343
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,978
<i>He wouldn't,
but the rest of us will.</i>

344
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,172
You bet.

345
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,045
<i>Come on in to headquarters,
I'd like to talk
with you a minute.</i>

346
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,452
Mr. Anderson, you can
break out the grog.

347
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,720
Kate,

348
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,429
this is Jesse James.

349
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,692
I want you two
to be friends.

350
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,738
<i>You should've seen
the way he handled
Rudolph Tate this morning.</i>

351
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,428
I did.

352
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,472
Oh, I meant to ask you
about that, Colonel.

353
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,774
<i>Why did he prod me that way?
I didn't give him no cause
to pick on me.</i>

354
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,542
<i>'Cause he was mean,
an untruthful man,</i>

355
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,776
always was that way,
no good.

356
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,785
He was good enough for you
until today.

357
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,385
<i>That's because I had to
put up with him, Kate,
you know that.</i>

358
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,888
But I never did trust him.

359
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,822
<i>Good riddance.
We'll drink to it.</i>

360
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,660
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

361
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,066
Do you know
where this war
is gonna be won?

362
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,407
Here, right here in the West.

363
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,907
<i>You know who's gonna win it?
We are.</i>

364
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,239
Now this, my boy,

365
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,510
<i>is what we call
"grand strategy".</i>

366
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,418
<i>Now here's
the approximate position
of the armies right now.</i>

367
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,353
Lee is retreating
from Gettysburg,

368
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,823
New Orleans and Vicksburg
have fallen

369
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,617
leaving the entire length
of the Mississippi
open to the Union forces.

370
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,660
Now, what does that mean?

371
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,164
<i>Well, the way I see it,
it means our side
ain't doing so good.</i>

372
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,064
It means that the South
is effectively surrounded,

373
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,204
now that the Northern Navies
control the seas.

374
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,701
Is it that bad?

375
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,210
No, no, no,
you missed the point!

376
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,442
This is just
the first phases,
the preliminary battles.

377
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,142
Let the North win the battles,

378
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,616
<i>we'll win the war!</i>

379
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,781
How we gonna do that
if they keep on licking us
all the time?

380
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,051
<i>Because we're only
giving ground,</i>

381
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,820
the North is giving men.

382
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,192
And the manpower of the North
is not completely
inexhaustible.

383
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,828
<i>Lee's strategy
has been good on the whole,
quite good.</i>

384
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,036
<i>Although as yet,
he's not seen
far enough ahead</i>

385
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,663
but he will.

386
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>We'll see to that.</i>

387
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,504
Come on, drink up.

388
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,780
<i>What's the matter,
don't you like this stuff?</i>

389
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,614
<i>It's just that
I ain't so used to it.</i>

390
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,676
Oh.

391
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,654
<i>Well, now here's
what I mean.</i>

392
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:37,893
When Lee eventually realizes
the hopelessness
of his present position,

393
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,225
<i>what's he gonna do?</i>

394
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,628
<i>Where's he gonna go?</i>

395
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,360
<i>There's only
one possibility.</i>

396
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,535
Here, the West.

397
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,101
May take months, even years.

398
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,869
But here
he can bide his time,

399
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,968
gather his strength
for that great counter-attack

400
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,673
that will drive
the Union Army into the sea.

401
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,572
<i>Colonel, you're right.</i>

402
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,349
If he could get
his men on this side
of the Mississippi,

403
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,182
the Yanks would
never dare cross.

404
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,551
There you are.

405
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,954
I knew you had
a head for strategy.

406
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,053
Now you know why I said
that we will win the war!

407
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,729
<i>That's our great task.
Our glorious cause.</i>

408
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,360
Our gateway
to immortal fame.

409
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,165
<i>Let's drink to it.</i>

410
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,512
<i>That Colonel Quantrill
sure chatters
like a magpie, don't he?</i>

411
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,172
Mighty near give me
an earache.

412
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,081
My ole pappy used to say
that if a man
talked long enough

413
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,881
<i>and loud enough
somebody's sure
to believe him.</i>

414
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,249
<i>Yeah, that's what
worries me</i>

415
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,726
Jesse hangs on pretty near
every word Quantrill says.

416
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,558
<i>We'll sweep 'em
into the sea.</i>

417
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,466
<i>I've got a hundred men now.</i>

418
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,935
<i>I'll have 100,000, more!</i>

419
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,538
<i>I'll be second-in-command
to Lee himself,</i>

420
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,175
<i>after all Lee's no longer
a young man.</i>

421
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,371
<i>Let's drink to that.</i>

422
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,376
Now, with my strategy...
Stop it!

423
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,347
<i>Haven't you given the boy
enough strategy for one night?</i>

424
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,819
<i>I guess you're right,
my dear.</i>

425
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,118
The hour is late.

426
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,282
I was just gonna say I...

427
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,590
I think I ought to be going.

428
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,059
Goodnight, Colonel.
Goodnight, my boy.

429
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,674
Goodnight, Miss Kate.

430
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,842
<i>You'll have to excuse me,
I ain't so used to it.</i>

431
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,993
What are you trying to do
to that boy?

432
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,259
Stuffing his head
with all your nonsense.

433
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,190
Nonsense?

434
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,932
I meant
every word of it, Kate.
Every word of it.

435
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,975
<i>Can't you realize
how useful that boy
can be to me?</i>

436
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,036
You saw his devotion.

437
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,449
<i>He's a born leader</i>

438
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,684
Who knows, maybe someday
he might even share my power.

439
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,218
<i>What's the matter, Kate?</i>

440
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,882
<i>I'll tell you
what's the matter.</i>

441
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,024
<i>Everyday you're becoming
more and more
a blood-thirsty murderer.</i>

442
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,799
Strategy...

443
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,395
Strategy...

444
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,778
Here, come on, Jesse, wake up.
Come on, Jesse, come on.

445
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,039
Frank,

446
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,407
the Yanks will never
cross the Mississippi.

447
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,245
<i>That's right, Jess,
and neither will you
if you don't get some sleep.</i>

448
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,809
Come on.
I tell you, Frank...

449
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,223
Well, will you look
at Old Jess?

450
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,830
<i>Jess boy, you and the old man
must've really
got along first rate.</i>

451
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,598
Well, how does it feel
to be a member of the grand
and glorious secret order

452
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,195
of the Quantrill Clowns?

453
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,435
Jesse, Jesse,
come on, boy.

454
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,908
<i>I'll have nobody
talking about him like that.
He's a great man.</i>

455
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,105
<i>Jess, my boy,
you're drunk.
Oh, shut up, will you, Kit?</i>

456
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,110
Come on, Jess,
he was only funning
with you.

457
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,209
Hey, Jesse,
where do you suppose
the Colonel got that uniform?

458
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,151
Look like it come
right out of a store window.

459
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,121
<i>I'd sure like to have me
an outfit like that.</i>

460
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,452
You gotta be a Colonel
to have one of them

461
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,287
and you gotta talk
like a Colonel, too.

462
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,054
Well, boy, if he can fight
like he can talk,

463
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,891
he sure must be something.

464
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,133
Goodnight, Frank, Jesse.

465
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,639
Goodnight, Kit.

466
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,901
Goodnight.

467
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,913
<i>He is a great man,
ain't he, Frank?</i>

468
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,372
Hmm?

469
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,917
Yeah. Yeah,
sure he is, Jess.

470
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,082
Go on to sleep.

471
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,090
Do you understand
your orders, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.

472
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,362
Good luck.
And another thing,

473
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,297
Tell the Colonel the quicker
he sends reinforcements,

474
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,736
<i>the safer it's going to be
for the town of Lawrence.</i>

475
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,332
Very well, sir.
Good luck.

476
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,172
Left by twos! Forward all.

477
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,267
<i>That's good, huh?
Good?</i>

478
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,937
<i>It's like I been
kicked in the head
by a Missouri mule.</i>

479
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,438
Was I?

480
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,711
<i>You weren't kicked by one,
you were just trying
to drink like one.</i>

481
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,252
Now, here, put this on
and straighten yourself up,

482
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,947
the old man wants
to see you right away.

483
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,216
<i>What's this?</i>

484
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,124
<i>Well, when you put that on,
you're officially a member
of the Quantrill Raiders.</i>

485
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,558
Oh, good.

486
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,293
<i>Say, Frank, I didn't do
anything wrong last night,
did I?</i>

487
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,592
<i>I ain't sure,
but by the looks of things</i>

488
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,133
you seem to have done
just about right.

489
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,724
He wants
to see you right away.

490
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,863
<i>What's that
supposed to mean?
We're going on a raid.</i>

491
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,600
Raid? You mean us,
the whole outfit?

492
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,506
<i>Yep, we're leaving
right away.</i>

493
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,339
<i>Quantrill's talking
to the group leaders
right now.</i>

494
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,539
<i>So get a move on,
I'll saddle up for you.</i>

495
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,546
As you all know our objective
is another enemy strong point

496
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,348
<i>similar to those
that we've been attacking
with such excellent results</i>

497
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,116
these past several months.

498
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,286
The very cause
of the Confederacy itself

499
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,349
may well depend
upon our success.

500
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,021
I want every man to know that
and to act accordingly.

501
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,121
<i>Mr. James, you're late.</i>

502
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,255
Sorry, Colonel.

503
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,333
One more thing.

504
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,434
Now that Mr. James is here,

505
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,199
he will act as group leader
of his own recruits

506
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,798
replacing the late Mr. Tate.

507
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,939
Any questions?
Yes, sir.

508
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,505
Mr. Anderson.

509
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,308
<i>The men ain't gonna like it.
Like what?</i>

510
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,973
Having this kid
put over for him.

511
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,677
<i>There's plenty other
deserves it more
and been here a lot longer.</i>

512
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,721
<i>As long as I'm in command here
I'll give the orders
and make the appointments.</i>

513
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,777
<i>That's all.</i>

514
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,517
Mr. James, have you
had your breakfast?

515
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,188
No, sir.

516
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,024
Napoleon made
the profound observation

517
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,065
that an army travels
on its stomach.

518
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,463
I suggest you fortify yours

519
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,558
if you hope to be
of any use to us.

520
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,500
<i>I've arranged
for your breakfast inside.</i>

521
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,765
Thank you, sir.

522
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,238
Come in.

523
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,450
The Colonel said that...
Yes, I know. Sit down.

524
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,786
<i>You don't have much time.
Thank you.</i>

525
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,585
The Colonel made me
an officer just now.

526
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,060
Oh? He likes
ambitious, young men.

527
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,729
<i>He's decided you've got
a head for strategy.</i>

528
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,563
<i>I don't know about strategy,
but I sure got a head.</i>

529
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,231
<i>I sure hope I wasn't
too much trouble to you
last night.</i>

530
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,905
<i>Oh, you weren't
any trouble.</i>

531
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,035
You were just
a little tongue-tied,
that was all.

532
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,270
Yeah, I guess so.

533
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,110
Yes. Every time
the liquor was passed,

534
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,514
<i>you just couldn't manage
to say the word "no".</i>

535
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,180
Yeah, I guess, I did try
to learn about that stuff
a little too fast.

536
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,356
<i>You'll catch on
quick enough.</i>

537
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,854
<i>You'll catch on
to a lot of things.</i>

538
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,252
<i>You've got
a good teacher.</i>

539
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,166
Why did you
join Quantrill, Jesse?

540
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,801
You and Frank?

541
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,933
Do some killing.

542
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,210
What do you mean by that?

543
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,211
Something that happened
back home.

544
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:49,310
<i>Something that I don't want
to ever see happen again.</i>

545
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,156
There are some men that...
Well, they do things.

546
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,258
They gotta be killed.

547
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,026
Quantrill kills, too.

548
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:02,988
Yeah.

549
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,829
Yes, he does.

550
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,968
<i>But only them
what's got it coming to 'em.</i>

551
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,706
You better go.

552
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,913
<i>I hope you've got
a good strong stomach!</i>

553
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,158
Your stomach all right now?

554
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,392
There seems to be
an awful lot of talk
about my stomach this morning.

555
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,762
Well, maybe after last night,

556
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,801
<i>folks just want to be sure
you've still got one.</i>

557
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,069
Our point of attack
is that farmhouse.

558
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,239
<i>I have information that
there's a troop of Union
soldiers quartered there.</i>

559
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,004
Mr. Anderson, Mr. James,
you know the plan.

560
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,138
<i>You'll start the attack
on the customary signal
from me.</i>

561
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,911
Hey, James!

562
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,892
<i>Better get
your share of the loot
before it's all gone.</i>

563
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,157
Willis, where are
those Union soldiers
we were supposed to fight?

564
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,424
Grow up, James.

565
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,729
Quantrill always tells us that
just before every raid.

566
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,564
It makes him feel
like a real colonel.

567
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,909
<i>I'm gonna
kill you for that.</i>

568
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,041
<i>You're gonna do what?</i>

569
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,374
Draw your gun.

570
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,286
Fortunes of war, Mr. James.

571
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,428
Bugler, sound the assembly.

572
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,929
<i>I'm good. Hit me.</i>

573
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,431
Again.

574
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,633
Find him yet?

575
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,135
No.

576
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,683
<i>Where you reckon
he's keeping himself?</i>

577
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,514
<i>We ain't hardly seen him
for the last three days.</i>

578
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,349
<i>Man, he's sure changed.</i>

579
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,979
<i>What's got into him anyway?</i>

580
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,024
<i>He ain't a preacher
or a preacher's son.</i>

581
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,525
He ought to know
how things go
in an outfit like this.

582
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,461
<i>Well, I don't know.
He don't always see everything
the same as other people.</i>

583
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,225
<i>Maybe it'd be better
If he did.</i>

584
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,062
<i>You don't suppose he just up
and rode away without saying
nothing, do you?</i>

585
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,397
<i>Nope. Jesse wouldn't
do that to us.</i>

586
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,932
<i>Well, he's hardly
said a word to us</i>

587
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,633
since we came back
from that first raid.

588
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,733
<i>We don't have to,
we know what he's thinking.</i>

589
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,437
<i>Well, I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.</i>

590
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,910
<i>I'm thinking this may not be
the sweetest smelling
way to live,</i>

591
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,246
<i>but it's downright better
than walking behind a plow.</i>

592
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,284
Right.

593
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,850
<i>Maybe it is
and maybe it ain't.</i>

594
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,055
Come on, deal me in.

595
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,606
<i>Haven't seen you
around for a few days.</i>

596
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,604
<i>I haven't been around.</i>

597
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,409
Tell me,

598
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,578
how did you enjoy
your first taste
of Quantrill warfare?

599
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:52,974
Warfare?

600
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,448
<i>So that's what he calls it?</i>

601
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,853
<i>Well, I can't say you didn't
try hard enough to warn me.
Thanks.</i>

602
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,227
<i>Maybe you're not
like the others,</i>

603
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,286
maybe I was wrong.

604
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,631
Was I?

605
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,831
<i>I guess
I ain't so different.</i>

606
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,902
But you could be,
Jesse.

607
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,933
You could be.

608
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,431
How?

609
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,710
<i>Quantrill's going on
another raid.</i>

610
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,048
<i>He's been
looking for you.</i>

611
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,847
<i>Well, I ain't ridin'
with him no more.</i>

612
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,287
Are you going to
tell him that?

613
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,456
Yes, I am.

614
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,964
<i>Now's a good time.</i>

615
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,488
<i>Mr. James,
you're late again.
You've kept me waiting.</i>

616
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,382
<i>I ain't ridin'
with you, Colonel.</i>

617
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,451
Not riding with us?

618
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,683
May I ask why?

619
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,622
I been thinking all night.

620
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,288
I been thinking
for three days.

621
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,832
Thinking about what?

622
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,892
What I ought to say
and now I got to say it.

623
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,471
I came here to fight.

624
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,100
<i>Came here straight
from my home, what's left
of it three weeks ago.</i>

625
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:29,043
<i>That was the day Frank and me
came home and found
the house burnin',</i>

626
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,240
my ma with her arm shot off,

627
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,909
<i>my pa hangin' in the tree
in the front yard.</i>

628
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,483
It was Red Legs.
Yankee guerrillas.

629
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,981
<i>One of 'em drunk
and was still there.</i>

630
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,325
I come here because
I wanted to kill every man
I could ever find

631
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,226
that would do
a thing like that.

632
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,065
Then we went out
on that raid the other day.

633
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,661
<i>I found we was
doin' the same thing.</i>

634
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,397
<i>We was murderin' people
that didn't have no chance.</i>

635
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,837
People just like my ma and pa.

636
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,568
<i>Maybe that's strategy,
Colonel,</i>

637
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,440
<i>and maybe
I don't understand it</i>

638
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,946
<i>but you don't need me
for what you're
gonna do tonight.</i>

639
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,710
<i>Maybe we don't need you
for nothin' at all.</i>

640
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,778
Put that gun away,
Mr. Anderson.

641
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,410
<i>Are you sure
you don't want me to...</i>

642
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,853
You heard what I said.
Put that gun away.

643
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,090
I suggest, Mr. James,
that you remain
behind on this trip.

644
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,831
<i>You sure you know
what you're doing,
Jess?</i>

645
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,710
<i>Yep, I know what I'm doing.</i>

646
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,347
Hello, Jesse.

647
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,182
<i>I thought
I'd find you here.</i>

648
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,325
<i>What's the matter?</i>

649
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,090
<i>Are you thinking maybe
you should've gone
on that raid?</i>

650
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,562
No.

651
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,391
<i>I was just thinkin'
about the Colonel.</i>

652
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,733
<i>I ain't never been
much of one to judge people
for what they have been,</i>

653
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,034
or even what they are.

654
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,908
<i>It's the way
they feel inside.</i>

655
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,110
Sometimes a man or a woman
will get into a thing

656
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,044
<i>and well, they just
can't get out of it.</i>

657
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,982
<i>But it's not that way
with the Colonel.</i>

658
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,517
He can get out of it.

659
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,421
<i>I don't know, Kate.</i>

660
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,759
It comes hard for me
to place all the blame
on him.

661
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,355
<i>After all there's Anderson,
and all them others</i>

662
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:33,028
<i>I'm not asking you
to blame him.
But, Jesse, listen to me.</i>

663
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,307
<i>Bloodshed and murder
don't mean anything
to Quantrill.</i>

664
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,673
<i>It's all part of a dream,
a dream of playing war.</i>

665
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,911
But the people he kills
are real people.

666
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,010
He saved my life,
did you know that?

667
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,780
Yes, I know.

668
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,956
He saved mine once,
too, in a way.

669
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,988
<i>Don't you...
Don't you feel nothin'
for him no more at all?</i>

670
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,256
No. I did once.

671
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,325
I believed everything
he said.

672
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,825
Until I began
to see for myself.

673
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,565
<i>I'd see them
come riding home
night after night.</i>

674
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,570
Some of them,
still had the blood
on their hands.

675
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,876
<i>Don't you see what
they're doing is wrong,
terribly wrong.</i>

676
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,574
No matter what
you feel about him,

677
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,082
<i>he'll die
at the end of a rope,</i>

678
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,983
and if you follow him,
so will you.

679
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,749
<i>Jesse, you've got to
get out of here.</i>

680
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,586
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

681
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,682
<i>I'll never get out
any other way.</i>

682
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:34,228
<i>If you won't do it
for yourself,
then do it for me.</i>

683
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,797
<i>We couldn't just
ride off without...</i>

684
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:41,201
<i>Well, then we'll tell him.
Tell him just like you did
this morning.</i>

685
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,003
<i>Jesse, you're not afraid,
are you?</i>

686
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,433
<i>Mr. Anderson, see that
the boys don't make too much
of a night of it tonight.</i>

687
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,670
All right,
you heard him.

688
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,889
<i>Well, my boy,
I'm glad to find you here.</i>

689
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,786
I thought that after
this morning, you might be
angry at me.

690
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,193
<i>I see you're not.
That's fine.</i>

691
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,989
How are you, Kate?
Have a nice day?

692
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,700
I want to talk
to you, Colonel.

693
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,668
I want to talk to you,
too, Jesse.

694
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,432
<i>I've been thinking
about you all day
and what you said.</i>

695
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,667
But first I have something
to say to Kate.

696
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,642
<i>If you'll wait
for me outside.</i>

697
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,244
<i>That's an order, Jesse.</i>

698
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,083
Go ahead, Jesse.

699
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,465
Now,

700
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,232
where did you get this?

701
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,036
He gave it to me.

702
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,310
Jesse?

703
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,042
Yes.

704
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,450
I see.

705
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,314
Very pretty.

706
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,817
My dear Kate,

707
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,021
<i>I'm too old a man to have
any illusions about
the constancy of women,</i>

708
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,227
or to be
seriously disturbed
by the lack of it

709
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,629
but when your intrigues
start interfering
with my plans

710
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,367
<i>that's something
else again.</i>

711
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,466
<i>Why don't you let him go?</i>

712
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,573
<i>Please. He's only a boy.</i>

713
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,705
<i>He's man enough
for my purposes.</i>

714
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:08,646
If you want to help him,
stay away from him.

715
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,422
Jesse,

716
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:27,402
<i>you've been thinking
some pretty harsh things
about me, haven't you?</i>

717
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,195
<i>I don't know what
to think no more.</i>

718
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,333
<i>You've been
talking to Kate?</i>

719
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,641
Yes, I have.

720
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,743
<i>Kate's a woman, Jesse.</i>

721
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:40,579
There are some things
that a woman simply
cannot comprehend.

722
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:47,052
A leader is a lonely man.

723
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,617
There are so few
that he can trust.

724
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,226
And even they often fail
to understand

725
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,200
just when he needs
their understanding most.

726
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,262
<i>Do you think it's by choice
that I lead this rabble?</i>

727
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,241
Do you think I condone
their brutality any more
than you do?

728
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,438
General Lee needs me

729
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,572
and through me,
he needs you.

730
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:15,516
<i>And in the days to come,
we're going to need you more.</i>

731
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,880
All I want is one word
from you, Colonel,

732
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,850
<i>there won't be no more
of what happened
on my first raid.</i>

733
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,689
My boy, you have it.

734
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,095
<i>Then I'm with you.
I knew you would be.</i>

735
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,770
Now that we understand
each other, I can tell you,

736
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,932
our next engagement
will be a major one

737
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,841
of vital importance
to the Confederate Cause.

738
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,472
<i>We're going to raid
the town of Lawrence,
Kansas.</i>

739
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,810
Lawrence, Kansas.

740
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,216
You better get some rest.

741
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,783
Jesse,

742
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,191
what I said about
your being a candidate

743
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,352
for the butcher brigade
still goes.

744
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,157
But you were all wrong, Kate.

745
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,289
<i>Everything's gonna be
all right now.</i>

746
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,799
The Colonel
gave me his word.

747
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,427
His word.
And you believed him.

748
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,097
<i>Like I said, Jesse,
Kate's a woman.</i>

749
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,801
<i>There are certain things
that she'll never comprehend.</i>

750
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,771
Good night, Kate.
Good night, Colonel.
Good night, my boy.

751
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,615
You have a winning way
with children, Colonel.

752
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,276
Thank you, Kate.

753
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,817
<i>My information is
that the town's
only defense</i>

754
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,412
consists of a few
Red Legs and a handful
of Union soldiers.

755
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,682
Mr. Anderson,

756
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,123
you will be in charge
of any military
or civilian opposition.

757
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,458
Mr. James,
your objective
will be the bank.

758
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,332
<i>Just make it clear
to Mr. James that
that bank money ain't his.</i>

759
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,392
You understand that,
Mr. James?

760
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,267
I understand that,
Anderson.

761
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,306
<i>Do you understand that
we're fightin' soldiers</i>

762
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,638
<i>and not shootin'
unarmed civilians
in the back?</i>

763
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,438
<i>That's clearly understood.</i>

764
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,979
<i>Mr. Pell,
you'll take charge
of posting pickets</i>

765
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,572
to guard against
any return of
the Yankee soldiers.

766
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,915
<i>Yes, sir.
We'll advance on
the usual signal from me.</i>

767
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,968
Quantrill. Quantrill!

768
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,953
<i>We don't want to
have to shoot nobody,</i>

769
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,728
<i>and we won't
if you keep your hands
where we can see them.</i>

770
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,493
Who runs this place?
I do.

771
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,636
<i>General Lee wants
all the Yankee money
you've got.</i>

772
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,505
Where do you keep it?

773
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,210
<i>You boys are going to
regret this day's work.</i>

774
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:45,243
<i>You're gonna regret it
a lot more if you
don't open that safe.</i>

775
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,951
<i>Next time it won't
be your hand.</i>

776
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:55,722
Kit.

777
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,134
<i>I told you these Yankee banks
were just bulgin' with money.</i>

778
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,374
Fortunes of war, mister.

779
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,673
Why, you little...

780
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,339
<i>General Lee's gonna be
much obliged to you.</i>

781
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,130
Will. Will.

782
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,164
Will.

783
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,261
Murderers. Murderers!

784
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,438
<i>Don't shoot! Don't shoot!</i>

785
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,660
Hey, James. Look here.

786
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:05,130
Come here.
See here, James?
See here?

787
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,466
Just like
the Colonel ordered.

788
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,765
<i>We ain't killin'
no unarmed men
and women.</i>

789
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,307
This here is
a military prisoner.

790
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,643
<i>I'll take that prisoner,
Anderson.</i>

791
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,975
Oh, you will, huh?

792
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,363
<i>Better get off
the street, Captain.
I can't see.</i>

793
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,334
Frank, take him inside.
Wait a minute.
I know that voice.

794
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,735
<i>Don't I know you?
No.</i>

795
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,331
Come on, Captain.
This way.

796
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,468
<i>Where's Quantrill?</i>

797
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,777
<i>He's over at the hotel.</i>

798
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,523
<i>Thank you, thank you, sir.
You're most kind.</i>

799
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,063
You have earned the undying
gratitude of Quantrill.

800
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,462
And mark you, gentlemen,

801
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,329
the day will come when
the favor of Quantrill

802
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,698
<i>will be worth
a king's ransom.</i>

803
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,899
Far more than these paltry
trinkets which you so kindly
donate to my cause today.

804
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:20,704
A very fine piece.
A family heirloom,
no doubt.

805
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,575
<i>That's all. Dismissed.
And you, sir?</i>

806
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,309
Well, what have we here?

807
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,546
Some more
family heirlooms?

808
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,483
<i>We'll see.</i>

809
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,828
Mr. Quantrill?
Colonel Quantrill,
Mr. James.

810
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,994
Your men are shooting
unarmed civilians.

811
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,867
What are you
gonna do about it?

812
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,170
<i>If you don't like the way
we're fighting the war,
Mr. James, tell Mr. Anderson.</i>

813
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,143
<i>Mr. Anderson's dead.</i>

814
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,270
I just killed him.

815
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,782
You...
Colonel. Colonel.

816
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,178
<i>Yankee cavalry
are headin' this way.</i>

817
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,745
Looks like
the whole Union Army.

818
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,313
Tell the bugler
to sound assembly.

819
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:12,452
<i>Gentlemen, gather up
our contributions.
We're moving.</i>

820
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:27,905
Ready to ride, men?

821
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,741
Yeah.

822
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,513
<i>I don't know where
you're aimin' to go when
you leave us, Jesse,</i>

823
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,450
<i>or what you plan on
doin' once you get there</i>

824
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,613
<i>but, whatever it is,
you ain't gonna be no
better off than you are now.</i>

825
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,281
Like my old pappy
used to say,

826
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,690
<i>a hog that straddles
a fence ain't likely
to wind up no place.</i>

827
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,160
Our old pappy
was always right,
Jess.

828
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,425
<i>Stayin' here's better
than plowin' from sun up
to dark</i>

829
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,091
<i>and livin' on side-meat
and corn bread</i>

830
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,964
<i>and never havin'
a dollar you don't
owe somebody.</i>

831
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,526
<i>Can't you see, Jesse?
This is the life.</i>

832
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,165
<i>Plenty money, shootin',
gamblin', sleepin'.</i>

833
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,833
<i>Ain't I right, Frank?</i>

834
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,968
<i>He knows
what he's doing.</i>

835
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,938
<i>Are you aimin'
to ride back
to Missouri, Jess?</i>

836
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:40,976
Maybe.

837
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,642
<i>Look, Jess,
ain't nothin' back there</i>

838
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,279
except a blackened chimney
where your house once stood.

839
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,846
<i>And a couple of new graves
coverin' your folks,</i>

840
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,687
<i>where the Yankees
and the Red Legs put 'em.</i>

841
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,727
<i>You can't go back
to Missouri, Jess.</i>

842
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,591
<i>We're already marked
with the Quantrill brand</i>

843
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,563
<i>and if the Yanks
don't hang you,
the law will.</i>

844
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,328
<i>Can't get no revenge
rottin' in somebody's jail</i>

845
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,494
<i>or swingin'
on the end of a rope.</i>

846
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,506
My old pappy
used to say that...
Yeah, I know! Your old pappy.

847
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,976
Well, some of what
you say does make sense.

848
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,304
<i>Guess I'll ride
with the Colonel
a while longer.</i>

849
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,714
<i>Again
and again they raided,</i>

850
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:18,185
<i>looted, burned
and destroyed,</i>

851
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:22,156
<i>following Quantrill
and his ominous black flag</i>

852
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,523
<i>into an inferno of violence,</i>

853
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:28,826
<i>brutality and destruction
of life and property.</i>

854
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,846
<i>But the Union Army</i>

855
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,016
<i>spurred on by
the people's angry voices,</i>

856
00:59:56,092 --> 01:00:00,085
<i>slowly cut down the size
of the Quantrill band.</i>

857
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:05,097
<i>Day after day
they became fewer and fewer.</i>

858
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,008
Well, gentlemen,
you know what that
signal means.

859
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,642
Sure we know
what it means.

860
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,712
What are we
gonna do about it?

861
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,485
<i>We're gonna make a stand
right here and fight until
there's not a man of us left.</i>

862
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:33,120
<i>The men in ain't
no shape to fight, Colonel,
even if they wanted to.</i>

863
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,720
<i>There ain't
but one thing to do.</i>

864
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,856
Split up.
Every man for himself.

865
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,491
Do you mean to question
my authority?

866
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,866
<i>You ain't got
no authority left,
Colonel.</i>

867
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,132
<i>We ain't only fightin'
the Union Army now,</i>

868
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,333
the whole state
of Kansas is after us.

869
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,273
And when General Lee
turned against you,

870
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,312
we all decided
it was time to quit.

871
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,310
All right,
get out all of you.
Come on, men.

872
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,170
<i>Well, why don't you
desert with the rest
of them?</i>

873
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,765
<i>What're you waiting for?</i>

874
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,037
<i>We're sticking
with you, sir.</i>

875
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,470
<i>Good. That's fine.</i>

876
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,640
<i>We'll proceed at once
to my Kentucky headquarters.</i>

877
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,048
<i>You're forgetting
something, Colonel.
What's that?</i>

878
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,383
<i>Kate. We're not
leaving her.</i>

879
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,088
Very well, Mr. James.

880
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,949
Looks like the Yankees
got here first.

881
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,750
<i>They may still be here.
Kate's either...</i>

882
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,883
<i>There's only one way
to find out. Wait here.</i>

883
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,371
<i>I hoped you'd come back.</i>

884
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,464
<i>You didn't expect us
to leave you here,
did you?</i>

885
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,704
Where are
the rest of the men?
They deserted.

886
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,504
A commander
without an army.

887
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,853
Dismount
and take cover.

888
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,386
<i>Are you hit, Colonel?
It's my eyes, Jesse,</i>

889
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,016
<i>Cole, get Kate
and let's get outta here.</i>

890
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,627
<i>You know,
it's a funny thing,</i>

891
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,068
<i>him gettin' it
in the eyes like that.</i>

892
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,969
Just the same
as that Union Captain.

893
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,234
Yeah.

894
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,432
<i>It's like he says himself.</i>

895
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,375
War is war.

896
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:39,141
<i>It's mighty funny,
all the same.</i>

897
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:42,878
<i>Just like it was some kind
of judgment on him
or somethin'.</i>

898
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,764
<i>Any better now, Colonel?
I can't see, Jesse.</i>

899
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,368
<i>I can't see.</i>

900
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,938
<i>We should've had
some hot water.</i>

901
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,844
<i>We can't risk a fire, Kate.</i>

902
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:17,579
<i>The whole country side's
swarming with Union soldiers,</i>

903
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:21,282
I must look quite
thoroughly disreputable,

904
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,249
<i>I'd hate to run into
any of my fellow officers
in this condition.</i>

905
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,422
<i>I don't imagine there'd be
any sudden danger of that.</i>

906
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,933
<i>You know,
I've been thinking</i>

907
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:36,732
considering the circumstances
and my present condition

908
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,811
it would be well
if you would assume
command, temporarily.

909
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,174
Yes, I think
that would be best.

910
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,946
<i>All right, Colonel,
if that's the way
you want it.</i>

911
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:53,318
Well, so be it then.

912
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,962
<i>Now that you're
the Colonel, Jesse,</i>

913
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,863
<i>where you gonna get us
somethin' to eat?</i>

914
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:07,562
You know what Napoleon
said, an army travels
on its stomach.

915
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,105
<i>Yeah, but Napoleon
didn't have my kind
of an army.</i>

916
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,901
Yeah, well...

917
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,770
From the looks
of that road, Jesse,

918
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,432
<i>there must've been
more than 100
Yankee troops</i>

919
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,498
passed this way.

920
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,977
<i>They're too close.
We been ridin' around
in circles for days now.</i>

921
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,244
<i>At this rate
we'll never break out.
What are we gonna do, Jesse?</i>

922
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,683
We just have to
keep riding.

923
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,301
Cole, you and Kit
hide the horses.

924
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,119
<i>Seems like
we've been here before,
don't it, Jesse?</i>

925
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,359
<i>It's burned out
so bad I can't tell.</i>

926
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,492
Get inside,
Colonel.

927
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,442
Where are we, Kate?
Do you know this place?

928
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,776
<i>No, I don't, Colonel.</i>

929
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,282
Must have been
a nice place, once.

930
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,355
Wonder how
it got burned.

931
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,794
Red Legs most likely.

932
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,793
Yeah, Jesse. Red Legs.

933
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,662
Hey, Jesse.

934
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,704
Jesse.

935
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,380
Look here, what we found.

936
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,075
<i>"Wanted dead or alive.</i>

937
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:40,444
<i>"$10,000 reward
for the capture or killing,</i>

938
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,658
<i>"or any information leading
to the capture or killing</i>

939
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,921
<i>"of the notorious guerrilla</i>

940
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,123
<i>"and the destroyer
of Lawrence, Kansas,</i>

941
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,189
<i>"William Clarke Quantrill</i>

942
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,929
<i>"and any member of his band
who may be with him."</i>

943
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,494
Any member of his band
that may be with him?

944
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,631
<i>That means us,
don't it, Jesse?</i>

945
01:07:58,707 --> 01:07:59,969
<i>That's us.</i>

946
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,579
Is that better?

947
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,948
Yes. Thank you, Kate.

948
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,556
<i>Kate, we haven't had
a talk for a long time.
Don't you think...</i>

949
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,615
You ought to get some sleep.

950
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,158
<i>I guess you're right.</i>

951
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,560
Good night, Kate.

952
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,380
<i>What're you thinking?</i>

953
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,282
Of this place.

954
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,747
<i>Then you have
been here before,
haven't you, Jesse?</i>

955
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,352
On my first raid
with Quantrill.

956
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,259
He ordered it
burned himself.

957
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,258
You were right, Kate.

958
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,791
You been right all along

959
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,800
when you told me how
Quantrill and his kind
always wind up.

960
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,995
<i>But you're still with him.</i>

961
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,428
Yeah, I know.

962
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,472
<i>Somehow I couldn't
leave him, either.</i>

963
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,773
<i>But you've got to, Jesse.
You know that.</i>

964
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,437
<i>And you've got to
pretty soon.</i>

965
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,505
Every day it gets worse
and every day we take
more chances.

966
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,074
<i>If they catch you with him,
you know what'll happen
to you.</i>

967
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,380
To you and all of us.

968
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,581
Our finish will be
the same as his.

969
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,221
<i>I just been puttin' off
thinkin' about it, I guess.</i>

970
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,523
<i>You can't put it off
any longer, Jesse.</i>

971
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,428
<i>It isn't fair
to the boys either.</i>

972
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:04,922
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

973
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,992
<i>You're young,
you've got your whole life
ahead of you.</i>

974
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:11,233
<i>Someday you'll want to
settle down, a wife and kids.</i>

975
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,867
A place of your own.

976
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,968
<i>I'll never want nobody
but you, Kate.</i>

977
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,964
Hello.
Anybody inside?

978
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,032
What do you want?

979
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:44,937
We saw smoke coming
from your chimney,
I just wanted to ask if...

980
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,836
Oh, this time
I do know you.

981
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,844
<i>That won't do you any good.</i>

982
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,437
My men have
this place surrounded.

983
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:55,244
<i>We've been looking for you
and your Colonel.</i>

984
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,252
<i>How many men do you think
you'll have left when you
get him?</i>

985
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,914
<i>Maybe I do
owe you something.
I don't know.</i>

986
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,685
<i>You don't owe me nothin'.</i>

987
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,318
<i>I don't want any more killing
if I can help it.</i>

988
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,392
<i>I'll give you until daylight
to surrender the Colonel,</i>

989
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,523
<i>then we're coming in
after you.</i>

990
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,105
<i>Well, we've got
until daylight.</i>

991
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,838
<i>Listen, Jesse. I ain't
gonna get hung for what
the old Colonel's done.</i>

992
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,379
<i>I didn't notice you
bein' so fussy</i>

993
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,041
about what
the old Colonel done
a while back.

994
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,244
<i>Nobody's gonna get hung.</i>

995
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,786
Jesse.

996
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,690
<i>You're all right,
you're a fine boy.</i>

997
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,890
<i>You're all fine boys.</i>

998
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,567
<i>We'll get through,
don't you fear.</i>

999
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,401
<i>There're still great days
ahead for Quantrill
and you'll share them,</i>

1000
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,201
all of you.

1001
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,936
We know that,
Colonel. Thanks.

1002
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,001
Better try
to get some sleep.

1003
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:01,048
Yeah. I can sleep now.

1004
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,581
Jesse?

1005
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,289
<i>We've been doin'
some thinkin' on our own.</i>

1006
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,165
We can make a deal
with that Yankee Captain.

1007
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,568
$10,000 is a lot of money.

1008
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,072
<i>We're gonna turn him in.</i>

1009
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,301
<i>We're gonna turn him in
and collect the reward money.</i>

1010
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:28,866
<i>It's him they
really want, not us.</i>

1011
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:30,878
<i>No.
But it's him or us.</i>

1012
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:33,744
<i>It's him or us, all right.
Not that way.</i>

1013
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,443
What other way is there?

1014
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,611
<i>You don't trust them Yankees
to make a deal with us,
do you?</i>

1015
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,656
<i>Remember that reward notice
read "Dead or alive.</i>

1016
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,625
<i>"And any member of his band
that might be with him".</i>

1017
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,954
Have you figured
some other way, Jesse?

1018
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,089
In a couple of hours
when things settle down
out there,

1019
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,757
<i>we'll make it out
the back way</i>

1020
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,668
down to the creek bed
and come in behind them
to the horses.

1021
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:00,707
You heard that, Kate?

1022
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,641
Get ready to go.

1023
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,677
<i>What about him?
He'd never get through.</i>

1024
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,486
<i>They've got just about
one hour more.</i>

1025
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,826
Now we all know what to do.

1026
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:28,696
<i>We'll stand a better chance
if we go out one at a time.</i>

1027
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,340
Kit, good luck.

1028
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,381
Jim?

1029
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,754
Cole?

1030
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,561
Frank, take Kate with you.
Jesse.

1031
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,324
Go along with Frank.

1032
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,594
Jesse.

1033
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,325
<i>Well, why don't you go?</i>

1034
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,769
Go where?
With the others.

1035
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,932
<i>You knew I wouldn't leave.</i>

1036
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,442
Yeah,

1037
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,471
<i>and I know why
you wouldn't.</i>

1038
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,977
Jesse, I want to
tell you something.

1039
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,488
<i>I guess from the beginning
I've been fooling myself.</i>

1040
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,221
I know I never fooled you.

1041
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,987
Maybe I never fooled
anybody else.

1042
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:03,191
But no more.
This is the end for me
and I know it.

1043
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,690
<i>I'm not going to sit by
and see you pay the penalty</i>

1044
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:08,565
for something
that you had no part in.

1045
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,635
There are two things
we can do, Colonel,

1046
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:14,801
make a fight of it here,
or try to get out
like the others did.

1047
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:17,573
<i>Like you said, Jesse,
you'd never get through
with me,</i>

1048
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,705
a blind man.

1049
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,807
<i>I figured
you'd want to fight.
I was gettin' things ready.</i>

1050
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,217
Suppose I told you
this is the way I wanted it,

1051
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,084
suppose I ordered you to go?

1052
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,055
<i>It wouldn't do you
any good.
Why?</i>

1053
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,025
<i>You said I was givin'
the orders, remember?</i>

1054
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,697
Mr. James,

1055
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,290
<i>I'm staying here alone.</i>

1056
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,132
<i>You're to go.
That's an order,
Mr. James.</i>

1057
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,039
Did you hear me?

1058
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,370
<i>That's no good, Colonel.</i>

1059
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,743
Either fight together
or break through together.

1060
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,743
<i>All right, we'll go.</i>

1061
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,011
<i>Chances ain't too good,
you know.</i>

1062
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,986
Are they any better here?

1063
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,921
Help me with my coat.

1064
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:26,009
<i>Have to hurry, Colonel,
it's getting light out.</i>

1065
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,070
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1066
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:37,256
<i>Jesse,
if I don't make it...</i>

1067
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,360
<i>You'll make it, all right.</i>

1068
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,390
<i>You see any of them?
They're mostly
around in front.</i>

1069
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,000
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any

1070
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:54,763
<i>to make up our minds
where we're goin',
what we're gonna do.</i>

1071
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,235
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

1072
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:59,171
<i>I figure
with all the experience
I've picked up here lately</i>

1073
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,108
me and my brothers
could make a real good
go of it.

1074
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,738
<i>Well, that's fine, Kit.
Cole, how about you and Jim?</i>

1075
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,612
<i>We figured on
stringin' along
with you two.</i>

1076
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,743
<i>That is, if you don't
have any objections.</i>

1077
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,684
<i>No, that's all right.</i>

1078
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,320
<i>Jess, we'll just ride
out a ways and you
can catch up with us</i>

1079
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,590
<i>if you're a mind to.</i>

1080
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,342
<i>You said once
you'd go anywhere with me.</i>

1081
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,886
Were you just saying that
or did you mean it?

1082
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:49,355
Maybe then. But...
But what?

1083
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:53,659
<i>Look, Jesse,
in a few years
the war'll be over,</i>

1084
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,227
and everything will look
different to you then

1085
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,391
and so would I.

1086
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,361
Good bye, Jesse.

1087
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,525
<i>And so into the pages
of crime history,</i>

1088
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,463
<i>rode five young men,</i>

1089
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,998
<i>Kit Dalton,
Cole and Jim Younger,</i>

1090
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:37,336
<i>Frank and Jesse James.</i>

1091
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,606
<i>Five whose warped lives</i>

1092
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,802
<i>were to be a heritage
from their teacher,</i>

1093
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,506
<i>William Clarke Quantrill.</i>
