1
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,590
CIRCUS WORLD

2
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,294
Matt

3
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,628
Let the ghost be.

4
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,168
Its fourteen years.
It's time you buried the dead.

5
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,858
They're buried, Cap.

6
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,922
Bust you wanna walk over
their grave again, to make sure.

7
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:42,342
Got a great idea:
European Tour.

8
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,917
- What do you say?
- It's no good.

9
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:48,618
Berlin, Madrid, Paris,
Vienna, Budapest.

10
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:50,268
They got a nice sound.

11
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:55,458
Europe's just a big Jonah for
American circuses.

12
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,033
- They were in for the money.
- And you ain't?

13
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,406
I love a circus.

14
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,907
Matt, Lili's gone.
Forget her.

15
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,884
When she ran out that night
it was over.

16
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:10,465
Like that puff of wind.
It's gone.

17
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:12,838
Matt,

18
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,212
Let it stay that way.

19
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,724
Got a lot to do tomorrow, Cap.

20
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:55,112
Ladies and gentlemen!

21
00:04:56,117 --> 00:05:00,785
You have witnessed our last
performance of the season.

22
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:05,934
Tomorrow our circus bids
goodbye to its native land,

23
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:10,239
The U.S.A., and sails for
Europe

24
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:14,464
To raise our tents in all
its capitals.

25
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,487
At this time the ushers sell
tickets four our attraction.

26
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,350
Tonight, we invite you to be
Our guests.

27
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,459
And now, the greatest Wild
West Showin’ the World!

28
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:37,799
On your mark.

29
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,544
And now!

30
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,763
The Great Stage Coach
robbery!

31
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:09,399
You are now about to witness
a race between man and a beast.

32
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,493
Ladies and gentlemen!

33
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,752
The Roman Race!

34
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,677
Toni, are you all right?

35
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,045
- Are you hurt?
- No.

36
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,091
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

37
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,781
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

38
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,637
- Get the next act on, Cap!
- Yes, sir.

39
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,689
- Have May drive for Toni.
- Right!

40
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,856
Are you sure you are O.K?

41
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:56,620
Yes.

42
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,190
What happened?

43
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,489
There was a bird in the tent.

44
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:05,029
Ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,288
We offer you tonight,

46
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:14,645
A cast of daring, with hair raising
feats of skill.

47
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,266
Still seeing things?

48
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,042
It was there, that's why
I slipped.

49
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,899
A bird in the tent is one of
the worst omens.

50
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:27,560
Superstitions have no sense.
It's unreal, Toni.

51
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,129
It's a make-believe world?

52
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,422
What's wrong with a
Make-believe world?

53
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,635
It's for weak people,
To hide in.

54
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:35,607
I'm not hiding in anything.

55
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,095
Look that rabbit's foot around
your neck!

56
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:40,394
Horse hair in your handkerchief
and owl feathers.

57
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:43,734
You can't perform like that.
It's dangerous.

58
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,636
Those are good omens, Matt.
Like you.

59
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,487
Your are a good omen.

60
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,344
All good omens make good
things happen.

61
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:53,792
I raised you wrong.

62
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,085
No, you haven't.

63
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:59,666
You raised me as good as any
real father could.

64
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:01,959
What are you afraid of, Toni?

65
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,707
Almost everything. I was scared of
going to Europe.

66
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:10,087
This morning I found milk
white butterfly.

67
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,621
That means I'll have a
wonderful trip.

68
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:17,168
A butterfly is a moth.
A moth means moth holes.

69
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,668
Omens, hexes, voo doo,...
It's all bunkum.

70
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,559
I'll prove it to you.

71
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,272
Oh, no - bread and butter!

72
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:32,939
Please!

73
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,508
- Leave the hat there.
- On the bed!

74
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,319
Leave it there, Toni.

75
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:37,767
Now!

76
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:42,233
Now I'm going to bust
a ten dollar mirror.

77
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:47,021
I'll prove you that omens are
for crazy heads.

78
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:54,625
It doesn't count if you do it
on purpose. Don't be scared.

79
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:56,234
Scared?

80
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,413
That mirror business is all
bunkum.

81
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,459
Well!

82
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:13,052
It's a good thing...
It was a Stetson.

83
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,754
You can't say I didn't try.

84
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,817
Matt, I don't worry about
omens when you're around.

85
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:30,996
Because when you love somebody,
nothing can hurt you.

86
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,927
And, I love you, Matt.

87
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,301
You sure cheer a fella up.

88
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:38,680
You better get to finishing
your packing.

89
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,215
I'll got Steve to pick you up.

90
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:44,957
I'm glad you found that

91
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:48,135
Lousy milk white butterfly.

92
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,245
That was a lot of yelling you
were doing to Toni.

93
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,573
Family discussion.

94
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,757
You can't deny that there was
a bird in that tent

95
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,613
The night that Alfredo fell
and her ma ran out.

96
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,263
You got anything else on
your mind?

97
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,631
Yes, Lili.

98
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:08,654
If you're going to Europe,
you start thinking about her.

99
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,631
She's liable to come out
to get a look at her daughter.

100
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,321
We'll take care of it.

101
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,816
Why don't you mind
our own business!

102
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,511
You got a circus to get
moving.

103
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,799
Steve!

104
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,420
Glad you signed for the tour.

105
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,546
You shouldn't be.

106
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:27,242
- Bad news?
- Are you up to hearing it?

107
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:28,690
I was weaned on it.

108
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:32,955
I was thinking about trying
to talk you out of this tour.

109
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,846
Then I figured, just let him go bust
and I'll be around...

110
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,548
You'd step in: New acts,
new flags in the tent,

111
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,117
New money thrown at you.

112
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,525
You're not sore?

113
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:45,226
Why? That's the way I started
ten years ago.

114
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:49,813
Got tired of being a rodeo bum,
grabbed an expiring big top -

115
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,106
Kicked everybody out
and took over.

116
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:54,198
That's exactly my plan.

117
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,612
I've been clear, Matt.
You want to fire me?

118
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,268
No, you'd better stick around.

119
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,808
I'll feel better if I know
there's a new genius around.

120
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,826
Will you bring Toni to the
ship?

121
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,039
Say, Matt...

122
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:11,177
You wouldn't consider skipping this

123
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:14,556
European thing?
I'm asking as a friend.

124
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,614
Thanks for saying that, Steve.

125
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:21,195
Shows you've got a big heart...
almost as big as your head.

126
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,689
Ship leaves at two.

127
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,650
Hello, boss!

128
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:09,234
Come in.

129
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:11,326
Steve!

130
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:15,389
Matt asked me to come by and
take you to the ship.

131
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,648
Come in. I'll be ready in a
few minutes.

132
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:20,258
Come in. Come.

133
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,971
This is almost my favorite.

134
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:30,074
Don't you ever get tired of
looking at the same stuff?

135
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,287
Oh, Steve! Look at this one.

136
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:35,023
Where he's holding me over
his head.

137
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,880
I've seen it fifty times.
Alfredo, famed circus star,

138
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,696
Starts training daughter Toni
for a trapeze career.

139
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:44,237
Toni will be the greatest of
the flying Alfredos.

140
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,892
- Says Father.
- Says Father.

141
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,185
That's something new?

142
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:51,800
Yes, I put it in last week.
Isn't he sweet Looking?

143
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:53,088
He's a Saint

144
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,703
who watches over the beautiful souls
in Paradise.

145
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:58,358
You know? That's where
Alfredo is.

146
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,606
What are those things?

147
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,497
Owl feathers.

148
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,750
They protect you from falling.

149
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,083
Paradise is pretty high up.

150
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,061
You know? I think you're a
little crazy.

151
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,118
Come on, Toni! Finish packing,
will you?

152
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:16,866
What's this?
Too small for you, aren't they?

153
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:20,366
My first birthday present
from my Uncle Aldo.

154
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:24,993
They're cute! Hurry up, Toni!
I haven't got all night.

155
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,809
I'll hurry, if you'll take me
to the party.

156
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,988
There's no chance.
It's no place for kids.

157
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:32,436
Kids!

158
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:36,339
I'm a Sicilian woman!
You ever hear of a vendetta'?

159
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,356
Stop making those faces!
It makes you Look nutty.

160
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:43,259
Sicilians are sensitive
and proud like horses.

161
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,949
You just remember that.

162
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,288
When you insult a Sicilian
it's for all his life, and yours.

163
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,656
That's a 'vendetta.

164
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,587
Thank you, very much

165
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:56,053
for the information.
Now, are you coming, or not?

166
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,433
Go by yourself.
Go on.

167
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,927
- Go!
- All right!

168
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:04,784
Steve!

169
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,117
Steve!

170
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,112
I hope you get seasick.

171
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,039
All the way.

172
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,062
Take her all the way up.
That's it. Hold it.

173
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:36,447
All right, swing it in.
Take it in.

174
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,937
Come on, there!

175
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:46,747
You did it!

176
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:48,799
That's my point!
Let it ride, boys!

177
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,070
Fifty! Cover me!

178
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,685
Snake eyes!

179
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:10,123
Pardon me. I'm Billy Hannegan
of Billboard Magazine.

180
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:15,313
Aren't you the daughter of the world's
most renowned artists,

181
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,646
- The Flying Alfredos?
- Yes.

182
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,543
I knew it, I knew it the first time
I saw you.

183
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:24,607
Oh, Lili's beautiful face
and the carriage

184
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,141
it's unmistakable.

185
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,877
Did you know my father?

186
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,412
We were great chums, yeah.

187
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:36,556
- Any news of your mother?
- I don't talk about her.

188
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:40,539
It's been fourteen years since
she disappeared, hasn't it?

189
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,947
I don't know.

190
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:43,074
I think it has.

191
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,890
The night since your father had

192
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,505
his fatal accident,
fourteen years to the day.

193
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:54,098
You've never heard from your
mother since that sad night?

194
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,035
Well, if it isn't my old pal
Hannegan!

195
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,932
If there's anything I'm gonna miss
in Europe

196
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,064
..it's the Billboard and Hannegan.

197
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,357
- Bring me a cup of coffee.
- Yes, Matt.

198
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,254
But, coffee is on board.

199
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,042
You're spoiling a good feature story,
Matt.

200
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:15,542
- The story is dead.
- Not this one, my friend.

201
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:20,209
It's just coming alive:
Will the renowned Lili Alfredo

202
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,635
come out of hiding to greet
her lovely daughter?

203
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,968
- Shake down.
- Oh, no, no, no.

204
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,503
There's a real tear in it.

205
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:32,400
How much will Billboard pay
for this tear.

206
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:36,182
Well, if I let myself go

207
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:40,366
I might fill 25 dollars worth
of space with it.

208
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,895
Here's fifty.

209
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,516
Write it for me. Send it to
Matt Masters, Europe.

210
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,487
That's very good of you, Matt.

211
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,298
I appreciate talent.

212
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,557
- I don't deserve it.
- I agree.

213
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:33,273
The key to the city.
Barcelona is yours.

214
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:35,848
Thank you, very much.

215
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,682
Ladies and gentlemen!

216
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:44,458
The slide for Life!

217
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,011
Here.

218
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,465
I'm all right.

219
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,164
Bring out those cargo knots.
Get them over the side.

220
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,262
Get a move on!
Bring out those cargo nets!

221
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:51,354
The cargo nets!

222
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:04,752
Hi, Simba!

223
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:07,809
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Whoa, boy!

224
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,075
Easy, easy.
Yah!

225
00:23:22,494 --> 00:23:23,903
Get in the cage!

226
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,093
Get back in the cage!

227
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:49,411
Cap!

228
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,474
Swing that boom around.
Give me a line.

229
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:54,882
Okay.

230
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:58,061
Will you swing that boom
right over to him?

231
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,931
How's Toni? Where's Toni?

232
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,914
She's all right.
She's on a lifeboat.

233
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:55,743
If we lose that canvas we re
out of business.

234
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,815
Look, your honor.

235
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:33,040
Tell him that we've got divers down
in the hold, right now,

236
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:38,190
Looking for the safe
and the cash boxes.

237
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,937
We're doing the best we can.
Explain that to him.

238
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,874
He says, they Looking for the safe
and the cash boxes.

239
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,047
We're very sorry,...

240
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:51,507
- You wait here. I go.
- No, no, no.

241
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,036
That's where I'm going.

242
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,047
You wait here.

243
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:59,553
He won't give me the feed
for the animals until he get paid.

244
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:02,651
- Well, keep talking.
- I've been talking, Matt.

245
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:05,146
He's 'muy simpatico,
he's very sorry.

246
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,043
But he's also got a family
to feed.

247
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,986
Keep conversing with him.
We've got the divers

248
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,514
- coming up, maybe.
- Sir...

249
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:17,699
The Port Master said,
with the deepest sympathy

250
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,837
he's sorry but it is necessary
that your ship

251
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:24,216
be removed as soon as possible.

252
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:27,556
I understand him,
and I sympathize with him,

253
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:29,366
and we'll remove it as soon
as possible.

254
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:32,022
He says, he's very grateful...

255
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:37,936
I hate to bother you right now,
but... could you help them?

256
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:41,436
They're broke, nothing to eat.
No place to sleep.

257
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:43,931
Honey, how can I...?

258
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:48,960
You got any money?

259
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,978
Well...no.

260
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,754
- Pio?
- No.

261
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:55,840
And you, Toni?

262
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,852
Me? Nothing.

263
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:02,197
Same here. Haven't got a
nickel, not a 'sou,

264
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,404
not a peseta.

265
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:05,979
- Mr. Masters.
- Yes, Your Honor?

266
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:08,272
The Port Master says,
and believe me,

267
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,692
he deeply regrets,
that if you do not remove the ship,

268
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:14,790
it becomes the responsibility
of the Port Authority.

269
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,882
It might be most expensive
for you if they...

270
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:20,704
Let him take it, salvage it.
You're welcome to it.

271
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:23,480
I hope there'll be a Little
left for our expenses.

272
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:25,492
I see no solution.

273
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,561
Matt! Matt!

274
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:33,699
They just brought up some
of the boxes.

275
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,995
Isn't that a picture of my mother?

276
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,852
Yes, it is.

277
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:15,301
Here, pay the men, and get
some meat for those cats.

278
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,503
Spread this among the artists
and get them something to eat.

279
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:23,629
Yes, Matt.

280
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:23,577
Looks Like he's trying to work off
his miseries.

281
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:27,761
Miseries he's got, all his animals
are boarded in Spain.

282
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:32,348
And still he's trying to kill himself.

283
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:39,791
Hey, Toni! Toni, I've got it!

284
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:42,889
That's a part of the act that made him
a star, remember?

285
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,866
He used to jump off the hotel roof
and make his getaway?

286
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:52,505
If he's thinking what I'm thinking,
it's time to talk.

287
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,591
Come on!

288
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,023
Hey, Matt!
You've got a few minutes?

289
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,793
What do you want?

290
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:11,454
Well, while you're still able
to talk,

291
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,909
I'd like to hear you say when
we're going home.

292
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,920
I'm not going home.

293
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,059
But, you can’t stay here.
You're broke.

294
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,846
I'm not broke. I got myself a job
with Ed Purdy.

295
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,462
You got a job with Ed Purdy!

296
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:29,238
When a fella's out of work
he gets himself a job.

297
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,249
No with Ed Purdy, you don't.

298
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,554
Back home you got friends,
you got contacts,

299
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:38,411
You can hook something good
for all of us.

300
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:41,147
Well, I only asked for a job
for myself.

301
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:43,722
I'm in no position to ask
favors to anyone else.

302
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:47,383
You all can go or stay,
as you please.

303
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,579
What about you, Toni?

304
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:56,556
You wanna go home?

305
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:00,258
Home... is where you are.

306
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,321
What about you?

307
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:07,500
I thought you were going
to stick around.

308
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,529
Where're you going?

309
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,788
Where do you suppose?

310
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:19,570
I'm going to see Purdy about
getting a job

311
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:24,679
and I'll settle for a partnership
you and me.

312
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,777
That's a very attractive offer,
Mr. McCabe.

313
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,398
A fella doesn't very often get a chance
to go in partnership

314
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,088
with a horse-riding pauper.

315
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,663
Right now you need a partner.

316
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:39,445
You figuring on being a
partner to me or anybody

317
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:40,652
you'd go out and earn it.

318
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:45,118
Among the things I'm good at,
taking advice from elders.

319
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:46,928
I'll go with you.

320
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:52,279
Elders! Partners!
That Texas punk!

321
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,130
You should have belted him.

322
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:57,872
Why don't you be a good boy,
take your hat in your hand,

323
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:02,297
go over to Purdy and see if you
can borrow some equipment.

324
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,148
- Old Ed Purdy!
- That's right.

325
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:10,424
He better be careful the way
he talks to me!

326
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,919
I knew that phoney when...

327
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:17,184
If he tries to pull anything on me,
I'll show him!

328
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,150
Come on!

329
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,303
Sure not causing much excitement.

330
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,804
It's pretty dreary.
Kind of quiet, huh?

331
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:16,930
Yep.

332
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:19,545
- Wanna change it?
- How?

333
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:22,281
Let's go into the opening act.

334
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:23,891
You gotta be kidding!

335
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,902
Just take the cue, boy.

336
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,972
- What's happening?
- Just hang on.

337
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:31,937
What?

338
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,311
Matt Masters!
You're not going to...

339
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:38,656
Oh, yes, we are.
Let's go!

340
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,376
Steve, stop it!

341
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,118
Steve!

342
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:08,831
Matt!

343
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:10,481
Knock on that!

344
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,129
Thank you.

345
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,267
Monsieur, je vous en prie.
Une photo.

346
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:04,474
Why not?

347
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:06,164
Attention!

348
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:08,698
C'est tout!
Je vous remercie, monsieur.

349
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:24,430
Monsieur American,
Matt Masters I artiste

350

352
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:36,379
En Champs Elysees.
Bravo, Matt Masters!

353
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,356
Premier artiste de la Far
West!

354
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:44,546
Purdy was sore at you when he saw
that crowd tonight.

355
00:36:44,627 --> 00:36:47,041
Why didn't you tell him
it was your idea?

356
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,334
He might have made you
a partner!

357
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:52,070
You've had your jokes.
You've finished your dinner.

358
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:55,208
Do you want me to answer
these telegrams or not?

359
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,783
Ones Hagenbeck in Copenhagen.

360
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:00,197
There's one from London
Associated Shows.

361
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,893
Can use your animals.
How much?

362
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,870
' Have a spot for Liberty Horses.
How much?

363
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,405
- Answering?
- Sure.

364
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,917
What are you trying,
get me drunk?

365
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:15,888
To be frank, yes.

366
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:19,469
That way you might say a few words
about our secret future.

367
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,963
Well, you don't have
to get me drunk,

368
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:24,136
I'm gonna build a new show.

369
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:29,246
I'll never use that word again,
but when do we sail?

370
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:32,223
We don't. We stay right here.

371
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:35,080
You can't build a circus here.

372
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,373
There ain't five Frenchmen
that can sit a horse.

373
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:40,712
Always thinking of a dog
and pony show.

374
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:45,621
All the big acts came from
Europe, the home of circus!

375
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:48,960
Belgium, Germany, France...
The big name families:

376
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,897
The Hannefords, the Bradnas,
the people that spell Circus.

377
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:54,955
They were born here,
so I figured that

378
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:59,300
while we're taking this tour
at Purdy's expense

379
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,438
we can pick up a few
of these great acts,

380
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,892
and build a real show.

381
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:08,634
Matt, I'm for it! That's new thinking.

382
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:10,646
Showmanship,
that's what I'm good at.

383
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:14,508
We can latch on to them before
Barnum, before Sells-Flot

384
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,606
all the rest. Say,
Medrano Circus is in town.

385
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:20,986
I'll go over and see if they
got anything good enough

386
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,279
for the new Master-McCabe
United Shows.

387
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,779
I might be a silent partner,
but I'm a partner.

388
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,067
You mind if I go?

389
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:30,400
If you can stand him.

390
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,395
At least he gives me top billing.

391
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:40,821
Listen, not that I'm gonna object
to anything, anymore,

392
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:44,361
but I wanna get this straight,

393
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:48,425
we stay with Purdy for the rest
of the European playdates,

394
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,994
And in our spare time we visit
carnivals and look and look?

395
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:53,012
That's about the size of it.
I look, and look.

396
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:55,345
And you're gonna find Lili.

397
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:58,564
Sure! Lili Alfredo!

398
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,782
That's why we're in Europe.
You still Love her.

399
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:04,558
Why don't you get drunk!

400
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,823
You plastered this Continent
with cablegrams for two years:

401
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:10,231
Where's Lili?

402
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,094
Not for me, for Toni. I stopped Looking
when Toni was four.

403
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:15,542
You're still Looking.

404
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,359
Get this in that empty head
of yours!

405
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:22,020
If Lili's alive, I couldn't less;
and if she's dead,

406
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:23,388
I'm not mourning her.

407
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,721
Alive or dead, she's gone.

408
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,905
- Where are you going?
- To get some fresh air.

409
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:33,044
It's too hot in here from that torch
you're carrying.

410
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,207
- Aren't they wonderful?
- Yeah.

411
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:23,943
That Little girl is wonderful too.

412
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:01,159
- Tojo, I'm delighted.
- Glad to see you, Mr. Masters.

413
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:02,366
Thank you.

414
00:44:02,446 --> 00:44:05,786
We've heard about your
terrible misfortune.

415
00:44:05,826 --> 00:44:09,004
I understand you're Looking for
some acts for a new circus.

416
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,901
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

417
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,522
Would you Like to come in?
Please?

418
00:44:15,683 --> 00:44:16,890
Thank you.

419
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,499
I'll take this stuff off.

420
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,827
- All right.
- I'll only be a minute.

421
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:21,638
Take your time.

422
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,293
Hello.

423
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,707
- What's your name?
- Giovanna, sir.

424
00:44:27,713 --> 00:44:29,282
I bet you Love the ballet?

425
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:31,133
Yes, sir, I do.

426
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:34,190
I've been studying a long time,
since I was five.

427
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:37,329
That make-believe wire act
you do is beautiful.

428
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,817
Thank you, sir.

429
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:41,392
I wondered, could you really walk
a high wire?

430
00:44:41,432 --> 00:44:45,375
- I've never tried, sir.
- That's too bad.

431
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,036
It'd wonderful if you could...
Ballet dancing on a wire.

432
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,663
The ballerina and the clown
in the hinge wire act.

433
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:55,755
Interested, Tojo?

434
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,204
Yes, very much.

435
00:44:57,566 --> 00:45:01,589
Uncle Tojo will teach me.
I will be very good.

436
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,883
- Honest.
- I believe you.

437
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:05,170
Still the fine showman,

438
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,021
Eh, Matt?

439
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,239
- Aldo.
- Yes.

440
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,269
Aldo Alfredo, formerly of...
the Three Alfredos.

441
00:45:19,574 --> 00:45:20,821
Where's Lili?

442
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:24,643
Haven't you heard from her?

443
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:26,816
- Where's Lili?
- I don't know.

444
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:29,793
The Last time I saw her was in
Copenhagen.

445
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:33,655
She was working in a show under
another name.

446
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:37,196
When I went over to speak to her,
she ran away.

447
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,219
I don't know if it's true,
but now I hear she is in...

448
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,875
Hamburg.

449
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:49,065
I suppose you're not interested
any more?

450
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,961
In the ballerina and the clown
on the high wire?

451
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:54,858
I'm not buying trouble.

452
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,353
Matt, there'll be no trouble.

453
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:00,974
I'm only interested in
Giovanna's future.

454
00:46:01,296 --> 00:46:02,503
Well, well, well!

455
00:46:02,784 --> 00:46:05,480
Looks Like you finally found
something.

456
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:08,779
- Aldo Alfredo!
- Cap Carson.

457
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:11,636
You can’t give this guy a job!

458
00:46:11,716 --> 00:46:14,170
It's Like hiring your own executioner!

459
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:18,033
The story of my brother is forgotten,
the vendetta over.

460
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:23,263
- Isn't she Lovely!
- Beautiful.

462
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,597
- You're Toni Alfredo?
- Yes, I am.

463
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:30,585
Toni, I'd Like to meet my niece:
Giovanna.

464
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:31,833
- hello.
- hello.

465
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,609
And I'm Tojo, the clown.

466
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:38,029
How do you do? I saw you dancing.
You're Lovely.

467
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,839
It will be much better on
the high wire.

468
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,736
Please, Mr. Masters!
Will you take us?

469
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:45,230
That's, is up to your uncle.

470
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:48,972
Giovanna and I will be very happy
to join you.

471
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:51,587
- Wont we?
- Yes.

472
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:54,927
It looks like we've hired our selves
an act,

473
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:58,105
and if you don't change your mind,
we winter in Madrid.

474
00:46:58,186 --> 00:46:59,755
See you there.
Good luck.

475
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:03,054
No, it's bad Luck to wish good Luck.

476
00:47:03,174 --> 00:47:05,709
You kick them, and say:
Break a leg .

477
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,681
Of course. Break a Leg.

478
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,577
Giovanna, work hard.

479
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,750
I will, I promise.
Goodbye.

480
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:14,400
Goodbye.

481
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:18,962
Wait here.
I'm gonna talk to this act.

482
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:41,412
Is there something you want?

483
00:49:41,493 --> 00:49:45,073
I'd Like to talk to Mr. Schuman
when it's convenient.

484
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,252
I'm Mrs. Schuman.
What do you want?

485
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:52,155
I'm Matt Masters.
We're getting together a circus...

486
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:55,132
I know, you don't need
to tell me.

487
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:58,190
Everybody knows.
News travels fast in Circus World.

488
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,569
I guess that answers all the questions
except one:

489
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,058
Are you interested?

490
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:04,345
Listen,

491
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:07,805
Emile has been doing this act
for three seasons now.

492
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,467
Every season they ask for more lions
to be sitting on him,

493
00:50:11,627 --> 00:50:14,806
I mean lying down on him.

494
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,300
Emile is getting very tired
of Lions.

495
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:21,042
I can't blame him.
But I have something else in mind.

496
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,531
- What?
- Tigers.

497
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:23,979
Tigers!

498
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,790
You want me

499
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:29,974
to lie down in the cage and the tigers
Lie on top of me?

500
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,100
No, monsieur!

501
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,796
Emile! No snap judgment.

502
00:50:35,003 --> 00:50:38,503
Every time a lion drops on me

503
00:50:38,544 --> 00:50:41,119
I'm playing Russian Roulette.

504
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,854
But tigers?
No, monsieur, no!

505
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,671
Let's get down to business.

506
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:51,579
I bought these Lions for Emile.
If you expect me to buy...

507
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,631
We have plenty of tigers.

508
00:50:53,671 --> 00:50:58,258
All right, then.
I'll speak to my husband,

509
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:01,275
until he makes the right decision.

510
00:51:01,396 --> 00:51:03,368
Good. Thank you.

511
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:09,161
Emile, das ist unseren grosste chance.

512
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:12,219
Du shusste as machen, Emile.

513
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:19,220
Isn't she Lovely?
Lili's girl.

514
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,587
She's beautiful, huh?

515
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:25,174
Hello, Mr. Masters.
You don't remember me, I bet.

516
00:51:25,255 --> 00:51:27,669
Flo Hunt, tumbling act.

517
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:31,290
That's me! Broke me back.
No more cartwheels.

518
00:51:31,732 --> 00:51:34,025
Got married. Four kids.
Easier work.

519
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:36,198
- I'm wardrobe here.
- Good.

520
00:51:36,278 --> 00:51:39,578
The girls are longing to meet you.
Fritzie, Ann...

521
00:51:39,658 --> 00:51:40,825
Ladies.

522
00:51:40,905 --> 00:51:42,837
I was telling them about Toni.

523
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:46,337
Haven't seen her since she was five.
I recognized her.

524
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,636
Same beautiful face as Lili.
Fritzie knows Lili.

525
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:51,929
Oh, a tragedy that Lili.

526
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,947
Maybe seeing her daughter
will help?

527
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:56,315
Seeing her?

528
00:51:56,516 --> 00:51:59,493
You mean, she hasn't?
But she's here in Hamburg.

529
00:51:59,614 --> 00:52:00,016
Lili?

530
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,988
Don't worry.
She'll turn up.

531
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:06,977
Yes, in Leipzig she talked
all the time about Toni.

532
00:52:06,977 --> 00:52:10,316
Do you have Lili's address,
Flo?

533
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:12,690
I knew where she lived a month ago.

534
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:14,943
But I meant to write.

535
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:17,156
Mr. Masters...

536
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:21,461
Pardon me.
Be right back.

537
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:26,329
My husband says:
No tigers.

538
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,582
- I'm sorry.
- But I like the idea.

539
00:52:28,743 --> 00:52:31,479
Its new faces in the act.
So, don't worry.

540
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,588
I know how to handle him.
He always does the right thing.

541
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:40,089
Thanks. Aman is lucky to have
a smart woman to guide him.

542
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,146
- Thank you.
- I'll expect your news.

543
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,514
You will?

544
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:55,739
I got it! Let me write it down.

545
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:30,300
- A beer.
- Ja vohl.

546
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,272
I'm looking for someone.

547
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:42,933
This picture was taken some
time ago. Have you seen her?

548
00:53:45,186 --> 00:53:49,370
That's Margot.
She's around sometimes.

549
00:53:49,572 --> 00:53:52,348
Well, good. Maybe you could
give me her address.

550
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:54,721
Her address?
She's living upstairs.

551
00:53:57,337 --> 00:54:00,274
Well,... is she now?

552
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:03,533
No, she ha been gone for
a few days.

553
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,470
Could I Look at her room?

554
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,441
Sure, of course, of course.

555
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:12,786
- Hilda!
- Yeah?

556
00:54:13,108 --> 00:54:14,838
Der Americano.

557
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:19,948
What's up?

558
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:23,609
Show this gentlemen Margot's
room.

559
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:26,828
- Margot? She's not here.
- Show him the room.

560
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:28,638
All right. This way, mister.

561
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,151
- You know Margot?
- Yes, I do.

562
00:54:41,754 --> 00:54:44,691
She doesn't come back
for two days. Always getting lost.

563
00:54:44,772 --> 00:54:49,077
Lot of girls Like that, you can tell
the ones want to get Lost.

564
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:54,227
Like Margot, you see her,
and then you don't see her.

565
00:54:58,049 --> 00:54:59,256
Voila!

566
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:35,506
Looks to me she's not coming back.

567
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:38,564
God knows there is much
to come back to.

568
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:41,501
I asked Margot: Why do you
pick out a room so plain,

569
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:43,834
Like a prison?
So he says:

570
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,771
Plain is more peaceful,
Like in the convent'.

571
00:55:47,616 --> 00:55:48,823
- Convent?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:52,967
She was there; nobody s
allowed to talk there.

573
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:55,864
Just work and pray.
She told me.

574
00:55:55,945 --> 00:55:58,962
She wants to be a nun,

575
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:01,698
so she can forget.
Do you understand?

576
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:07,451
You can get Lost good in one
of those women's religious places.

577
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:10,630
You can see that there,

578
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:12,601
she still got all that stuff.

579
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,619
Crosses, beads, Little books,

580
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,234
candles, everything.

581
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,861
Are you a relative?

582
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,321
No, no relative.

583
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:35,655
Friend?

584
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:41,569
Yes, I was, a Long time ago.

585
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:45,271
Are you, what she was trying
to forget?

586
00:56:49,093 --> 00:56:50,783
I was part of it.

587
00:56:51,668 --> 00:56:52,995
Merci.

588
00:56:53,317 --> 00:56:56,697
When you see Marge,
say hello from Hilda?

589
00:56:58,226 --> 00:56:59,272
I will, Hilda.

590
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,887
- Good.
- Much obliged.

591
00:57:33,189 --> 00:57:34,033
One.

592
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:24,112
May I? I mean,
if you're not using them.

593
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:25,882
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

594
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:10,219
Do you need the binoculars?

595
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:12,794
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

596
01:00:54,436 --> 01:00:56,287
Toni! Are you all right?

597
01:00:56,407 --> 01:00:58,137
I think so.

598
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:05,218
What happened?

599
01:01:05,379 --> 01:01:08,880
I was out there, everything
was going fine.

600
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,782
I had a good hold, then I...

601
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:15,397
I got a strange feeling.
I don't know why.

602
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,254
At least there wasn't a bird
in the tent.

603
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:20,467
Come on, we'll have Doc Look
at that.

604
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:27,065
How's the ankle, Toni?

605
01:01:27,146 --> 01:01:29,197
It will be fine with this
tight bandage.

606
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:31,169
Good. I'm going to change.

607
01:01:32,577 --> 01:01:35,112
Now stand on it Toni.
See how that feels.

608
01:01:35,353 --> 01:01:37,445
It's all right, Doctor.

609
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:40,704
Put your boot on and it'll
keep the swelling down.

610
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:45,210
- Thank you.
- Good.

611
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:49,716
- You forgot your things.
- Thanks.

612
01:01:50,722 --> 01:01:53,176
Is it very bad your ankle?

613
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:55,309
I sprain something all the
time.

614
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:59,735
Soak it tonight in salt.
That's very good for sprains.

615
01:01:59,855 --> 01:02:04,361
You're a circus performer.
I mean, used to be.

616
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:06,695
How can you tell?

617
01:02:06,816 --> 01:02:08,707
From the way you stand.

618
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:11,925
Yes, I used to work in shows.

619
01:02:12,086 --> 01:02:14,138
Did you ever work up high?

620
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:17,035
They won't Let me.
Bit I sneak in a Lot of practice.

621
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,248
On the trapeze?

622
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:22,145
Yes, flying.
And I'm going at it, too.

623
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:24,760
Because my father was
the best in the world.

624
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,099
If you've been in shows,
you must have heard of him:

625
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,749
The Flying Alfredo.

626
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:32,484
Yes, I heard of him.
Years ago.

627
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:35,945
He was the only who ever did
a triple somersault.

628
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:38,238
Nobody has ever done it
since him.

629
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:42,261
Was your mother in the circus?

630
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,078
I don't remember.

631
01:02:48,216 --> 01:02:50,831
Could I ask you something
personal?

632
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:53,285
What about?

633
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:55,860
If you're Looking for a job...

634
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:58,797
Thank you.
You are very kind.

635
01:02:58,918 --> 01:03:02,217
I Like talking to old circus
performers.

636
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:07,166
I'm sorry, I didn't mean old,
I mean veterans.

637
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,988
And I like talking to the
young ones.

638
01:03:11,108 --> 01:03:13,925
Especially a girl who's going
to be a big star.

639
01:03:13,965 --> 01:03:16,580
Maybe, if the omens are right.

640
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:19,034
I'm on the next.

641
01:03:19,115 --> 01:03:20,121
Yes?

642
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:21,569
Can you make it?

643
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:23,943
Yes. Easy.

644
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:25,230
- Okay, two minutes.
- Goodbye.

645
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:27,725
Is something the matter?

646
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:32,352
No. It's been so nice talking to you.

647
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:34,122
Good Luck.

648
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:35,731
Thank you. Goodbye.

649
01:03:36,214 --> 01:03:38,346
Where's the shot gun?
Come on.

650
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,956
Get up on it.

651
01:03:58,383 --> 01:04:00,636
Well, it happened.

652
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,245
What?

653
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:04,176
I just saw an old friend
of yours.

654
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:06,510
Where is she?

655
01:04:06,671 --> 01:04:08,079
Over by the hospital.

656
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:56,721
Lili!

657
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:05,693
Leave me alone!

658
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:10,602
Oh, Lili!

659
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:17,924
Changed a Little bit,
people change.

660
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:22,229
It's been a Long time, Matt.

661
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:26,775
Nearly fifteen years.
Don't Look at me, Matt!

662
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:31,724
I saw a friend of yours
in Hamburg.

663
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:34,379
She said to say hello.

664
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:39,006
Hilda? You were there?

665
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:41,662
Oh, Matt!

666
01:05:42,587 --> 01:05:46,490
Why, Lili? Answer me!
Why did you do it?

667
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,174
Leave me alone!

668
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:49,950
How Long do you think
you can keep running away?

669
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:53,611
How Long are you gonna
flop around in cheap joints?

670
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:56,709
I killed him! I killed...

671
01:06:17,872 --> 01:06:19,240
Secora?

672
01:06:33,804 --> 01:06:36,701
What are you hiding from,
Lili?

673
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,282
I killed Alfredo.

674
01:06:40,322 --> 01:06:46,236
Just as if I'd used a knife.
I killed him!

675
01:06:46,317 --> 01:06:49,374
All right. You killed him,
or I did,

676
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:54,524
maybe it was something neither
of us could help or anybody.

677
01:06:54,605 --> 01:06:58,226
God knows we didn't just wake up
one morning and say:

678
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:00,157
Today we're gonna fall in
Love .

679
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:01,887
But it happened, though.

680
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:04,784
What happened, Lili.
You've paid.

681
01:07:04,905 --> 01:07:09,934
Go away, Matt! Find yourself a Life,
with someone.

682
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:11,583
Let's forget about us.

683
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:15,124
Say that's over, finished, through.

684
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:18,141
You've got a daughter.
What about her?

685
01:07:19,187 --> 01:07:22,205
That night when I saw...

686
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:27,677
Alfredo dead, I ran outside.

687
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:33,068
People stared, I was still
in costume.

688
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:38,338
The only place I could find to hide
was in a church.

689
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:42,281
In the morning the nuns
found me.

690
01:07:42,402 --> 01:07:47,270
They gave me clothes...
They were kind to me.

691
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:54,029
And it was a haven.
It seemed Like an answer.

692
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:59,300
A convent, you took the easy
way.

693
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:05,295
Easy? I had to give up Toni.

694
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,835
But she had you, Matt.

695
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:13,382
You've been good for her.

696
01:08:13,462 --> 01:08:16,278
They're some things a man
just can't do.

697
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,376
She has to learn from a woman,
from her mother!

698
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:21,750
She needs you!

699
01:08:24,285 --> 01:08:28,147
How can I? Look at me.

700
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:32,010
What would you do?

701
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:34,021
I'd wash my face.

702
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:38,005
And make myself decent enough
to go up to that Little girl

703
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,895
and say: I'm your mother .

704
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:48,626
It's too late! I'm too tired!

705
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,851
Too late! Still full of self pity!

706
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:56,914
Cognac!

707
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:13,893
Make up your mind.
Or you're forever dead.

708
01:10:05,874 --> 01:10:07,765
- Toni, come here, please.
- Me?

709
01:10:09,897 --> 01:10:12,472
- Take your hat off.
- My hat off?

710
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:14,042
Put the funnel on your head.

711
01:10:14,605 --> 01:10:17,582
No, the other way round.

712
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:24,502
Now, when you catch the ball...

713
01:10:24,623 --> 01:10:26,956
- I'll give you five dollars.
- Five dollars!

714
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:30,779
Don't move now, don't move.

715
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,561
- One...
- Five dollars!

716
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:36,773
Five dollars!

717
01:10:36,854 --> 01:10:38,745
I'll give you five dollars!

718
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:41,481
One, two, three

719
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:44,377
four, five!

720
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:13,828
Jose! Put this in the safe.

721
01:11:15,116 --> 01:11:18,576
Hard paying bills without
Money. Take finesse.

722
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:22,519
We did all right today, 81
kids, 77 grown-ups,

723
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,180
6 dead heads.
Total: 259 pesetas,

724
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:27,950
That's 43 dollars American.

725
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,008
Eight thousand more
and we get our tent.

726
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:32,175
That's right.

727
01:11:32,295 --> 01:11:35,434
- Any other problem?
- Yes. You do have problems.

728
01:11:35,474 --> 01:11:38,974
Toni. She's sick and tired
of playing clown.

729
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:42,434
She got some of the wardrobe
girls fixing her up a costume.

730
01:11:42,555 --> 01:11:44,526
She's going for the high
trapeze.

731
01:11:44,647 --> 01:11:47,785
They'll fix her a costume
but she isn't gonna wear it.

732
01:11:47,986 --> 01:11:50,159
You Let me know if she does.

733
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,688
I'll Let you know.

734
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,568
Now, there be a good girl,
run up.

735
01:11:58,688 --> 01:12:03,114
Good girl. Run up, please.
Please, lady.

736
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:06,574
No, you can’t do anything
by standing.

737
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,546
Come on. Get inside!

738
01:12:08,626 --> 01:12:11,805
Look! Look at them,
they hate me.

739
01:12:11,885 --> 01:12:16,150
I don't want people to think
you're a coward.

740
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:21,300
You think she'll get him
to go in there?

741
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:25,162
She got him all the way
from Hamburg to Madrid.

742
01:12:25,323 --> 01:12:27,938
It's a big difference - Lions to tigers.

743
01:12:28,059 --> 01:12:30,312
Wives don't notice such things,

744
01:12:31,318 --> 01:12:34,255
Hello, Maggie.
How's the Leg?

745
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,789
Fine thank you.

746
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:59,280
You're one foot higher today,
but it doesn't matter.

747
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:01,855
Now, never Look at your feet.
Look right here.

748
01:13:01,895 --> 01:13:04,913
You walk with your eyes.
You ready?

749
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,723
- Ready.
- Go

750
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:18,632
- Nice work, Giovanna.
- Thank you.

751
01:13:18,753 --> 01:13:20,081
Look right here.

752
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:22,696
- I'm sorry, Aldo.
- It's all right.

753
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,552
Haven't you got some
rehearsing to do?

754
01:13:25,633 --> 01:13:27,886
- Yes, Sir.
- Well, get at it.

755
01:13:39,352 --> 01:13:42,370
All right Toni, you've had
your fun. Come on down.

756
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,548
Matt, I'm learning beautifully.

757
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:47,560
I don't want you Learning
anything.

758
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:51,382
I catch you up in the air again
I'll put you in the kitchen.

759
01:13:51,543 --> 01:13:53,595
You hear me?

760
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,612
Get down.
Come on down.

761
01:13:57,377 --> 01:14:01,038
Haven't you something to do,
riding a horse or something?

762
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:03,090
Well, yeah, but, well, I...

763
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:12,706
Come on, Toni.

764
01:14:17,695 --> 01:14:19,304
You Look beautiful!

765
01:14:19,344 --> 01:14:22,362
Yeah! Go ride your horse.

766
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,019
That's a nice Looking outfit.
New?

767
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,956
Yes, the wardrobe girls
made it for me.

768
01:14:49,157 --> 01:14:52,617
Oh, has Matt seen it?

769
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,922
No, I didn't put it on for him.

770
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,141
Do you Like it?

771
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:02,515
I'm getting used to it.

772
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:08,469
You'd rather I wore
the Salvation Army dress?

773
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,366
No, you Look much better
in this rig, but, different.

774
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,510
How, different?
Better or worst different?

775
01:15:16,677 --> 01:15:19,493
Well, better different for me.
Matt, he's gonna...

776
01:15:19,614 --> 01:15:22,551
Matt will make faces.
He always does.

777
01:15:22,631 --> 01:15:26,011
But they never Last Long.
He'll be all right for tomorrow,

778
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:28,465
or anyway the day after.

779
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,633
Toni told me you bawled her
out this morning.

780
01:15:43,714 --> 01:15:45,283
Yes, I did.

781
01:15:45,403 --> 01:15:47,898
For going up on the high trapeze?

782
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:51,599
Look, with Lili for a mother
and Alfredo for a father,

783
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,939
isn't that kind Like
bawling out a duck

784
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,669
for taking the water?

785
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:58,761
She's just a kid.

786
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:07,331
Are you gonna tell Toni that.

787
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:11,756
Well, that you saw her mother?

788
01:16:13,848 --> 01:16:15,860
- It's your pay.
- Are you?

789
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:21,131
No, I'm not, and it's your
move and quit reminding me.

790
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:31,068
Yeah, she's growing up fast.

791
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,247
Looks Like her baby days
are over.

792
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:52,674
It's the most wonderful day
in my Life.

793
01:16:52,794 --> 01:16:56,295
I'm a woman, I Love everybody.

794
01:17:13,836 --> 01:17:14,923
Well!

795
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:17,457
You, I wanna talk to you.

796
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,912
I wanna talk to you.

797
01:17:27,757 --> 01:17:30,252
- You kissed Toni.
- Did I?

798
01:17:30,573 --> 01:17:33,148
Well, you encouraged her,
I saw it.

799
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:35,080
Grabbing her and whirling
her around.

800
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,649
That's called dancing.

801
01:17:36,769 --> 01:17:42,120
Taking advantage of a kid!
Do you deny it?

802
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,339
- I deny nothing. I was...
- I'm not gonna belt you.

803
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,425
Belt me!

804
01:17:46,586 --> 01:17:49,081
You sounded off in Paris
about wanting to be my partner.

805
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:51,213
- That's right.
- Well, mister,

806
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,466
You're certainly going about it
in the wrong way.

807
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:58,093
But Like that you'll get nothing
except a busted head.

808
01:17:58,254 --> 01:17:59,260
A busted head?

809
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:04,208
I've never seen anything as cheap
and disgusting.

810
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:07,306
Matt, can't I say something?

811
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:08,956
- Say it.
- She's a woman.

812
01:18:09,077 --> 01:18:12,497
Not yet she isn't and she isn't
going to be made into one

813
01:18:12,577 --> 01:18:14,347
By any flight-by-night
Circus bum.

814
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:18,491
When Toni meets a man it's
gonna be for true Love,

815
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:21,710
no penny-ante fella using her
for a blue chip.

816
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,860
You figured me about as wrong
as any man possibly could.

817
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:33,056
- Steve, where are you going?
- Steering clear at you.

818
01:18:33,096 --> 01:18:35,188
Listen, do me a favor.
Just stay away from me.

819
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:38,246
I don't want a busted head.

820
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,082
Matt Masters, you're a bully.

821
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:07,455
What are you trying to do,
ruin my life?

822
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,260
Wait a minute.

823
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:11,318
- Don't treat me like a baby.
- I didn't call you a baby.

824
01:19:11,398 --> 01:19:14,255
No, but if you had your way,

825
01:19:14,335 --> 01:19:16,629
I'd be cooped up in a play-pen
with dolls

826
01:19:16,629 --> 01:19:20,250
Or in a high chair eating mush
and drinking milk.

827
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,669
And my clothes!
I'm still wearing bloomers.

828
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,808
Maybe you're a grown-up,
but I've been trying to help you...

829
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,791
Help me! Make me look like an idiot
in front of everybody.

830
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:33,285
I'll never forgive you.
I'm going to grow up.

831
01:19:33,406 --> 01:19:34,894
And you're not going to
stop me.

832
01:19:35,055 --> 01:19:37,107
I can't stop you.
You aren’t a kid any more.

833
01:19:37,228 --> 01:19:39,199
Then what am I? Say it.

834
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,929
Let me hear you say it once.

835
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:44,068
- Just once.
- You're a woman, Toni.

836
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:47,407
I got eyes.
You're beautiful

837
01:19:47,568 --> 01:19:50,223
- young woman and,
- Then why?

838
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:53,764
Please, just let me talk.

839
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:57,304
There’s a lot of things
that I should've said before, but

840
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:58,592
Go on.

841
01:19:58,713 --> 01:20:02,816
It's time you learned some
facts of life.

842
01:20:02,977 --> 01:20:06,156
- I'm listening.
- Sometimes, with two people,

843
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:07,966
well, things can get out of hand,

844
01:20:08,087 --> 01:20:11,145
and it's the woman that has
be strong.

845
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,846
Aman's generally no better
than he has to be.

846
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:18,025
Look at those idiots today
ogling you and whispering.

847
01:20:18,145 --> 01:20:21,444
Because I wore that costume.
Why? Everybody loved it.

848
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:24,382
There isn’t a man in this
place you can trust.

849
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:27,721
But there are exceptions.
A girl has to get married.

850
01:20:27,922 --> 01:20:32,710
I'm not talking about Steve,
or any other man.

851
01:20:32,951 --> 01:20:37,095
I don't want you to start off
stumbling.

852
01:20:37,176 --> 01:20:41,320
But, I'm in love, Matt.
Honest. In love.

853
01:20:42,124 --> 01:20:47,274
I guess maybe you are.
I don't know what to tell you.

854
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,493
Maybe you won't get hurt, but

855
01:20:50,694 --> 01:20:54,677
I just don't want you to do
your first dive without a net.

856
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:59,224
Oh, funny. When I came in
I wanted to kill you.

857
01:20:59,385 --> 01:21:01,638
I'm glad you changed your mind

858
01:21:01,678 --> 01:21:03,810
There's something you're not saying,
Matt.

859
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:06,546
Something sad in you...
I've felt it before.

860
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:07,874
Nothing like that.

861
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:09,885
It isn’t anything I've done
is it?

862
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,253
No, Toni.

863
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:17,409
You've given me nothing but
good things, and I'm grateful.

864
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:20,990
Matt, I owe you so much.

865
01:21:21,111 --> 01:21:24,732
Please, don't worry.
If I do any high dive,

866
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:26,381
I'll use a net.

867
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:06,614
Hey, Matt!

868
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:10,517
- You coming to supper?
- No, and close the door.

869
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:17,276
Kind of cozy here.

870
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:22,869
Schuman claims on of his tigers
has got indigestion.

871
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,242
He wants a doctor to examine
him.

872
01:22:25,484 --> 01:22:28,340
I told him flat -
I don't know any tiger doctors.

873
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:32,002
Go on to supper.
Don't bother me.

874
01:22:34,295 --> 01:22:35,582
What's on the program?

875
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,077
I don't know.

876
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:42,824
Maybe we ought to take the new
Circus and dump it in the junk

877
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:44,715
Are you crazy?

878
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,371
We're only 2000 bucks shy
on the price of a tent.

879
01:22:47,492 --> 01:22:48,819
I'm shy a lot more than that.

880
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:52,963
Just come on, let's shop it.
They got a new rice dish.

881
01:22:53,044 --> 01:22:55,297
Well, you eat it.

882
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:58,073
I gotta go through all
these mail-letters

883
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:01,211
from agents, phony acts...

884
01:23:01,332 --> 01:23:06,321
The always come crawling out,
you're putting on a circus.

885
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:07,648
Am I?

886
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:08,976
Well, it's my opinion.

887
01:23:10,626 --> 01:23:14,689
In a circus you have to have
artist flying through the air,

888
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:18,833
Like musical notes,
somebody making a tune with ‘em

889
01:23:18,914 --> 01:23:21,006
Somebody with a calliope
inside...

890
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:24,949
Calliope? You got steam coming
out of your ears.

891
01:23:27,564 --> 01:23:29,374
Go away, Cap.

892
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:33,116
Okay.

893
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:36,456
And close the door.

894
01:23:38,628 --> 01:23:42,088
I think you and the tiger both
need a doctor.

895
01:23:50,256 --> 01:23:51,342
Hello, Lili.

896
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:54,078
Hello, Cap.

897
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:02,929
Kind a wet out here, but,
might be worse inside.

898
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:19,224
Will you make up your mind
and stop opening and close?

899
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:40,507
Well, I washed my face.

900
01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:46,985
And I combed my hair.

901
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:52,014
Look any better?

902
01:24:54,307 --> 01:24:55,957
About eight pounds better.

903
01:24:56,882 --> 01:24:58,491
Seven.

904
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:04,607
A rope and a rigging will
Take off another seven.

905
01:25:05,894 --> 01:25:10,038
Matt, do you have a spot for
Another performer?

906
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:13,619
Lili, I...

907
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,838
Just a performer.
No relative.

908
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,091
She'll know you.

909
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:21,263
Not for a long time, Matt.

910
01:25:21,384 --> 01:25:24,844
And, if you don't want it,
never.

911
01:25:24,925 --> 01:25:28,586
I just don't want to be a performer,
working near her.

912
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:30,557
Hey, Matt! You in there!

913
01:25:35,265 --> 01:25:39,529
You're the lady who told me about
salt for my ankle.

914
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:41,259
I thought you were looking for a job.

915
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,760
Yes, I was just talking to Mr. Masters
about it.

916
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:47,294
- What's your act?
- High trapeze.

917
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:51,961
We've got one woman working high.
We need someone.

918
01:25:52,203 --> 01:25:54,979
What is your full name?

919
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,594
Margot Angeli.

920
01:25:57,876 --> 01:26:01,094
I'm Toni Alfredo.
Will you join us for supper?

921
01:26:01,296 --> 01:26:03,911
Well, I have to unpack, Toni.

922
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:06,526
Have you eaten, Miss Angeli?

923
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:10,308
No, I haven’t.

924
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:13,285
Well, you're more than
welcome to join us.

925
01:26:13,406 --> 01:26:14,613
Oh, fine!

926
01:26:16,866 --> 01:26:18,958
Under here you won't get wet.

927
01:26:51,024 --> 01:26:53,800
Good morning, Miss Angeli.
You're early.

928
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:57,341
It's been a long time.
I need some practice.

929
01:26:57,663 --> 01:26:59,433
Well, your rigging's secure.

930
01:27:00,358 --> 01:27:02,571
- Thanks, Cap.
- Any time.

931
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:22,877
You're all right.

932
01:28:23,561 --> 01:28:25,291
You only fainted.

933
01:28:25,693 --> 01:28:28,349
You just lie quiet
and you'll be fine.

934
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,999
You're Aldo.

935
01:28:37,803 --> 01:28:40,016
I shouldn't have surprised
you that way.

936
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:42,591
I thought...

937
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,482
Did I upset you?

938
01:28:46,816 --> 01:28:49,551
It's nothing, Matt.
She just had a little shock.

939
01:28:50,316 --> 01:28:53,454
I thought she knew I was here.
I'm sorry.

940
01:29:03,834 --> 01:29:06,409
You fell. You're not going up again.

941
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:10,795
But, it had nothing to do
with my strength.

942
01:29:10,956 --> 01:29:13,490
It was Aldo...

943
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:18,439
He stood there looking at me
in Alfredo's eyes and clothes.

944
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:23,026
I thought it was Alfredo.
It was just my imagination.

945
01:29:23,146 --> 01:29:24,434
I wonder.

946
01:29:24,555 --> 01:29:29,181
Well, anyway it won't work out,
Lili.

947
01:29:29,262 --> 01:29:33,245
Because of Aldo?
I'm not afraid of him.

948
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,216
Not Aldo, you.

949
01:29:35,297 --> 01:29:37,349
You and Toni.

950
01:29:37,429 --> 01:29:41,010
But she likes me, Matt.
Last night...

951
01:29:41,171 --> 01:29:43,424
Last night you were somebody
in the rain.

952
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:48,775
No, there's more to it than that.
She feels something.

953
01:29:48,936 --> 01:29:52,879
Well, that's a feeling you're not
going to like.

954
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,580
You're a blacked out figure
in her scrapbook, Lili,

955
01:29:56,781 --> 01:29:58,753
and in her life,

956
01:29:58,914 --> 01:30:01,408
And I did that, and I meant
to do it.

957
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:04,909
Way back, when she was a
little kid,

958
01:30:04,989 --> 01:30:07,725
She blamed herself because
you'd gone away.

959
01:30:07,846 --> 01:30:10,944
It took a long time to convince her
it wasn't her fault.

960
01:30:11,064 --> 01:30:14,283
I could have told her the
truth, bit I didn’t.

961
01:30:14,484 --> 01:30:15,892
I lied.

962
01:30:16,013 --> 01:30:21,082
So she blacked you out, like
I did. I taught her that.

963
01:30:21,284 --> 01:30:24,542
Then, why did you go to
Hamburg?

964
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:32,147
Matt, let me stay until
she finds out.

965
01:30:32,589 --> 01:30:36,170
Maybe by then she'll get to know me.

966
01:30:37,176 --> 01:30:38,664
I'm not a monster.

967
01:30:38,825 --> 01:30:42,124
She's been hurt once.
That's enough.

968
01:30:42,245 --> 01:30:46,108
Well, if she hates me,
it won't hurt her to find out.

969
01:30:46,188 --> 01:30:49,286
She may curse me, spit at me
and tell me to get out.

970
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:53,148
She has a right.
And if she tells me to go, I'll go.

971
01:30:54,919 --> 01:31:01,356
It won't hurt her to have revenge.

972
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:03,810
What happens to you?

973
01:31:07,029 --> 01:31:09,644
I'll take my chances.

974
01:31:12,903 --> 01:31:14,834
You've got guts, Lili.

975
01:31:18,013 --> 01:31:19,622
I hope you win.

976
01:31:42,233 --> 01:31:44,365
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Oh, yeah.

977
01:31:45,049 --> 01:31:47,584
- What's the matter, Steve?
- Oh, nothing.

978
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:50,481
Yes, you kept your eyes open
when you kissed me.

979
01:31:50,722 --> 01:31:53,136
I was doing sentry duty.

980
01:31:53,217 --> 01:31:57,280
Stop worrying about Matt.
He isn't here.

981
01:31:57,562 --> 01:31:59,574
Toni, hes all over the places.

982
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:05,367
I don't like acting like two kids,
scared of Matt.

983
01:32:05,448 --> 01:32:08,385
- Do you like that, Toni?
- Not entirely.

984
01:32:08,465 --> 01:32:11,885
I didn’t tell you what was biting him.

985
01:32:11,966 --> 01:32:15,345
He thinks that I'm courting you
so I can become his partner.

986
01:32:15,345 --> 01:32:19,047
Using you to blackmail him.
He's a flathead!

987
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,541
You could have told him
he was talking crazy.

988
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:23,633
I didn’t have much chance.
But I'm going to...

989
01:32:23,714 --> 01:32:25,524
Do you have to leave now?

990
01:32:25,766 --> 01:32:30,754
I’m telling him I wouldn’t be his partner
even he begged me!

991
01:32:30,835 --> 01:32:33,651
And the only part I want is
Toni Alfredo.

992
01:32:33,812 --> 01:32:37,715
- Do you have to tell him now?
- Yes, you coming?

993
01:32:37,755 --> 01:32:38,761
Sure.

994
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:41,376
Wait a minute!

995
01:32:43,146 --> 01:32:44,796
Now what are you doing?

996
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:48,095
For good luck on a journey.
You're going to need some.

997
01:32:53,084 --> 01:32:54,935
- Now?
- Now.

998
01:32:59,843 --> 01:33:02,217
Well! Back together again, eh?

999
01:33:02,297 --> 01:33:04,188
Glad to see you two've made up.

1000
01:33:04,269 --> 01:33:06,924
Happy faces,
that's what we need in the circus.

1001
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:09,258
How you doing with your
trapeze, honey?

1002
01:33:09,338 --> 01:33:11,028
I'm doing fine everywhere.

1003
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:14,247
Well, don't waste it on me.
Him!

1004
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:18,994
Now go back to your secret
hiding place nobody knows about

1005
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:18,178
- Thank you, Goliath.
- Any time, Miss Margot.

1006
01:34:24,172 --> 01:34:26,425
Good morning.

1007
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:31,978
You do those turns just beautifully.

1008
01:34:32,179 --> 01:34:33,627
I thought I was rather stiff.

1009
01:34:34,271 --> 01:34:37,127
I've seen you work before

1010
01:34:37,288 --> 01:34:38,938
Somewhere.

1011
01:34:39,059 --> 01:34:42,720
- No, I doubt that.
- I'm sure I have.

1012
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:44,812
Where did you work in the
United States?

1013
01:34:45,657 --> 01:34:47,186
Oh, it's been a long time.

1014
01:34:47,588 --> 01:34:50,042
And not in any shows you’ve
ever seen.

1015
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:54,870
Name the shows you were in,
and I bet you I remember.

1016
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,922
Well, how did it go today,
Miss Angeli.

1017
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:58,853
- Twenty five turns.
- Wonderful.

1018
01:34:59,014 --> 01:35:00,423
- Five more than yesterday.
- Great.

1019
01:35:00,543 --> 01:35:03,319
Matt, I just told Margot
that I...

1020
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,860
I thought I wanted to be an
aerialist.

1021
01:35:07,021 --> 01:35:11,286
I'd like to see you do
twenty-five flags.

1022
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:13,659
That's easy.
Just watch.

1023
01:35:19,694 --> 01:35:21,907
- Thanks for saving me.
- What brought that on?

1024
01:35:22,229 --> 01:35:23,758
Will you count for me?

1025
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:26,091
I'm counting.

1026
01:35:26,655 --> 01:35:29,833
I don't know.
When she was a little girl,

1027
01:35:30,075 --> 01:35:33,052
She used to sit on the ring
curb and watch me work out.

1028
01:35:33,173 --> 01:35:35,184
I remember.

1029
01:35:35,305 --> 01:35:38,161
That's how she learned to count,
counting your turns.

1030
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:42,386
How much does she know about
her father and me?

1031
01:35:43,955 --> 01:35:48,180
She knows her father died in
a fall and you disappeared.

1032
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,191
How much does she know about you?

1033
01:35:51,197 --> 01:35:54,255
Well, I spanked her when
she was bad,

1034
01:35:54,335 --> 01:35:56,347
Loved her when she was good.

1035
01:35:56,508 --> 01:35:57,675
I'm just there like

1036
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:01,617
night and day and she never question it.

1037
01:36:02,985 --> 01:36:06,969
Would you be afraid
to let her know the truth?

1038
01:36:08,055 --> 01:36:10,348
It'd be a lie to say I wasn't afraid.

1039
01:36:10,469 --> 01:36:13,768
I don't want to lose her.
She's like my own.

1040
01:36:19,722 --> 01:36:21,694
She needn’t ever know.

1041
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:25,114
I intend to tell her sometime,

1042
01:36:25,959 --> 01:36:27,286
take my chances.

1043
01:36:27,488 --> 01:36:28,695
How many?

1044
01:36:28,775 --> 01:36:29,499
Fifteen.

1045
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,557
Fifteen? It's twenty-two!

1046
01:36:32,959 --> 01:36:35,534
Fifteen's my count.
Start over.

1047
01:36:36,017 --> 01:36:38,431
Start over! That's not fair!

1048
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,012
Hey, Matt! It's here!

1049
01:36:42,132 --> 01:36:44,587
The canvas! The tent!
It's coming right up the road!

1050
01:36:44,828 --> 01:36:47,121
Toni, come on!
Come on, everybody!

1051
01:36:47,282 --> 01:36:49,777
Here's the tent!
The tent's here!

1052
01:36:50,058 --> 01:36:52,151
Come on! Let's go!

1053
01:37:33,028 --> 01:37:35,120
What about the party?

1054
01:37:36,488 --> 01:37:39,747
Let's go for it!
After we get the tent up.

1055
01:38:11,974 --> 01:38:14,267
- Hello, boss.
- Thanks, Goliath.

1056
01:38:16,922 --> 01:38:19,376
That deserves some coffee,
what do you say?

1057
01:38:19,457 --> 01:38:21,630
- I'd love some.
- Let's get it, Cap.

1058
01:38:45,448 --> 01:38:47,580
Dance with an old friend?

1059
01:38:48,345 --> 01:38:49,914
And old friend, Aldo?

1060
01:38:50,075 --> 01:38:51,684
And old enemy, then.

1061
01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:55,667
You haven't forgiven me yet,
have you?

1062
01:38:55,788 --> 01:39:00,052
In Sicily we say: Those who want
forgiveness must knock

1063
01:39:00,133 --> 01:39:02,305
at the gates,
and wait for the devil to answer .

1064
01:39:02,507 --> 01:39:05,122
Haven’t I waited long enough?

1065
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:31,756
- Why, that big...!
- Get off it! Leave them alone!

1066
01:39:31,917 --> 01:39:33,969
Leave them alone?
It's dark out there!

1067
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:37,188
Well, kids like the dark.
Weren’t you ever young?

1068
01:39:37,308 --> 01:39:40,125
Why don't you mind your
own business?

1069
01:39:40,205 --> 01:39:42,016
Give me some coffee.
Come on.

1070
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:06,759
Where's Lili?

1071
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,696
She’s right...
I guess she's gone.

1072
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:11,909
Look for her.

1073
01:40:24,744 --> 01:40:26,836
It was Alfredo's waltz.

1074
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:29,169
He made his swing to that
waltz.

1075
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:33,273
I can’t stay here, Matt,
I just can’t do it.

1076
01:40:33,354 --> 01:40:37,135
Dance to it, Lili.
Dance!

1077
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:45,504
It's just and old waltz,
just and old piece of music.

1078
01:40:49,447 --> 01:40:54,154
God forgive me...
but I still love you, Matt.

1079
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:57,735
It's nothing to be ashamed of,

1080
01:40:58,701 --> 01:41:00,189
then or now.

1081
01:41:04,373 --> 01:41:05,661
It's all right.

1082
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,301
Why, that's Matt with Margot!

1083
01:41:34,066 --> 01:41:36,721
Why, that fat-head dancing.

1084
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:39,779
Maybe we could rent him
our place behind the calliope, eh?

1085
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:43,521
Oh, no, no, no.

1086
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,563
Have you told Matt, honey?

1087
01:42:11,684 --> 01:42:14,058
Not exactly, but I hinted
about it.

1088
01:42:14,219 --> 01:42:17,236
Church, white veil, orange blossoms
and those all omens.

1089
01:42:17,317 --> 01:42:19,731
But, did you happen to mention me?

1090
01:42:19,891 --> 01:42:21,581
You know, in a general way.

1091
01:42:22,547 --> 01:42:25,926
I'm sure that he didn't know what
you were talking about.

1092
01:42:26,047 --> 01:42:28,823
He's been very busy.
He doesn't concentrate.

1093
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:32,002
Of course, he's been concentrating
with Margot.

1094
01:42:32,163 --> 01:42:35,059
I'm glad he is.
She's nice, very nice.

1095
01:42:36,468 --> 01:42:38,198
- Do you want me to tell him?
- Oh, no.

1096
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:40,410
If we're gonna get married Sunday...

1097
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:44,756
- No, I want to tell him.
- There he is now.

1098
01:42:46,928 --> 01:42:49,745
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, Goliath, You winning?

1099
01:42:51,233 --> 01:42:52,521
Not now.

1100
01:42:52,641 --> 01:42:55,216
He's in good mood.
He's laughing.

1101
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:58,676
No, I've got to get dressed.
I'll tell him later.

1102
01:42:58,717 --> 01:43:02,660
- When?
- Just later?

1103
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:05,637
Just later!

1104
01:43:17,304 --> 01:43:18,270
May I come in?

1105
01:43:18,874 --> 01:43:21,770
Yes, I wish you would.

1106
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:26,075
Oh, lilac! How beautiful.
I know who they're from.

1107
01:43:26,236 --> 01:43:28,530
Matt. Lilac are good luck.

1108
01:43:28,691 --> 01:43:30,581
I hope so.

1109
01:43:31,225 --> 01:43:32,312
Beautiful!

1110
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,622
Could I have it quiet, please?
Everybody here?

1111
01:43:38,186 --> 01:43:40,559
Where’s Toni? And Tojo?
Where is he?

1112
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,968
I'll get them in.

1113
01:43:42,732 --> 01:43:44,703
Well, it's finally here.

1114
01:43:44,824 --> 01:43:47,278
It's a half hour to dress rehearsal.

1115
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:49,813
No breaks and no waits.

1116
01:43:49,893 --> 01:43:52,589
I want the same performance
you're gonna give tonight.

1117
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:55,687
So, check your costumes
and your props.

1118
01:43:55,848 --> 01:43:58,262
- And pick up those music cues.
- Yes, sir.

1119
01:43:58,463 --> 01:43:59,751
Now, are there any questions?

1120
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:04,217
When I blow this whistle
for the Grand Parade,

1121
01:44:04,297 --> 01:44:05,665
You're all on your own.

1122
01:44:05,826 --> 01:44:09,769
You're a fin group of artists,
the best in the world.

1123
01:44:10,332 --> 01:44:12,706
And I don't want you to forget that
for a minute.

1124
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,689
And also, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you

1125
01:44:16,729 --> 01:44:19,747
for the hard work that's made
this circus possible.

1126
01:44:19,787 --> 01:44:23,247
So, break a leg,
let's get to it!

1127
01:44:35,518 --> 01:44:38,334
I'm trying to get up enough nerve
to tell Matt

1128
01:44:38,455 --> 01:44:41,593
That I'm getting married.
It's not that I'm afraid,

1129
01:44:41,674 --> 01:44:44,048
but, well, I'm all he has.

1130
01:44:44,369 --> 01:44:47,427
He doesn't ha a family
or anyone like that.

1131
01:44:47,588 --> 01:44:49,680
And, he'll be alone when
I get married.

1132
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:53,663
Not really alone, but you know,
it won't be the same.

1133
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:56,802
Even if I'm still on the show.
You see what I mean?

1134
01:44:57,687 --> 01:44:59,658
I understand, of course.

1135
01:45:00,463 --> 01:45:02,957
Matt is very good.
He's kind of sweet.

1136
01:45:02,998 --> 01:45:06,015
And if he's short of loud
sometimes,

1137
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:09,033
it's just because he's full
of fun and he loves life.

1138
01:45:09,033 --> 01:45:12,895
There've been a lot of women
after him forbears but,

1139
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:16,154
None of them were right for
him, I guess.

1140
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:18,769
I think you are right, I mean.

1141
01:45:19,735 --> 01:45:21,666
You do like him,

1142
01:45:23,195 --> 01:45:24,844
don't you?

1143
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:30,759
What's the matter?

1144
01:45:31,966 --> 01:45:33,092
Thirty minutes.

1145
01:45:33,816 --> 01:45:36,874
Get dressed or Matt will
put you back on the Stage Coach.

1146
01:45:37,115 --> 01:45:39,891
I'm going.
Think about what I said.

1147
01:45:40,938 --> 01:45:41,984
I will.

1148
01:45:47,898 --> 01:45:49,065
What was that all about?

1149
01:45:49,185 --> 01:45:52,967
She was trying to match me
with Matt.

1150
01:45:57,594 --> 01:46:03,106
You and Matt are digging and awfully
deep hole yourselves.

1151
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:28,936
Why can't the keep on cue?

1152
01:46:29,057 --> 01:46:31,712
Last time it took them four minutes
o make that...

1153
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,609
Are your working here?

1154
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,707
Get into your costume!

1155
01:46:42,937 --> 01:46:45,552
- Where was I?
- Four minutes!

1156
01:46:45,834 --> 01:46:46,639
Take two out of it.

1157
01:47:58,013 --> 01:47:58,978
Hi!

1158
01:47:59,018 --> 01:48:02,720
I think wed better work those
ponies in Number Three Ring.

1159
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:03,766
Right.

1160
01:48:05,536 --> 01:48:06,864
Look at that!

1161
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:09,881
Look at that!
Is that my mother?

1162
01:48:10,002 --> 01:48:12,859
Answer me, is she my mother?

1163
01:48:13,663 --> 01:48:15,192
Yes, Toni.

1164
01:48:15,434 --> 01:48:18,612
And this says my father killed
himself.

1165
01:48:18,813 --> 01:48:22,233
He dived from a trapeze and
left a note about my mother

1166
01:48:22,354 --> 01:48:26,820
and another man.
Is that true? Is true?

1167
01:48:27,142 --> 01:48:28,429
It's true.

1168
01:48:29,596 --> 01:48:33,780
You didn’t tell me any of this.
Why? Tell me why!

1169
01:48:35,309 --> 01:48:36,757
I'm the other man, Toni.

1170
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,217
It was me.

1171
01:48:41,505 --> 01:48:42,310
You?

1172
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:58,725
Why didn't you tell her the
rest of it?

1173
01:48:58,886 --> 01:49:02,909
All about her father
and how loyal Lili really was?

1174
01:49:02,989 --> 01:49:06,248
What good would that have done?

1175
01:49:10,151 --> 01:49:14,013
You sneak back and think
you can make me love you.

1176
01:49:14,134 --> 01:49:16,789
- I only meant...
- You thought you'd trick me!

1177
01:49:16,789 --> 01:49:20,089
But you didn't trick me!

1178
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:22,141
I know what you are
and what he is.

1179
01:49:22,221 --> 01:49:24,233
Toni, we only wanted...

1180
01:49:24,434 --> 01:49:29,181
You wanted Matt again!
To roll around in filth with him again!

1181
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:32,561
Well, here he is! Take him!

1182
01:49:32,762 --> 01:49:35,578
Take him, made love to him!

1183
01:49:35,699 --> 01:49:37,107
- Crawl on him!
- That's enough!

1184
01:49:37,268 --> 01:49:41,493
It's not enough! You liars!
You killed my father!

1185
01:49:41,654 --> 01:49:43,826
It would only be enough if
I kill both of you!

1186
01:49:44,068 --> 01:49:47,005
Toni, grow up! Be a woman.

1187
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:50,384
Get married with Steve.
Make a life on your own!

1188
01:49:50,465 --> 01:49:53,804
I hope it's a better one
than Lili's had.

1189
01:49:53,925 --> 01:49:58,351
I hope she has no life at all!
Not now, not ever!

1190
01:50:10,099 --> 01:50:11,587
Lili.

1191
01:50:14,363 --> 01:50:15,450
Lili.

1192
01:50:17,099 --> 01:50:21,444
Lili, we both said we could
take it, remember?

1193
01:50:24,663 --> 01:50:26,273
The rehearsal.

1194
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:32,670
I'll be there.

1195
01:50:41,762 --> 01:50:44,056
So just puck up and let's get
out of here.

1196
01:50:44,136 --> 01:50:47,274
- What else could I do?
- You could have realized

1197
01:50:47,355 --> 01:50:52,545
That whoever planted this
in here to make their love

1198
01:50:52,706 --> 01:50:55,603
look dirty.
And I just don't believe it.

1199
01:50:55,643 --> 01:50:58,499
But, you've known Matt longer
than I have.

1200
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:01,718
I've only known him for ten years.

1201
01:51:03,891 --> 01:51:07,230
That's Parade Call.
You want to get ready?

1202
01:51:07,592 --> 01:51:08,477
No!

1203
01:51:08,638 --> 01:51:10,529
All right.

1204
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:06,816
Ladies and gentlemen,
we bring, our Circus!

1205
01:52:06,936 --> 01:52:08,143
Master!

1206
01:53:17,345 --> 01:53:18,270
Fire!

1207
01:53:19,598 --> 01:53:20,845
Fire!

1208
01:53:33,076 --> 01:53:35,047
- Gimme your knife.
- Matt, you can't do...

1209
01:53:35,208 --> 01:53:37,622
I'm not gonna lose another
damn tent!

1210
01:53:38,507 --> 01:53:40,479
Get those animals outta here!

1211
01:54:07,435 --> 01:54:10,211
That part's gone,
is out of control.

1212
01:54:10,573 --> 01:54:12,947
We gotta make a fire break
to save any of this tent.

1213
01:54:13,028 --> 01:54:16,126
Drop the canvas between two
and three poles.

1214
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:19,304
I'll flatten those seats.

1215
01:55:04,365 --> 01:55:05,532
Hurry!

1216
01:55:17,079 --> 01:55:18,407
Oh, honey.

1217
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:23,074
Give Cap a hand with that fire break.
Get Toni out of here!

1218
01:55:25,609 --> 01:55:26,534
You ready?

1219
01:55:37,035 --> 01:55:38,886
Get the quarter poles!

1220
01:55:40,012 --> 01:55:41,340
What do you have to do?

1221
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:44,277
I have to cut the lacing on poles
two and three.

1222
01:55:44,398 --> 01:55:46,289
I can do that.

1223
01:55:57,031 --> 01:55:59,163
- Cap, what can I do?
- Here,

1224
01:56:02,301 --> 01:56:04,152
cut down those lights.

1225
01:57:34,114 --> 01:57:35,723
Get out of here!

1226
01:57:59,783 --> 01:58:00,909
Get back!

1227
01:58:50,235 --> 01:58:53,535
Gimme a hand.
Help them with that canvas.

1228
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:13,169
Steve! Cut it and get out there!

1229
01:59:54,086 --> 01:59:55,414
Thanks.

1230
01:59:56,178 --> 01:59:58,552
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1231
01:59:59,879 --> 02:00:03,702
You know something?
You've got a dirty face.

1232
02:00:07,725 --> 02:00:09,857
It started in the wardrobe
caravan.

1233
02:00:11,346 --> 02:00:15,530
We got a piece of tent,
a whole show and half an idea,

1234
02:00:15,691 --> 02:00:18,910
And if it works out goes on tonight.

1235
02:00:19,071 --> 02:00:21,525
- Are you out of your mind?
- Lets me see that.

1236
02:00:21,605 --> 02:00:22,772
Let the doctor
take a look at it.

1237
02:00:22,933 --> 02:00:25,749
- A show with this?
- Let's check the damage.

1238
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:34,122
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, Goliath.

1239
02:06:42,535 --> 02:06:47,121
Ladies and gentlemen!

1240
02:06:47,805 --> 02:06:51,185
Your attention, please!

1241
02:06:52,231 --> 02:06:57,220
It is my privilege to present
to you

1242
02:06:59,151 --> 02:07:02,973
It's a remarkable thing, Matt.
I hope I don't fail you.

1243
02:07:03,456 --> 02:07:04,985
You couldn't.

1244
02:07:05,025 --> 02:07:07,238
Toni, give her some of those
owl feathers.

1245
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:09,934
- I haven’t got any.
- You haven't?

1246
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:12,106
You!

1247
02:07:13,032 --> 02:07:16,170
Well, how do you think I got
this big top up?

1248
02:07:16,934 --> 02:07:18,222
Break a leg!

1249
02:07:19,187 --> 02:07:22,647
...Lili and her daughter Toni.

1250
02:09:34,854 --> 02:09:37,027
- Lili's getting tired!
- She won't quit.

1251
02:09:40,769 --> 02:09:42,499
Something's happened.
Toni's quit!

1252
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:43,504
Nothing's happened.

1253
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:49,499
She knows what she’s doin'.
A wonderful kid.

1254
02:09:53,844 --> 02:09:54,971
Lili!

1255
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:57,586
Seventy-one, seventy-two,

1256
02:09:57,988 --> 02:10:00,443
seventy-three, seventy-four,

1257
02:10:00,845 --> 02:10:04,627
seventy-five, seventy-six,
seventy-seven,

1258
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:08,932
seventy-eight, seventy-nine,
