1
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,588
Come on, come on!

2
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:57,276
Dead One, let's go.

3
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:00,994
Come on!

4
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:05,115
- Dead One, let's go.
- Wait! I'm winning.

5
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,749
- Which one is yours?
- That one. Can't you see he's winning?

6
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,707
You lost. Let's go.

7
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,384
Are you staying here forever,
or are you coming with me?

8
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:53,000
OK, OK.

9
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:54,184
Come on, I want an answer!

10
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:01,664
I'm coming with you.

11
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:23,272
The enemy comes
at a gallop...

12
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:27,472
and moving in the wind...

13
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,436
their red flag.

14
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:35,551
And moving in the wind...

15
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,384
their red flag.

16
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:45,909
The enemy comes
at a gallop...

17
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,985
Get down! Hands up!

18
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,941
- Easy...

19
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:35,334
Leave your gun there.

20
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:39,536
- Calm down...
- I'm OK.

21
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:46,583
Do I look nervous?

22
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,614
Do you know what I do
when I get nervous?

23
00:06:56,545 --> 00:07:00,378
Am I nervous?
I'm not, you bastard!

24
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,503
Where's the gold?

25
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:17,982
It's in the saddles, on the
horses.

26
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,297
There's nothing in the
stagecoach

27
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,379
Vargas! Pig! Go search the dead.

28
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,735
Let's see what you got here...

29
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:35,863
What are you looking for,
you ignorant gaucho?

30
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,774
I told you, there's nothing
there!

31
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:53,172
I'll show you how we,
ignorant people, sign.

32
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,816
Don't fucking move!

33
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:24,612
Aballay!

34
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,895
Hey Aballay,
let's go, others are coming!

35
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:31,931
Go get the gold, Dead One!

36
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,457
TEN YEARS LATER

37
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,652
Say it, come to me.

38
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,206
These cards I hold right now...

39
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,373
are almost shouting out...

40
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,657
for me to show off...

41
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,054
and "flor" and "truco" cry!

42
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:17,049
"Flor", you say?

43
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:19,658
Then I must call and raise...

44
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,015
"Contra-flor"! I win!

45
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,338
Fuck! I want to see them!

46
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,656
Here!

47
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,213
What's this fuckin' saint
doing here?

48
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,890
If the Dead One gets you,
he'll cut your throat.

49
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,849
It's bad luck for me!

50
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,448
Shit!

51
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:48,610
Stupid gaucho!

52
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,892
They've burnt you, Saint...

53
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,092
Old, stupid gaucho...

54
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,371
Shit...

55
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:16,133
Shit! I can't find my "pingo"!

56
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,730
Pissed gaucho...

57
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,564
Torres! You pay what you owe!

58
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:48,210
Where are they?

59
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:49,930
Who?

60
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,085
Aballay, Pig, Dead One!

61
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:54,034
I don't know them.

62
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,819
At La Malaria.

63
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:58,699
But please don't kill me!

64
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,651
I'll work for you,
I'll do whatever you want!

65
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:06,569
I have seven kids.
Please, don't kill me, I'll!

66
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,602
So you're an orphan...

67
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,082
Good morning.

68
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,923
I heard you're looking for
workers.

69
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:42,401
The salary is meager.

70
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:45,798
Meager salary, a roof and food?

71
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,641
That will do.

72
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,361
Julian Erralde

73
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,045
Benavides, at your service.

74
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:02,205
- Where are you from?
- The city of Buenos Aires.

75
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,999
"Negro"! Come help the man.

76
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,401
Please, don't... It's OK.

77
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,520
Thanks.

78
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:39,392
Pig!

79
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,994
Good morning

80
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,357
Morales!

81
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,471
Morales!

82
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:22,754
Nice animals, Morales...

83
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,472
I'll take the four of them.

84
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,566
But after paying your taxes

85
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,641
and giving you some animals for free,

86
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:40,075
I need some cash.

87
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,319
I see, this is your job.

88
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,270
And how much for these animals?

89
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,559
They're strong, healthy, well-fed.
At least ten each.

90
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,879
- What the hell do you feed them?
- Boss!

91
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,149
What is it?

92
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,112
Torres's been killed.

93
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,765
And who killed him?

94
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

95
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,956
- Have you seen them?

96
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,559
- What, are you blind?
- I was drunk

97
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,359
So you were drunk!
You fucking asshole!

98
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,634
You were drunk?

99
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,116
Give the animals to him.

100
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,997
What about what we discussed?

101
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:46,195
Heads, you're dead.
Tails, you live.

102
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,993
Hope your lucky streak goes on.

103
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,829
Take him to Lopez's, you asshole!

104
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,194
Mind the steps.

105
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,598
You'll be comfortable here.

106
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,803
This is La Malaria?

107
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:08,717
No, it's near here.
Across the river.

108
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,276
Why do they call you
by a man's name?

109
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:16,112
Careful.

110
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:19,162
- What's your name?

111
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,997
My name is Juana. And yours?

112
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,750
Julian, and yours?

113
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:27,911
Juana...

114
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,956
And yours?

115
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:38,557
Oh, Saint who performs miracles
I know I shouldn't bother you.

116
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:42,321
You look after the Dead and the Living.

117
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:46,456
But Pauper, please,
I have no one else to turn to.

118
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:50,556
I'm calling out for you, asking you
to work a miracle

119
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:53,891
and help him stay alive
and safe from harm.

120
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:57,191
A true miracle,
like the captives faith.

121
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,029
Hi.

122
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:49,150
Come in, boy. Come in.
What are you looking for?

123
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:50,788
Bale wire.

124
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,985
I have something special.

125
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:57,063
This... It's just arrived...

126
00:21:57,394 --> 00:22:01,839
Look at this. Look.
This fabric. Look.

127
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:05,274
This fabric is great.
The curtains you could make with it!

128
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:06,639
This is Jacquard. Look.

129
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:09,665
- I'll give you a discount.
- No. Wire. Bale wire.

130
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:11,318
Wire? Bale wire?

131
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:15,118
I have the best one here,
but it's sold.

132
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:18,393
But I'll get more. Tell me where
you live and I'll have it delivered.

133
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,590
At Don Benavides'.

134
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,753
Don Benavides? Sure.

135
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:27,663
You like scarves?
Take a look at this one.

136
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,991
It's cotton from India.

137
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:34,153
Take it, it'll make
a good present for a young lady.

138
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,111
- It's on the house.
- Thank you.

139
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:38,798
OK. But you know what, dear?

140
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,512
You can't wear those pants
any longer.

141
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,548
No, look at them...

142
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:19,866
Thank you.

143
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:51,418
You like it?

144
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,019
Yes

145
00:26:54,984 --> 00:26:58,693
He's The Pauper, a local Saint.

146
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,820
Nobody knows where he lives,

147
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:05,980
but he keeps appearing.

148
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:12,493
Those who have seen him say
he's always on horse. He lives up there.

149
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:17,613
From there he's cured kids, they say.

150
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:20,481
He helps people.

151
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,420
He's very good.

152
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,861
He performs miracles.

153
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,020
Who carved it?

154
00:27:29,623 --> 00:27:33,059
My godfather, from Cordoba.

155
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,867
He's a good person.

156
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:37,733
He lives near the river.

157
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,820
He used to live with Clarisa,
a friend of mine.

158
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:45,740
But she kicked him out because...

159
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:49,298
he drinks a lot.
And she got tired.

160
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:54,978
He's a devotee of the Saint,
so he makes lots of these...

161
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:59,614
Bigger ones, with a long beard,
short beard, another hat...

162
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,139
He has an altar and prays.

163
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:08,219
I'm also a devotee.

164
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,216
Kiss him, he'll bring you good luck.

165
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:31,607
- You're wrong, Boss.
- Why?

166
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,213
Why are you so happy?

167
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,255
It's an albino pig.

168
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:02,729
It's still a baby.
It's 20 days old, but...

169
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:05,889
It'll be white forever.

170
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,495
Does it have a name?

171
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:12,257
- Ramon. Do you like it?
- Yes.

172
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,612
- Sounds nice. Ramon.

173
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:18,654
When I call it, it'll come.

174
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:20,142
- Juana...
- Yes?

175
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:21,769
Let me make a portrait of you.

176
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,614
- A portrait?
- Yes

177
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,177
What's a portrait?

178
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:28,610
A drawing.

179
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:30,455
Oh, a drawing.

180
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,415
Why?

181
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:36,449
To remember you.

182
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,007
Are you leaving?

183
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:43,654
No. Because I like drawing.

184
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:47,172
Just because you like it...

185
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,806
- With Ramon?
- Of course.

186
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,165
OK.

187
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:53,811
Excuse me.

188
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:01,293
He'll make a portrait of us,
Ramon.

189
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:03,008
Smile.

190
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:13,887
Pig, go get Benavides.

191
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:25,883
Good morning.

192
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,285
Good morning.

193
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:31,446
Here's a present for you
to wear tonight.

194
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,044
- Nice day, isn't it?

195
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:39,524
- Yes.

196
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:44,847
- Nice...

197
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:49,369
Hello.

198
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,251
Commander Frutos,
La Malaria's Judge of the Peace.

199
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:01,043
And who are you?

200
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,884
I asked what your name was!

201
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,044
Julian Erralde.

202
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:24,086
Mr. Erralde is working for us

203
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:30,012
And how long are you staying?

204
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,889
Not long.

205
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:39,492
That's OK. People from big cities
are not good at field chores.

206
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:43,451
Come here, Pig!
Here's a son of yours!

207
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:47,329
Ramon... Easy...

208
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:54,086
You can prepare it
for the feast tonight.

209
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,206
And you, Juana, get ready.

210
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,561
I'll send for you tonight.

211
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:13,322
Sure. Here's the money.

212
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:20,807
What business do you have
with these people?

213
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,082
Come, Pig! We have to prepare
the party for tonight!

214
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:29,973
I see you in the light of dusk

215
00:34:30,008 --> 00:34:34,081
walking with your girl, and I'm behind.

216
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:45,373
I don't know where you're from
or what your name is,

217
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:49,288
I bark at you for a while,
but you don't even look at me.

218
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:53,093
I dream that you come and get me,

219
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:57,325
we get stuck together, then we go to sleep.

220
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:11,447
In the light of dusk I watch you go by

221
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:15,527
I return home alone, then I start to bark.

222
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,485
Music man, stop the music!

223
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:24,286
You all know our sacred values:

224
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:30,842
God, our Nation and our families.

225
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:35,125
So I've gathered you here today

226
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:40,316
to leave my path of sins

227
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,964
and tell you that

228
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,083
I'm getting married.

229
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,211
Cheers!

230
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:53,316
Cheers, Commander!

231
00:35:55,245 --> 00:35:57,884
Long live Commander Frutos.

232
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:22,516
Stop it!

233
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,797
Here's my future bride,
so happy she's almost crying.

234
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:32,922
Let's hear it for her,
poor thing!

235
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,324
Bring her to me, Vargas!

236
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,201
Come here, girl!

237
00:36:52,204 --> 00:36:55,088
We'll continue with the ceremony.

238
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:58,672
The religious one
will take place some other day.

239
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:02,323
You don't like the ceremony, baby?

240
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,837
What a pity, darling!

241
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:11,352
Grab her!

242
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,958
Now we'll have this one.

243
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:23,353
This is the real ceremony.

244
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:29,272
Dead One!

245
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,237
Let her go!

246
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,516
Oh, we have a guest.

247
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,957
What's wrong with you?
You fallen in love with her?

248
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:53,718
I'll show you
who's mounting this mare!

249
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,840
A fucking gaucho roulette!

250
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,765
Musicians...

251
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,155
We need some music!

252
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,032
Where is he?

253
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,468
Where is he?

254
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,629
Where are you? I'll find you...

255
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,957
Where is he? Maybe here,
maybe there...

256
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,758
I don't know, but I'll find you.
I'll find you.

257
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,564
Where are you?

258
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,877
Where's the big city guy!

259
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,630
Where are you?

260
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,353
Where are you?!

261
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,754
Let's see...

262
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,022
Go, go!

263
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:22,577
The Dead One's responsible,
Godfather.

264
00:44:26,908 --> 00:44:28,785
Do you think he'll be OK?

265
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:36,344
He's hurt. If you don't
take care of him, he'll be blind.

266
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,705
Fuck! Shit!

267
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:44,939
I'm sorry I got you involved
in this, Godfather.

268
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:50,899
Dear, you know I curse just because.

269
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:56,097
But if in a case like this
you don't ask me for help,

270
00:44:56,547 --> 00:45:01,302
I won't talk to you again.
You understand, "Negro"?

271
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:06,302
We must run away from here.

272
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,583
I'll go get Pastrana.

273
00:45:13,306 --> 00:45:16,184
Take this. Just in case.

274
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,551
Tell The Pauper to be careful.

275
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:27,578
That's a package
stolen from the Dead One.

276
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:04,889
I'm blind.

277
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:09,532
I can't see.

278
00:51:10,094 --> 00:51:13,882
Of course, you really hurt your eyes.

279
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:19,611
Don't touch the bandage.

280
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:22,612
Be patient.

281
00:51:22,974 --> 00:51:24,646
You'll be able to see again.

282
00:51:25,574 --> 00:51:26,927
Who are you?

283
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:22,566
Antonio like your uncle,
the one that's wicked? No.

284
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:25,207
Mariano.

285
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:29,843
No, the female version is better.
I like "Mariana".

286
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:34,377
How about Silvan? Or José?

287
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:39,280
José, like Virgin Mary's husband.

288
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,840
Aballay!

289
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:39,518
What's wrong with you, Aballay?

290
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:42,804
Are those bags too heavy for you?

291
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:48,325
Why don't you give them to me?

292
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:51,839
Come here, girl. You're pretty.

293
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:56,237
Get down here!
You want to pray?

294
00:54:56,447 --> 00:54:57,766
Pray, you asshole!

295
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:01,077
Aballay, what shall
we do with them?

296
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:04,491
Do you believe in God?

297
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:06,357
Tell him the Dead One sends his regards.

298
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,570
Come here!

299
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:51,799
Kill him, Dead One!

300
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:00,881
You son of a bitch!

301
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:07,162
Son of a bitch!

302
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:08,919
Take this!

303
00:56:09,124 --> 00:56:10,273
Take this!

304
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:29,952
After me, somebody
more powerful will come.

305
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:35,606
I'm not worthy
to untie His sandals.

306
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:41,477
When He comes, deserts will
open up and lilies will bloom.

307
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:47,671
Meanwhile, let's celebrate the Virgin
with the words of the prophet.

308
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:56,159
Praise the Lord! It is possible
to wash away your sins...

309
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:59,805
...and the pain caused by them.

310
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,516
But nothing is possible
without a sacrifice.

311
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,390
Simeon the Elder,

312
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,598
the first stylite,

313
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:15,477
redeemed his sins

314
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,396
and withdrew from the Earth
where he had sinned

315
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,076
by staying on pillars in the desert
and never coming down,

316
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,996
so that he could be closer to God.

317
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:34,599
He would endure freezing weather
and the boiling sun, night and day.

318
00:58:34,634 --> 00:58:39,764
After spending decades on a pillar,

319
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:44,031
the Lord, who knew
about his sacrifices, said:

320
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,604
"This is a fearless man,

321
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:51,699
deaf to the debauchery of the winds,

322
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:55,759
whose body feeds from Heaven's bread

323
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:59,363
and Heaven's wine."

324
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:04,998
Rejoice, since he who
approaches God and is remorseful

325
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:09,958
will receive God's mercy
and be forgiven,

326
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:14,283
like those brave stylites.

327
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:20,917
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

328
00:59:24,638 --> 00:59:26,549
Amen.

329
00:59:29,477 --> 00:59:31,229
Amen.

330
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,793
I was born in your valleys,
I'm made of stone and sand.

331
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:41,353
I was born in the woods,
I was raised in stony ground.

332
00:59:41,837 --> 00:59:45,796
And calandra larks and thrushes
used to sing to me.

333
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:52,857
I was born in your valleys,

334
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:59,081
I'm made of stone and sand.

335
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:07,433
And calandra larks and
thrushes used to sing to me.

336
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:15,072
And calandra larks and
thrushes used to sing to me.

337
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:23,628
I'll see those birds again.

338
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:33,746
Father, I'd like to know
about the saints you talked about.

339
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:39,193
I said that they lived in sanctity.

340
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:42,910
They were anchorites, or hermits.

341
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,313
Didn't you say something else?

342
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:50,193
Something else?

343
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:53,269
Stylites, maybe?

344
01:00:54,915 --> 01:00:56,666
It's the same.

345
01:00:57,234 --> 01:01:00,226
Stylites were a special
type of anchorites.

346
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:03,679
Anchorites were solitary people.

347
01:01:03,714 --> 01:01:06,626
They would willingly withdraw
from other people.

348
01:01:07,554 --> 01:01:13,345
They would inhabit caves
or live on a mountain top.

349
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:14,827
What for?

350
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:17,509
To serve God in their own way.

351
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:19,639
You said they were on top of...

352
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:24,594
On top of pillars or columns.
Those were stylites.

353
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:26,265
And there they stayed...

354
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:31,104
through cold or hot weather,
whether they were sick or hungry...

355
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:32,702
How long?

356
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:37,789
For eternity! Simeon the Elder
spent almost 37 years like that.

357
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,103
Simeon the Younger, 70 years.

358
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:48,432
So, what do you think now
of their sacrifice?

359
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:51,469
Could you imagine such a thing?

360
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,397
And how did they eat?

361
01:01:55,432 --> 01:01:58,469
Uncomfortably. Bugs, mice...

362
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:03,072
Sometimes sad people or believers
would go on a pilgrimage

363
01:02:03,107 --> 01:02:06,303
to ask them
to ask God to help them.

364
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:09,437
You said they used to...

365
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:11,747
Show repentance and meditate.

366
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,277
Why did they show repentance?

367
01:02:14,312 --> 01:02:17,110
To relieve the pain
caused by their sins.

368
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:23,062
Stylites would stay on pillars
to get closer to Heaven

369
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:27,902
and to withdraw from the Earth,
since that was where they had sinned.

370
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,467
Will you bear with me, brother?

371
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,581
Will you bear with me?

372
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,588
It's forever.

373
01:05:39,305 --> 01:05:41,261
Are you always on a horse?

374
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,616
Always.

375
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:47,261
Do you sleep on it as well?

376
01:05:48,665 --> 01:05:50,222
I do.

377
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:56,509
So you're The Pauper.
People pray to you.

378
01:05:56,544 --> 01:06:00,253
That's just a belief.
I'm just riding my horse.

379
01:06:01,464 --> 01:06:03,341
And why don't you get off it?

380
01:06:09,504 --> 01:06:11,062
What's the matter, my friend?

381
01:06:13,264 --> 01:06:16,017
There are still people
I have to kill.

382
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:19,822
And that's terrible.

383
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:24,376
What comes afterwards...

384
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:28,137
...is even worse.

385
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:17,693
My wife has returned.

386
01:09:20,097 --> 01:09:21,974
Thank you so much, friend!

387
01:09:25,577 --> 01:09:27,135
Where's the city guy?

388
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:31,651
The Earth has eaten him...
Didn't even spit his heart!

389
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:07,736
Did you miss your daddy?
Won't you give him a kiss?

390
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:09,931
Come on, kiss your daddy!

391
01:10:10,496 --> 01:10:14,576
Kiss your daddy, kiss your daddy!

392
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:18,454
Come on, kiss him!

393
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:31,292
Where's that handsome boy?

394
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:38,495
You've stolen him from me,
so you'll give him back to me.

395
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,723
Understand?

396
01:15:02,726 --> 01:15:03,875
There he is!

397
01:15:04,926 --> 01:15:07,884
Get him! Don't let him escape!

398
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:13,841
Get him!

399
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:23,834
Oh, Saint who performs miracles.
I know I shouldn't bother you.

400
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:28,038
You look after the Dead and the Living.

401
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:30,650
But Pauper, please,

402
01:15:30,685 --> 01:15:32,810
I have no one else to turn to.

403
01:15:32,845 --> 01:15:37,325
I'm calling out for you, asking you
to work a miracle and help him stay alive.

404
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,600
A final miracle that finds him safe from harm.

405
01:16:59,562 --> 01:17:01,359
Pretty boy!

406
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:06,560
Don't you want some meat?

407
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:31,678
City guy!

408
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:39,634
Don't worry if you have loose teeth,
the meat's already been chewed!

409
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:07,513
Dead One!

410
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:10,633
I brought you a present.

411
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:20,549
Is that Aballay?

412
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:31,517
Let Juana go,
and the Saint is yours.

413
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,197
Aballay is the Saint?

414
01:18:40,998 --> 01:18:43,990
What a surprise!

415
01:18:45,838 --> 01:18:47,032
Vargas!

416
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:02,989
Drop your gun! And the man!

417
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,745
I'm getting nervous.

418
01:20:06,275 --> 01:20:08,425
You stinking city boy!

419
01:23:43,788 --> 01:23:45,699
What is it, Julián?

420
01:23:53,788 --> 01:23:54,857
I'm leaving.

421
01:23:58,748 --> 01:24:00,260
You're leaving?

422
01:24:03,027 --> 01:24:05,018
- I thought...
- I have to go.

423
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:16,426
I know.

424
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:20,464
It's because of the Dead One.

425
01:24:24,107 --> 01:24:28,066
It's because I've been with him,
that son of a bitch...

426
01:24:30,026 --> 01:24:31,584
I'm dirty...

427
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:34,781
- It's that.
- No, you're not.

428
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,735
It's me.

429
01:24:44,186 --> 01:24:45,221
I'm poisoned.

430
01:24:47,706 --> 01:24:51,255
I've spent my whole life thinking of
avenging my father's death.

431
01:24:54,026 --> 01:24:56,017
But you've killed all of them.

432
01:24:59,185 --> 01:25:00,174
Not all of them.

433
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:04,776
The worst one is alive.

434
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:08,420
Who?

435
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:14,460
The Pauper.

436
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,024
The Pauper?

437
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:24,821
What are you saying, Julian?

438
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,655
The Pauper saved your life.

439
01:25:28,864 --> 01:25:30,939
He is a saint, Julian.

440
01:25:30,974 --> 01:25:33,015
You can't kill a saint.

441
01:25:34,624 --> 01:25:36,854
You can't, Julian!

442
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:43,382
Don't do it.

443
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:50,297
Stay with me.

444
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,059
Get down!

445
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,292
No. You know I can't get down.

446
01:29:37,576 --> 01:29:39,692
I had to do it.
