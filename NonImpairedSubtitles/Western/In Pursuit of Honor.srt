1
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,784
IN PURSUIT OF HONOR

2
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,915
The climax of the Bonus
Army's two-month siege...

3
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,052
...Is rapidly developing in the
shadow of our nation's capital.

4
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,858
Since early June,
nearly 18,000 veterans...

5
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:56,058
...of the Great War of 1917,
many homeless and starving...

6
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:59,697
...have been camped with their
families on Anacostia Flats...

7
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,004
...demanding payment of their
promised soldiers' bonus.

8
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,810
Today, one policeman and one
Bonus Marcher were killed...

9
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:08,972
...In skirmishes with local police...

10
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,882
...prompting President Hoover
to order the U. S. Army...

11
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:14,352
...under the leadership
of General MacArthur...

12
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,013
...to remove the veterans.

13
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:20,753
Fifteen hundred federal troops. a
combined force of Infantry, cavalry...

14
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,852
...and the newly-formed
armor division...

15
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:27,559
...have responded to the President's call
to put an end to the veterans' rebellion.

16
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,338
General, any thoughts about
gong against former soldiers?

17
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:37,703
Watch me.

18
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,676
We want what's coming to us.

19
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,787
WE DEMAND IMMEDIATE
PAYMENT OF THE BONUS

20
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,358
Regimental Sergeant,
break out the colors!

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,331
Major Hardesty, sir, I think
they know what army it is.

22
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:09,237
Do as ordered without
insubordination, Sgt. Libbey.

23
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,202
Break out the colors!

24
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,849
In line right and halt!

25
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:36,993
Draw!

26
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,064
Sabers!

27
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,529
I gave an order, Sergeant.

28
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,833
Your order goes
against my conscience.

29
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,929
These men served with us in France.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,970
They're only asking for
what they were promised.

31
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,547
This is mutiny, Sgt. Libbey.

32
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,786
You're under arrest, mister.

33
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,718
You and these men, return to post.

34
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,723
Under your own recognizance.

35
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,451
Advance!

36
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,878
The attack Is on. General
MacArthur Is In command.

37
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,925
The Army of the United States
Is attacking Its own veterans|

38
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,926
Their camps are being destroyed|

39
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,826
This Is a national disgrace...

40
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,023
...one of our country's
darkest hours...

41
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,525
TEXAS

42
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:53,659
Damn it.

43
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,090
Are you okay?

44
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,931
What do you think you're doing?

45
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,095
I was walking.

46
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,901
The roads are for automobiles!

47
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,271
Yeah, if you got one.

48
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:06,140
You look okay to me.

49
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,421
Where are you headed?

50
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,327
Down to the border.

51
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,930
Get in the car!

52
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,357
What?

53
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:34,038
I said, "Get in the car," idiot!

54
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,807
There's a dust storm.

55
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,249
Much obliged.

56
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,222
Marsh Buxton, ma'am.

57
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,652
Only my good friends
call me an idiot.

58
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,226
Jessica Stuart, and I'm
not your good friend.

59
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:43,499
Kinda takes your
breath away, doesn't it?

60
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,179
Cowboy soldier.

61
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,116
I should've guessed.

62
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,388
Excuse me.

63
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:12,469
Sir! Bachelor officers'
quarters are the last building...

64
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,066
...at the left side of the drill
field. Regimental HQ is in front of us.

65
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,603
Thank you, Private.

66
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,041
About the woman, sir.

67
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:22,009
Lady friends are off-limits
at this time, sir.

68
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,009
With all due respect...

69
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:25,841
...she isn't my friend.

70
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,285
I'm Jessica Stuart, Private.

71
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,117
Stuart? As in Colonel Stuart, ma'am?

72
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:37,957
Holy Moses!

73
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,393
The commanding officer's daughter?

74
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,226
Kinda takes your
breath away, doesn't it?

75
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:10,529
Let's see, you were fourth
in your class at West Point...

76
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:13,229
...you speak three languages...

77
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,960
...and according to this, you're
just about expert in everything.

78
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:22,135
I don't understand something. Why
would they take a man so special...

79
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,542
...and waste him, send him out
to a godforsaken place like this?

80
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,841
I don't...

81
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,210
Now I understand!

82
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,446
Listen!

83
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,657
Maybe you'd like to enlighten me...

84
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,819
...as to this incident here...

85
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:48,300
...of you striking an
officer at your last post.

86
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,196
It was a soldier's fight, sir.

87
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,068
He was abusing his horse...

88
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:54,835
...and I stopped him.

89
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,003
Did you win?

90
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:00,409
Yes, sir, I did.

91
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,711
Let me ask you a question.

92
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,485
You have trouble with authority?

93
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,780
Yes, sir.

94
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,355
You'll have no trouble
with authority here.

95
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,397
Let me explain that
to you, all right!

96
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:21,325
The cavalry's in enough
trouble now. Discipline...

97
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,563
...is critical to our morale...

98
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,833
...and essential for survival,
yours and mine, understood?

99
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,568
You'll carry out your orders
and you'll do them smartly.

100
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:33,772
And if there's one iota of
insubordination in your eyes...

101
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,807
...you'll face charges!

102
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,775
-Am I understood?
-Yes, sir.

103
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,849
-Can't hear you.
-Yes, sir!

104
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:42,821
That's much better.

105
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,447
Okay.

106
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:53,055
Now, since you're
attached to the 12th...

107
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:58,229
...and I had the honor of
serving with your father...

108
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,870
...I'm gonna have Sgt. Rutherford...

109
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,443
...amend your records.

110
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,541
Then, you'll be able to
start here with a clean slate.

111
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,211
Thank you, sir.

112
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:18,713
Dismissed.

113
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,240
Jessica.

114
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,112
Father.

115
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,559
Back, back...

116
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,549
'Evening, Mr. Quinlain.

117
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,146
'Afternoon, Top.

118
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:26,718
You got that stud
working for you good, Tom.

119
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:28,119
He's coming along.

120
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:30,584
Hello, Ahab.

121
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,165
-'Afternoon, sir.
-Gentlemen.

122
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:45,669
-Master Sergeant Libbey.
-Marshall Buxton.

123
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:49,210
May I present Sgts.
Quinlain and Mulcahey?

124
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,647
-Pleasure, sir.
-It's an honor, sir.

125
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,310
I've been assigned officer in
charge of remounts and stables.

126
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:59,324
Regulations call for a
quartet of horses for each man.

127
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,120
These all the horses we have?

128
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:03,995
There's a few more.

129
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:06,795
Sgt. Quinlain, sound the recall.

130
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,524
They're still grazing, sir.

131
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,200
By any chance, would you be...

132
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,174
...related to a Thomas Buxton, sir?

133
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:19,670
He was my father.

134
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,644
May I say, sir, that he was
one hell of a fine horseman.

135
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,241
The best, sir.

136
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:26,609
God love him.

137
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:29,748
Seems like everyone in
the cavalry knew him.

138
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,752
We wasted the better part of our
youth in the Mexican campaign.

139
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:37,990
Wasted? Hell, they got the Medal
of Honor at the same ceremony.

140
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,291
It was a sight to behold, sir.

141
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,462
What are you doin' here?

142
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,002
It's a long story
about a quick decision.

143
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,558
An old cavalry trick, sir.

144
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,854
A soldier got separated
from his mount...

145
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,625
...a bugle call would bring
him back, on the double.

146
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,097
Goddamn it, Quinlain! Is
this some kind of a joke?

147
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:23,634
Sgt. Shattuck...

148
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,705
...can I introduce Lt. Buxton?

149
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,582
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, sir.

150
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,642
Every officer can choose
his own mount, sir.

151
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,482
But personally...

152
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,313
...I favor that sorrel mare.

153
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,313
Hey, get a load of this!

154
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,382
What's going on here?

155
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,031
Not Hardesty.

156
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,049
John.

157
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,242
Owen.

158
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,780
This is a surprise.

159
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,719
They didn't tell me
it was gonna be you.

160
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,524
I wasn't notified until
10 days ago, myself.

161
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,334
This is my ADC, Major Forrest.

162
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,499
I'd like to be shown
to my quarters now.

163
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,302
I'll take formal command
at 09:00 tomorrow morning.

164
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:22,518
So, that's the future.

165
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,458
I feel like an idiot.

166
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,227
I don't think I've ever
seen you out of uniform.

167
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,326
I haven't worn one of these...

168
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:08,592
...in years.

169
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:10,799
You look handsome.

170
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,269
Darling, I am a soldier...

171
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,575
...and it hurts me that you...

172
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,371
...disapprove of it.

173
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,846
I don't disapprove of
you, I'm proud of you.

174
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:31,020
Sure, because I'm out of uniform.

175
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,282
I don't hate the Army.

176
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,892
It's the systematic
stupidity of it that galls me.

177
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:42,563
I'm glad you write
for the newspapers...

178
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:46,101
...'cause you got enough opinions...

179
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,697
...to choke a horse.

180
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:13,787
Sir!

181
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:22,635
You don't have to do that,
I'm not in the Army anymore.

182
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,582
Sir, we'd like you to have
the Villista standard...

183
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,481
...that we captured at Carrizal.

184
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,078
But I wasn't there...

185
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,123
...I was at Guerrero.

186
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:43,784
Yes, sir...

187
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,656
...and if you hadn't
been at Guerrero...

188
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:50,524
...not a man in our unit would've
walked out of Carrizal alive.

189
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,060
Sir.

190
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,414
It's been an honor, sir.

191
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:12,646
Thank you.

192
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:38,438
Miss Stuart.

193
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,875
Colonel.

194
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:41,817
Goodbye, sir.

195
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,782
If you're ever down
Tucson way, drop in...

196
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,257
...and say hello
to an old war-horse.

197
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,260
Thank you, sir, I will.

198
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,390
Stay out of the brig, Mr. Buxton.

199
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:54,095
I'll do my best, Miss Stuart.

200
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:11,738
Gentlemen...

201
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,577
...in compliance with
War Department orders...

202
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:19,215
...the 12th Cavalry is to be
incorporated with the 23rd Infantry.

203
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,792
I'll expect utmost cooperation
from all officers and men.

204
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,062
I will brook no slackness
within my command.

205
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:33,799
Additionally, by Special Order
AG 474.71: "Subject: Salary.

206
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,732
"Salaries to all enlisted
personnel, including officers...

207
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,210
"... shall be reduced
15 percent, henceforth.

208
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,617
"Special Order AG
474.72: Subject: Saber.

209
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:51,244
"The saber is discontinued as an
item of issue to the cavalry. "

210
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,455
Finally...

211
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:02,824
...it has been directed by Chief
of Staff General MacArthur...

212
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,899
...that in these times of
increasing economic hardship...

213
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,100
...the cavalry is to
dispose of excess horses.

214
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:13,040
With the cooperation of
the Mexican government...

215
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,672
...these remounts will be
driven across the border...

216
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:19,707
...to be thereby disposed
of, two days hence.

217
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:27,349
Lt. Buxton, you will be
in charge of this exercise.

218
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,791
Details will be worked
out with Sgt. Gruber.

219
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,459
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

220
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,336
Army is the whipping boy of Congress.

221
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,440
Our supporters are either
in insane asylums...

222
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,937
...or the movies.

223
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,781
Major Forrest, dismiss them.

224
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,181
Ten-hut!

225
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:00,286
Dismissed!

226
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:01,522
Sir!

227
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,457
I request permission to be
excused from this detail, sir.

228
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:07,021
Request denied.

229
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,064
Sir!

230
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:15,631
I cannot, in good conscience,
be part of it, sir.

231
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,069
Cannot?

232
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:22,508
You'll do as ordered, mister, or
face a goddamned court-martial!

233
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:24,975
Your conscience be damned!

234
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,913
May I see your written orders?

235
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,114
-You may not.
-Is there a written order, sir?

236
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,787
You're insubordinate.

237
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:35,582
Dismissed.

238
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,759
Hand it in, son.

239
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,712
Mr. Buxton! Lieutenant!

240
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,848
Better come quick, sir. It's Libbey.

241
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:29,939
Sergeant!

242
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:33,139
Sir!

243
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:35,445
Beg pardon, sir.

244
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:39,716
Go straight to hell.

245
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,442
You go to hell.

246
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:12,644
I'm already there.

247
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,585
There's nothing left.

248
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:22,258
No horses.

249
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,595
No cavalry.

250
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,995
No honor.

251
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,370
Goddamn it.

252
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,081
I hate what this world's becoming.

253
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:47,880
So do I.

254
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,637
Sergeant...

255
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,751
...carry on.

256
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,161
They should've been
here by now, Sergeant.

257
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:05,821
Just a couple of minutes, sir.

258
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:07,387
Have these men fall back.

259
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,621
506 remounts, as
requested and ordered, sir.

260
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,890
May I remind you, we're
soldiers, not cowboys.

261
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:49,265
Cowboys use lariats, Mr.
Buxton, soldiers utilize crops.

262
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,528
500 head are a lot to handle, sir.

263
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:57,699
The pit can handle
only 100 at a time.

264
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,108
Instruct your men to divide
them up and bring them in order.

265
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,209
Yes, sir.

266
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,945
Sgt. Gruber, prepare your men.

267
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,056
I'm not happy about this, Sergeant.

268
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,359
No, sir.

269
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,996
But then, we're cavalry,
you're artillery.

270
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:28,538
There was a time when
artillery depended on horses.

271
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:32,575
And they were properly
retired to Fort Sill.

272
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:34,669
They weren't murdered.

273
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,248
I won't bandy words with you.

274
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,209
Carry on.

275
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:52,524
Let's cut out 100 of them and
drive 'em down into the pit!

276
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:57,587
I hate to see this.

277
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:07,402
Platoon, lock and load.

278
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,295
Ready.

279
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,594
Take aim!

280
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:44,203
Fire!

281
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,742
God help us.

282
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:30,352
-We never even killed the enemy
like that. -Shut up, Tom.

283
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:32,113
We gotta do something.

284
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,023
Like what? You got general
stars on your collar?

285
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:02,314
Finish it, Sergeant.

286
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,790
1st Platoon, pick your
targets and fire at will.

287
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,694
This ain't right, Top.

288
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,000
We can stop it, before
they shoot any more.

289
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:26,601
Stop it, sir?

290
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:27,909
How?

291
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,344
By moving the remainder
of the horses to safety.

292
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:32,747
Are you suggesting we steal the herd?

293
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:37,149
I suggest we take them into
custody before they murder any more.

294
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,145
Take 'em where?

295
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,355
Away from those guns.

296
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,786
Goddamn it, I love those horses,
but this smacks of insanity, sir.

297
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,024
That's insanity.

298
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,265
I suggest you decide now, Lieutenant.

299
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,775
Let's go. Tom!

300
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:11,879
Watch it!

301
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:26,229
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

302
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,862
Saving the rest of the remounts.

303
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:29,530
-This is mutiny!
-No, sir!

304
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,975
A cavalryman's first
duty is to his horses.

305
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:33,940
Regulations specifically forbid...

306
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:37,104
...endangering their lives
outside of enemy engagement.

307
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,275
This expedition is an illegal
act by the War Department.

308
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:42,042
Illegal act?

309
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,644
Yes! Have you seen written orders?

310
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:46,722
As remounts officer,
you're in charge of this!

311
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,758
I command the infantry.

312
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:51,289
It's also my belief, since
I've seen no written orders.

313
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:53,554
I believe my first
duty is to the horses.

314
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:55,756
Lt. Buxton, you've lost your wits.

315
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:56,956
Yes, sir.

316
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,866
Cut loose the machine guns now.

317
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:00,871
-No, sir!
-Sergeant!

318
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:03,464
Have your men take
possession of those guns!

319
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,481
Damn it, Jack, don't do this!

320
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:16,110
Now, we'll take possession
of the remounts, sir.

321
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:17,782
This'll mean Leavenworth.

322
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:21,920
I will await the results
of the court-martial, sir.

323
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:37,932
They have to be stopped!

324
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,101
Any suggestions as to how, sir?

325
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,609
Arrest them, damn it!

326
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,512
I doubt they'll submit,
not without a fight.

327
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,649
I've known Jack Libbey 20 years.

328
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,982
Not a man I'd care to tangle with.

329
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,453
Damn them!

330
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:52,578
Yes, sir.

331
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,076
And you just let them go?

332
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,683
Begging the Colonel's
pardon, we thought it was...

333
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:25,616
I'll remind you, Major, we're
under War Department orders!

334
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,556
Where are they now?

335
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,597
They could be anywhere, but
I think they'll held north.

336
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,667
North!

337
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:40,036
North indicates a vast area, Major.

338
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,238
North is all of America!

339
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:47,742
Sergeant.

340
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,483
Cable the details of this fiasco to the
War Department requesting instructions.

341
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:57,910
Major.

342
00:37:58,189 --> 00:38:00,020
Assemble the regiment.

343
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,184
I want "B" Troop patrolling
the Mexican border.

344
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,726
The mechanized column
will move north.

345
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,926
I want those men taken.

346
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,166
I want their hides framed
and hanging on my wall!

347
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:11,223
Yes, sir.

348
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,361
May I speak, sir?

349
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:15,938
Be concise and
constructive, Sergeant!

350
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:18,308
There's a lot of open
country out there.

351
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:21,378
They know how to move quietly
and cover their tracks.

352
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:24,681
Four hundred horses
aren't easy to hide.

353
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,515
No, sir, but there's desert
and canyonland to the north...

354
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,621
...and not many paved roads.

355
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:33,014
So, your vehicles will be worthless.

356
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:35,853
My vehicles will do
quite well, mister.

357
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:41,522
They'll transport a squadron of your fine
troopers to within striking distance...

358
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,461
...and you'll effect the
capture of the renegades.

359
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:46,993
Yes, sir.

360
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:53,935
Colonel.

361
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,816
If they refuse to
surrender, then shoot them.

362
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,707
The genie's out of the bottle, sir...

363
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:00,942
...we don't have the cork.

364
00:40:01,446 --> 00:40:02,777
What now?

365
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:06,915
Tell you the truth,
Sergeant, I haven't a notion.

366
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:11,983
What insane hell have
we gotten ourselves into?

367
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:13,484
Trouble?

368
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,788
We've gotten ourselves
into a lot of trouble.

369
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:20,953
Sir.

370
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,400
Col. Hardesty is
bound to come after us.

371
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,025
And soon.

372
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,934
Head north by northwest.

373
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:34,408
Meet me at a place called
Broken Hill. You know the spot?

374
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,906
I do indeed, sir.

375
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:38,506
And you?

376
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:44,353
If I ride hard, I can
make Tucson by tonight.

377
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,559
I'll catch up with
you sometime tomorrow.

378
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,930
Well, now.

379
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,825
We're out here, on our own, no plan.

380
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:01,765
An officer that couldn't
lead flies to shit.

381
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,831
And Shawn here says, "Well,
now... " like a priest.

382
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,840
That's one scared little lieutenant.

383
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,909
Let's not count him out...

384
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:17,815
...yet.

385
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,186
It's the tread. This
tank's not going anywhere!

386
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:26,558
Move it!

387
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,668
I need to speak with your father.

388
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:07,898
Oh, God Almighty!

389
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,500
The Army has gone mad.

390
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,643
So, then, you and your men...

391
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:22,177
...you conspired to mutiny.

392
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:25,221
There were no written orders.
I don't consider it mutiny.

393
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,525
May I remind you that you are
an officer in the U. S. Army.

394
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,686
You have taken an
oath to obey orders...

395
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:33,025
...whether they're written or not!

396
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:39,526
Sir.

397
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,799
Gen. MacArthur has decided
that the cavalry is obsolete.

398
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,943
He may be right, I do not know.

399
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:49,305
When they muster the troops, they
thank them and wish them well.

400
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,645
They don't march them behind
the barracks and shoot them.

401
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,616
The cavalry is men and horses.

402
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,514
We have a tradition, and
a duty to protect them.

403
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:04,656
They fight and die beside us,
they deserve the same respect...

404
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,855
...and the same honor.

405
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:12,096
Well...

406
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:17,700
...it's a point of honor, all right.

407
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,081
Given the situation...

408
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,512
...if I was in your position...

409
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,389
...I hope to God I could do the same.

410
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:37,588
Stop gaping, woman!

411
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,761
Now, what's your plan?

412
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,932
Well, Hardesty is south.

413
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,869
I thought we might move north.

414
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:54,003
That's not a plan,
that's a direction!

415
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,039
The truth is...

416
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,972
...with all due
respect to the Army...

417
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:02,346
...nothing at the Point
prepared me for this.

418
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,481
I don't know what
rules apply anymore.

419
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:08,616
I was hoping...

420
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:10,851
...that you could help me.

421
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,227
I don't know what to do, sir.

422
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:20,768
First of all, sit down.

423
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,979
You've fallen out of the
fold, that's for sure.

424
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,713
The War Department will
give you little mercy.

425
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,844
Gen. Douglas MacArthur
will give you none!

426
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:39,716
Now, you have to make a choice.

427
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,985
You can either fall
back, or go forward.

428
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,155
Back is wrong, sir.

429
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:47,019
There you are.

430
00:44:47,798 --> 00:44:51,894
That's your first,
willful conscious decision.

431
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:54,296
And that's what makes a leader.

432
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:01,176
-You got a map?
-No, I haven't, sir.

433
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:13,947
Here you are...

434
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,424
...one map...

435
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,659
...one compass...

436
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:20,429
...and that's about
all the help you'll get.

437
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,598
-Thank you, sir.
-Another thing.

438
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,393
Listen to Sgt. Libbey,
he's a hell of a soldier.

439
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:28,904
I will, sir.

440
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:30,874
Lieutenant.

441
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:34,742
Good luck.

442
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:38,379
Thank you.

443
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:52,925
You're a damn boy scout, aren't you?

444
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,396
What do you mean?

445
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,331
Stealing 400 horses from
the Army to save them.

446
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,801
You're out of your mind.

447
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:05,472
I don't exactly consider it stealing.

448
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,641
They were about to be destroyed.

449
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,541
I wish you luck, Lieutenant.

450
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:17,181
Thank you.

451
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,318
You'll need it.

452
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:37,131
You could've been more generous.

453
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:39,569
I gave him the best advice I could.

454
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:42,168
You gave him a map,
and sent him on his way.

455
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,473
-What'd you want me to do, join him?
-I don't know.

456
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:48,182
You can't just leave him out there.

457
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,376
I did everything I could do!

458
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:53,112
You're retired. Not dead.

459
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:59,060
-I know what I can do. -Sure,
you're going to write your article.

460
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,258
You know what'll happen?

461
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:04,127
No publisher in the
country will print it.

462
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:07,227
Gen. MacArthur will see to that.

463
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:09,097
You know MacArthur.

464
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,504
You go to him and
tell him to stop this.

465
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,771
Come on, please, don't be ridiculous.

466
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:16,210
You just go ahead.

467
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,245
You write your article.

468
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:21,843
Let me...

469
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,187
...think about it.

470
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:52,548
Papa, there's lots of horses coming!

471
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,174
In a minute, son. I
have a problem here.

472
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:58,085
Hell's bells, I can't see
through all this steam.

473
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,876
Sure this is the right place, Jack?

474
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,656
It's Broken Hill.

475
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,781
Jack!

476
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:42,622
Shame, he gave up a damn good career.

477
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:46,567
We threw away a damn good
retirement, didn't we?

478
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:56,439
Welcome back, sir.

479
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,939
You seem to know this
country pretty well.

480
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:06,416
My father and I hunted here when
I was a kid, but that's about it.

481
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:08,123
From here north...

482
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,721
...it's guess work, map
work and a whole lot of luck.

483
00:49:11,795 --> 00:49:13,160
North, sir?

484
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:17,691
We've got to keep moving, find
a place to wait out the Army.

485
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,835
That's a bit like
waiting out God, sir.

486
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:22,433
Can't be done.

487
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:26,100
North is either sparse and dry,
or wet and cold this time of year.

488
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:30,343
North's as good a choice as any.

489
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,074
Travel at night, sir?

490
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:40,452
May I suggest that we travel
by day as much as possible.

491
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:42,256
Make better time.

492
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,825
Good, then.

493
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,796
We'll leave in two hours,
if you men are up to it.

494
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,733
We're not that old, sir.
We just look like it.

495
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:04,107
Mulcahey, you and Quinlain and Shattuck
tend to the horses, then get some rest.

496
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:20,128
What do you think Hardesty'll do?

497
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:23,528
I think if he finds us,
he'll try to engage us.

498
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:27,231
I've never been in combat.

499
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:29,631
You have.

500
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,368
-Perhaps you're better qualified...
-Beg your pardon, sir.

501
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:35,036
This is your detail.

502
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:39,582
I hope it doesn't come to
combat, but if it does...

503
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,877
...there's nothing I can tell you that
you won't learn in the first 5 seconds.

504
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,601
Sir, Hardesty's traveling
nearly 30 miles an hour.

505
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:09,168
At that rate, they should
engage them by nightfall.

506
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:11,713
Thank you, ma'am.

507
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:24,183
-Where do you think they are now?
-Probably in the White Mountains.

508
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:26,418
And the Army?

509
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,623
They're probably running around the
mountains looking for a paved road...

510
00:51:31,902 --> 00:51:35,531
...trying to catch 400 horses
they know nothing about.

511
00:51:37,441 --> 00:51:39,500
How long since you
were in Washington?

512
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,140
Washington...

513
00:51:42,913 --> 00:51:46,872
I've been there eight
or nine years ago.

514
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:51,216
The last time I was there...

515
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,516
...I was with your mother.

516
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,691
She loved army life.

517
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,233
But she hated to travel.

518
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:14,077
Mother did not love
the Army. She loved you.

519
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:15,771
Same difference.

520
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:17,210
Big difference.

521
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:20,949
Are we going to go on for
the rest of our lives...

522
00:52:21,018 --> 00:52:22,781
...just butting heads?

523
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:24,916
Probably.

524
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:28,186
You're just like your mother.

525
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,592
No, I'm not.

526
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,194
I'm like you.

527
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:42,127
Hey!

528
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:47,205
I'll tell MacArthur you send
him your love. How's that?

529
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:30,375
Easy.

530
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:33,647
Steady.

531
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:51,364
This is just the damn beginning.

532
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,423
We're pushing them too damn hard.

533
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:50,690
It's hopeless, goddamn it!

534
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,939
I'll let you know when
it's hopeless, Mr. Shattuck!

535
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:59,303
Until then, we're moving
north, hard and fast.

536
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,444
How many more die before that?

537
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:04,446
I don't know. Some will.

538
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:07,248
If you wanna quit, why
don't you quit right now?

539
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:08,614
No, sir.

540
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:16,282
Well done, sir.

541
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:28,335
Damn it, it's going to cost us a day.

542
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,277
Capt. Novadin.

543
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:39,675
Proceed north across the
river with the mounted troop.

544
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,513
Yes, sir. You'll remain here?

545
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:44,581
No. We'll move to the northwest.

546
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:48,188
We'll operate as a pincer,
with the deserters between us.

547
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:51,186
You will locate them,
drive them to us...

548
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:54,858
-... we'll bring this matter to a close.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,599
Major, offload the horses!

550
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:02,767
Get these goddamned
trucks turned around!

551
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,830
Break out the mounts!

552
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:05,932
Yes, sir.

553
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:09,408
Let's turn these trucks around.

554
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:13,210
I need a mechanic. This
goddamn radiator's shot.

555
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:47,946
Fifty miles should take us
just west of Rock Springs.

556
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:50,009
Address the Lieutenant.

557
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:51,776
Sir.

558
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:53,689
Dust, sir.

559
00:56:56,093 --> 00:56:57,924
That's a mounted patrol.

560
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:00,254
They're at least 30 miles off.

561
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:02,297
So much for grazing
the green pastures.

562
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:03,864
Let's get that herd moving.

563
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:05,329
Moving where, sir?

564
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,468
Up there, Mr. Quinlain.

565
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:10,563
We go up there. It's our only choice.

566
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:23,279
You heard him, boys. Let's go.

567
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,958
The General sends his apologies,
but his schedule is full right now.

568
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:38,062
He can't be that busy.

569
00:57:38,535 --> 00:57:40,298
You tell him I'll be back.

570
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:43,673
-I don't...
-Tell him I will be back...

571
00:57:43,774 --> 00:57:47,073
...tomorrow, and the day after
that, and the day after that!

572
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:50,970
I want a word with that man!

573
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:02,121
It's a fascinating story!
Why are you giving it to me?

574
00:58:02,325 --> 00:58:06,625
There isn't a paper in the country willing
to be the first to criticize MacArthur.

575
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,528
So, if I publish photos and
file the story in London...

576
00:58:09,733 --> 00:58:12,531
The press over here
will have to pick it up.

577
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,326
Good boy, Ahab.

578
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,127
Indians!

579
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,665
How many?

580
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,364
A thousand or so.

581
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:57,937
I knew it. Where?

582
01:00:00,277 --> 01:00:01,505
Montana.

583
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:07,750
What are you talking about?

584
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:09,215
The horses.

585
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,113
I don't follow your
thought, Lieutenant.

586
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,352
The Sioux Reserve is right here...

587
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,824
...just below the Canadian border.

588
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,164
There are about 1,000
Indians on a lot of land.

589
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:26,533
They all love horses.

590
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:29,034
It's good grazing country, too.

591
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:32,670
Are you suggesting the cavalry
give its horses to Indians?

592
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,702
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

593
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,845
Don't that beat all?

594
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:39,811
Army'll go in and get 'em back.

595
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,150
That's the beauty of it.

596
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:44,880
By law, they have to be
treated as a separate nation.

597
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:48,113
No federal troops are
allowed on the reservation.

598
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,825
It's a fine plan, sir.

599
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:03,802
It's decided then: Indians.

600
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,334
The Indians riding cavalry mounts...

601
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:09,876
...my granddaddy'd never forgive me.

602
01:01:10,547 --> 01:01:13,311
When you get to hell, don't tell him.

603
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:41,167
Beg pardon, Colonel.

604
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,970
These are my men.

605
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:46,976
You mind if I take a look?

606
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,541
I could get my ass
handed to me for this.

607
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:23,909
They're pushing us,
straight to Hardesty.

608
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:28,649
The main unit will be ahead.

609
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:14,568
Looks like they've
got us all sewn up.

610
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:20,205
Nothing that's sewn,
that can't be unsewn.

611
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:23,002
I just don't see any way around them.

612
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:27,149
Go back to your
cavalry tactics manual.

613
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,845
Genghis Khan knew a trick or two.

614
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:34,313
You know what that means?

615
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:35,914
Yes, sir, I do.

616
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:38,885
Tonight.

617
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:42,991
Lead with the geldings.
That way they won't nicker.

618
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:45,196
No mares, no warnings.

619
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:47,226
Let's get back.

620
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:54,840
-If they're ready and waiting?
-And what if they shoot?

621
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,503
I mean, do we shoot back?

622
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,208
They're not the enemy.

623
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:00,139
Like hell, they're not.

624
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:02,314
It didn't stop them at Anacostia.

625
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:03,942
To them, we're deserters.

626
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:08,153
They're gonna be shootin'
at us. I'm shootin' back.

627
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:09,691
We aren't shootin' back.

628
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:17,265
We just have to break
through, and we're gone.

629
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:21,029
It'll take them time
to regroup and follow.

630
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:24,564
We're in Montana
now, we have a chance.

631
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:42,491
Unload your weapon, James.

632
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:34,538
You hear that? Everybody up!

633
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:37,410
-It's a stampede!
-It's the horses!

634
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:40,271
Get up!

635
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,733
Sons of bitches!

636
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:43,876
-We did it!
-Did you see that camp go down?

637
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:49,348
It's gonna take them
soldiers days to regroup!

638
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:52,753
There's still a mounted
patrol behind us.

639
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:55,018
Now they know where we are.

640
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:58,953
I suggest deliberate
and steady going.

641
01:06:59,162 --> 01:07:01,722
Take no chances and
little forage, sir.

642
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:03,493
All right, Top.

643
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:24,179
Christ Almighty!

644
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:31,485
We'll have to close that
wound or it'll take infection.

645
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:37,063
God!

646
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,053
Ready, Top?

647
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:09,758
Yes, goddamn it, do it.

648
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,514
The General will see you now.

649
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,420
It's been two weeks.

650
01:08:40,963 --> 01:08:42,931
I'm getting calls, Owen.

651
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,591
Calls from a newspaper in London.

652
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:49,761
Today, I even got an inquiry
from the Washington Chronicle.

653
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,169
Rumors are rampant.

654
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,974
The President is asking questions.

655
01:08:55,344 --> 01:08:57,278
I'm to meet with him next week.

656
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:01,477
I hold you and your
daughter responsible.

657
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:05,150
You always did blame somebody
else when your plans failed.

658
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:14,927
I have to battle Congress and Roosevelt
on a daily basis to keep this army alive.

659
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,797
I understand.

660
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:21,069
No, you don't.

661
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:27,943
Hitler's rebuilding the German army.
Last month he met Mussolini in Venice.

662
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:29,836
There's talk of a pact.

663
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,270
C'mon now, it's peace time.

664
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:37,843
The Japanese are
expanding into China.

665
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,721
War is around the corner, Owen.
Modern war, and we're not ready.

666
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:47,294
I have nothing against the horses.

667
01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:49,925
They've outlived their time.

668
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:54,091
They're soldiers to us. They go in
battle with us, they get wounded!

669
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,570
Time and time again,
they've saved our lives!

670
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:59,502
They're not worth what
it costs me to feed them!

671
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,371
The Germans and the
Japanese have tanks.

672
01:10:04,914 --> 01:10:08,475
Good tanks, fine
tanks, in great numbers.

673
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:11,676
We have 12.

674
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:16,221
Twelve tanks in the
entire U. S. Army.

675
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,653
I can't afford a
cavalry we can't use.

676
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,330
What about the men?

677
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:34,842
They're good men, just
trying to do their duty.

678
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:36,941
Put yourself in their shoes!

679
01:10:38,681 --> 01:10:42,242
But then, who would be in mine?

680
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:50,319
No, Owen, these soldiers of yours,
these renegades, will be caught.

681
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,655
They'll face a
general court-martial.

682
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,595
They'll be convicted and
punished appropriately.

683
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:58,327
The horses will be
destroyed as I have ordered.

684
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:03,729
This is a time of a great
depression. The people need heroes...

685
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:04,863
No!

686
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:09,541
God help you when the public finds out
about your actions! They'll devour you!

687
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:15,673
Even if they could, they wouldn't.

688
01:11:17,787 --> 01:11:19,914
I'm General Douglas MacArthur.

689
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:25,383
The country needs
me, and they know it.

690
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:31,789
You're dismissed.

691
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,027
General...

692
01:11:39,575 --> 01:11:43,671
...I'm not in the Army, anymore.

693
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:27,180
Hut!

694
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:33,922
Lieutenant!

695
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:36,293
Lieutenant!

696
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:07,856
These six are finished.

697
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:26,377
Ahab's feet are split
clean-through, Top.

698
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:30,609
They're finished.

699
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:34,681
They'll slow us down.

700
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,117
We can't compromise the herd.

701
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:42,961
Form them into a parade, and do
it quick, before the 12th is on us.

702
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:48,101
Top?

703
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:52,805
Do not look to Top for
confirmation! I gave a direct order.

704
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:55,267
Shit!

705
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,337
It had to come to this, didn't it?

706
01:13:57,646 --> 01:14:01,343
At least we're not herding them
into pits and slaughtering them.

707
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:26,063
Lieutenant!

708
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,277
I'll handle it.

709
01:16:08,978 --> 01:16:10,707
We've got them, Sergeant.

710
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:11,970
Let's go!

711
01:16:43,712 --> 01:16:45,737
I'll see you in hell, Ahab.

712
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:28,580
Let's move out.

713
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:14,929
Colonel!

714
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:18,372
They were sighted northeast of here.

715
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,637
My opinion is, they're attempting
to cross at the Sioux Reserve.

716
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,675
We'll move to flank them.

717
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:25,146
Sir!

718
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:28,650
Move out smartly, Corporal.

719
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:38,353
Good move, Buxton.

720
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,393
Good move.

721
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:52,901
Montana.

722
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:55,570
I'll cable London.

723
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:11,115
C'mon, c'mon!

724
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:36,967
They cut 'em off.

725
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:51,792
Mulcahey, scout the
left and southern flanks.

726
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:14,540
Whoa!

727
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:18,851
Get after them!

728
01:22:33,929 --> 01:22:34,953
No!

729
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,529
Sergeant, I order you to stop!

730
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,977
Nothing more can be done for him now.

731
01:24:43,759 --> 01:24:45,192
He was following an order.

732
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:49,025
My order.

733
01:24:50,732 --> 01:24:53,724
You gave a soldier
an order, he obeyed.

734
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:56,264
There's always a price.

735
01:24:57,939 --> 01:24:59,668
We gotta keep moving, sir.

736
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:01,905
We got the 12th on our ass.

737
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:04,378
And we're flanked over there.

738
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,114
You think we could get
past them to the reserve?

739
01:25:08,784 --> 01:25:09,808
No, sir.

740
01:25:12,354 --> 01:25:13,514
Then, it's Canada.

741
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:14,846
Canada?

742
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:17,855
We'll have to make
a run for it and...

743
01:25:18,427 --> 01:25:20,361
...pray there's no one at the border.

744
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:22,454
-Mount up!
-What about Mulcahey?

745
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:25,398
If you want to give him
a funeral, start digging.

746
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:27,462
Ready when you are, sir.

747
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:40,002
Corporal, organize a detail.

748
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:43,242
Prepare Mr. Mulcahey's
body for transportation.

749
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:46,573
What are you doing? We have
to keep after those men.

750
01:26:46,848 --> 01:26:48,873
Take charge of it for proper burial.

751
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:51,618
This man was a renegade and a thief.

752
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:54,748
There's been no court, no review!

753
01:26:55,423 --> 01:26:57,323
This man was a soldier!

754
01:26:58,059 --> 01:26:59,993
We'll treat him with dignity.

755
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:02,057
You'll face charges for this.

756
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,194
If you wish to pursue and
single-handedly capture them...

757
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,064
...I'm sure the War
Department will commend you.

758
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:12,565
Not one of my men moves until
this soldier's taken care of.

759
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,152
No sign of them.

760
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:37,631
How do you figure that?

761
01:27:38,199 --> 01:27:42,533
It's Mulcahey. He took care of
their horses better than anyone.

762
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:46,363
-They pay their respects and give us time.
-You used a dead man!

763
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:49,600
Goddamn right, I did!
And I'd do it again.

764
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:57,081
That'll be Hardesty
coming to intercept us.

765
01:28:00,589 --> 01:28:01,851
All right!

766
01:28:01,923 --> 01:28:05,415
This is us. This is Milk
River at the Canadian border.

767
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:06,619
This is Hardesty.

768
01:28:07,395 --> 01:28:11,195
And the main body of the 23rd
will probably cut us off here.

769
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:14,027
-I'm too goddamn old for this, Jack.
-Quit.

770
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,867
The whole goddamned
regiment's chasing us!

771
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:19,266
I don't even know what
we're doing anymore!

772
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:21,007
You're free to back out, James.

773
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:25,910
You, too, Shawn.

774
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:29,582
With your permission, sir.

775
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:35,848
We traveled nearly
2,000 miles together.

776
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:39,193
If you men wanna stop now...

777
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:42,555
...you go ahead, no blame from me.

778
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:46,090
Christ on a crutch!

779
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:48,998
Hell, I've never been a quitter.

780
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:51,966
And neither is Shattuck.

781
01:28:54,075 --> 01:28:55,099
Are ya?

782
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:01,313
No, I'll stick, you
goddamn son of a bitch!

783
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:03,409
C'mon!

784
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,177
Well, then, let's go to Canada.

785
01:29:48,396 --> 01:29:52,230
To the right is Milk River
and the Canadian border.

786
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:59,032
That's the main encampment,
over there. Two miles, I'd say.

787
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:05,740
They're in a good position.
They'll move fast when they spot us.

788
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,810
I suggest we move slow,
so we don't raise dust.

789
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:12,943
We'll rest the remounts
for the final dash.

790
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,355
We might just make it.

791
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:17,825
Yes, sir...

792
01:30:18,893 --> 01:30:20,121
...we might.

793
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:31,369
Good afternoon! This
area's restricted.

794
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:33,168
We're the press, Corporal.

795
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:37,476
No civilians allowed.

796
01:30:37,545 --> 01:30:39,445
This is Miss Jessica Stuart.

797
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:42,845
I'm Evan Buckley, a photographer
for the London Tribune.

798
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:45,283
Please step out of
the car, Miss Stuart.

799
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:48,219
I'm going to escort Miss
Stuart to Col. Hardesty.

800
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:50,484
We'll have to detain you here, sir.

801
01:31:04,839 --> 01:31:06,170
Am I under arrest, Colonel?

802
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:10,410
You're way off-limits
here, Miss Stuart.

803
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:13,677
You will be detained until
this exercise is over.

804
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:19,483
As for the deserters, we're ordered
to shoot to kill if necessary.

805
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:22,883
That's official. From
MacArthur himself.

806
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:27,725
Not many men get that order.

807
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:31,494
I have the privilege of
attacking my own men, again.

808
01:31:33,134 --> 01:31:34,795
Twice in one career.

809
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:37,232
You could choose to ignore it.

810
01:31:39,507 --> 01:31:40,701
I won't.

811
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,439
I've been taught to
obey and follow orders.

812
01:31:47,248 --> 01:31:49,341
I will not do otherwise, Miss Stuart.

813
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:52,247
Being Army yourself,
you should understand.

814
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:57,120
The chief of staff is building a new,
modern army out of the ruins of the old.

815
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:58,819
This is insanity.

816
01:32:02,997 --> 01:32:04,157
Certainly.

817
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:09,962
What would you have me do?

818
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:12,697
Give them a chance.

819
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:15,669
-File a protest with MacArthur.
-I already have.

820
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:17,176
Then file another.

821
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:19,736
-I've sent a wire.
-Wait for an answer.

822
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:22,406
I have my answer, Miss Stuart!

823
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:28,688
If you think I won't report
this, then think again.

824
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:32,556
When you fire on those men, I will
witness it and I will not be silent.

825
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,761
Corporal!

826
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:40,066
Keep Miss Stuart company.

827
01:33:27,615 --> 01:33:29,048
Contact headquarters.

828
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:33,844
Advise them we have the renegades
in sight and under the gun.

829
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:43,790
Mounties.

830
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:48,429
You think they're there to stop us?

831
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:51,668
No, they're waiting
with cookies and milk.

832
01:33:54,609 --> 01:33:56,167
A damned white flag?

833
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,649
Maybe they're surrendering.

834
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,806
You're outmanned and outgunned.

835
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:39,483
Looks like you've lost
a good number of horses.

836
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,485
We can still save what's left.

837
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:42,985
You'd risk your life?

838
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,025
Your men's lives on a whim?

839
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,226
-They're on the table.
-Christ, Jack.

840
01:34:48,896 --> 01:34:51,797
We got four 75 mm
howitzers on your flank!

841
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:54,766
-Orders are shoot to kill.
-Give it up, man.

842
01:34:54,902 --> 01:34:57,735
Stand the court. At least
there's some honor in that.

843
01:34:57,872 --> 01:34:59,999
We're not surrendering the horses.

844
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:02,300
You do whatever you have to do.

845
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:06,109
He's young and headstrong.

846
01:35:06,948 --> 01:35:10,679
You and the others are just
plain fools, Sgt. Libbey.

847
01:35:12,253 --> 01:35:14,153
In your eyes, I suppose so.

848
01:35:44,485 --> 01:35:45,816
Let's go!

849
01:36:05,873 --> 01:36:08,933
We're pretty spread out for a dash...

850
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:11,803
...and it's gonna have to be a dash.

851
01:36:11,913 --> 01:36:14,746
Spread out ain't so
bad. Is it, Mr. Quinlain?

852
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:17,045
Not a bit.

853
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:20,178
Looks like I lead.

854
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:23,447
With your permission, sir.

855
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,684
Take the point, Sergeant.

856
01:36:52,987 --> 01:36:55,046
Take the right flank, Shattuck.

857
01:37:26,754 --> 01:37:29,382
I reckon we could
take it from here, sir.

858
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:34,458
Meaning what?

859
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:40,030
Shattuck, Quinlain and me,
we're kind of like the buffalo.

860
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,228
We've had our day.

861
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,797
We're lucky we lived this long.

862
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:51,269
But it doesn't have
to end for you here.

863
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:55,546
You can turn back now...

864
01:37:56,517 --> 01:37:57,984
...stand the court.

865
01:37:58,186 --> 01:37:59,983
Hell, blame it on us.

866
01:38:02,123 --> 01:38:05,456
I'd be honored to take the blame
for any crime you committed.

867
01:38:08,563 --> 01:38:11,828
Are you suggesting I relinquish
command of this detail?

868
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:16,597
No, sir.

869
01:38:18,005 --> 01:38:19,165
Good, then.

870
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:21,766
Carry on.

871
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:55,408
C'mon, Quinlain.

872
01:39:00,448 --> 01:39:03,281
Hello, darlin'! Did you miss me?

873
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,271
Move it, move it!

874
01:40:17,925 --> 01:40:18,914
My God.

875
01:40:21,128 --> 01:40:24,427
All right, outta the truck. Let's go!

876
01:40:40,147 --> 01:40:41,546
Adjust the guns.

877
01:40:58,733 --> 01:40:59,757
Elevation?

878
01:40:59,867 --> 01:41:01,596
-Forty degrees!
-Range find!

879
01:41:02,136 --> 01:41:03,501
One thousand yards!

880
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:08,470
-Elevation?
-Forty degrees!

881
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,970
One thousand yards.

882
01:41:17,752 --> 01:41:18,980
Elevation?

883
01:41:19,053 --> 01:41:20,247
Forty degrees!

884
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:33,557
Colonel! Stop! They've
been granted full pardon.

885
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:35,966
-By whom?
-Roosevelt! Read it!

886
01:41:36,137 --> 01:41:37,832
Before it's too late.

887
01:41:38,906 --> 01:41:40,271
It's already too late.

888
01:41:40,341 --> 01:41:42,468
Fire!

889
01:41:46,947 --> 01:41:48,107
Fire!

890
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:51,010
Fire!

891
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:08,197
Well done, Sergeant.

892
01:43:17,137 --> 01:43:18,729
They fired high and wide.

893
01:43:18,806 --> 01:43:20,467
It would appear so.

894
01:43:20,641 --> 01:43:23,474
Forrest never was much
of an artilleryman.

895
01:43:23,911 --> 01:43:24,935
Like hell.

896
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:57,502
Are we under arrest?

897
01:43:58,312 --> 01:44:00,177
Have you broken a law in Canada?

898
01:44:00,748 --> 01:44:02,909
We came over the river uninvited.

899
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:08,019
That you did. But I consider
it a minor infraction.

900
01:44:08,389 --> 01:44:10,254
What are your plans for the horses?

901
01:44:12,126 --> 01:44:13,957
Only to keep them alive.

902
01:44:15,262 --> 01:44:18,197
What about you, lads? You
gonna make yourselves useful?

903
01:44:20,034 --> 01:44:23,697
It'd be nice to have a new bunch
of fellows to tell my lies to.

904
01:44:30,678 --> 01:44:33,078
TO COL. OWEN STUART WAR
DEPARTMENT COMMS OFFICE

905
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,676
MEN AND HORSES SAFE
IN CANADA LOVE YOU DAD.

906
01:44:36,984 --> 01:44:38,315
JESSICA.

907
01:44:55,235 --> 01:44:57,635
I'm glad somebody else likes horses.

908
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:18,487
Well, we made it, sir.

909
01:45:19,793 --> 01:45:21,090
Two thousand miles.

910
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:23,459
Another long story
about a quick decision.

911
01:45:27,568 --> 01:45:29,229
Where you headed?

912
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:32,300
I reckon I spent
enough time in the Army.

913
01:45:34,274 --> 01:45:37,243
I'm thinkin' about the Yukon,
see what that looks like.

914
01:45:37,511 --> 01:45:39,138
Alaska? Good God.

915
01:45:41,148 --> 01:45:44,879
We've been heading north for so long,
kind of hard to change direction.

916
01:45:49,323 --> 01:45:50,449
And you?

917
01:45:54,995 --> 01:45:58,055
You told me that you hated
what this country was becoming.

918
01:45:58,298 --> 01:45:59,560
I do, too.

919
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:02,166
I wanna help change it.

920
01:46:04,271 --> 01:46:06,739
I'm gonna go back
and stand the court.

921
01:46:09,476 --> 01:46:11,444
I hope you kick their ass.

922
01:46:12,746 --> 01:46:14,236
I do too, Top.

923
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:28,291
You take care, Jack.

924
01:46:29,997 --> 01:46:31,464
You too, sir.

925
01:46:45,446 --> 01:46:46,640
C'mon!

926
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:49,133
No animals were harmed during
the making of this film.
