1
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,114
Woh there.

2
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,196
Excuse me a minute, Major.

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,758
You know, I've been thinking
about home the past couple hours.

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,310
These here hills and all this mud
is beginning to get me.

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,513
Didn't seem to notice it so much
when we was a fighting

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,152
but this just riding along
through it day after day gets awful.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,119
Hello there little fellow.

8
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,952
I'd sure be glad to get back
home to Texas again.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,630
Tell us about Texas, Tiny.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,518
He must think we're from that place
they call "the rest of the world".

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,476
You mean to tell me there's
someplace else besides Texas?

12
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,509
Yep.

13
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,395
I was sort of hoping we were
just living in a bad dream.

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,353
Don't you think it's about time
you two woke up?

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,592
Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga...

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,030
Dirt, muck, blood.
Four years for nothing.

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,197
We fought for something we believed.
There's been no disgrace.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,358
- So we pick off where we left off?
- Lf we make up our minds to it.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,310
I wish I were like you, Neil.
You can make the best of anything.

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,316
- So can you.
- No.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,719
No. At least I'm smart enough
to know myself.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,516
See little brother,
I just don't like to lose.

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,552
I don't know about you fellows,
but I got me a lot of plans.

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,311
I figure the future of Texas
lies in its people.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
I'm going back to assist
the ever expanding population

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,035
- of my beloved state.
- Think your wife still loves you?

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,599
You know she does.

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,435
I got two kids to prove it
and they'll be more little Texans.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,038
You're a fine shepherd!

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,116
That poor little lamb
might have drowned.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,797
Yes, sir.
When Tiny McGilligan

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,470
gets back to Texas they'll be
calling me "populating papa".

33
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,155
Well Dan,
we're finally getting close to home.

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,156
Got a lot of years to make up.

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,791
You said it just right Neil,
a lot of years to make up.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,190
Believe me,
I'm gonna make them.

37
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,796
Are you sure this is Austin?

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,079
Maybe we've been away
more than four years.

39
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,108
Why don't you two look around
for a couple of minutes?

40
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,877
I got something to tend to.

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,632
I'll take those Miss.

42
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,753
I'd say Miss on first and second
sight you don't need a new hat.

43
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,838
You must be a stranger here.

44
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,793
That's right.
First return in four years.

45
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,550
- Major there have been changes.
- I can see that.

46
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,228
I hope you think they're
for the better.

47
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,630
I'm not in a position to know...
Yet.

48
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,871
Maybe you'll find out soon.

49
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,474
I wonder what you'd look like with
a shave and some up to date clothes.

50
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,634
Goodbye.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,275
Dan, you can look but
even that's wasting your time.

52
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,639
She's taken.

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,393
Sam Hunter!

54
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,790
You're the first proof I've had
that I'm back in Austin.

55
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,115
You're not only back but
I'll buy you a welcome home drink.

56
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,673
Let's go.

57
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,473
<i>Now she's known Alexis,
the darling of Texas.</i>

58
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,835
<i>She is just a five foot girl</i>

59
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,276
<i>but she gives 6 footers a whirl.</i>

60
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,071
<i>That's what they say about Alexis,
the darling of Texas.</i>

61
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,070
Looks like you got the wealth
of the world right here in Austin.

62
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,951
A lot of it here alright.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,391
We really do have it though.
Most new money, northern capitol.

64
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,039
I guessed as much.

65
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,876
If a fellow has money,
there are ways of making more.

66
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,869
I hope some of it
has rubbed off on you.

67
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,152
No, still chief country clerk.
Good job.

68
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,669
But I reckon I just lack
the old savvy, that's all.

69
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,398
That girl in the carriage,
who is she?

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,911
I told you, she's taken.

71
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,475
- What do you mean taken?
- Married.

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,189
- To whom?
- Cord Hardin, from Illinois.

73
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,551
Money, plenty of it.
Ranches, cattle...

74
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,397
How do you stack up against that?

75
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,557
I don't.
I'm one of the vanquished.

76
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,958
Back home and broke kind.

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,198
A fellow gets back and looks
at all this wealth

78
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,599
he begins thinking.

79
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,958
- About making money?
- Making big money, fast money.

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,233
You got any ideas?

81
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,518
No, but if I could
get a start somewhere...

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,757
I better find Neil before he thinks
I'm swallowed up by the new world.

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,233
Good luck.

84
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,754
Sal!

85
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,279
Sally Eaton!

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,438
Neil!

87
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,117
Welcome home.

88
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,191
Tiny!
When did you get back?

89
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,276
Just passing through
on the way to the circle H.

90
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,753
Dan with you?

91
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,438
- Is he around here?
- Somewhere around here.

92
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,948
- Where?
- I don't keep him on a rope.

93
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,518
You've grown up and you're
even prettier if that's possible.

94
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,549
Well thanks.

95
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,353
- What are you doing here in Austin?
- Father died last year so I...

96
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,391
Mother wrote us about it.

97
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,152
Don't tell me your running
the freight company?

98
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,829
Look just because this is
a man's world is no reason a woman...

99
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,949
A woman?

100
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,713
- She's still wet behind the ears!
- Say that again!

101
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,877
Easy gal.
She's still the Texas terror.

102
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,794
Dan!

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,111
Dan, welcome home.

104
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,996
- Don't you remember me?
- Of course I do. Sal Eaton!

105
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,919
You sure grown up!
No wonder I didn't recognize you.

106
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,949
You're forgiven.

107
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,150
We better get started.
The sun's moving.

108
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,191
Good to see you Sally girl.

109
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,630
Come by the ranch sometime Sal
and visit the folks.

110
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,558
- Yeah do that Pigtail.
- As soon as I can.

111
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,919
- Ma!
- Mr. Hammond!

112
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,916
Daddy's coming home!

113
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,473
Hi bud.

114
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,757
Dan!

115
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,634
- How you been?
- How are you!

116
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,593
Dad!

117
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,914
Children this is your father,
General McGilligan.

118
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,234
He win the whole war.

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,350
Juan, what a big soldier you are.

120
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,789
And little Celeste, what a beauty.

121
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,198
How proud I am of you.

122
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,597
Ma, you're wonderful.

123
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,037
Ira, I don't know how to thank you
for taking care of my family.

124
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,759
They've done a lot
to take care of us.

125
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,076
It isn't every ranch that's lucky
enough to have a foreman like you.

126
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,111
- We missed you.
- Thanks Martha.

127
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,398
Major, I'll take care of the horses.
You folks go on in the house.

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,005
Right.
What are we having for dinner?

129
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,874
- Cornbread?
- We've had it in the over for weeks.

130
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,874
And here are the two of you
as youngsters.

131
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,712
Neil was a little beauty, wasn't he?

132
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,149
Yeah, the two Hammond kids,
"Beauty and the Beast".

133
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,155
It seems like yesterday.

134
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,158
Here's a picture of you we took
right after you came to live with us.

135
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,078
It's nice to have been picked.
I hear he just happened.

136
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,718
Boys, boys...

137
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,349
Pretty wonderful having
you boys home again.

138
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,950
That's something special
I've been saving.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,517
There've been time over the years
when I didn't think...

140
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,635
That's alright Dad.

141
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,797
There've been time over the years
when we didn't think so either.

142
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,394
- Here son.
- Ira!

143
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,715
Thanks, Dad.
Here's to us!

144
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,469
- What is this stuff?
- Whiskey.

145
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,513
Won't be long before
the Circle H is yours.

146
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,996
Maybe mother and I will take
a trip back to Kentucky.

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,075
But now tomorrow.
We'll start life as if there'd been no war.

148
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,759
Yeah. That's alright.

149
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,159
What's the matter, boy?

150
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,515
I don't know. It seems
kind of quiet around here.

151
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,351
Well Texas is a big country.
Sound gets lost in it.

152
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,517
Maybe I've been so used to sound
and excitement that

153
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,509
the idea of ranching kind
of slipped away from me.

154
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,270
It'll slip right back again.
Tomorrow you'll get into it.

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,639
You never really lose
the love of ranching.

156
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,318
Well we better get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

157
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,433
Good night, Dan.

158
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,873
Good night, Mother.

159
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,032
You really like this, don't you?

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,708
Sure.

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,472
I believe you do.

162
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,873
For Dad's sake,
try to make a go of it.

163
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,638
It'll break his heart if you give up.

164
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,519
Let's just do one more.

165
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,472
It's getting late.
Near supper time.

166
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,834
There's excitement
in this ranching Dan.

167
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,591
A man and his dreams,
the cattle and the future. Yes sir.

168
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,599
We used to talk about this,
what we'd do when we got back.

169
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,074
Well, we're doing it.
The old life again.

170
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,437
Yeah. The old life again.

171
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,559
Dad.

172
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,478
Who are those men down there?

173
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,549
Just about everything
under the sun I guess.

174
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,957
Ex-army deserters,
renegades of every stripe.

175
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,912
- Is that where they live?
- Yep.

176
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,639
They're a pretty tough lot.

177
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,871
I doubt even the Texas Rangers,
even if they hadn't been disbanded,

178
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,229
would relish tackling them.

179
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,591
Dregs of the war.

180
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,554
What more could a man want?

181
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,030
Fine home, good food,
this year, plenty of cattle.

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,231
1600 heads in the extreme
south section

183
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,756
and 950 in the big meadows.

184
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,239
When the Eastern markets open up
and the drives to Kansas begin

185
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,472
with a little luck,
we ought to be in pretty fair shape.

186
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,597
Meanwhile you're short of money.

187
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,751
Yeah. Meanwhile.

188
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,230
And in city's like Austin
men are making money hand over fist.

189
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,236
That kind of money is no good.

190
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,869
- What's wrong with it?
- It doesn't build solid land.

191
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,558
That's false prosperity.

192
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,229
I'd like to have a little of it.

193
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,831
What are you trying to say son?

194
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,509
Maybe I can't be satisfied
with ranching.

195
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,038
Trying to make ends meet year
after year like you been doing.

196
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,674
But we're happy.
We have everything we want.

197
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,553
Part of the joy was
not having to hurry it.

198
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,233
Let's face the facts Dad.

199
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,710
You're 65 years old and the ranch
isn't even paid for yet.

200
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,791
I haven't got that kind of patience.

201
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,272
I'm sorry, Dad.
Excuse me, Mother.

202
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,758
I suppose an ordinary citizen
doesn't have the right to bother

203
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,438
- a public official.
- You can.

204
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,354
After all these years...
Let's have it Dan.

205
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,757
- I want to make money.
- Is that all?

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,710
- It's about everything to me.
- I had you figured for ranching.

207
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,433
A chip off the old block.

208
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,915
- No, sir.
- What changed you?

209
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,833
- The war I guess.
- You're not the only one.

210
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,998
I've seen it in others too.

211
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,556
How do you figure I can help you?

212
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,793
- You know people.
- I know a lot of them.

213
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,917
What kind of people
do you want to know?

214
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,234
The rich ones.

215
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,235
Are you still a fervid southerner?

216
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,198
Naturally, but I could
forget that for money.

217
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,920
- No grudges.
- Same answer.

218
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,673
If I introduced you to a Yankee,

219
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,598
I wouldn't want to see you start
trading punches right off.

220
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,592
No. I'll be careful.

221
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,592
I'm serious, Dan.
It's a new world.

222
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,514
The old one ended when
the Confederacy went to war.

223
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,471
The new one started the same day.

224
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,876
We...
Come in Cord.

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,554
I'm glad to see you.

226
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,195
- I'm delighted you could drop in.
- Thanks.

227
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,988
I want you to know my old friend,
Major Hammond.

228
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,471
- This is Cord Hardin.
- Major.

229
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,636
- Mr. Hardin.
- May I Frank?

230
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,159
Oh yes. Help yourself.

231
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,991
How about a little poker tonight?

232
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,513
Something special?

233
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,473
In a way, yes.

234
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,319
Some of us are getting a pool
together to buy 50,000 acres

235
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,989
cotton land in the Brazos.
Can you check on the legal details?

236
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,715
I can't tonight Cord. How about
bringing the papers tomorrow?

237
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,909
I can do that.

238
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,997
Are Osborne and Kenny
going to be in the game tonight?

239
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,632
They're both in the pool.

240
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,711
I'd like to have Maj. Hammond
meet them.

241
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,598
Perhaps you could get him in
on some business venture.

242
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,472
Frank has put it rather bluntly.

243
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,230
- You play poker, Major?
- Fair game.

244
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,314
I'll see you tomorrow Frank.
8:00?

245
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,958
- That'll be fine.
- I'll expect you then.

246
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,076
- Goodbye Frank.
- Bye.

247
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,759
- I'm very grateful.
- That's alright Dan.

248
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,355
But they play a rough game of poker.

249
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,789
So if you value your money
look out for yourself.

250
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,997
- Thanks for the warning.
- Good luck.

251
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,509
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Dan.

252
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,353
- What are you doing in town?
- Thought I'd say hello.

253
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,714
Sit down.

254
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,154
- How are things at the ranch?
- The same.

255
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,794
I'd like to ask you a favor
but I won't blame you if you say no.

256
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,875
Money?

257
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,790
I can't tell you when
I'll be able to pay you back.

258
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,072
I can spare 1000.
I wish it could be more

259
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,433
but it's from my own
private kitty.

260
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,278
- No questions?
- Why should there be?

261
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,635
- Jacks and nines.
- Beats me.

262
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,954
- Too much for me.
- I'm out.

263
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,713
Queens and tens.

264
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,355
Up until now the nice part
about this game is no matter

265
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,756
how much you win or lose,
we always kept it in the same crowd.

266
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,118
You looking for an opportunity
to start in a business?

267
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,068
I'd like nothing better.

268
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,754
For 25,000
you can start a cotton mill.

269
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,793
I got a little deal I can fix up
for you for only 50,000.

270
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,434
Col. Grayson was telling me
the fastest way to make money...

271
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,472
The fastest way to make money
is right here in this game.

272
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,039
Who's gonna open?

273
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,470
- 100.
- I'll stay.

274
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,878
- And I.
- See you and up you 5.

275
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,995
Hello, dear.

276
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,992
Please don't get up gentlemen.

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,274
- I believe you know everyone but...
- Hello Major?

278
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,833
You've met before?

279
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,113
Yes. As a matter of fact the Major
insulted me in a very nice way.

280
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,432
That's a new kind of technique.
I'll have to try it sometime.

281
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,112
I'll see your raise Major.

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
Excuse me Mrs. Hardin.

283
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,794
How much have you got there?

284
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,194
2400 even.

285
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,636
You look beautiful tonight darling.

286
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,268
2400.

287
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,476
And raise you 5000.

288
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,279
That's too good for me.

289
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,032
- I'm out.
- Me too.

290
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,593
I don't have that much with me.

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,989
Cards?

292
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,309
I'll play these.

293
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,555
I'll take two.

294
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,429
Full.

295
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,513
Full house, kings high.

296
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,669
Aces high.

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,593
I'll expect the 5000 tomorrow.
5:00.

298
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,719
I'm afraid that's too fast.

299
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,753
When can I have it?

300
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,799
You'll have to give me
a little more time.

301
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,194
I don't like that answer.

302
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,711
I'll get it as quickly as possible.
That's the best I can do.

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,433
I have a couple of ranches.

304
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,439
Paradise can use
an extra cow hand.

305
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,992
You can work it out.
Report to my foreman tomorrow.

306
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,069
If you don't mind I'd like
to work it out in my own way.

307
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,795
You've stepped out
of your class tonight.

308
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,588
You're a farmboy.

309
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,879
You were born a farmboy
and you'll end up as one.

310
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,236
On top of that you're a welcher
and a smart alec.

311
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,599
Now get out of here.

312
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,909
I had that coming

313
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,069
this time.

314
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,589
Gentlemen.

315
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,229
Lorna.

316
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,754
Fix me a drink.

317
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,829
- Somebody's coming.
- Scatter.

318
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,550
Keep riding Mister,
right into the light.

319
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,114
Get off your horse.

320
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,799
Drop your gunbelt.

321
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,309
Start walking.

322
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,557
- Who are you?
- A friend.

323
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,071
- Where are you from?
- Austin.

324
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,156
What makes you think
you're wanted around here?

325
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,232
Whatever you want, say it fast.

326
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,797
Who's the spokesman for all you men?

327
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,393
We all do the talking here.

328
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,474
Let's see what the gentleman
from Austin looks like.

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,992
Look what we found.

330
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,073
A dude from Austin.

331
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,638
You two are awful tough
with all that artillery.

332
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,791
Better not hit him
with your right hand, Sy.

333
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,718
You want to go first?

334
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,589
Go get him Sy!

335
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,198
That a way!
Hit him Sy!

336
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,199
Give it to him!

337
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,109
Sy!

338
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,436
Come on Sy, let's keep it clean.

339
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,474
Major, I always enjoy
seeing a good man in action.

340
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,790
- How are you?
- Dandy Taylor.

341
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,559
I thought I left you doing
guard duty in Chickamauga.

342
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,196
I want you to meet
the finest major, crackest shot

343
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,919
the toughest soldier
that ever lost a war.

344
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,395
Major Dan Hammond.
What are you doing here?

345
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,150
I heard about you men
being down here.

346
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,474
I came to talk to you
about making a living.

347
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,236
- A living for all of us.
- And he means all of you.

348
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,033
War's over you know.

349
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,998
Yeah?
You wouldn't think so.

350
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,950
I see soldiers here from the North.

351
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,194
And from the South.

352
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,675
But none of us are
soldiers any longer.

353
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,308
Also among you

354
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,835
there are men who are
deserters from the Army

355
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,715
for one personal reason or another.

356
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,911
Others among you may be wanted
by the law on various charges

357
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,793
and are now facing
an uncertain future.

358
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,238
I came here to tell you

359
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,389
that we can all make it
a little more certain.

360
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,191
For you and for me.

361
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,155
I need men who can ride hard,
shoot hard

362
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,470
- and live hard.
- That ought to be easy.

363
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,192
What are the wages
for this kind of work?

364
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,354
You're going to get loyalty from me.

365
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,751
And that's what
I expect to get from you.

366
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,474
That ain't enough.
What about wages?

367
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,158
If Dan Hammond says
he'll give you loyalty for loyalty

368
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,514
it means you'll get more money
than you ever made before.

369
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,868
Thank you, Dandy.

370
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,355
And to that

371
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,631
let me add one last thing.

372
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,589
If you men decide to go with me

373
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,879
this is the last night you'll ever
spend hiding in a river bottom.

374
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,678
Make up your minds.

375
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,269
Dandy!

376
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,313
Get those strays.

377
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,798
- 5000 dollars for French wine.
- Check.

378
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,759
- 50,000 dollars for diamonds.
- Check.

379
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,071
Of course Monsieur Auriel,
20,000 of French silk

380
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,230
<i>percentage to us 4500 dolares.</i>

381
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,954
4500 dollars?
Why?

382
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,835
To buyers here I've sold
champaign, jewelry, perfumes...

383
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,549
and General Escobar's
percentage has always been 20%.

384
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,355
What is this 22.5%?

385
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,154
<i>- General. Please.
- Good afternoon Mr. Auriel.</i>

386
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,032
<i>Good afternoon General.</i>

387
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,790
- Sr. Hammond.
- General.

388
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,432
<i>Please mi General.</i>

389
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,515
What is this 22.5%?

390
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,589
It's like Lt. Salazar says:
4500 dollars.

391
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,214
Fernandez, the Cuban,
Hiller, the German, and Lopez

392
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:56,389
bring goods to you. They sell.
But always it is 20%.

393
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,079
It's Escobar's new rule.

394
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,748
French silk now
5000 dollars cash.

395
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,314
But you said 4500 dollars.

396
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,193
Yes I know, but you talk and talk.

397
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,953
You waste my time.
5000 dollars cash.

398
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,393
Alright. I pay.

399
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,159
It is a good thing for you
Escobar make a place like Zona Libre?

400
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,753
But for me it is very expensive.

401
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,594
I have to pay my police,
my other helpers, everybody.

402
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,199
And nobody helps me.

403
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,916
It costs very much to make this army

404
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,956
and I have to take care of my people.
And I do!

405
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,351
That is why we make me the General.

406
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,194
<i>- Right Salazar?
- Yes my General.</i>

407
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,509
You see?

408
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,350
Auriel, you and I,
we won't have any trouble.

409
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,549
I hope so.

410
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,076
<i>- Good day and thank you.
- Good day General.</i>

411
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,511
And remember you are
always welcome here.

412
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,517
<i>My friend Hammond!
How are you man?</i>

413
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,079
A long time no see you.

414
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,991
General, you look magnificent.

415
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,112
What? This uniform?
This nothing.

416
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,110
Maybe I make one for Salazar
next week.

417
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,919
<i>Thank you, General.</i>

418
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,196
<i>- You like it?
- Yes General, I do.</i>

419
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,120
<i>- But without the hat.
- Thank you, General.</i>

420
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,072
<i>A chair for the gentleman.</i>

421
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,829
<i>My friend Hammond,
how have you been?</i>

422
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,757
Fine General.
And you?

423
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,516
Business has not been too good
but I think it will pick up.

424
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,789
Let's see

425
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,159
on this trip I only sold
15000 heads.

426
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,708
Commission for you 9000 dollars.

427
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,995
<i>Salazar, how many was it?</i>

428
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,797
<i>15,202.</i>

429
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,958
<i>He thought I wouldn't check.</i>

430
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,638
<i>- Yes my General.
- What?</i>

431
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,113
<i>No General, no.</i>

432
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,190
<i>Sr. Hammond,
Was it not 15,202 heads.</i>

433
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,513
That would be for me,
my commission

434
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,070
<i>9,121 dollars and 40 cents.</i>

435
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,476
Forgive me. I didn't want to
bother you with little figures.

436
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,313
Dandy! How did you get
such an accurate count?

437
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,079
The cows, they count
each other for me.

438
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,639
Alright. Let's see.

439
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,399
9 thousand...

440
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,997
121 dollars and...

441
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,073
<i>Hold on. Forget the cents.
This one is on me.</i>

442
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,275
Well thank you General.

443
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,069
Now you smoke a fine
General Escobar cigar.

444
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,788
See? My picture.

445
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,789
Well...

446
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,758
- Dandy?
- That's pretty.

447
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,669
You don't smoke?

448
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,039
You make almost 50,000 dollars
since we met in the Zona Libre.

449
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,559
A very fine meeting.

450
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,072
You stay with me one week,
I give you fine time.

451
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,954
<i>Salazar, I want the best
for Mr. Hammond.</i>

452
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,471
<i>For the best my friend.
The best beer, the best tequila,</i>

453
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,233
<i>- the best mariachis... Got it?
- Yes sir, General.</i>

454
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,470
<i>And the best girls too.</i>

455
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,230
Very nice General but
I have a date back home.

456
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,752
- You going to kill somebody?
- No, this is with people I love.

457
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,831
Maybe next time.

458
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,189
Good.

459
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,991
Come on Dad.
Half of this is yours.

460
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,033
This is wonderful.

461
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,193
Here's to the best parents
anybody ever had.

462
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,471
Here's something special for
sticking it out with him so long.

463
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,754
- Look at that.
- Oh dear.

464
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,110
I'll say on thing Dad, if he'd
stayed on the ranch

465
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,316
he'd never had had enough money
for a bobble like that.

466
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,591
May I see it Mrs. Hammond?

467
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,395
It really is beautiful.

468
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,118
Come on you two.
Let's cut the cake.

469
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,469
You sure make that money making
business sound easy son.

470
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,988
How do you go about doing
that in the big city?

471
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,439
I was lucky Dad.

472
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,554
That may be warmer there in the pan.

473
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,069
A friend of mine staked me
to 1000 dollars.

474
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,269
Sam Hunter.

475
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,957
On a hunch I took
a trip to New Orleans.

476
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,757
- Great town, New Orleans.
- So I've heard.

477
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,678
Everybody's speculating.

478
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,999
I got a tip on cotton futures.
I bought quick, sold quick.

479
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,678
That's all there is to it.

480
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,393
Well that was sure a fine present
you gave Mother.

481
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,477
I don't think she ever expected
to get anything like that.

482
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,278
By the way Dad.

483
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,873
Here's a letter for you.

484
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,669
Letter?

485
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,749
- What...
- That's right.

486
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,078
The 6000 you owe the bank.
All paid up.

487
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,109
Well...

488
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,351
Son, I don't even know

489
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,279
- how to begin to thank you.
- You try it and I'll punch you.

490
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,789
Sure takes the pressure
off all of us.

491
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,955
I confess I've been pretty worried.

492
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,673
See the Circle H has come to mean

493
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,910
just about all the living to me.

494
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,277
It goes way back to when
Texas was pretty young.

495
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,914
That's why I didn't want anything
to happen to the Circle H.

496
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,149
Well, so far nothing has.

497
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,108
How do you mean?

498
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,598
Cattle rustling, Dan. They've been
stripping the biggest ranches.

499
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,990
They've come close to us
but so far they've kept clear.

500
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,190
Sheriff Clawson,
what's he doing about it?

501
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,078
He thinks it's a regular
organized gang.

502
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,953
They keep it up,
we go to do some organizing ourself.

503
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,638
What are your plans Dan?

504
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,357
I've got some money, enough
to move in any direction I like.

505
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,954
Your mother and I would sure
like to see you settled down

506
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,753
particularly in Austin.
It'd be a big help to us.

507
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,519
Ira and Dan, our guests are leaving.

508
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,909
Thanks son.

509
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,358
I'm so sorry you all have to go.

510
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,595
I've enjoyed it so much.

511
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,797
- Bye bye.
- See you then.

512
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,158
Awful glad you could come today Sal.

513
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,589
- Thank you.
- When can I see you again?

514
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,313
Whenever you want.

515
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,200
- I didn't know you were interested.
- Interested?

516
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,792
I always thought you paid
more attention to Dan.

517
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,992
Neil, don't you know
I'm in love with Dan?

518
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,315
Have been since I was two.

519
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,554
But I'll give you a chance
to change my mind.

520
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,993
- See you in Austin.
- Goodbye Dan.

521
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,032
So glad you're interested.

522
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,269
Say, what's?

523
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,829
Good.

524
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,269
Dan.

525
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,592
There's a rumor around Austin

526
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,110
that Hardin has your IOU
for 5000 dollars and you welched.

527
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,072
Bad story if it's true.

528
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,997
If it isn't true,
you better nail it right away.

529
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,231
I'll nail it. Tonight.

530
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,549
Thirsty?

531
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,109
Two whiskies.

532
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,033
As I was saying, no matter
where you go you always find a man

533
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,832
who reminds you of a welcher.

534
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,954
Here's an IOU for 5000 dollars.

535
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,948
I'd sell it to the highest bidder,
but it isn't worth the paper it's on.

536
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,995
I was gonna see you at your ranch
later tonight.

537
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,197
This saves me the trouble.

538
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,354
See me about what?
Some more poker?

539
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,038
Here's the 5000
I owe you Mr. Hardin.

540
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,952
And here's the rest of it.

541
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,118
Just stay seated folks!

542
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,914
Gentlemen, the Major and me
came in peaceably.

543
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,316
That's the way we'd like to go out.

544
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,631
Tarlton, Butler, Clark.

545
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,758
All friends of Hammond.

546
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,468
My ranches.

547
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,109
What's this? A new game boss?

548
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,153
I'm just trying to figure out
where Hammond got 5000 dollars.

549
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,070
None of these ranches
have been touched.

550
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,033
My land has been raided
three times.

551
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,553
- Well, Major Hammond. Hello.
- Hello, Mrs. Hardin.

552
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,755
Would it be too bold if I were
to say it's good to see you?

553
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,719
- You just said it.
- That's right. I did.

554
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,912
Walk to the carriage with me?

555
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,228
- You've been out of town?
- Yes.

556
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,275
You tagged onto the money
you seem so eager to make?

557
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,356
I think I've just begun.

558
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,950
Mr. Hardon was wondering about you.

559
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,710
I just paid Mr. Hardin off.

560
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,719
Good for you.

561
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,478
- You staying at the hotel?
- As of this morning.

562
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,758
We stay here whenever
it's too late to go back to the ranch.

563
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,274
Look us up sometime.

564
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,398
I don't think he'd approve.

565
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,955
Perhaps I'd have something
to say about that.

566
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,432
I don't think I'd approve.

567
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,070
I see. Convention.

568
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,153
Well, good luck to you, Major.

569
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,989
Alright Edward.

570
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,511
Alright, Hammond,
up with them.

571
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,229
Start riding.

572
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,238
- What are you talking about?
- Jack, check the brand on the cattle.

573
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,273
Ok Hammond, move. Move.

574
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,232
Who's in this with your brother?

575
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,349
Give me the belt.

576
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,989
Take over, Ed.

577
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,992
Let's start over.
You and that brother of yours.

578
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,549
Lorna.

579
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,192
- You're home early.
- You're a brave man Cord.

580
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,438
Maybe you'd like to see
Dan Hammond in there tomorrow.

581
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,358
Perhaps you'd like that better.

582
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,229
Come in!

583
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,628
You're certainly inviting gossip
Mrs. Hardin,

584
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,672
breaking into a man's room'
like this.

585
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,953
Your brother's in trouble, Dan.
They've got him at our ranch.

586
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,356
You've got to believe me.
Why would I come here?

587
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,234
That's what I was wondering.

588
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,436
They're beating him within
an inch of his life to find out about you.

589
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,869
They might kill him.

590
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,549
Dan.

591
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,759
They may be expecting you.

592
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,116
Be careful, will you.

593
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,509
Thanks.

594
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,429
Reach!

595
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,189
Get off that horse.

596
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,835
So Mrs. Hardin did pay you a visit.

597
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,555
Interesting.

598
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,839
Where's my brother?

599
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,469
We're not after your brother,
but the man who rustled my cattle.

600
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,078
You saved us the trouble.
Get his gun.

601
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,714
Drop your guns!

602
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,519
Don't any of you move.

603
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,989
- Where's Neil?
- He's not here.

604
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,594
I'll give you five seconds
to produce him.

605
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,756
Al. Get him out.

606
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,750
Alright Hardin.
Now you're gonna take it.

607
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,629
You.

608
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,595
- What's your name?
- Ed Tompkins.

609
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,673
- You his top man?
- I took his orders, Mister.

610
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,711
- Major!
- Major.

611
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,910
- You tell the truth about this.
- He'll tell the truth alright.

612
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,036
- Sy, get these men out of here.
- Let's go.

613
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,998
- How about him?
- Cover him up.

614
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,949
Dandy.

615
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,797
Stick around here until I get back.

616
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,955
- Neil, I'm sorry. Sorry as I can be.
- Thanks for the rescue.

617
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,353
Hardin already had something on you.

618
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,915
You don't have to believe
everything you hear, do you?

619
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,509
No. I'm thinking of the folks is all.

620
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,319
Nothing's gonna happen.

621
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,119
I'm not running away from anything.
I'll report this to the authorities.

622
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,349
Let's go.

623
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,672
I'm truly sorry, madam.

624
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,559
But before I can take this case
to the grand jury

625
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,359
I thought we ought
to meet here informally

626
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,556
to determine whether it was murder.

627
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,876
Mr. Tarleton, excuse me.

628
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,079
As Major Hammond's attorney

629
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,517
I can assure you he'll answer
frankly any question you put to him.

630
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,112
Thank you.
That's very kind of the Major.

631
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,909
But it's fair to inform you
that my office is aware that

632
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,631
Mr. Hardin strongly believed
your client had rustled his cattle.

633
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,833
How could that be possible?

634
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
A man in my position has enemies.

635
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,398
Mr. Hardin was a man
on horseback around here.

636
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,952
I was fair game for any
accusation he wanted to make.

637
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,315
May I be allowed to say something
Mr. Tarleton?

638
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,674
Yes Mrs. Hardin.

639
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,314
Major Hammond
is innocent of everything

640
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,038
and he would not be here now

641
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,237
except that I went to him and
told him my husband and his men

642
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,753
were torturing his brother.

643
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,273
Did you kill Hardin?

644
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,869
Yes.

645
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,072
- Was it premeditated murder?
- It was not.

646
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,709
My brother killed Hardin
in self defense.

647
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,674
- There was no way to avoid it.
- I'll swear to that too.

648
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,354
In any court. Yes sir.
I'll swear that.

649
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,997
As Prosecuting Attorney

650
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,948
I don't see any case
against Dan Hammond.

651
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,279
Major Hammond, madam.

652
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,313
I was rather expecting you.

653
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,869
So I see.

654
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,074
- Thank you for this afternoon.
- Was there ever any doubt?

655
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,989
Sit down.

656
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,791
Major, what are your plans?

657
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,751
- That's very simple
- Money?

658
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,989
Money.

659
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,356
A few years ago I had an idea money
could buy everything in the world

660
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,511
that's why I married Cord Hardin.

661
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,839
Didn't buy me anything worthwhile
except hate.

662
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,515
He was the meanest,
cruelest man I've ever known.

663
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,951
Anything else you might want Dan?

664
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,992
- You're very beautiful Mrs. Hardin.
- Thank you.

665
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,709
Suddenly

666
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,796
I want very much to be beautiful.

667
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,672
I've always wondered
what it would be like.

668
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,671
If I were a free woman again.

669
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,828
- Now you know.
- No. I don't.

670
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,800
I thought there would be
nothing that would keep me here.

671
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,310
I'd be free to go wherever I cared.

672
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,628
Now I know I can't go anyplace...

673
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,269
without you.

674
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,272
Did it ever occur to you
that you never kissed me?

675
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,519
It's something I've tried
not to think about too much.

676
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,229
Until now.

677
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,875
The Conventional Major Hammon.

678
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,670
You have rather
a strange code of honor.

679
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,237
You break every rule in the book
but one.

680
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,870
Perhaps I've even admired you for it.

681
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,758
I'm pretty much of a fatalist.

682
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,431
But I knew from the first moment
I saw you that someday...

683
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,356
And you look like such an angel.

684
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,751
I'm gonna have land

685
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,432
and the land will be covered
with cattle and cotton.

686
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,712
I'll have lumber mills,
grist mills.

687
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,913
And when the railway comes in,
I'll have a piece of that too.

688
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,236
- How do you aim to do that?
- You're gonna help me get started.

689
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,551
- You're gonna dig into files and...
- Discover loop holes in land titles.

690
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,795
- And errors in official surveys.
- There's dozens of them.

691
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,394
You'll get info on everywhere
staggering under accrued taxes.

692
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,431
I'll see that you can
grab them for practically nothing.

693
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,597
- You can make everything legal.
- Legal and above board.

694
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,831
But you might have to back up
some of the grabs with force.

695
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,831
- We've got that.
- We've got everything.

696
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,115
This reconstruction period
is made to order for you.

697
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,510
No Texas Rangers,
very little law.

698
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,717
Sam, you old thief, you told me
once you didn't have the savvy.

699
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,714
I been waiting for someone I trust,
someone strong like you.

700
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,957
The Major will make
a rich man out of you.

701
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,432
I'm gonna have me clothes,
rich cigars, best liquor

702
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,714
tastiest vittles...

703
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,515
I'll pick money off bushes like
I used to pick beans as a kid.

704
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,951
You don't have to reach high,
just soft and easy.

705
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,996
You said it just right Dandy.

706
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,680
I'll have judges, lawyers,
peace officers.

707
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,639
They'll jump traces, cut circles,
follow the word.

708
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,711
They'll see nothing happens
to what I'm building,

709
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,478
'cause I'm building an empire.

710
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,557
And when I'm on the top Sam

711
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,560
People will swear
that I've done nothing wrong.

712
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,513
Nothing wrong at all.

713
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,591
You know, Dan,
I'm not one for tossing compliments

714
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,477
but I'd say you were on the way.

715
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,269
Sorry.

716
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,949
Thanks Sam.

717
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,476
So far it's been slow but sure.

718
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,670
But from now on I don't want
it to go that slow.

719
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,989
Come here.

720
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,191
Here's the spread
Snyderman Ranch, 6500 acres, here.

721
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,637
Dorf Holdings here, Cooper X-B
about 4000 acres here.

722
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,955
- And that's just the start.
- A word of warning, Dan.

723
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,993
I can't go in for
too much skullduggery.

724
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,836
You can't back out now.
You're in too deep.

725
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,192
I got enough on you to hang you.

726
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,229
Dennis!

727
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,356
Dennis!
Get out here!

728
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,958
I got a mandate for you.

729
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,158
The Hammond Land Company has bought
your property for delinquent taxes.

730
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,992
Unless you vacate
within three days

731
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,078
you'll be faced with proceedings
and forcibly removed.

732
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,073
As Marshall of Austin,
I advise you to obey this order.

733
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,278
Marshall Clawson,
if you try it they'll be shooting.

734
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,950
We can make trouble for you...
A lot of trouble.

735
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,109
What do you mean no?

736
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,868
Dan Hammond offers you
a third interest in cattle profits

737
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,393
for the next five years.

738
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,758
You want to tell him
something for me?

739
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,236
You better not say it Layton.

740
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,599
Get off my land.

741
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,869
Al?

742
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,348
You'll pay for this!

743
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,154
Thank you, Major.

744
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,830
I've been thinking about that
Bronson case against me judge.

745
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,078
How did you plan to handle it?

746
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,635
That's funny, I was just
going to ask you.

747
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,309
Dismiss it.

748
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,076
- Throw it out.
- Very good recommendation sir.

749
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,791
I'll never forgive him, Ira.
Never.

750
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,918
Legal trickery, that's what it is.

751
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,594
Through legal trickery
I lose my ranch, everything.

752
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,718
My cattle rustled, house burned,
and I can't prove anything.

753
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,230
What is it the power of the law
can't touch?

754
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,238
I can't understand it.

755
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,509
Our son...

756
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,469
The soldier we were
so proud of...

757
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,154
We've got to do something about this.

758
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,709
Hello Neil.

759
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,036
You look like a man
with something on his mind.

760
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,789
That's right Dan.

761
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,389
Spill it.

762
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,032
I have come on my own account.

763
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,396
- Ma and Dad don't know anything.
- Make it short.

764
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,312
Dan, you're running away
with yourself.

765
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,996
I know when we came back you
had no idea of doing all this

766
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,230
- turning all of these people out.
- I said make it short.

767
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,389
Alright Dan.

768
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,312
I just can't believe you alone
are responsible for all these things.

769
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,000
I think there's someone else.
I think it's that Hardin woman.

770
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,755
Look. That's enough from you.

771
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,519
A woman like that, with all
that gossip going on about...

772
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,351
Get back to the Circle H.
And keep away from me.

773
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,758
I'm gonna stop you Dan.

774
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,836
That's a man sized job Neil.

775
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,199
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

776
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,670
That's the only way you figure things.
Gun against gun.

777
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,752
I'll tell you one thing
little brother.

778
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,671
Don't expect any quarter from me.

779
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,718
Don't worry.
I'm not asking for any.

780
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,078
Well, they're making a fight of it.

781
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,709
Tarleton.

782
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,429
My brother.

783
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,114
My own brother.

784
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,713
Alright. I'll make it tough on them.
I can't back away now.

785
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,029
Why not?

786
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,669
Because when is started out
I had two ideas.

787
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,718
To build a Western empire

788
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,030
and to make you
the greatest lady in Texas.

789
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,679
For the first time in my life
I know what it is to love a man.

790
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,960
That's why I'm afraid of
what might happen to you.

791
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,159
Let's get away from here.
New Orleans, anywhere.

792
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,992
I want the empire, honey.

793
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,794
More than you want me?

794
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,036
One doesn't go without the other.

795
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,596
Dan you haven't told me everything.

796
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,234
I want you to go to Zona Libre.
Wait for me there.

797
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,868
I'd rather stay here with you.

798
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,595
Take the stage to Brownsville
cross the river to Matamoros.

799
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,235
- You're expecting trouble?
- I didn't say that.

800
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,758
Will you do as I ask?

801
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,632
Haven't I always Dan?

802
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,429
So, I've got to know that
every man here will back me up.

803
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:57,357
If you'll testify in court against
Dan Hammond when the time comes.

804
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,796
Each of you may be risking your life.

805
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,793
Hammond and his riders
aren't going to take this lying down.

806
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,036
If we can't get action legally

807
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,599
we'll take the gun too.

808
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,437
I'm sorry Ira, but
if we have to we will.

809
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,399
I understand Frank.

810
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,399
You have your job to do.

811
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,315
Now that I know each of you
will stand with me

812
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,038
I can leave for Washington
tomorrow morning.

813
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,238
We've got to have action.
Federal troops.

814
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,477
Troops who'll ride the border,
have police authority.

815
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,199
As soon as I get back,
I'll campaign

816
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,231
for the reestablishment
of the Texas Rangers.

817
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,754
That's it gentlemen.

818
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,918
Ira, you and Neil stay.

819
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,349
Jim.

820
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,198
Legal authority for me
to ask for your resignation.

821
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,269
Read it.

822
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,472
- What's in back of this?
- I don't trust you.

823
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,316
I didn't ask you to come here.
I don't know why you came.

824
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,432
As soon as I come back, I'll give you
a hearing if you still want it.

825
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,034
- Meanwhile...
- Suppose I don't stand for this.

826
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,554
Let's have your badge please.

827
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,829
Pick it up.

828
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,031
You heard what the man said?

829
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,509
Now get out.

830
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,709
Ira.

831
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,713
I'm going to ask Neil to take
this job until I get back.

832
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,549
I'll take it.

833
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,829
Come on Dad.

834
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,792
You think it's bad, eh?

835
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,917
- Even worse than you figured.
- How much worse?

836
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,752
Tarleton is leaving for
Washington in the morning.

837
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,638
He's got people behind him.
He could stir up agitation.

838
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,150
He's even asking for
Special Federal troops.

839
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,476
He wants the Texas Rangers back.

840
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,829
Thanks Jim.

841
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,874
Incidentally, I'll take care of you.
You won't lose.

842
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,349
Thanks Dan.

843
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,519
Get the light Dandy.

844
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,190
I'll take that rig Mr. Tarleton.

845
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,353
Good evening Frank.

846
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,034
I want to talk to you.

847
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,598
- Hello Dan. Let's go in the house.
- Let's take a walk. It's better.

848
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,552
Borden, drive the rig around back.

849
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,758
Frank, what is it?
Who is that with you?

850
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,229
Just some friends.
Everything's alright dear.

851
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,318
- What do you want?
- Let's take a walk.

852
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,638
- Frank?
- Dad!

853
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,479
- Dad!
- I'm alright Jane, Dick.

854
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,400
Just some friends.
Nothing to worry about.

855
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,639
You're not going to Washington.
Not tomorrow or any other day.

856
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,194
Dan, you've lost all sense of reason.

857
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,118
I'll tell you another thing.

858
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,711
- You'll resign your office.
- No, I'm not.

859
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,792
I've had you dead to rights
a couple of time and let you off.

860
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,474
I'll not make
that same mistake again.

861
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,795
I haven't the time
to stand here and argue.

862
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,718
I suggest you be sensible.

863
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,434
I'm not like these men you've
been terrorizing.

864
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,512
I'll use all my influence
to destroy you.

865
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,148
- I'll never give up on you.
- You do as I say...

866
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,038
Dandy, you fool!

867
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,149
Frank!

868
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,229
Frank!

869
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,472
Judge. I don't even know why
we're having a meeting. It's obvious.

870
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,633
Mrs. Tarleton, so far there's
not a shred of concrete proof.

871
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,829
Proof?

872
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,318
I'll go on declaring again and again
it was Dan Hammond's voice I recognized.

873
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,589
Recognized?

874
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,393
With all our respect for you,
that's not sufficient.

875
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,748
Sure it's sufficient!

876
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,998
If you weren't prejudice in favor
of Hammond, you'd do something.

877
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,991
Yes. This will be like
every other time.

878
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,752
We'll stay here all day
and nothing will happen.

879
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,230
I'll throw you both out if you
make another out of order comment.

880
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,269
I'm sorry. These things
are so unpleasant...

881
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,312
It's a dirty, rotten disgrace.

882
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,994
The best public official
Austin ever had murdered.

883
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,633
What are you gonna do about it!

884
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,311
Mrs. Tarleton swears
it was Dan Hammond.

885
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,799
Sure it was Dan Hammond.

886
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,638
You can't arrest a man
just because somebody says...

887
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,671
Mrs. Tarleton ain't just somebody.

888
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,513
Judge Smythers won't issue a warrant.

889
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,994
- He says there's not enough evidence.
- We're not waiting for evidence.

890
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,355
Mrs. Tarleton's word
is good enough for me.

891
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,438
What are we waiting for?

892
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,470
They want me for a killing
I didn't commit.

893
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,228
I can't figure out what
Dandy was thinking about.

894
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,035
One trigger happy kid ruins
all my plans.

895
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,231
This is something new for Austin.

896
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,959
Alright Hammond! Up with them!

897
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,438
- You're coming with us.
- Gentlemen...

898
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,835
Stay out of this. You're lucky
we're not after you.

899
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,309
Hold it!

900
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,468
Put those guns away.

901
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,994
Come over here Dan.

902
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,279
This isn't the way
we're gonna do it.

903
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,716
If my brother is guilty,
he's gonna get a trial.

904
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,076
There's a question of his guilt?
There ain't no question.

905
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,872
Is this town gonna be run
by you Hammonds?

906
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,593
I am acting Marshall
and I'll make my orders stick.

907
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,148
- We'll take the law away from you.
- You just try it.

908
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,512
You just try it.
Let's go Dan.

909
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,877
Neil! That mob means business.
We got to get Dan out of here.

910
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,148
Let me have a gun.

911
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,715
- What if they break down the door?
- They'll not break down anything.

912
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,716
- You gotta give me a gun.
- No gun.

913
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,996
Tell them they'll be no lynching
even if we have to shoot them.

914
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,189
Tiny!

915
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,671
Take Dan to the basement
of St. David's church.

916
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,156
When things quiet down we'll
take you to Houston. Get going!

917
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,830
We got to pile everything
we got against that door.

918
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,669
Hold it Major.

919
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,989
Sit down Major.

920
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,877
You'll be a lot safer down here.

921
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,634
It sure seems odd
you're being my prisoner.

922
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,638
I can't get used to it.

923
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,992
Tiny, don't give it a thought.

924
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,599
- No hard feelings?
- None.

925
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,231
I sure wish we'd stuck together.

926
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,357
Over at the Circle H, I mean.

927
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,838
It wasn't in the cards.

928
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,271
Mind if I ask you something?

929
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,949
Go ahead.

930
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,591
Something happened to you.

931
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,789
Major, I...

932
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,595
Go ahead and say it.

933
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,114
Somewhere you lost ideas
like pity and mercy

934
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,435
and understanding.

935
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,717
It was like you was trying
to fill the whole world around you.

936
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,470
What's it all about?

937
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,396
I'm not just certain.

938
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,517
Something deep inside me.

939
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:24,189
Maybe it's cruelty and ambition
together, a driving force.

940
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,519
Maybe it's because I want
to be the biggest man in the state

941
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,670
but I don't know how to do it
any other way.

942
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,955
Alright Tiny.

943
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,118
Get away from those stairs.

944
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,119
This ain't the war Dan.
You better give me that gun back.

945
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,069
Major!

946
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,354
Take my horse.

947
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,589
Major please.

948
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,112
Ira, somehow it doesn't seem right.

949
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,517
Father against his own son.

950
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,149
Would it be better
brother against brother?

951
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,511
No Mother. This time it's not
Neil's job. It's mine.

952
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,278
I'll bring him back for trial.

953
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,112
I don't know what to say.

954
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,877
I don't know what to ask for
in my prayers anymore.

955
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,313
Neil. I want you to know,
I'll be waiting.

956
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,152
- You speak English?
- Yeah.

957
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,153
Can you tell me where
Dan Hammond's office is?

958
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,478
- What do you want to know for?
- I'm his father.

959
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,956
That two story adobe over there.

960
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,389
Thank you.

961
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,749
Hello Dad.

962
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,749
Hello son.

963
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,718
This is kind of unexpected.

964
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,115
Dan, you're going back with me.

965
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,357
You know that's impossible Dad.

966
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,029
You'll back with me and
return everything you've taken.

967
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,194
I'll go back
but in my own sweet time.

968
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,715
I got titles to everything I own.
I'll not give up anything.

969
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,954
You'll give everything back
and stand trial for murder.

970
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,194
Give me your gun Dan.

971
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,638
Look around for Mrs. Hardin.

972
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,872
You've done your last killing Dan.

973
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,949
So you say?

974
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,309
I'm not Tiny trusting you,
or Tarleton without a gun.

975
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,313
Drop your gun Neil.

976
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,953
Just step back here Mrs. Hardin.
Don't make any noise.

977
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,952
Where'd you tie your horses?

978
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,109
Dan!

979
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,829
Dan!

980
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,713
Dan!

981
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,549
Honey...

982
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:15,150
I guess we'll have to wait a while
to build our empire.

983
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,309
Dad, I...

984
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,749
Dan.

985
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,949
No!

986
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,635
- Looks good, huh?
- Looks wonderful!

987
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,312
It'll be the first Texas herd
into the railroad at Abilene.

988
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,351
Ought to make some kind of history.

989
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,637
- I'm proud of all of you.
- Be seeing you.
