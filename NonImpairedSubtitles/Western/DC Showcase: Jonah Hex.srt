1
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,798
My name is Red Doc and I can whip any men
in the house and ride any filly in the place.

2
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Give me a fresh bottle,
the good stuff

3
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:01,444
and don't keep a tip
I don't like you.

4
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,100
Big Boy. I am Madame Lorraine.

5
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:24,900
I'm ready to see you got the guts.
But it will cost you.

6
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,900
On a horseback hanging from my chandelier
you name it!

7
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,200
I hope your aim improves.

8
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,507
You think I'm too drunk, don't you honey?

9
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,560
Come over here and sit by me.
I'll show you what I can do.

10
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's make it comfy first.

11
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,108
Get rid of him. And make sure noone sees you.
Like always boss.

12
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,001
- I know who you are. You are the Jonah Hex.
- Congratulations.

13
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,500
I can shoot six bottles off
a fence and not miss a one.

14
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,666
Who gives a damn?

15
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,867
I could take it!

16
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,000
- seen him?
- Can't say that I have.

17
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,150
Are you sure?

18
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,940
A-Ha

19
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,900
Put a drink on the bar and go away.

20
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,300
- I have seen him.
- Talk.

21
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,193
I'll help you. Will you help me?
What kind of help? Enough money to leave town.

22
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,100
Got me a little paper round.

23
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:40,400
Madame Lorraine, she picks the well-heeled ones
they go upstairs...

24
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,901
...they are never seen again.

25
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,593
Take your reward.

26
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,026
Hey bartender...
Set up the house.

27
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,022
Hey, cowboy. How would you like to trade
that drink for some real fun water upstairs?

28
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:18,283
- You ask me because I'm so handsome?
- Cos I think you can afford a good time.

29
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,424
- How about we both get comfortable?
- I'm looking for a dead man named Red.

30
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:36,044
Oh, a dead man!
Now Why would I know anything about a dead man?

31
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,923
- You wouldn't hit a lady?
- You ain't no lady.

32
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,777
Drinks are on the house.

33
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,335
- You hit me.
- Hard as I could.

34
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:52,001
Only gonna ask this once:
Where is Red?

35
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,494
He's gonna be a little wraith.

36
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,381
Oh man,
You and your rats smart bussiness, ain't you?

37
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,956
Wait! We could be partners.
I don't mind splitting the take.

38
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,200
- You can't leave me here alone!
- You ain't alone. You got plenty of company ...

39
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,901
... And you know hell everybody there.

40
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,888
