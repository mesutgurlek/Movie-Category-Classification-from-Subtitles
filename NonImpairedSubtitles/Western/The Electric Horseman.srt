his boot and he won't even help.

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,835
- All right, here.
- Thanks.

Hey, how about a little coffee?

6
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,280
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?

7
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,758
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.

8
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,916
Got a little somethin' to go with that?

9
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,076
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.

10
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,715
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.

11
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,037
Button his shirt, put his arm
in the sleeve and get the wire.

12
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,675
- His hat. Where's his hat?
- I'm buttoning his shirt.

13
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,758
Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.

14

Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.

I'm all right. Let me go.

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,588
- Is he gonna make it?
- Sure. Don't he always?

No.

- And it beats havin' your legs braided.

use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?

113
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,395
You think he's worth coverin'?

114
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,555
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...

115
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,992
...but there's just a lot of "yup"
and "shucks", and stuff like that.

116
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.

117
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,710
See you downstairs.

118
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,632
Bernie... So, they don't want us
to talk to the cowboy.

119
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,639
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!

120
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,835
Excuse me, please.

121
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,597
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.

122
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,956
Excuse me, could you tell me
if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?

123
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,438
No, he's not listed.

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,592

- Thank you. It's Indian.

126

Oh, it's lovely.

127
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,159
Why does Ampco say absolutely
no interviews with Sonny Steele?

128
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,159
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.

129
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,997
That don't really
mean anything, you know.

130
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,193
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.

131
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,835
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes
he loses the best part of himself.

132
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,349
What is the best part of himself?

133
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,149
- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have <i>you</i> known him?

I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.

144

Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.

Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay,
so just behave yourself.

Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.

148
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,469
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...

149
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,388
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.

150
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,159
Foggy Tate's wife Louise
gave me this handkerchief.

151
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,717
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!

152
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,039
Come on. This is a serious thing to these
people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.

153
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,958
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.

154
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,152
So don't tell no jokes,
don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?

155
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,590
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.

156
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,392
John, you had a question.

157
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,672
Do you anticipate opposition
to the takeover of Omnibank?

158
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,156
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.

159
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,559
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.

160
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,956
We've made a generous tender offer
for the Omnibank shares.

161
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,389
We're confident they'll accept it.

162
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,433
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump
outta that seat. You have a question?

163
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,312
For Mr Broderick.

164
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,911
Bud, you've played opposite just about
every great motion-picture actress.

165
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,828
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?

166
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,319
That depends. What part of the body
are you talking about?

167
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,357
Print that. I dare you.

168
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,553
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late
to the press conference?

169
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,952
Ha... Well...

170
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,798
I'd like to apologise for that.

171
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,590
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.

172
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,556
And we lost her, too.

173
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,309
Do you in fact
eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?

174
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,752
Well, ma'am, I eat
steak and eggs for breakfast.

175
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,997
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.

176
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,954
You were three-time
Worid Champion Cowboy...

177
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,798
Five.

178
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,515
Five-times Worid Champion Cowboy,
and now you're selling cereal.

179
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,870
How do you feel about that?

180
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,997
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.

181
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,918
You are all invited
by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...

182
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,556
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?

184
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,959
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?

185
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,198
After you circle, you stop
on your mark, stage left...

186
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,630
...lean forward in the saddle,
face the audience, wave...

187
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,069
Where's the horse?

188
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,835
Bring in the damn horse.

189
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,156
Spot, please.

190
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,235
God, he's a beauty.

191
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,433
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times,
applause, applause, applause...

192
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,348
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...

193
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,076
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.

194
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,709
This tendon, it ought
to be braced and bandaged.

195
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,752
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?

196
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,590
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.

197
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,951
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.

198
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,878
How else are we gonna get him up here
with all these lights?

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,719
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!

200
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,429
Sonny, your first line...

201
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,630
"Ranch Breakfast...
a champ's way to start the morning."

202
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,639
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"

203
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,433
"If you agree, don't say anything."

204
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,598
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.

205
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,670
"Ranch Breakfast,
a champ's way to start the morning."

206
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,519
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.

207
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,956
Much bigger. Louder.

208
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,670
"Ranch Bre..."

209
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,908
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.

210
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,836
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.

211
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,989
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.

212
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,348
This it here?

213
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,596
You ain't in no shape
to see no Hunt Sears.

214
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,597
What I gotta do first? Jog?

215
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,874
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed
drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...

216
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,711
Each item will appear in several major
magazines during the month of July.

217
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,628
As an example of our confidence
in the success of these new fashions...

218
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,709
...Ampco will be sending these lovely
models on a one-month tour...

219
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,354
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.

220
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,913
Hey. How are you?

221
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,559
Well, then let's...

222
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,116
Carol's interested in commercials...

223
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,596
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?

224
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,950
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.

225
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,957
Get him a short horse.

226
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,198
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?

227
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,551
That question about the merger -
who the hell was that guy?

228
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,071
That was Cross, the Washington bureau
of the <i>Times</i>. He's connected to Treasury.

229
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,430
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.

230
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,712
Sonny, here's a couple I'd
like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.

231
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,513
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.

232
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,552
Sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year.

233
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,309
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.

234
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,797
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.

235
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,436
He sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.

236
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,472
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.

237
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,195
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.

238
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,993
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.

239
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,192
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.

240
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,279
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.

241
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,474
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it
with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.

242
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,513
Why not just take a picture of Grace in
front of that picture of me and the box...

243
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,473
...with a picture of me on the box,
holding a picture of me...

244
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,149
Then you got Grace
and a whole bunch of pictures of me.

245
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,272
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.

246
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,550
I bet it's shorter.

247
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,477
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?

248
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,398
Hello, Sonny. It's about time
we finally met, isn't it?

249
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,956
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?

250
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.

251
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,514
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.

252
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,110
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.

253
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,630
But he don't belong
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.

254
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,276
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most
natural place in the worid for any of us.

255
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.

256
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,115
Let's give him a drink!

257
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,993
Rising Star represents
a substantial investment.

258
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,192
You can be sure
we've entrusted his care to experts.

259
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,756
Well, I don't think
them experts are so expert.

260
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,957
Mr Steele, would you please sign this
picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.

261
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,550
Look, why don't I make an appointment
with Mr Sears's secretary...

262
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,797
Why would you put that horse
on a stage with dancing girls?

263
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,388
- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to <i>him</i>.

264
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,389
It sells products, Sonny.

265
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,753
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.

266
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,917
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.

267
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,157
All them lights blinkin' and winkin',
and girls...

268
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,475
Sir, I used to rodeo.

269
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,828
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.

270
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,159
To who?

271
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,999
This is a conversation
we might have some other time.

272
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,996
Would it matter?

273
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,430
What matters is that you fulfil
the requirements of your contract.

274
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,473
Which don't include your passing
judgment on corporate policy.

275
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,998
Nothin' in that contract
about me ridin' toy horses.

276
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,429
You're not in rodeo any more.

277
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,835
Actually, you're more famous now,
aren't you?

278
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,635
Your face is on millions of boxes,
on billboards all over the country...

279
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,955
...people want your autograph...

280
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,117
What I'm talking about
is that you voluntarily accepted...

281
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,152
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...

282
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,910
...that more than a handful of cowboys
would give their right arm for.

283
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,118
You're right.

284
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,674
I don't want just to be right.

285
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,555
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.

286
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,150
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden
is waiting over by the earthmover.

287
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,397
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.

288
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,636
You bet.

289
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,389
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.

290
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,519
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?

291
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,473
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.

292
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,797
Wendell handles all that, babe,
you know that. Come talk to me.

293
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,480
How <i>is</i> old Wendell
who can't find a stamp?

294
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,834
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels,
please. Tall glass.

295
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,514
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.

296
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,516
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?

297
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,793
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.

298
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,673
All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson <i>that</i>.

299
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,713
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.

300
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,594
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.

301
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,836
I want you to sign these papers.

302
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,555
You don't think I saw you tryin'
to slip out? I left three messages.

303
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,036
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.

304
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,629
Sonny, that judge told you
to sign the papers.

305
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,711
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.

306
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,515
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?

307
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,595
Excuses?

308
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,713
You got somebody now who sits up
all night cos you lost your keys?

309
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,478
Or you got a flat tyre?

310
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,276
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me
to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.

311
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,393
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look
like they hadn't been in your back seat!

312
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,239
Charlotta, yoo-hoo,
you got a mean memory.

313
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,669
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!

314
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,394
That light-up suit
musta given you shock treatment!

315
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,557
I'm talkin' a <i>lot</i> of parties,
and a <i>lot</i> of back seats!

316
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,830
But for back seats, we'd never have met.

317
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,110
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.

318
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,674
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.

319
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,429
You're just walkin' around
to save funeral expenses.

320
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,435
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.

321
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,792
Do you know what your skeleton looks like
in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.

322
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,832
You couldn't get through
a metal detector stark naked.

323
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,871
Give me the papers.

324
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,319
Huh?

325
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,590
Give me the papers.

326
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,160
- For real?
- Give me them.

327
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,870
You look like hell.

328
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,955
Well, you look great.

329
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,796
Hey. Would you come up to my room?

330
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,869
I can't. You just know what'd happen.

331
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,793
Yeah.

332
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,388
Besides, I got somebody
who really likes me now.

333
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,750
Well, it's not hard to do.

334
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,676
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.

335
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,196
Billy-Roy Fix?

336
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,276
Is that right?

337
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,077
I guess there's just somethin'
about us Western stars.

338
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,115
- <i> Mr Sonny Steele, please report</i>...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.

339
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,796
Goodbye, darlin'.

340
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,677
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?

341
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,152
Well, Mr Steele.

342
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,675
After this number,
the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.

343
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,109
And then you and the horse.

344
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,838
Now, listen. You don't start those things
until I give you the cue, yes?

345
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,471
Not now.

346
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,955
Not now! Not now!

347
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,755
Open the curtain.

348
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,239
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!

349
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,750
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...

350
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,519
...but it's too dangerous
to use that horse on a ramp.

351
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,471
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!

352
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,310
He wasn't even supposed to be out there
yet! He's ruined the whole concept!

353
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,232
<i># I gotta run to keep from hidin'</i>

354
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,909
<i># And I'm bound to keep on ridin'</i>

355
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,628
<i># And I got one more silver dollar</i>

356
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,716
<i># And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me</i>

357
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,437
<i># No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch</i>
<i>the midnight rider</i>

358
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,431
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!

359
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,791
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.

360
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,629
Well, he was askin' about
the horse's tendon, and the drugs.

361
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,276
Drugs? What drugs?

362
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,912
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.

363
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,315
They tranquillise the animal
to keep it calm.

364
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,432
And the Butazolidin
they use for the... tendon.

365
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,199
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?

366
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,437
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.

367
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,429
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed
we've used steroids to muscle him up.

368
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,075
Well, are they dangerous?

369
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,036
Well, they make the horse sterile.

370
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,517
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just
a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.

371
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,029
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?

372
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,597
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?

373
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,996
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the worid of illusion.

374
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,509
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.

375
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,596
Jesus...

376
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,919
We're not talking about a horse,
we're talking about a $300 million merger.

377
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,076
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.

378
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,556
If Steele talks to anyone before
he's caught, we have no merger.

379
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,955
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.

380
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,436
If we've mismanaged the horse,
we've mismanaged the corporation.

381
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,473
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?

382
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,398
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.

383
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,875
And get those morons out of here.

384
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,231
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!

385
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,393
We have been advised
by the attorney general...

386
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,035
...that the theft of Rising Star
is grand larceny, a felony.

387
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Should this prove to be a deliberate act,
a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.

388
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,313
At this time, however, our primary concern
is the welfare of our horse.

389
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,637
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.

390
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?

391
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,435
- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not <i>that</i> crazy.

392
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,712
He's been tossed on his head enough
times. Thought about brain damage?

393
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,072
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.

394
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,751
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake
and he'll bring it back when he cools out?

395
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,474
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?

396
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,318
I don't know any answers.

397
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,238
I don't know from brain damage,
from cooling out...

398
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,239
Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some <i>good</i> news, for chrissake!

399
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,476
"Cool... out."

400
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,353
...<i>these days</i>.

401
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,552
- <i> Why'd she quit him?</i>
- <i> Who knows?</i>

402
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,398
<i>Sonny was married in Gus's living room</i>.
<i>And when that woman quit him,</i>...

403
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,829
...<i>well, you know</i>
<i>where Sonny came to cool out</i>.

404
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old</i>
<i>and strange these da</i>...

405
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,197
...<i>well, you know</i>
<i>where Sonny came to cool out</i>.

406
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,880
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old</i>
<i>and strange these days</i>.

407
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,358
Seen Wendell?

408
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,632
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just
runnin' round like crazy people today.

409
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,878
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.

410
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,074
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin'
personal. Were you surprised he did it?

411
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,158
Who, Sonny?

412
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,829
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some
surprises are bigger than others.

413
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,236
Like he gave me this ring one day,
just like that.

414
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,749
Had old Wendell's teeth
fixed for him, too.

415
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,633
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.

416
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.

417
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,796
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.

418
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,591
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?

419
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,589
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about
the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?

420
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,475
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean
is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.

421
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,476
Mesquite.

422
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,035
You wanna drive?

423
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,278
Morning.

424
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,356
Hello.

425
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,799
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.

426
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,712
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.

427
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,752
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?

428
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,359
Oh, five or six dozen.

429
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,596
- Bags?
- Boxes.

430
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,838
Come on, boy. Come on, son.

431
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,270
Just a couple more times of doin' this
and you'll be breathin' just fine.

432
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,391
If <i>I</i> live.

433
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,953
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills

434
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,196
# Round her head

435
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,317
# Glimmer golden hills

436
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,191
Mr Atwater?

437
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,276
You wounded?

438
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,718
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.

439
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,469
- But he was.
- Yep.

440
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,750
From about this high.

441
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,989
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.

442
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,315
Like a flutterin' bird.

443
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,990
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.

444
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,275
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.

445
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,114
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.

446
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,471
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

447
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,956
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!

448
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,550
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.

449
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,073
They told me you'd know
where to find him.

450
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,958
How else would I know
where you were? Huh?

451
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,795
We're real worried about him.

452
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,195
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.

453
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,035
I can't hurt him.

454
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,596
He came here. Covered with a mist.

455
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,872
You know? Like floats atop a river?

456
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,679
And... and it grows into a cloud...

457
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,751
...and it shuts away the sun...

458
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,635
Where'd he go, Gus?

459
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,718
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?

460
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,513
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!

461
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,073
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.

462
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,997
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...

463
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,429
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.

464
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,471
How? How did you find me?

465
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,397
Gus.

466
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,591
Gus Atwater.

467
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,676
Gus?

468
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,629
Gus.

469
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,116
Can I... can I get up now?

470
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,910
Please?

471
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,315
How did you know to get to Gus?

472
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,556
I... interviewed your friends.

473
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,639
Who?

474
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,593
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...

475
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,317
Wait a minute, you hit my face,
you son of bitch!

476
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,075
I'm not gonna stay here.

477
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,349
What did you take the horse for?

478
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,633
You're crazy.

479
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,834
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...

480
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,795
Oh, <i>I'm</i> crazy? You go off with somebody
else's $12 million horse, and <i>I'm</i> crazy?!

481
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,717
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!

482
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,796
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.

483
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,630
Does anybody else know you're here?

484
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,880
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have
any reason to tell anybody anything.

485
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,389
Go away. Go home.

486
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,039
Well, what <i>are</i> you gonna do with him?

487
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,510
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.

488
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,189
And you're not gonna start
your own cereal company.

489
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,274
I mean, what the hell <i>do</i> you want?

490
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,192
Oh, can't you just answer one question?

491
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,112
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...

492
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,754
What do you expect,
sneakin' up like some cat?

493
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,599
I tried to call, but your line was busy.

494
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,189
Do you know how worried your friends are
about you? Wendell and Leroy?

495
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,593
Isn't there something I can tell them?

496
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,678
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?

497
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,474
You want information, go to the library.

498
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,311
I know what you want. It ain't answers.

499
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,274
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?

500
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,234
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.

501
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,114
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.

502
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,279
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?

503
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,834
Honest to hell, you people
are all the same.

504
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,235
There's folks in Africa,
or some damn place...

505
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,794
...you try to take a picture of them,
they'll kill ya.

506
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,629
They figure you're takin' somethin' from
them, and you just got so much stuff...

507
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,274
...and if other people take it all
you got nothin' left.

508
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,914
Well, I don't wanna be no story.

509
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,991
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.

510
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,829
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip
with somebody else's $12 million horse.

511
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,270
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.

512
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,595
But not yours.

513
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,759
I'm nobody's story but my own now.

514
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,396
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?

515
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,438
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?

516
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,439
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?

517
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,428
Look, can't you just do
a working girl a favour?

518
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,950
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck,
tell an honest tale.

519
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,992
I don't want to make up
a story about you.

520
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,395
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

521
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,195
Everybody's wondering where you're going,
why you did it.

522
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,791
The great American cowboy
and the worid-champion horse...

523
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,273
...riding into the sunset...

524
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,188
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.

525
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,596
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!

526
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,070
Come on, son. Come on, boy.

527
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,511
If you think you're gettin' away from me
you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.

528
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,316
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me
what you're gonna do with the horse.

529
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,190
What are you doing?

530
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,997
Oh, my God!

531
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,874
Now it shouldn't take you more
than about 15 minutes to change that.

532
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,788
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call
the cops. I got your license plate.

533
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,194
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

534
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,677
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.

535
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,635
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.

536
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,431
It was from this hotel that Rising Star,
greatest money-winner in racing history...

537
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,189
...and corporate symbol for one
of the worid's largest conglomerates...

538
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,311
...was taken late Friday night.

539
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,638
Yesterday I uncovered information
which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.

540
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,158
<i> Now to raise</i>
<i>the old Stars and Stripes</i>.

541
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,714
<i>Where's that blasted flagpole?</i>

542
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,434
<i>Good gracious! A bird's nest!</i>

543
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,118
<i>How clumsy of me. I hope</i>
<i>I didn't step on your eggs, birdie</i>.

544
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,511
You got any shoelaces?

545
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,234
- What?
- Shoelaces?

546
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,557
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.

547
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,358
<i>By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire</i>...

548
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,473
...<i>I saw Rising Star,</i>
<i>and I encountered Sonny Steele himself</i>.

549
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,715
- What?
- What?

550
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,956
- <i>We talked for many hours</i>.
- What?!

551
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,517
<i>As a result of our wide-ranging</i>
<i>conversation, I formed these impressions:</i>

552
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,834
<i>Mr Steele, in my opinion,</i>
<i>did not take the horse for monetary gain</i>...

553
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,396
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

554
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,270
- Where was he?
- I forgot.

555
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,915
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.

556
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,235
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.

557
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,229
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could
put you right in the middle of the story.

558
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,354
We could guarantee
that you get first crack at everything.

559
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,190
I've already had first crack at everything.

560
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,595
Suppose we made it exclusive?

561
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,395
How about if we gave you
exclusive footage on the capture?

562
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,795
Oh, when are you planning that?

563
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,755
Wanna tell me about that confrontation
with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?

564
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,028
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.

565
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,592
Aiding a felon during the commission of
a felonious act, concealment of a felony...

566
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,075
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.

567
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,273
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take
on the First Amendment, be my guest.

568
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,198
That oughta sell
a whole lot of breakfast cereal.

569
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,835
I'll be around,
if you wanna handcuff me later.

570
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,874
- We <i>could</i> take her to court.
- Have her locked up.

571
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,912
And gain what? The last thing
we need is a female martyr.

572
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,998
At least he didn't say anything
about mistreating the horse.

573
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,714
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.

574
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,957
You "think". It's a chance
we can't afford to take.

575
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,237
Do we have a choice?

576
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,717
We could make sure that if he speaks
to anyone he won't be believed.

577
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,630
Can you get to the media
by the 11 o'clock news?

578
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,838
How the hell did she find him,
we ain't even heard from him?

579
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,599
We sent her over there,
that's how she found him.

580
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,510
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried
to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...

581
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,916
She liked your ring, she liked
my watch, I liked her eyes...

582
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,192
That's how those people are. They tell
you they're your friend, and they use you.

583
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,151
Well, what are we gonna do?

584
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,999
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...

585
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,830
...one of those keno girls that can suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.

586
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,596
<i>10.59 here at KLSG in St George,</i>
<i>and here's Harvey Del Rio</i>...

587
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,111
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep
standin', boy, we'd have this licked.

588
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,639
<i>In Las Vegas, investigators still have no</i>
<i>leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,</i>...

589
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,877
...<i>whose ab duction by Sonny Steele</i>
<i>triggered a massive search</i>.

590
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,276
<i>Ampco officials are expressing alarm</i>
<i>over the welfare of the horse</i>.

591
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,279
<i>According to one, Steele has a long history</i>
<i>of alcoholism and drug abuse</i>.

592
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,234
<i>He's appeared in public in an intoxicated</i>
<i>state on several occasions,</i>...

593
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,635
...<i>and has been abusive</i>
<i>to press and public</i>.

594
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,957
<i>They believe if the horse is to survive,</i>
<i>time is of the essence</i>.

595
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,878
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.

596
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,390
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.

597
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,195
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.

598
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,278
- He isn't hurt?
- No.

599
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,117
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?

600
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,712
Just wonderin'.

601
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,638
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.

602
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,277
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long
time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.

603
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,959
What <i>is</i> the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?

604
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,515
All's I know is he musta had a good
reason, or he woulda been back by now.

605
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,792
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!

606
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,078
You know, they only said
those bad things about him.

607
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,193
They didn't say what's decent. Even
though it is hard to find it sometimes.

608
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,276
How'd you meet Sonny?

609
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,550
Hallie Martin, please.

610
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,995
- What?
- <i>You alone?</i>

611
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,439
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?

612
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,791
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.

613
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,113
It's time for another
wide-rangin' conversation.

614
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,033
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is it you?

615
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,720
Right from the dim glow
of the shrouded campfire.

616
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,795
<i>You maniac!</i>

617
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,115
I broke three nails changing that tyre.

618
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,999
- You want a story?
- Yes.

619
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,555
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.

620
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,479
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.

621
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,036
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.

622
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,314
So if he stopped for the night he should
be within 150 miles of St George.

623
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,034
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.

624
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,390
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.

625
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,876
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?

626
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,117
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate
on Liberty and Cedarville.

627
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,392
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.

628
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,353
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.

629
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,869
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.

630
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,595
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.

631
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,714
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't
prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.

632
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,115
Just don't let him start up
about the horse.

633
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,910
I'm here!

634
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,351
Hey, I'm here!

635
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,675
I'm alone. No troops.

636
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,639
Come on. Come on.

637
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,870
Oh... Oh, God!

638
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,195
I think I've broken my leg.

639
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,710
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

640
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,155
Here. Get your camera ready.

641
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,072
Uh...

642
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,510
Listen, would you mind standing
over here with that background?

643
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,313
No, this is all right. Right here.

644
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,079
But I think it'd be more dramatic
in front of...

645
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,478
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.

646
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,120
Listen, I've been driving all night,
and I'm not used to being talked to like...

647
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,629
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.

648
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,070
What do <i>you</i> call
a man who steals horses?

649
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,759
Have you ever seen this horse race?

650
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,759
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.

651
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,994
I saw him stumble and fall back,
and lose his stride, and pick himself up.

652
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,112
I saw him stretch out
when he had <i>nothin'</i> left to give...

653
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,038
...but he found it... somewhere.

654
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,230
And he won.

655
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,069
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.

656
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,035
He's got more heart, and more drive,
and more... soul...

657
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,552
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.

658
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,717
Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!

659
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,630
They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!

660
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,754
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers
and bute, stickin' him full of needles...

661
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,475
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up,
he's shot full of steroids...

662
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,558
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!

663
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,069
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...

664
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,752
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on
some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.

665
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,077
To say nothin' of what
the horse hisself is missin'.

666
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,553
So...

667
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,110
...so I took him.

668
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,709
Come on, let's go. Get this...

669
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,750
Let's crank up this little hummer
and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.

670
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,716
All right?

671
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,436
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?

672
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,313
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.

673
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,838
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...

674
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,474
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.

675
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,829
And he's one of the best.

676
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,839
He's one of the greatest animals
in the... in the history of... animals.

677
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,989
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.

678
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,272
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.

679
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,514
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.

680
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,432
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.

681
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,792
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.

682
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,875
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.

683
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,673
I gotta tend this horse
and get him movin'.

684
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,712
Listen, can I... can I come with you?

685
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,034
No!

686
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,398
Why? I wouldn't be any...

687
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,078
- Trouble?
- No.

688
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,995
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?

689
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,592
Card. Sometimes you think of something
you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.

690
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,556
Steele, what <i>are</i> you gonna do with him?

691
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,717
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.

692
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,878
Enough.

693
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,117
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.

694
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,356
From doing what?

695
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,070
I'm gonna turn him loose.

696
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,792
What?! Rising Star?

697
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,549
I'm gonna get him back
to where he was, what he was.

698
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,832
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.

699
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,110
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!

700
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,596
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...

701
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,998
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna
have his own shot at it, that's all.

702
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,669
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.

703
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,268
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?

704
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,550
- I know.
- Who else knows?

705
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,956
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?

706
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,640
You know you're gonna
screw up your whole life?

707
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,672
Goddamnit, I'm trying to <i>unscrew</i> it, lady!

708
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,271
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.

709
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,958
- Is it true?
- Nope.

710
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,517
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?

711
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,596
Don't tell me.

712
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,548
She says you take her breath away.

713
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,438
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.

714
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,836
She's, uh, she's pretty.

715
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,315
Yes, she is pretty.

716
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,672
She said that when you two
first met you... Oh...

717
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,598
Wait, that canyon
where you went on your honeymoon...

718
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,995
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.

719
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,350
Goddamn that woman!

720
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,711
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.

721
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,435
That's exactly why I left her,
her and her big m... Or she left me.

722
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,393
Anyway, I'm not goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon.

723
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,435
I have an idea. Let's go into town,
have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.

724
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,710
My treat.

725
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,678
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.

726
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,794
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?

727
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,989
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin'
a mailbox, so if you'd be...

728
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,476
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.

729
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,996
Well...

730
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,671
What do I do? Just take this road
back to the broken tree?

731
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,839
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.

732
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.

733
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,359
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.

734
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,508
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.

735
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,155
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!

736
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,909
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.

737
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,679
<i>Hold your horses</i>...
<i>Hear that about horses?</i>

738
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,475
Les, I am trying to convey a sense
of urgency. I want this on the air today.

739
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,229
<i>OK. KLSG</i>-<i>TV in St George, Utah</i>.
<i>Looks like about 60 miles</i>.

740
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,430
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.

741
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,519
I need a camera crew to meet me at a
place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.

742
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,791
- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- <i>When do you need 'em?</i>

743
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,391
They should leave right now, cos I don't
know when I'll get there or he'll get there.

744
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,511
And they should be prepared to camp out.

745
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,518
I have a feeling this place
does not have a Hilton Hotel.

746
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,474
I mean, this is a place
<i>horses</i> like, Les, and...

747
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,834
Les, when Steele gets there,
he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.

748
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,995
<i>What?!</i>

749
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,272
$12 million worth of thoroughbred
racehorse, loose in horse heaven.

750
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,992
Think you got a story?

751
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,556
<i>Stick with the lunatic, Hallie</i>.
<i>Tape everything. This is gold!</i>

752
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,195
- He doesn't want me around.
- <i>That never stopped you before</i>.

753
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,595
<i>Just find some way to talk to the guy</i>.

754
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,111
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew
and I'll talk to you later.

755
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,950
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?

756
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:27,234
I don't know for sure. I think somebody
may have spotted that cereal cowboy.

757
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,309
Hello?

758
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,796
Hi. Listen, are you, uh...
are you going to St George?

759
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,751
'Less they moved the road.

760
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,873
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.

761
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,831
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...

762
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,872
...two motorcycle cops,
a county marshal and a sheriff.

763
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,198
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.

764
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,231
Expert, huh?

765
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,512
Hey.

766
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,757
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?

767
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,757
I am in as much trouble as you are.

768
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,759
If I go back I'll have to tell them
everything I know. And I mean everything.

769
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,793
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.

770
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,309
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.

771
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,718
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't
divulge sources and expect anybody...

772
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,035
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?

773
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,071
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...

774
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,634
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?

775
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,354
I'd have to tell them about Gus.

776
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,436
I would.

777
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,313
Ohh! God!

778
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,510
What are we gonna do?

779
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,633
Get on the floor.

780
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,354
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.

781
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,160
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?

782
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,670
You stay right there. When I go
out the back, you count to 60.

783
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,394
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.

784
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,432
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!

785
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,632
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.

786
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,832
There's a lake there
at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.

787
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,838
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.

788
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,030
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.

789
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,152
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.

790
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,512
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's
gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...

791
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,393
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.

792
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,670
No, wait! You can't...

793
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,869
That's him!

794
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,518
...28, 29, 30...

795
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,112
...58, 59, 60.

796
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,113
He's in Bundy's Field.

797
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,834
- <i>We can't follow him</i>.
- Ten-four.

798
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,232
He's headin' for the dam.

799
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,829
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!

800
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,994
Go! Go!

801
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,870
Come on! Come on! Go!

802
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,075
All the way! Go! Go!

803
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,476
For chrissake, look out!

804
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,436
Oh, jeez!

805
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,875
- <i>How did he get away?</i>
- <i>On a horse</i>.

806
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,752
<i>On a horse. Find him</i>.

807
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,110
Bring him back here.

808
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,279
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.

809
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,516
Put out a reward - a large one.

810
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,916
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?

811
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,272
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!

812
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,276
Hello?

813
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,996
Hello?

814
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,673
Oh, you made it! You made it!

815
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,276
Hey. There's some witch hazel
in the cabinet over the sink...

816
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,233
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.

817
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,835
I owe you one, buddy.

818
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,756
Is he all right?

819
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,438
Easy.

820
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,713
They didn't chase me. You were right.

821
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,991
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.

822
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,156
You were.

823
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,279
Were you surprised that I got here?

824
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,958
No.

825
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:59,071
It was on the road map. I didn't even
need to ask anybody or anything.

826
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,472
Easy, boy.

827
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,955
It's gonna be getting dark soon.

828
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,474
How long does it take
to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?

829
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,672
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.

830
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,955
What?

831
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,834
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere
for that camper. We'll have to leave it.

832
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,675
- And do what?
- Walk.

833
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,036
<i> I've seen him run</i>.
<i>I saw him stumble and fall back,</i>...

834
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,549
...<i>lose his stride, and pick himself up</i>.
- You bet!

835
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,514
<i>He had nothin' left to give,</i>
<i>but he found it</i>... <i>somewhere</i>.

836
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,760
...<i>and more drive, and more</i>... <i>soul</i>
<i>than most people you'll ever know</i>.

837
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,711
<i>And they hang lights on him</i>.

838
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,912
<i>Trot him round with dancing girls,</i>
<i>ta-da-da-ta-ta!</i>

839
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,238
<i>They'd have him wearin' short pants and</i>
<i>smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!</i>

840
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,716
...<i>stickin' him full of needles</i>...
<i>Look at this tendon. It's all filled up</i>.

841
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,150
<i>He's shot full of steroids</i>...
<i>And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!</i>

842
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,555
<i>So even if</i>...
<i>God, that's what's so damn funny</i>...

843
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,797
<i>Even if they wanted to pass on</i>
<i>them fine qualities, they couldn't</i>.

844
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,437
I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.

845
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,633
And maybe I could find someone that
could take it to the network, like today.

846
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,799
And since you figure it's gonna be
a long trip, that would give us...

847
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,876
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.

848
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,198
That would give us, what,
maybe four or five more days on news.

849
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,350
That way, once you set Rising Star free,
the whole country will be behind you.

850
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,755
Then I'd just have to keep
lookin' back over my shoulder.

851
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,159
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?

852
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:33,951
No.

853
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,753
Well, how do you think
this is gonna end up?

854
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,275
Not on television.

855
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,837
OK, I, uh... respect your position.

856
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,751
I do. I don't understand it,
but I respect it.

857
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,434
A lot of famous people hated publicity.

858
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,115
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...

859
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,680
Albert Schweitzer... Um...

860
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,190
How you doin', partner?

861
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,429
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.

862
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,918
What are we... doing?

863
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,996
Going to sleep.

864
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,670
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.

865
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,315
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.

866
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,155
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?

867
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,430
Wherever you want.

868
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,074
Where the hell are we,
the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?

869
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,558
I'm ready.

870
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,240
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.

871
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,072
When they spot that camper
they're gonna trace it right to him.

872
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,589
What... what are you doin' with that?

873
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,752
This is expensive equipment,
and I'm responsible for it.

874
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,270
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.

875
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,119
There's no escalators out here,
or bellhops.

876
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,198
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.

877
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,914
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.

878
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,996
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.

879
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:55,319
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's,
or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?

880
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,194
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell
do you know about New York?

881
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,035
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?

882
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,831
No.

883
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,635
They got a rodeo there, and it's
a damn big thing. And I've been in it.

884
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,320
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.

885
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,276
Did you stay
for the rattlesnake roundup?

886
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,755
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.

887
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,350
They don't have one. How are you
gonna round up a rattlesnake?

888
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,519
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.

889
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,996
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...

890
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,830
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me,
and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...

891
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,988
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that
thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.

892
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,630
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.

893
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,990
Your horse

894
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,949
Ahh... Here, give me
those glasses, would you?

895
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,350
They're prescription.

896
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,077
You wait here with him
till I get back, ya hear?

897
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,114
But if you're spotted
and you don't come back...

898
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,037
Call your lawyer.

899
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,072
Hello. Can I help you?

900
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,236
Howdy. Uh...

901
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:24,390
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece,
and I wondered if I could use your phone...

902
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,594
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in
a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.

903
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,713
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.

904
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,197
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.

905
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,953
Phone's right there. You help yourself.

906
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,756
Thank you.

907
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,160
- Hello?
- <i>Gus, it's Sonny</i>.

908
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,269
Sonny!

909
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,994
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...

910
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,793
- <i>Sonny!</i>
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.

911
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,071
- I'm in the kitchen.
- <i>People are gonna come, probably police</i>.

912
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,909
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.

913
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,554
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."

914
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,478
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.

915
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,718
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.

916
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,913
When the people ask about the camper,
tell them "Sonny stole the camper."

917
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,873
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.

918
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,311
Oh, uh...

919
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,557
Partner, I'm much obliged
for the use of that phone.

920
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,274
Here. Five oughta cover it.

921
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,356
Mr Steele...

922
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,988
...I don't want your money.

923
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,554
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.

924
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,070
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.

925
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,034
Right now, it looks like
we oughta get you out of this county.

926
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,352
How do you like it so far?

927
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,834
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?

928
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,919
Doin' all right. Got the whole worid
lookin' for that cowboy.

929
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,636
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.

930
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,672
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway -
except for that reward.

931
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,235
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.

932
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,836
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

933
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,713
All right, you're clear. Come on down.

934
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:05,155
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.

935
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,434
The woman put together some stuff -
bread and cake and stew and coffee.

936
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,949
I put a bottle in there
to keep your blood pumpin'.

937
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,150
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.

938
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,478
Listen, there's not many people
you'd trust $50,000 worth.

939
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,512
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.

940
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,556
Come on.

941
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,796
Oh, my God!

942
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,949
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.

943
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,358
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.

944
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,269
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.

945
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:53,997
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.

946
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,830
Put his rib through his right lung,
the guy could hardly breathe...

947
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,756
He still got up and rode
the rankest mare there.

948
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,233
I will never understand why you find
that kind of behaviour admirable.

949
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,830
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.

950
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,036
Hey, Steele?

951
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,991
Sonny?

952
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,554
Norman!

953
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,750
How do you know "Norman"?

954
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,635
I never divulge sources.

955
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,509
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...

956
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,919
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?

957
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,557
Try to put your mind on somethin' else,
make things easier.

958
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,349
Get it off your feet.

959
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,671
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?

960
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,711
- What?!
- The national anthem?

961
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,391
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.

962
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,273
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?

963
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,998
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?

964
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,509
I used to be a psychology major.

965
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,837
"America the Beautiful",
that's an easy tune to carry.

966
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,633
Why don't we sit down
and sing it together?

967
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,716
# O spa...

968
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,116
# O beautiful for spacious skies

969
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,268
# With amber waves of grain

970
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,914
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!

971
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,670
# For purple mountains majesty

972
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,715
# Above the fruited plain

973
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:44,638
# America, America...

974
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,349
Halloween.

975
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,592
Ha...

976
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,750
Hal-louise?

977
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,920
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.

978
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,150
That's not your name.

979
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,116
Alice.

980
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,278
My name is Alice.

981
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,917
My kid sister used
to holler at me after school.

982
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,069
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"

983
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,594
So they called me Hallie.

984
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,950
Alice Martin.

985
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,830
That fits you.

986
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,711
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.

987
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,637
I'll bet you did.

988
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,230
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.

989
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,389
You know what you need?

990
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,953
A pair of proper shoes.

991
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,189
Hey.

992
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,876
Where are we?

993
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,716
Are we lost?

994
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,236
Lost?

995
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,238
No.

996
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,033
Good night... Alice.

997
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,949
Good night, Norman.

998
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,549
If she's with Steele, then the network
will know where they are.

999
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,035
That's the news department, Mr Sears.

1000
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,516
I don't think they'll want
to give out that kind of information.

1001
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,916
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...

1002
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,429
...and we can't get
a simple piece of information?

1003
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,916
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.

1004
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,271
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.

1005
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,510
What are you doin' up?

1006
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,796
Nothing much.

1007
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,039
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?

1008
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,675
Oh, I wish it were that easy.

1009
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,316
I don't sleep.

1010
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,515
Ever?

1011
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,870
How old are you?

1012
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,995
Not in front of... in front
of people I don't know.

1013
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,590
You slept last night.

1014
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,870
The hell I did.

1015
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,915
Not in front of a stranger.

1016
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,079
What, are you afraid of what you'll
look like with your mouth open?

1017
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,230
You have a mean streak in you.

1018
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,232
No.

1019
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,316
No, I don't.

1020
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,395
I still pinch and bite.

1021
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,872
OK.

1022
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,156
Morning.

1023
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,435
I'm still here.

1024
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,839
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.

1025
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,399
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.

1026
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,910
And there's cheese.

1027
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,516
Cheese.

1028
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,270
You're all bent. Are you sick?

1029
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,956
No. Just bent.

1030
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,518
Well... Here, have some cheese.

1031
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:09,153
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

1032
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,753
I know. I'm the one that said it.

1033
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,078
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...

1034
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,112
...some parts wake up faster than others.

1035
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,433
Broke parts take a little longer, though.

1036
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,354
I, uh, I would've called a cab,
left you a note.

1037
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,756
You know, "Call me",
with my phone number.

1038
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,119
Actually, I'd have left my answering
service number, just stuck it on the...

1039
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,992
What's the matter?

1040
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,715
I wanna know what's botherin' you.

1041
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,470
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.

1042
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,270
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.

1043
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,871
The problem is you get up slowly, I get
up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.

1044
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,879
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.

1045
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,070
I was up before the sun
ever hit your room.

1046
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,192
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.

1047
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,669
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?

1048
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,190
Good mornin', Alice.

1049
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,716
Good morning.

1050
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,629
You're right. We are in a hurry.

1051
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,948
But let's say we lighten up a bit.

1052
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,635
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.

1053
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,594
We're gonna be travelling together
a little while...

1054
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,714
Oh...

1055
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,149
There. All lightened up.

1056
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,231
...<i>temperatures are dipping</i>
<i>below freezing in the high plateau</i>.

1057
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,238
<i>On the national scene,</i>
<i>the search for Sonny Steele</i>...

1058
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,399
...<i>is concentrated in central Utah</i>.
<i>KLSG switchboards have been jammed</i>...

1059
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,717
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.

1060
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,513
Hell, you can name anything anything.

1061
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,357
It's like those people who
look up at the stars and see things.

1062
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,393
Chickens and bulls and chariots
and snakes and shit...

1063
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,119
What's this guy's name who's supposed
to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...

1064
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,629
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.

1065
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,399
Probably there was a falls here once.

1066
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,437
This whole land was under water
millions of years ago.

1067
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,793
If you go... if you go slow,
take your time and you look real close...

1068
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,072
...you can find skeletons of these
weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...

1069
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,395
...long, long gone.

1070
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,952
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...

1071
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,154
...everything, was under an ocean once.

1072
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:28,398
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...

1073
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,833
...that you know all that. It's interesting.

1074
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,280
Well, this country's where I live.

1075
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,870
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.

1076
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,231
Oh, yeah, you do.

1077
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,871
How'd you know to find me?

1078
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,595
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there,
but you were the one that found me.

1079
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,712
Just had a few hunches
and got a head start.

1080
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,952
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.

1081
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,996
Let's go.

1082
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,070
Here, give me that stuff here.

1083
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,476
OK, I want you to put
your left foot right here.

1084
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,591
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.

1085
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,473
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.

1086
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,592
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.

1087
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,234
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.

1088
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,797
We're not gonna get anywhere
with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.

1089
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,997
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.

1090
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,315
That's it. There you go.

1091
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,716
Here.

1092
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,435
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.

1093
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,437
<i> Doyle Hicks</i>.
<i>Go ahead, you're on the air</i>.

1094
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,074
- <i> Is this Doyle?</i>
- <i>Turn down your radio</i>.

1095
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,237
<i>Yeah, well, I just wanna say</i>
<i>that what Sonny Steele done</i>...

1096
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,272
...<i>is wonderful news</i>
<i>for the animals of this country</i>.

1097
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,791
<i> If somebody's poisoning an</i>
<i>animal, a person should try and stop it</i>.

1098
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,480
<i> I'd have done</i>
<i>the same damn thing myself</i>.

1099
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,559
<i>Them Ampco people</i>
<i>got no right to dope up a horse</i>.

1100
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,234
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?

1101
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,475
- What is it?
- Just notes.

1102
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,318
Can I see 'em?

1103
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,590
They're just my notes.

1104
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,839
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.

1105
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,110
- Well, read 'em.
- No.

1106
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,875
You got a secret?

1107
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,232
"I feel I'm seeing this country
for the first time."

1108
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,949
"Not looking down
from a jet 30,000ft up...

1109
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:32,950
...but from the low angle... of a special
man who means to cross it on foot...

1110
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:38,359
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to
a secret destination... to a private goal."

1111
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:43,958
"To a fairness that he intends
to find in these valleys."

1112
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,598
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.

1113
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,672
Nice.

1114
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,958
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.

1115
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,873
She ordered a camera crew
to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.

1116
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,549
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.

1117
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,148
The sales figures again, exactly.

1118
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,511
In the three days since he took the horse,
office equipment has been as projected...

1119
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,551
The cereal.

1120
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,989
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.

1121
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,274
And by closing time today
they'd emptied the shelves.

1122
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,997
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?

1123
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:42,353
Well, sir, there's something here
that I think you should be aware of.

1124
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:50,235
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.

1125
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,389
Now that's not supposed to be there.

1126
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,750
Or we're not supposed to be here.

1127
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,836
<i>You're</i> lost?

1128
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,789
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.

1129
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,596
Maybe... Do...

1130
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,556
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.

1131
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,474
Oh!

1132
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,916
Here, here...

1133
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,996
You OK?

1134
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,632
Are you all right?

1135
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,830
A- OK.

1136
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,475
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1137
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,792
Maybe you ought to sit down.

1138
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,869
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.

1139
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,514
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.

1140
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,552
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.

1141
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,989
Oh... God, my back.

1142
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,272
Easy.

1143
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,516
Let's take a look.

1144
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:54,515
You just relax, cos we're makin'
good time, don't worry.

1145
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,796
Hold on.

1146
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,433
Here.

1147
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,629
Oh.

1148
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,671
Little hair of the dog.

1149
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,233
Oh!

1150
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,194
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.

1151
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,038
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.

1152
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,236
I won't be long.

1153
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,635
Hi, there. What's your name?

1154
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,278
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.

1155
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,671
You, uh... you taking care
of this place all by yourself?

1156
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,351
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?

1157
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,313
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.

1158
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,036
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.

1159
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:17,711
Every time it snows up at Marysville,
first thing, the phone goes out.

1160
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,796
Where's your car?

1161
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,393
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out,
and my car went on the blink.

1162
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,910
And I, uh... I need
to get a message to my boss.

1163
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,998
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?

1164
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,838
Well, we got a phone at home.

1165
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,474
I bet you could call for me
and get a message to him.

1166
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,115
Could you do that? How much
do you charge to make a call?

1167
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,798
One dollar.

1168
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,878
That's fair. OK, let me
give you the phone number...

1169
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,118
...and when you get him on the phone, ask
for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.

1170
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,356
And tell him you're calling for me...

1171
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,994
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.

1172
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,759
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.

1173
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:01,716
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off
everything. I'll explain when I see him.

1174
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,071
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.

1175
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:09,034
- About the flu?
- No, the <i>crew</i>. I'll write it out for you.

1176
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,799
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?

1177
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,956
Well, it...

1178
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,719
Well, it didn't really break down,
it's just acting...

1179
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,910
And I have to call her boss about it.

1180
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,874
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.

1181
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,037
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.

1182
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,470
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.

1183
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,273
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.

1184
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,910
Found us a spot.

1185
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,359
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.

1186
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,076
Serves you right.

1187
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,672
There's a place we can cross the road
about a mile south.

1188
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,430
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.

1189
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,433
We're that close?

1190
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,269
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.

1191
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,678
Isn't there some closer place where
you guys take horses to let 'em go?

1192
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,553
No. I just usually use the one, myself.

1193
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,632
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...

1194
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,637
Well, you're not. Come on.

1195
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,992
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.

1196
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,916
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.

1197
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:43,474
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.

1198
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,115
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.

1199
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,514
He had a voice that was
just like runnin' molasses.

1200
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:56,359
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."

1201
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,439
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just
havin' been dumped on by some bull...

1202
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,792
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's
voice'd come sailin' across...

1203
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,118
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."

1204
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,754
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.

1205
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,437
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.

1206
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:20,236
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.

1207
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,510
That horse used to ju...

1208
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:27,949
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh,
runnin' right off at the mouth.

1209
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,556
I enjoyed it.

1210
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,152
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.

1211
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,876
It's been a long haul.

1212
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,275
Somethin' bothering you?

1213
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,671
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?

1214
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:14,435
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares,
do you just... do you just do the same?

1215
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,915
What do <i>you</i> think?

1216
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:22,591
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.

1217
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,953
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".

1218
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,310
No. I like you bein' smart.

1219
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,157
It's just sometimes you're so busy
being clever that I don't...

1220
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,552
When was the last time
you were surprised?

1221
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,636
You.

1222
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,276
You were a surprise.

1223
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,751
I told them.

1224
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,871
Wha... Who?

1225
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,917
I, uh...

1226
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,916
I called the network and I told them
you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.

1227
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,555
And I asked them to meet me there
with a camera crew.

1228
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,278
Oh.

1229
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,357
And that's not all.

1230
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,149
Oh, now for the <i>bad</i> news?

1231
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,832
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.

1232
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,599
Well.

1233
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,189
Well, well, well.

1234
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,396
What <i>do</i> you know.

1235
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,915
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.

1236
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,191
Don't be like that. Hit me,
yell at me, slap me or something.

1237
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,675
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.

1238
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:02,396
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?

1239
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,954
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...

1240
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,469
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.

1241
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,832
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.

1242
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,033
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.

1243
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,596
You did it.

1244
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,710
Hey, how about my letter?

1245
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,679
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?

1246
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,756
Oh, please!

1247
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,159
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.

1248
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,033
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.

1249
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,840
- Why?
- I want him at <i>that</i> place.

1250
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,952
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...

1251
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,196
...you did, now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

1252
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,835
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.

1253
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,714
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either
all goin' to heaven or we ain't.

1254
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,435
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.

1255
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,476
Let it finish.

1256
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,068
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.

1257
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,554
I've been hurt. I still get up.

1258
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,470
Thanks for the worry.

1259
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,596
Do me a favour?

1260
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:36,757
Tomorrow... don't take notes.

1261
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,555
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.

1262
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,470
Better get off.

1263
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,908
How soon before we get there?

1264
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,155
We <i>are</i> there.

1265
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,872
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.

1266
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,477
Appears not.

1267
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,637
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?

1268
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,759
They... they must be at another entrance.

1269
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:52,075
Ain't no other entrance.

1270
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,750
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.

1271
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,030
I doubt it.

1272
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,916
Well, where the hell are they?

1273
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,635
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?

1274
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,349
They'd be about 90 miles north.

1275
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,553
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?

1276
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:17,557
You...

1277
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:21,150
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!

1278
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,078
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!

1279
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,829
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?

1280
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,349
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.

1281
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:34,119
When our own investigation
revealed the truth...

1282
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,913
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.

1283
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,039
I don't think there's enough food
to last another night.

1284
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,757
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.

1285
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,315
Well, Star, you wanna
say goodbye to the lady?

1286
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,756
Hey, boy.

1287
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,829
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.

1288
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,952
OK.

1289
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,914
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.

1290
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,759
Only they've never been broke. But
they ain't won no championships neither.

1291
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,796
So when you cross that stallion
and he wants to fight...

1292
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,789
...you remember, you got the blood
on your side. And you can take him.

1293
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,271
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.

1294
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,718
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.

1295
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:04,029
Make somethin' outta yourself now.

1296
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,999
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.

1297
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,076
OK, bye-bye.

1298
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,156
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.

1299
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,630
Oh. Good.

1300
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,629
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

1301
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,439
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.

1302
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,471
What did they say?

1303
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:33,071
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.

1304
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,829
Especially now that Ampco
has reversed its position.

1305
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,439
Yeah, I'll bet.

1306
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,314
They have me going to Paris next
to cover the elections.

1307
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:46,594
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.

1308
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,874
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?

1309
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,238
Yes, please.

1310
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,318
Just a little somethin' for the road.

1311
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,439
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.

1312
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,875
Tell me, Norman...

1313
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,515
...did you think it'd be this tough
to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?

1314
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,391
Ma'am, I had no idea.

1315
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,150
All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.

1316
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:52,598
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...

1317
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:56,110
It'd be nice if you didn't mention
where it was that we let him go.

1318
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,673
Silver Reef?

1319
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,268
Be nice if you didn't divulge <i>that</i> source.

1320
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,437
I don't know, leave out a name like that...

1321
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,353
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?

1322
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,912
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.

1323
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,755
Find me somethin' simple.

1324
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:25,235
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.

1325
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,551
Any bags, ma'am?

1326
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,432
Uh, no.

1327
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,672
Uh, hey...?

1328
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,675
I keep wantin' to thank you.

1329
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,234
But then I keep wonderin' what for.

1330
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,030
I know. I know. Me too.

1331
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:51,515
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel
whenever I see you on television.

1332
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:58,073
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.

1333
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,913
So...

1334
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,996
All aboard, ma'am.

1335
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,840
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.

1336
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:21,035
Have a safe trip back now.

1337
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,514
All charges have been dropped,
and, sources say...

1338
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,633
...the Ampco art department
is hard at work designing a new logo.

1339
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,320
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...

1340
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,555
...nothing further is known.

1341
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:51,434
So ends the bizarre saga
of horse racing's most honoured stallion...

1342
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,028
...and the man who set him free.

1343
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:59,559
Except for one note of thanks
from this reporter to Mr Steele...

1344
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,832
...for his... cooperation
in bringing this story to you.

1345
