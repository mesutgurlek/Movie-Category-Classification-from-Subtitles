1
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,030
Drag it.
- Up and down the street!

2
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,453
Drag it out of town!

3
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,672
Yeah, get rid of him.
- Drag him out of town!

4
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:56,932
Should've hung him!

5
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,157
Drag him out of town!

6
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,441
That oughta help skin him up.
- Drag him!

7
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,277
What are they doing? Who is it?

8
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,744
It's John Cord.
They're dragging him.

9
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,584
Are they killing him?

10
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:59,469
Are they? ARE THEY?

11
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,859
Yes, Ralph, they're killing him.

12
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,929
Make them stop it!
All of you, stop it.

13
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,300
You make them stop it.

14
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:12,660
What about your eyes?

15
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,252
That's enough. That's all.

16
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,200
Who's on the horse?

17
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,948
Me, Tom Powis.

18
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,000
Is he still alive?

19
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:43,816
Yes, sir. But a couple more runs...

20
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,309
Where's Brewster?

21
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:48,755
Right here, Mr Hamilton.

22
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:53,230
You're the law here.
I put you in office myself.

23
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:57,466
What kind of lawman
lets this kind of thing happen?

24
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:02,177
Do you know who that is lying there?

25
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,802
My brother told me.

26
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:08,102
Maybe Douglas didn’t tell you right.

27
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:11,109
That's John Cord. John Cord.

28
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:18,265
You're right, Mr Hamilton,
you put me in office.

29
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,420
Everybody here owes you something,
one way or another.

30
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:28,009
But John Cord came riding in
bold as daylight.

31
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,692
He served his time.

32
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:32,377
The town don’t feel that way.

33
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,005
When he wouldn't leave,
they wanted him hanged.

34
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,350
I said I'd let him off
with a dragging, then head him out.

35
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:47,257
That's John Cord, Mr Hamilton. If
it wasn't for him, you could see.

36
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:52,146
He's responsible for my little
daughter never walking again.

37
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,609
You forgot?

38
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:56,578
I forget nothing!

39
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:01,300
Lift Cord into my wagon -
I'm taking him to my place.

40
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,981
Is that clear?

41
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,662
DO YOU HEAR ME?

42
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:13,195
Do I have to do it myself?

43
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,300
I will.

44
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,600
Don't, Ralph.

45
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,742
I wouldn't, Mr Hamilton.

46
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:22,485
Douglas.

47
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:40,313
You don't know what's good for you.

48
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:46,435
Help me keep this man alive,
so I can keep you all alive.

49
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,359
Better let me strap him to his
horse and head him out of town.

50
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:58,620
If none of you will help me,
my wife and my brother will.

51
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,208
Janice... Douglas...

52
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:07,819
I wouldn't do that!
- That goes for me too.

53
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:10,547
He took this from me.

54
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:14,207
I'll kill anybody
that tries to help him.

55
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:18,303
I'm with Tom. My wife's
in the cemetery cos of him.

56
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,188
My brother's out there too.

57
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:25,411
You can't see my store,
but it used to be over there.

58
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:29,667
His horsemen destroyed it.
You'd see that, if you could see.

59
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:33,295
I never got it started again.

60
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,213
This is for your own good.

61
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:40,014
Go ahead, Douglas,
they won't shoot you.

62
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:43,543
I'm afraid they will, Mrs Hamilton.

63
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:47,537
Your husband refuses to realise
that's John Cord.

64
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:51,851
I KNOW WHO HE IS! I SENT FOR HIM!

65
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,764
All right, Janice.

66
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:55,224
Lie still, John. Otherwise
you're bound to get dirt fever.

67
00:08:56,857 --> 00:09:02,113
Janice Wilson!
You got your hair done up.

68
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:05,400
Lie down. You may have concussion.

69
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:09,123
You always worried about concussion.

70
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:12,781
Heads like mine don't get broken.

71
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:17,094
Please, lie down
till the doctor comes.

72
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:27,352
If you worry about a man's health you
should also worry about his spirits.

73
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,950
You'll make it worse!

74
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:34,538
When a man's getting mad in prison
for five years...

75
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:39,863
...a letter from his girl
can do a whole lot for his spirit.

76
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:45,968
I'm not your girl -
I married Ralph Hamilton.

77
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,700
A new bride?

78
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,349
No, we’ve been married five years.

79
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,526
You didn't waste any time.

80
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,304
I owed you nothing, you saw to that.

81
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,503
I don't know about that.

82
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:14,188
After what you did to Ralph
you think you can help yourself
to his wife?

83
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:18,062
You used to wear my ring -
it's my privilege to kiss the bride.

84
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,393
When you blind another man
you lose your privileges.

85
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:28,845
You think I didn't remember that
every day and night for five years?!

86
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,608
I'd better go and find out
what your... husband... wants.

87
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:43,715
Who is it?

88
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,786
Walk so I can hear you.

89
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,586
Cord?

90
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:06,215
My ears have eyes, Cord...
so does my memory.

91
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,808
Douglas, get out and stay out.

92
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,500
You might need my help, Ralph.

93
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:14,448
When I need you I'll send for you.

94
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:23,150
This Winchester is no longer of use
to me but it keeps my hands busy.

95
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:29,090
The prison was underground but
before I even got used to the light
they handed me your message.

96
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:33,695
You still had eyes.
Did you read it?

97
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:39,175
It's a good rifle.

98
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,499
You didn't bring me 300 miles
to talk about your rifle.

99
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,656
I've got a herd for you to move.

100
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:48,545
A herd? I'm John Cord, remember?

101
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,788
I remember.

102
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:54,733
Nobody would ask John Cord
to move a herd now.

103
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:59,728
Nobody but John Cord could move
a herd this size - 5,000 head.

104
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:04,607
It doesn't look
like you're desperate...

105
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:09,022
...or that moving 5,000 head
of cattle is life or death.

106
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,914
Rooms don't change, bank accounts do

107
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,200
But a man with 5,000 head...

108
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:21,231
They're not all mine. Almost
everybody in Hamilton owns a share.

109
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,539
That herd could make
a dying town live again.

110
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,614
That makes my heart bleed!

111
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,925
I've hated you a long time, too.

112
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,100
But can't we let it be?

113
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,300
Because no-one else would move
a herd for you at this time of year?

114
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,368
If you get them to Fort Clemson
you'll be a top trail boss again.

115
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:49,504
I'll pay you $15,000 in advance.

116
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:53,214
$15,000? Your conscience
bothers you that much?

117
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,977
I need you that much.

118
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,900
What's the matter with Garth?

119
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,235
He’s dealt from the bottom
since this happened.

120
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:14,084
By the time I realised, he had
half my cattle and his own ranch.

121
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,096
He'd like the town
renamed "Garthville".

122
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,074
Well, there's always
little brother Douglas.

123
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,780
He's a green kid.

124
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:30,335
He'd bring 100 head to Fort
Clemson, if he got there at all.

125
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,066
No, you're the man, if you'll do it.

126
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:38,822
The army needs beef for the troops
and the Indian reservations.

127
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:44,078
They're paying good -
I'll pay you good.

128
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,009
I'd be in a position to ruin you
without half trying.

129
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,741
Yes, you would.

130
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,158
Well, I won't do that to you, Ralph.

131
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,469
So I’ll take my torn shirt
and my reputation...

132
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:08,588
Forget the past, Cord!

133
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:14,700
Nobody else has forgotten it!
- Nobody helped them forget it.

134
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,372
You've got to ride trail for me.

135
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:21,221
You’ve got Janice. The score’s even.

136
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:24,759
You can make it. You try.

137
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,936
Mr Cord? Where do you think
you're going?

138
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,142
That's my business.

139
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,800
You turned him down?

140
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,832
What do you expect?

141
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,779
Do you know what it cost
my brother to ask you?

142
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:53,260
I know.

143
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:56,979
I hate you so much it burns my guts.

144
00:14:57,014 --> 00:15:03,283
But if you have to see all of us
Hamiltons crawl, I'll crawl too.

145
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,500
I don't care what you Hamiltons do.

146
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:08,659
You can’t turn him down.

147
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:12,755
You might sleep better
if you squared part of your account.

148
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,816
I spent five years
squaring that account. I sleep fine.

149
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:21,210
You’re not going anywhere!

150
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,341
Even?

151
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:28,984
I can't get mad at a kid
I taught to ride and shoot.

152
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,526
I'm not a kid any more!

153
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,000
Then why don’t you take the herd?

154
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:36,953
You know why - I'm not good enough.

155
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:40,884
Now take the gun. I'll shoot anyway.

156
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:47,995
I wouldn't want to kill you, junior,
you got too much learning to do.

157
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,150
Why, there's Little Johnny!

158
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,500
Little Johnny!

159
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:24,711
George Washington Jeffrey!

160
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:27,533
Where you been all this time?
You remember my kid brother?

161
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:29,281
Thomas Jefferson Jeffrey.

162
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:32,217
Where he’s been is his affair.

163
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:35,021
How's your daddy?

164
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,500
Well, he's been dead for some years.

165
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:43,535
I knew he’d been ailing but...
I’m sorry, Little Johnny.

166
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,261
It looks like
you've been ailing too, eh?

167
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,425
What he looks like is his affair!

168
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,062
Who are you boys working for now?

169
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:56,876
We ain’t. We quit Garth’s place.

170
00:16:56,911 --> 00:17:00,347
The fool thinks he can take his herd
to Fort Clemson this time o' year.

171
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,081
Most of them rivers is bone dry.

172
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:08,264
For once, George Washington
is right about something.

173
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:14,158
Only one trail boss might make it.
But he wouldn't try, eh, John?

174
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:18,313
I thought maybe that was what
Little Johnny came back for.

175
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:22,507
What he come back for is his affair!

176
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,619
You boys interested in a drink?

177
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,824
Interested? No.

178
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:31,942
All he’s interested in
is when you’re gonna ask us.

179
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:36,157
George Washington...
Thomas Jefferson...

180
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,813
Getting worse
every time you set foot in it.

181
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:52,162
Like every place in town, waiting
for the undertaker to bury it.

182
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,839
Whiskey.

183
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,228
Cork the bottle!

184
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:11,000
You're not drinking in my saloon.

185
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:15,712
They ain’t no trouble, Mr Grainger.
They just came in.

186
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:20,338
Cork the bottle. We're fed up
with your troublemaking.

187
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:26,266
I'm having a drink with my friends,
Grainger. Maybe we'll have another.
Then I'll leave.

188
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:28,111
Now listen, Cord...

189
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:32,589
Wash off the warpaint, Grainger.

190
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:39,778
You were once glad to have his trail
herders spend their wages here.

191
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:43,510
That was before he let his
drunk men ruin us all.

192
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:48,426
A trail town should be able to
protect itself, wouldn't you say?

193
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:52,721
Yeah. Yeah, l’d say.

194
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:57,200
I heard you were back.
Glad to see you.

195
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,349
Hello, Garth.

196
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:02,709
Set up a bottle for my old cooks.

197
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:06,407
Join me, I've something
to say to you.

198
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,600
They roughed you up a little, huh?

199
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,091
That what you had to say?

200
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,550
Did you turn Hamilton down?

201
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,540
Maybe.

202
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:29,610
I suppose he told you
I'm moving herd tomorrow.

203
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,134
He mentioned it.

204
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,981
We rode a lot of trails together,
I learned a lot of things from you.

205
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,781
You can forget ‘em.

206
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:44,688
Some things a man doesn’t forget
- like John Cord’s rule for herd drinking.

207
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:49,412
"Carry a keg of whiskey
for the men to drink in camp.

208
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:52,416
"It keeps them from wrecking
an innocent town."

209
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,386
No-one seemed to remember that
at the trial.

210
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:02,800
If my herd gets to Fort Clemson,
Hamilton and the town are ruined.

211
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,893
Are you asking my help?

212
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:09,408
I believe in buying insurance,
plenty of it.

213
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:15,188
What do you say?

214
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,258
There's no end to it, Cord.

215
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:22,673
Between us we can build the biggest
cattle empire in this country.

216
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:27,005
I'm not interested in cattle empires.

217
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:35,158
But the Fort Clemson drive,
you got yourself a trail boss.

218
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,100
You can write your own contract.

219
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:40,499
I'm not interested in money, either.

220
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:42,434
Let's invite the boys over
to celebrate the partnership.

221
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:46,617
No. I want to keep it quiet.

222
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:47,824
We move tomorrow.

223
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:50,208
I'm not leaving with you.

224
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:52,342
What are you giving to me?

225
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:54,123
I'll join you in three days.

226
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,228
The trail boss rides with the herd.

227
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,983
Head for Horsethief Creek tomorrow.

228
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:03,181
I'll stay behind
to see we have no competition.

229
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,390
Fair enough.

230
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:18,310
You going trail herding again?

231
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,625
LOOK OUT!

232
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,355
Don't turn around, John Cord.

233
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:30,459
You're gonna get it where
your men gave it to my daddy...

234
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:33,140
in the middle of the spine.

235
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:40,399
I squeeze the trigger, and
I'm the biggest hero in Hamilton.

236
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,668
Johnny ain't got a gun!

237
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,622
Keep pouring for 'em.

238
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:10,344
I'm gonna pick up my horse
at the sheriff's. I'll see you.

239
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:15,102
Who's there?

240
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,324
It's Cord.

241
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,783
You got yourself a trail boss, Ralph.

242
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:27,474
What changed your mind?

243
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,924
Sounds like you’re following
a coffin, Douglas.

244
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,902
Garth's moving his herd.

245
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,809
He was supposed to.

246
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:46,770
We got a trail boss that can feed a
herd on tumbleweed, water it on mud,

247
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:50,542
...and get us there with more cattle
than we started with!

248
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:54,545
That OK with you, little brother?

249
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,591
How many men have you got?

250
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:59,200
Ten good men on the ranch.

251
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,264
We’ll need some for homebodies.

252
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,257
I'll need all the men I can get.

253
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,100
We’ll line up some vaqueros.

254
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:10,335
I want these men to ride with me too.

255
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:15,038
My husband doesn't read any more!

256
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,214
Let's hear the list.

257
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:24,140
Tom Powis. Rex Cogswell. Jim
Whittaker. Paul Corbell. Dan Quince.

258
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:28,262
The men who dragged you
through town. Do you want revenge?

259
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,613
I want those men.

260
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,513
Some of them were good
men on the trail, Douglas.

261
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:36,472
When Tom Powis had both his arms...

262
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,786
Cord's your trail boss!
Do as he says.

263
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,461
If you want them, we'll get 'em
- it's their herd too.

264
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:47,966
I want you, too, Douglas.

265
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:53,534
You're making a big mistake,
Mr Cord.

266
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:59,144
Cos I got both arms and both eyes,
and I'm still young.

267
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,766
I want you to ride with us, Ralph.

268
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:05,970
I should’ve shot you
when I had the chance!

269
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,706
No, I think it's an act
of great kindness.

270
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:13,980
I don't want long months
waiting here for news.

271
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:18,213
I'll ride. I may even be
some use riding night herd.

272
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:22,310
Darkness is a great equaliser
for a blind man.

273
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,281
Cord...
- You’re going too.

274
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,497
Can we be ready in three days?

275
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,300
Three days?!

276
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:33,099
We’ve got to get there first, Cord!

277
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,306
Is this my show?

278
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:41,566
It's your show.

279
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:56,053
To the herd, to the drive...

280
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,542
...and to John Cord!

281
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,698
Mr John Cord.

282
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,770
What are you two doing here?

283
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,201
Uncle John, don't you know me?

284
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,885
Ain't she growed some?

285
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,002
Sandy Jeffrey!

286
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,557
You might grow into something
to interest a man after all!

287
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:33,345
Something to interest you?

288
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,250
Remember you promised to wait
for me to grow up?

289
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:41,120
Didn't you boys think
it was too late for a drive?

290
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,045
With you we'd go in winter!

291
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,481
We can't leave my granddaughter
in Hamilton.

292
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:49,220
I can carry my weight on a drive.

293
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,085
Blackmail! Take her on cook's louse.

294
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,520
But I'll eat dust all day
and ride the drag!

295
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:59,615
I got somebody pegged for that job.

296
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,646
Still fond of horses? You can work
in the remuda with the wranglers.

297
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,173
Just like old times, Little John.

298
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,481
HOLD IT!

299
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,891
Down there.

300
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,817
Do as he says.

301
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,333
Cord?

302
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,247
Here.

303
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,988
All the men you wanted.
Douglas?

304
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,767
The boys from our ranch
and Aruzza's vaqueros.

305
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:29,174
I am Juan Aruzza, Senor Cord.

306
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:32,320
My men and I will ride with you
and follow your orders.

307
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:35,796
I know your people. They'll do.

308
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,754
Gracias, senor.

309
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,555
And these are...
- I know, the pride of Hamilton.

310
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,419
You know the rules of the trail...

311
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:47,970
I'd like to say something, Cord.

312
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:50,720
On the trail my men call me Mr Cord!

313
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:53,968
I've not put in my bedroll, Cord.

314
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:57,470
Say your say, Powis.

315
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:02,331
We agreed to ride with you
for Mr Hamilton's sake.

316
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:08,769
It's easy to see why you picked us
but we'll take anything you hand out

317
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:14,370
...as long as you do your level best
to beat Garth to Fort Clemson.

318
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,770
If you have any other notions...

319
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:18,354
Finish, the day's short.

320
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:21,070
If you have any other notions,
we'll kill you.

321
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,274
Is that all?

322
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:27,359
Anybody else
itching to make a speech?

323
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,074
All right, let's get going.

324
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:33,158
Bedrolls in the wagon,
line up for work orders.

325
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,945
Mr Cord?

326
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,114
Ma'am.

327
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,620
Will you give me my assignment now?

328
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:59,275
You've got your assignment -
taking care of your husband.

329
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,320
Butcher that one.

330
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,694
That's one of the best in the herd!

331
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:27,870
He's a stampede maker.
Let the chuck wagon have him.

332
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:43,520
That's the lead steer for us.

333
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,709
A most majestic animal, senor.

334
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:49,816
I take him up to point.

335
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,702
Get ready to move.

336
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:11,920
One moment, son.
You've forgotten something.

337
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,784
I didn't forget.

338
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,697
All right, get it over with.

339
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,709
Almighty God.

340
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:27,371
Thou knowest these men
who bow their heads before Thee,

341
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,364
hard working, God-fearing.

342
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,913
They beseech that Thou go with them
on this arduous journey.

343
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:42,027
We ask for guidance and blessing
for man and beast. Amen.

344
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,225
All right, Thomas Jefferson,
let her roll!

345
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,670
ONE HUNDRED!

346
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:58,459
A HUNDRED IT IS!

347
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,301
You drag riders, tighten up the gap!

348
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,470
Want us to choke to death?

349
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:28,022
Get up where you can head off trouble

350
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:39,370
We got 'em off to a good start.

351
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,904
Have your riders trim the flanks,
it's widening out.

352
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:06,820
He expects us to ride drag
and eat dirt all the way.

353
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:11,104
We'll eat dirt one way or another.

354
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:16,554
Maybe he just remembered that
both of us used to ride point.

355
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:25,826
Uncle John!

356
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:33,548
All my life I've dreamed of riding
trail with you, all grown up.

357
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:38,518
Riding with me means doing your
job - you belong with the remuda.

358
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,420
Forget the "Uncle" -
you're too grown up for that.

359
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:44,277
All right!

360
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,771
Mr Cord!

361
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:09,620
What is it, Mrs Hamilton?

362
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:12,994
It's Ralph - he insists on riding.

363
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:18,092
Why shouldn't he? A man needs
to feel the wind and sun on his face.

364
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,471
Is that all?

365
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:25,714
Mr Cord...

366
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:30,083
...do you think we'll make it?

367
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,895
Who can tell?

368
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:47,920
You sure picked a cosy spot
for our midday rest.

369
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:50,869
We'll bed down here.

370
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:53,020
We've hardly done half a day!

371
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,739
If I'm not back by dark, see that
they don't scatter or crowd too much.

372
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:02,520
Just how much time are you planning
to donate to Garth?

373
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:04,655
Aruzza, take charge till I get back.

374
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:48,132
Excuse us, boys.

375
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:54,676
Sit down.

376
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,280
Missed you.

377
00:38:07,672 --> 00:38:10,407
I've been looking for you all day.

378
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:14,003
The Hamilton herd's
three days behind you.

379
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:16,220
Who's taking them?

380
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:17,820
I am.

381
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,807
You?

382
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,360
Roping two saddles at once!
Aren't you spreading your influence
a little too far?

383
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:32,936
Keep going east and you'll hit
Horsethief Creek in ten days.

384
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,670
Where are you taking them?

385
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:35,970
Northeast.

386
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:39,395
Isn't Dismal River bone dry?

387
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:46,415
No. They'll be able to smell it
but it'll be too thin to plough
and too thick to drink.

388
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:52,342
Those cows will go berserk. A sight
a man would enjoy seeing, eh?

389
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:58,234
You stick with your herd,
and I'll join you after the Dismal.

390
00:39:33,424 --> 00:39:39,556
# As I walked out
in the streets of Loredo

391
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:44,555
# As I walked out
in Loredo one day

392
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:51,052
# I spied a poor cowboy
all wrapped in white linen

393
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:57,514
# All wrapped in white linen
as cold as the clay. #

394
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:16,018
What lies ahead, John?

395
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,210
Go northeast.

396
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,270
The herd seems peaceable.

397
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:28,434
They still like my voice.

398
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,270
John, I...

399
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:35,288
I was wondering...

400
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:38,092
Is it a starry night?

401
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:43,554
Yeah, there's plenty of stars.
The moon's coming up.

402
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:49,121
You'd better put this on
- it's getting cold.

403
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:53,152
Good night.

404
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,194
Good night, John.

405
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:09,704
# Oh, beat the drum slowly
and play the fife lowly

406
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:17,107
# And may the dead march
as you carry me along

407
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:24,548
# Take me to the green valley,
there lay the sod o'er me

408
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:31,789
# For I'm a poor cowboy
and no' have done wrong. #

409
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:39,625
Wrangler.

410
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:42,055
WRANGLER!

411
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:45,520
Looks like he's been ridden hard.

412
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:47,707
Feed him.

413
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:50,820
He's covered a lot of territory.

414
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:54,272
Then rub him down.

415
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:58,173
Wrangler...

416
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:15,847
Is that you, Little Johnny?

417
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:18,520
What are you doing up at this time?

418
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,820
Waiting to see if you're hungry.

419
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,732
No, thanks.

420
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:38,034
I put your bedroll over there,
George Washington built you a fire.

421
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:43,368
You being off on your own,
we figured you'd need it.

422
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:50,020
You know, John, there's nothing much
we wouldn't do for you...

423
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:53,714
What's the matter, Thomas Jefferson?

424
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:57,282
We'd stick by you
till hell froze over.

425
00:42:57,317 --> 00:43:02,937
But if you're aiming to lead
them fine steers to ruination...

426
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:07,340
...we're walking out, so help me.

427
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:14,952
When I need a preacher,
I'll send for him.

428
00:43:51,655 --> 00:43:54,220
What are you doing out here?

429
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,620
I want to talk to you.

430
00:43:56,655 --> 00:44:00,659
Everybody has something
to say to me tonight.

431
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:04,859
John, it was a mistake
for me and Ralph to come.

432
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:11,847
I want you to send us home.

433
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:15,635
Why?

434
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:18,447
I'm afraid.

435
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:24,184
I'm beginning to...
to remember things.

436
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:29,335
What's wrong with remembering?

437
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:07,620
Seems you're always with the cattle.

438
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,825
Seems they're better to be with.

439
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,163
Sounds like the old John Cord.

440
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:14,466
When will we get 'em to water?

441
00:45:33,495 --> 00:45:34,726
You've been avoiding me.

442
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:38,011
There aren't enough hours in the day.

443
00:45:38,046 --> 00:45:40,405
Is that the only reason?

444
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:45,607
Is that why Sandy was complaining?
She's in love with you.

445
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:49,635
Sandy? That's hero worship.
She'll get over it.

446
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:52,835
When are we gonna tell Ralph?

447
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,370
When the time comes.

448
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:56,420
It's because of John Cord.

449
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:59,435
We've had enough of John Cord.

450
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:10,234
We're finished.
We cut out our cows. We're leaving.

451
00:46:10,425 --> 00:46:12,507
We thought you oughtta know.
- What are you getting at?

452
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:14,500
Our few'll do better at home, alive.

453
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:18,120
John Cord will get to Fort Clemson.
His herds always make it.

454
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:21,145
He lost the race before we started.

455
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,920
And he won't catch up.

456
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:26,754
He will.
Never been a trail boss like him.

457
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:29,953
He took the job to get even with us.

458
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:31,320
He's out to ruin us.

459
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:33,710
Maybe. But he won't do that.

460
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:38,353
Trail driving is his life.
It's what he was born for.

461
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:44,950
It might be in him to destroy us,
but not the cattle. Not them.

462
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:51,003
If you believe that, Mr Hamilton,
you stay with him, but we're going.

463
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:43,022
ARUZZA!

464
00:47:52,178 --> 00:47:56,003
ARUZZA!

465
00:47:56,038 --> 00:48:00,099
Hold it! Nobody cuts out
without my permission.

466
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:04,443
If you lost your stomach, go home,
but the cows stay.

467
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:09,051
I signed to deliver 4, 000
head of cattle, with or without you.

468
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:12,848
Aruzza, get those cows
back in the herd!

469
00:48:13,998 --> 00:48:15,620
The food stays with the drive.

470
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,020
You want us to starve?

471
00:48:17,058 --> 00:48:20,267
You want to go, that's your business.

472
00:48:32,038 --> 00:48:36,259
We can't spend the day eating,
we got a herd to move.

473
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:40,263
Little Brother, take charge.
Head due north.

474
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:44,075
North? We...
- Keep on till midnight and drive them.

475
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:50,472
Don't get too comfortable tonight -
we start tomorrow before sunrise.

476
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:25,874
That's a good way to get shot!
We were to meet at Horsethief Creek.

477
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,870
I'm not joining you.

478
00:49:27,905 --> 00:49:29,820
Something up?

479
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:33,795
I'm going to do my best
to beat you to Fort Clemson.

480
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:38,578
What changed your mind?

481
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:42,190
I can't lead 5,000 cattle
to their death...

482
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:45,672
...no matter how I feel
about the owners.

483
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,433
That's mighty noble of you.

484
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:51,710
Someone can write ballads about you.

485
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:56,675
And what am I supposed to do?
Fold my arms and let you pass me?

486
00:49:56,908 --> 00:50:01,675
If I can pass you fairly, I will.
From now, it's up to each of us.

487
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:07,192
You've no complaints. The head
start puts the odds in your favour.

488
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:11,153
You still heading for Dismal River?

489
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:16,717
There's no water there. We're headed
for Horsethief, like you.

490
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:19,610
Thanks. Thanks for telling me, Cord.

491
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:28,032
We could ride out and cut him down.

492
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:34,242
Doesn't matter if he gets back to
his herd. He said all I need to know

493
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:39,237
Notice how set he was
on us going to Horsethief Creek?

494
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:40,407
Yeah.

495
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:46,196
He joined me in the first place
to make sure we headed there.

496
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,798
He came tonight to make double sure.

497
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:58,001
You know what I think? I think
he knows Horsethief Creek is dry.

498
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,605
All right,
we're heading for Dismal River.

499
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,401
First we crawl, then we gallop.
It makes no sense.

500
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,193
We should have quit this afternoon,
like you said.

501
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:23,520
He'll kill us all, the cattle too!

502
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:26,155
On the trail, he's the boss.

503
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,206
I'd like to string him up
and relieve him of the job.

504
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,178
You flaunt a good deal of courage
behind my back, wrangler.

505
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:57,201
Are you calling me a coward?

506
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,959
Read your own meaning.

507
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,114
We hit the trail in three hours.

508
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:25,602
Aruzza!
I checked the Dismal, it's dried up
so we'll go to Horsethief Creek.

509
00:52:25,637 --> 00:52:27,358
He's lying.

510
00:52:29,535 --> 00:52:32,900
He didn't go to Dismal
or Horsethief.

511
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:38,760
He's cooking up some deal with Garth
- I know because I followed him.

512
00:52:39,195 --> 00:52:43,120
Next time you leave the herd
without permission, don't come back.

513
00:52:43,165 --> 00:52:46,158
That all you got to say, Mr Cord?

514
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:50,320
No, there's something
you need to understand.

515
00:52:50,355 --> 00:52:58,160
The tough herding is ahead of us.
If you think it's been hard up to now
and you want to quit, speak up.

516
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:04,116
I've had all the Cord herd-drive
I want.

517
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:08,164
Thomas Jefferson,
get him his bedroll.

518
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:12,620
When you get to Hamilton,
tell my wife...

519
00:53:12,638 --> 00:53:17,360
Hamilton's dead. I'm going to
Fort Clemson for a new start.

520
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,165
At least one of us will get there.

521
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:21,920
You were working into a good man.

522
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:24,358
Let him go.

523
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:34,773
Anybody else?

524
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:05,688
Could be I was wrong. Maybe that gun
I saw in Garth's hand wasn't an act.

525
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:08,287
Maybe it wasn't.

526
00:54:21,097 --> 00:54:23,283
A beautiful sight, senor.

527
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:25,470
Have we two days to give 'em?

528
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:29,497
I don't know. We gotta get the herd
to Fort Clemson.

529
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:33,701
There's no sign of Garth
watering his herd here.

530
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:39,506
If he took them to the Dismal after
my warning, we got two days and more.

531
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:32,026
Isn't she beautiful?

532
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:34,429
Very beautiful.

533
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:36,520
What are you gonna do about it?

534
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:40,020
We'll talk at the end of the trail.

535
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:41,911
Cord? I'm getting
to know your horse.

536
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:44,670
Something's worrying you.

537
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,294
Worrying me? No, nothing.

538
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:51,220
A man could be worried
about the plains and not be ashamed.

539
00:56:51,316 --> 00:56:54,308
The cows will get you to the Pecos.

540
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:58,052
Odd, how a man
can't change his ways.

541
00:56:58,087 --> 00:57:04,469
Not a man like you. Nor me.
When we reach Fort Clemson,
I'll just keep on going.

542
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,820
What are you talking about?

543
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,652
A blind man's no use on a ranch.

544
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:12,475
You and Douglas run it,
run it and share it.

545
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:18,085
I'm offering you all I've got.
But get the cattle through.

546
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:29,667
Some things a man is born for...
and some things don't belong to him.

547
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:34,913
You don't have to bribe me, Ralph.
I'll get the herd through.

548
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:00,820
That makes twenty-seven.

549
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,270
You want me to...?

550
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,717
No, that's my job.

551
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:43,420
What's wrong? Nobody hungry?

552
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:45,672
Too tuckered out.

553
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:48,107
Hang on. We'll make it.

554
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,320
You, er, mind if I eat with you?

555
00:58:55,355 --> 00:58:57,683
Sit down.

556
00:59:31,717 --> 00:59:34,020
You see, senor, what I see?

557
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:36,672
The Pecos! We made it!

558
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,483
The Pecos! The Pecos! Water!

559
00:59:39,518 --> 00:59:40,520
Water!

560
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:43,152
Water!

561
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:20,620
Never knew you fiddled, Cogswell.
You never have before.

562
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:24,868
I didn't feel like it before,
but I do now!

563
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:29,301
Only a mile to Tumbleweed
and two saloons.

564
01:00:29,497 --> 01:00:33,120
Those saloon keepers
entitled to some of our money?

565
01:00:33,137 --> 01:00:35,482
That's right. They are!

566
01:00:35,517 --> 01:00:38,682
Cord said to give Tumbleweed
a wide bunk.

567
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:42,926
Time to stop orders from
Mr High-and-Mighty Cord!

568
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:44,820
Do we tell him
what to do with his orders?

569
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,750
You said the word.

570
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:48,620
And about time.

571
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:53,527
Hey, trail boss!
We wanna have some words with you.

572
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:13,297
We figure you didn't mean
the order we can't go into town.

573
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:14,420
I meant it.

574
01:01:14,457 --> 01:01:19,122
Will you let us go peaceful,
or do we have to shove you?

575
01:01:19,157 --> 01:01:21,420
We'll do it, believe me.

576
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:25,124
Five years ago a drunken spree
wrecked your town.

577
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,768
You want me to let you do the same?

578
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:29,820
We won't hurt Tumbleweed.

579
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,322
We're decent people.

580
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:35,412
Decent people wrecked your store.

581
01:01:35,447 --> 01:01:39,565
They didn't want to -
they were just blowing off steam.

582
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,781
These men are different.
I vouch for 'em all.

583
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:47,963
After two months' trail,
nobody's different.

584
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:51,051
You want a drink,
here's all you want.

585
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:56,855
Now, get out of our way.

586
01:01:58,367 --> 01:02:00,320
The next man to step forward...

587
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:05,409
All right, Cord, we're coming.

588
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:16,407
Wait, you crazy fools!

589
01:02:16,597 --> 01:02:19,395
Listen to me. Listen to me!

590
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:23,857
Don't do something you'll
be ashamed of all your lives.

591
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:26,212
We just wanna go to town...

592
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:29,330
Quiet! Give Mr Hamilton his say.

593
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:37,517
I made John Cord my trail boss
cos I told you he'd get us through.
Now listen to something else.

594
01:02:37,727 --> 01:02:41,049
Cord also carries his own whiskey...

595
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:46,392
...to stop worn-out saddle-tramps
wrecking towns like Tumbleweed.

596
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:52,457
He forgot his brandy and feelings
when he hit Hamilton five years ago!

597
01:02:52,492 --> 01:02:54,950
I'll tell you what happened then.

598
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:59,835
It was a time like now -
there were more cows than buyers.

599
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:03,212
Cord was driving
someone else's herd.

600
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:07,252
He camped by Hamilton
after six weeks' trail.

601
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:12,652
Broke open a barrel, gave his men
a chance to let off steam.

602
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:19,889
I had my own herd, ready to start,
and no man who raced
John Cord fairly stood a chance.

603
01:03:19,924 --> 01:03:22,772
I was desperate.

604
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:26,254
So while his men
were having their whiskey...

605
01:03:26,457 --> 01:03:29,847
...and he and I
had a friendly drink...

606
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:35,258
...I had one of my men, name
of Garth, crack him over the head.

607
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:39,047
We scattered his herd.

608
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:45,745
And we, not John Cord...
we turned his drunken crew loose.

609
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:53,709
He was the man who made you blind?

610
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:56,261
Yes.

611
01:03:57,047 --> 01:04:01,182
He gave the blow that cost my eyes.

612
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:03,868
I'll tell you how.
- It doesn't matter, Ralph.

613
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:10,572
Time they knew about it.
Time everybody knew.

614
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:16,659
Cord came to Hamilton that night,
too late to stop his rampaging crew.

615
01:04:16,694 --> 01:04:20,434
He came looking for me.
He was suspicious.

616
01:04:21,427 --> 01:04:27,332
I was the one he had trusted.
Now he was suspicious.

617
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:33,454
I had to get mad or admit
he was right. I taunted him
about losing his men and herd.

618
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:38,142
That's what the fight
in Grainger's saloon was about.

619
01:04:39,697 --> 01:04:42,575
You let him go to prison?

620
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:48,254
Yes. I was the guilty one...

621
01:04:48,447 --> 01:04:51,644
...but... I felt sorry for myself.

622
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:56,035
At the time of the trial
I'd just heard I'd stay blind.

623
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,439
I was bitter. Vengeful.

624
01:04:59,077 --> 01:05:02,192
He should've killed you.

625
01:05:02,227 --> 01:05:06,038
There've been plenty of times
I wished he had.

626
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:12,267
Now, if you want to drag me
up and down the camp...

627
01:05:12,857 --> 01:05:15,451
...no-one will stop you.

628
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:19,242
Mr Cord...

629
01:05:19,277 --> 01:05:22,971
...if you want to belt me, go ahead.

630
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:26,665
What I want is a drink.
Who'll join me?

631
01:05:58,197 --> 01:06:01,223
Ralph's back there, Janice. He...

632
01:06:01,817 --> 01:06:04,524
Well, I think he needs you.

633
01:06:16,197 --> 01:06:20,008
The men, at least,
are big enough to say sorry.

634
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,820
You love him very much, don't you?

635
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:28,222
That's none of your business!
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

636
01:06:46,827 --> 01:06:49,227
What is it?

637
01:06:49,617 --> 01:06:55,021
At the beginning, when you wouldn't
let me go, you wanted to hurt me.

638
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:58,021
That's all there was to it.

639
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:01,224
Wasn't it?

640
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:05,320
I deserved it.

641
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:08,059
That was in the beginning.

642
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:11,404
And later?

643
01:07:12,197 --> 01:07:14,597
And now?

644
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:21,320
Mr Cord!

645
01:07:21,399 --> 01:07:23,359
Somebody's coming!

646
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:25,320
It's Whittaker!

647
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,857
Why're you back? Change your mind?

648
01:07:28,892 --> 01:07:31,269
Mr Cord, where is he?

649
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:38,220
Well, Whittaker?

650
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:42,382
I made it to Fort Clemson.
I met Garth in the saloon.

651
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:48,208
He went to Dismal, lost his herd.
He hired gunmen. Asked me to join.

652
01:07:48,243 --> 01:07:49,570
Join with him for what?

653
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:54,420
He's waiting with forty men
at Indian Pass - he wants our herd.

654
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:56,920
Does he want the war
that goes with it?

655
01:07:57,017 --> 01:07:59,921
This is turning into a real drive.

656
01:07:59,956 --> 01:08:02,825
I take it you're back with us?

657
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:05,820
Thanks, "boss".

658
01:08:05,837 --> 01:08:08,226
Let's get ready for Garth.

659
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:17,217
Get down. Get down and keep down.

660
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,730
He's being real smart,
waiting for us in a gully.

661
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:28,933
All right, if he wants to play
games we can play games, too.

662
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:32,247
Let's get at it.

663
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:20,670
He's up there someplace.

664
01:10:20,786 --> 01:10:23,186
I think he's spotted us.

665
01:10:24,276 --> 01:10:28,235
I can do no more.
I need help, Douglas.

666
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,820
You know what to do?

667
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:32,481
Yes, sir. Lead out!

668
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:26,316
Cut 'em down!

669
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,397
Senor! Over there.

670
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:12,257
Come on!

671
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:29,040
Throw your guns down!

672
01:12:35,634 --> 01:12:37,875
Let him go.

673
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:39,444
Put your gun away.

674
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:50,724
Now turn around.

675
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:09,609
Will you put your hands up
or do you want to try me?

676
01:15:09,644 --> 01:15:14,843
You don't make sense, Cord -
you're a cattleman, not a gunman.

677
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:18,220
I've been around, you know that.

678
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:20,450
Do you want to try me?

679
01:15:20,644 --> 01:15:21,884
Yep!

680
01:15:33,224 --> 01:15:38,844
You'll live. It's a pity you think
everybody is as crooked as you.

681
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:43,031
You'd have beat us
if you believed me about the Dismal.

682
01:15:43,224 --> 01:15:46,830
You know, we could
have had that empire.

683
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,044
That's the way it goes.

684
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:11,069
Here's the trail log, Ralph.

685
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:14,029
To date we've lost 182 head.

686
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:17,886
Out of 4,000?
That's the usual Cord miracle!

687
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:20,484
Why the formal report?

688
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:25,498
I'll let you know where
you can send my pay. I'm leaving.

689
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:27,820
Before the herd is delivered?

690
01:16:28,026 --> 01:16:30,989
We're there. Douglas can do it.

691
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:35,427
Next year, he'll do it alone.
A full-fledged trail boss!

692
01:16:35,462 --> 01:16:37,220
Why the hurry to leave us?

693
01:16:37,312 --> 01:16:40,441
I hear there's a lot of grass
in the northwest.

694
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:43,029
I offered you a partnership, John.

695
01:16:43,064 --> 01:16:47,285
Somebody's waiting for me.
I plan to settle down.

696
01:16:49,664 --> 01:16:51,347
First choice?

697
01:16:54,274 --> 01:16:59,325
Well, you know what you want, John,
and you know best what's right.

698
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:07,282
Well, the end of the trail
for us, Ralph.

699
01:17:08,474 --> 01:17:11,449
Boss, say goodbye to the men for me.

700
01:17:11,484 --> 01:17:15,295
They're as good a bunch of boys
as I ever rode with.

701
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:33,287
Janice?

702
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:40,893
I wish you could see what a pretty
little face she has, Ralph.

703
01:17:45,514 --> 01:17:49,302
A good thing for her
you were on this drive.

704
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:07,500
John Cord!

705
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:16,899
That was no way to say goodbye!

706
01:18:16,934 --> 01:18:20,335
Sorry, Sandy.
Someday you'll understand.

707
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:23,542
I understand, and so does Janice.

708
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,935
She can't do anything about it.
I can.

709
01:18:28,134 --> 01:18:31,899
You don't play uncle
to a girl all her life...

710
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:37,338
...and let her think - and think
about you - then just ride off.

711
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:39,820
You have to give her a chance.

712
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,079
What kind of chance?

713
01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:45,717
A chance to go
to the free grass with you.

714
01:18:45,752 --> 01:18:49,279
I'd like a chance to be...
first choice.

715
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:54,354
You got so much growing up to do,
Sandy, and much forgetting too.

716
01:18:54,514 --> 01:18:56,120
Oh, I'll never forget.

717
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:57,420
We'll see.

718
01:18:57,517 --> 01:19:00,316
Will we? You'll come back and see?

719
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,820
I'll come back.

720
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:04,279
You promise?

721
01:19:04,314 --> 01:19:06,220
I promise, if it gets to that.

722
01:19:06,316 --> 01:19:08,717
It'll get to that.
