1
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,561
Put it back, Billy.

2
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,864
I said put it back.
That's nothing for you to fool with.

3
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,961
- Oh, can't I just shoot it once?
- No.

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,940
No, I told you before.
I don't even want you to touch it.

5
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,999
But you let me fire the rifle.

6
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,375
The rifle's for shooting buffalo

7
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,813
and your brother Ben will be proud
you're getting so good at it.

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,181
What you bring down with a.45,

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,752
the skins aren't worth a cent.

10
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,614
- Mr. Masterson...
- Yeah?

11
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,785
Mr. Masterson, what's it like to kill a man?

12
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,859
Well, Billy, I'll tell you.

13
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,597
It's not so good.

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,567
First you're standing there facing him
and you're scared.

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,801
And you want to run and hide,
hide anywhere.

16
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,345
But you don't, because you can't.

17
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,382
And you can't because you know
if you make even the slightest move,

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,281
he's bound to draw.

19
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,177
So you watch his eyes,

20
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,791
praying to God Almighty
he'll back down or say something,

21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,123
anything to give you
a chance to get out of it.

22
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,164
Then you try to make yourself
say something.

23
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,762
But before you can, it's too late.
He's not there anymore.

24
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,634
He's on the floor

25
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,333
and the cuspidor's spilled
and it's running all over him

26
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,740
and people are screaming and they run in

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,302
and want to buy you a drink
and tell you he drew first.

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,777
And then you break away

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,253
and run outside somewhere
where no one will see you and vomit.

30
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,986
Hello, Bat.

31
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,149
- Dave?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,850
- BAT: What are you doing way out here?
- Well, I ain't chasing buffalo.

33
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,692
How are you and the half-wit doing?

34
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,255
Well, looks like all right.

35
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,927
Where do you plan to sell them?

36
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,870
- Hays City?
- Sure.

37
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,833
- How've you been doing?
- Oh, not bad.

38
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,348
I drew a straight flush last week.
Billy's brother there like to died.

39
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,473
I don't know, Bat,

40
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,575
it ain't as much fun
taking him as taking you.

41
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,812
You'll have your chance.

42
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,684
With all these hides I got,
I aim to buy the place back.

43
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,189
Oh, I wouldn't if I were you.

44
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,125
Why not? Ben doesn't want the place,
just the money I drop to him.

45
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,391
You take my advice, now.
I'm an old friend of yours, aren't I?

46
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,729
Sell them hides in Dodge
and stay out of Hays City.

47
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,327
All right, Dave, let's have it.

48
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,531
You didn't ride way out here
just to pass the time.

49
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,131
Well, the fact is,
I've got a message for you.

50
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,939
A sergeant fella by the name of King,

51
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,837
he wouldn't feel too kindly
if you came back to town.

52
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:47,147
- Says he's going to kill you.
- King? Never even heard of him.

53
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,016
Well, he came after you left

54
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,114
but he certainly has heard of you
from Molly.

55
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,523
- Molly Day.
- Oh?

56
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,688
It seems she talked about you too much
and at the wrong times

57
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,961
and the sergeant, he's just fit to be tied.

58
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,492
You know, he paid me $15
to come out here to tell you this.

59
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,834
Molly's all right,
but she means nothing to me.

60
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,066
Tell the sergeant to cool off.

61
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,473
I already did.
I said "Cool off, Sergeant King.

62
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,512
"Bat ain't going to risk
getting himself killed over Molly."

63
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,444
I'm coming in day after tomorrow.

64
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,915
You're crazy, Bat. You're as crazy as he is.

65
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,316
Sell them hides in Dodge City.

66
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,046
All right, Dave,
drink your coffee and get moving.

67
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,353
- Like I say, I'm your friend, Bat.
- Mine or King's?

68
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,589
Hell's fire, Bat.
Sergeant King ain't no friend of mine.

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,924
He's my cousin.

70
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,763
What ails you, half-wit?

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,395
Do you want to get
your fool head blown off?

72
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:43,067
I guess he don't like that kind of talk.
I don't either. Good night, Dave.

73
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,530
Come on, Billy.

74
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,442
- Ben.
- Billy. Take over.

75
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,650
- I bet you thought we'd never get here.
- Oh, I figured you'd be along about now.

76
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,655
Say, buffalo hunting agrees with you.

77
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,351
Well, it doesn't with me.
There's not enough money in it.

78
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,917
- Besides, it stinks.
- Yeah, I see what you mean.

79
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,223
Go on out back and wash up, Billy.

80
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,390
- I want to see what you look like.
- All right, Ben.

81
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,991
- Dick, let's have a bottle.
- Yeah, Ben.

82
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,027
Bat, I sure am grateful to you
for taking Billy along with you.

83
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,907
He doesn't belong in a place like this.
It's too easy for him to get into trouble.

84
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,445
Well, let's have it.

85
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,946
- How did you do?
- Oh, pretty good, I guess.

86
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,420
I've got a wagonload of hides out there.
I notice you didn't change the sign.

87
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,149
All I'd have to do is take that sign down

88
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,487
and have another one painted
and one night you'd waltz in,

89
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,584
play me a little acey-ducey
or one-eyed jacks,

90
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,526
and I'd be out looking for buffalo.

91
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,794
Hey, look, there's Molly.

92
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,096
What's she doing here?

93
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,196
I didn't know Ernie ever
let her out of his sight.

94
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,002
I sure would like to hunt
a little of that quail.

95
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,804
Look, that sergeant's a pretty mean boy.

96
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,038
You better stick to hunting turkey.

97
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,614
Want to see some fun
and get off KP forever?

98
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm way ahead of you. Come on, let's go.

99
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,453
- Hello, Molly.
- Oh, Bat, didn't Dave see you?

100
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,290
Yeah, he told me about the engagement.
When's the happy day?

101
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,853
Please don't joke.
You shouldn't have come.

102
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,525
This whole town's military, Bat,
and the sergeant said...

103
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,762
Come on, come on, sit down.

104
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,997
You've got to listen to me,
you've got to go.

105
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,337
I don't want to see you
get shot up on my account.

106
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,807
I'm not fixing to be.

107
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,846
But I hear you've been doing
a little talking in your sleep.

108
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,507
Well, I guess I mentioned you some, but...

109
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,710
- I like you, too, Molly.
- Maybe you two want to be alone.

110
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,082
Bat...

111
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,447
You Masterson?

112
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,250
Oh, listen, Ernie,
he doesn't mean anything to me.

113
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,558
I told everybody what I'd do
if you came back here.

114
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,893
Ernie...

115
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,994
All right, that's all.
I'll kill the first man who points a gun.

116
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,866
Get him out of here.

117
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,604
- Move.
- All right, give a hand here.

118
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,719
I shouldn't have come here.

119
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,384
- Now, don't go blaming yourself.
- I shouldn't have come here.

120
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,222
Let me take a look at that arm.

121
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,921
No, Dave.

122
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,526
- He was my own flesh and blood.
- He was shooting at me.

123
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,401
Go on, Dave, you've got things to do.

124
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,443
Sit down.

125
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,344
Bat, you've got to
light out of here right now.

126
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,712
This is a soldiers' town.

127
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,151
Whenever one of them gets it,
no matter how hated he was,

128
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,351
the whole platoon suddenly
falls in love with him.

129
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,861
- Yeah, how about Dave?
- Oh, he'll cool off.

130
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,363
Listen, this whole thing will
blow over in a month,

131
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,367
but it won't if you stay here,
so go any place.

132
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,032
Go to Dodge City, your brother Ed's there,

133
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,594
and don't worry about this place
or your skins.

134
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,300
I'll sell them for you
and deposit the money.

135
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,634
Oh!

136
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,110
Put it down, Billy.

137
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,872
All right, here you are, my friends.

138
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:50,143
Here's a nice green fat cigar there for you
and a vote for Sheriff Regan, I hope.

139
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,850
Now, you look like an intelligent man,
I can talk to you.

140
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,182
Talking to some people is just
like pouring water on a duck's back.

141
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,778
Comes in one ear and out the other.

142
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,019
A cigar, there, my friend,
and a vote for Sheriff Regan, I hope.

143
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,116
Thank you, my friend.

144
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,060
Here you are... Oh, wait a minute.
Not you, sonny.

145
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,122
You may not be too young to smoke
but you're certainly too young to vote.

146
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
Now go on home
and cut that kindling, boys.

147
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,364
You go with your big brother.

148
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,013
- Looking for the Marshal?
- Yeah.

149
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,023
Well, he should be back any time now.

150
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,893
He's over at the church,
working up the Bible vote.

151
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,431
What?

152
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,060
Running against a man like Regan,
he shouldn't be singing the <i>Rock of Ages,</i>

153
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,001
he should be throwing them.

154
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,199
You're welcome to wait in my office
if you care to.

155
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,571
Thanks.

156
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,522
Have a seat.

157
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,859
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm the doctor.

158
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,529
And I'm getting a little old
to be hauled out of bed every night

159
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,399
to sober up drunks and set broken jaws.

160
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,596
That's why I'm backing Ed Masterson.

161
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,370
Maybe if our so-called fair city gets
cleaned up, I can get a little sleep.

162
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,038
If you're not too tuckered out,
how about re-bandaging this arm?

163
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,908
Sit over here.

164
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,424
Gunshot.

165
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,291
- How did it happen?
- Just bandage the arm.

166
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,825
Well, Sam, you missed another meeting.
What's your excuse this time?

167
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,799
My excuse is I wasn't there.

168
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,835
Bat, what the devil are you doing here?

169
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,530
Getting my arm bandaged, I hope.

170
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,700
- Hello, Pauline. Sit down, folks.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

171
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,243
- Good news travels fast.
- Yeah.

172
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,940
It was nothing I could help, Ed.
I'd never even seen the man before.

173
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,483
Oh, Bat, I want you to meet my fiancée.

174
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,713
This is Pauline Howard and her father,
the Reverend Howard.

175
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,084
- This is my brother.
- How do you do?

176
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,055
Bat Masterson.

177
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,854
No one's introduced us. I'm Sam Tremaine.

178
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,588
It's going to be one beer for this dressing.

179
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,254
- You've got it.
- Bat Masterson.

180
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,958
Now, I've heard that name recently.

181
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,764
Oh, Reverend, Bat was mixed up
in that shooting in Hays City.

182
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,895
Oh?

183
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,769
Now, I never connected
that name with you.

184
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,139
Well, we don't often
run into each other, Reverend.

185
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,837
What's all this
about you running for Sheriff?

186
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,469
Hold still.

187
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,038
Well, Regan, he's the Sheriff here,
and his crew of deputies

188
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,981
are all ex-outlaws and gunmen.

189
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,986
Well, there's nothing unusual about that.

190
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,887
There are a lot of lawmen that have
been wanted at one time or another.

191
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,585
It never hurt a sheriff
to have a reputation with a gun.

192
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,217
That's not the point.

193
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,092
Anything goes in Dodge City
because Regan lets it.

194
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,961
In fact, he encourages it.

195
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,830
Bat, I want to get rid of
the crooked dealers

196
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,927
and the gunfights and the robberies.

197
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,370
What about that badge
you're wearing now?

198
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,070
Fact is, being City Marshal around here
is like a watchdog without teeth.

199
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,611
As soon as I throw the crooks in jail,

200
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,147
they get out by order
of the County Sheriff.

201
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,911
And I'm just a little annoyed by it.
It's like a merry-go-round.

202
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,546
- Well, I wish you luck.
- He'll need more than that.

203
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,013
In my opinion, if the Reverend
will excuse the expression,

204
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,083
he doesn't have a prayer.

205
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,526
Oh, Doc, you ought to be ashamed.

206
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,122
Oh, so that's the girl you wrote me about.
That was months ago.

207
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,403
- How come you're not married?
- We plan to be in the fall.

208
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,568
Well, what are you waiting for?
The corn to ripen?

209
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,543
If I had a girl like this,
I'd kick her door down.

210
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,945
Well, how would it be
if I'd make some coffee?

211
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,347
I haven't had breakfast yet.

212
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,408
Maybe you'd like something stronger?

213
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,013
Sam's been trying to shock me
for the better part of 30 years,

214
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,148
but he hasn't succeeded yet.

215
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,285
Some other time, Sam.
We really have to go.

216
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,228
Oh, Mr. Masterson,
whatever else you may be,

217
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,528
you are Ed's brother,
and if you're here in the fall,

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
we'd like to have you attend the wedding.

219
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,537
Well, whatever else I may be,
I'm much obliged.

220
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,931
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking of
going into business here.

221
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,671
- Oh, what sort of business?
- Why, I thought I might buy a saloon.

222
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,946
Oh, yes...

223
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,817
- Well, we must be going.
- I'll take you to the carriage, dear.

224
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,785
Bat, I'll be right back.

225
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,680
Mr. Masterson,
you can forget about that beer.

226
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,953
The dressing is on the house.

227
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,370
I understand the boys of the Bar K
are coming in later tonight.

228
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,499
We ought to have some fun!

229
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,206
Looks like I picked
the right business to go into

230
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,576
but the wrong time to come here.
Just before election, I mean.

231
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,013
Bat, don't worry about it. It's all right.

232
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,573
You start a reform platform

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,279
and your brother the gambler
comes along and shoots craps on it.

234
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,481
It doesn't matter.
The people around here, they know me.

235
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,046
They know what I stand for.

236
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,252
What they stand for, you mean.
It seems to me it's quite a lot.

237
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,885
Well, it's you I'm worried about.

238
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,361
- Me?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,159
I manage to do all right.

240
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,563
Well, you've never settled down.

241
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:46,093
You're like a ball in a roulette wheel,
jumping from one place to another.

242
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,072
You know, one of these days,
if you keep getting into scrapes,

243
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,076
you're going to land on number 13 black.

244
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,212
That looks like a nice quiet place.

245
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,272
- How about a drink?
- No.

246
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,583
No, thanks, Bat.

247
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,917
Come on,
we haven't had one together in years.

248
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,388
You know, I've missed you so much,

249
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,392
I'll even let you nag me
about settling down.

250
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,758
No, you go in. I've got to make my rounds.

251
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,194
I'll meet you back at the room, huh?

252
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,323
Well, since you insist.

253
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,154
You look like the whiskey type.

254
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,450
Evening, Bat.

255
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,048
- Good evening, Doc.
- Here!

256
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,286
Let me pay for that.

257
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,589
Charlie,

258
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,823
this is Ed Masterson's brother.

259
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,525
His name is Bat.

260
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,668
Sorry, my mistake.

261
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,100
Now, what ails him?

262
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,078
Oh, I'd diagnose it
as a case of hyper-timidity.

263
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,843
You may not know it but there are
rumors about you all over town.

264
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,077
About me?

265
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,053
They say you deal blackjack with
three fingers: thumb, index and trigger.

266
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,248
Oh, that's crazy.

267
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,120
I've never done anything
but defend myself.

268
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,989
Sure, but how often?

269
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,821
Well, you know, Bat,

270
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,866
that's the way it is with a reputation.

271
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,062
It's built up by hearsay, wild rumor.

272
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:29,267
When you go to dig into it,
well, all too often you find out it's true.

273
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,835
- Is that a professional opinion?
- I know your brother pretty well, Bat.

274
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,708
You have no idea
how much he worries about you.

275
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,141
I've often heard him say

276
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,745
he'd be the happiest man alive
if you'd take root in Dodge.

277
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,551
Wouldn't that just be
great for him politically?

278
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,718
I'm not speaking politically,
I'm speaking spiritually.

279
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,924
You see, he has a reputation, too,
as the loneliest man in town.

280
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,733
Oh, I know, you're thinking about Pauline,
but I don't think they'll ever get married.

281
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,103
- What makes you say that?
- I just don't think she's too sure of Ed.

282
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,835
I agree with you.

283
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,036
Pauline and Ed aren't suited to each other.

284
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,846
Ed's a dreamer. Half the time,
he's living in the future 20 years from now

285
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,110
and what she needs is a man
who'll beat her brains out

286
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,155
every morning before coffee.

287
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:21,181
All right, Lily, I won't argue.
No one ever wins with you anyway.

288
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,388
- Meet Ed's brother.
- I've heard a lot about you.

289
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,363
I was wondering
when you were going to pay me a visit.

290
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,490
- Pay you?
- This place, I mean.

291
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,035
See, I've been running it
ever since my husband died.

292
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,832
Not too successfully, I'm afraid.

293
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,466
- You want to have a drink, Lily?
- I don't mind if I do. Charlie!

294
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:43,508
Last year, Lily's husband was shot
by a person or persons unknown

295
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,641
for a reason just as unknown.

296
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,617
To everyone but our friend,
Mr. Regan, of course.

297
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,711
I've been hearing a lot about your sheriff.

298
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,881
- Haven't you met him yet?
- No.

299
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,448
He's a very clever man, our sheriff.

300
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,359
He's got two hats
he keeps taking off and putting on.

301
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,866
The white one is for making speeches,
kissing babies and attending rodeos.

302
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,663
The black one is for funerals

303
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,795
and collecting his percentage
of every business in town.

304
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,832
My husband was a stubborn man,
Mr. Masterson,

305
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,900
with more than his share of pride.

306
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,709
He refused to pay.
The next night we had no dealers.

307
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,241
Then, when he wouldn't reconsider...

308
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,953
So, that's why this place is so salty?

309
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,191
There hasn't been a wheel turned or
a hand of Faro dealt since it happened.

310
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,387
Regan is just waiting now
till I have to close my doors,

311
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,488
which could be any minute,
so he can walk in and take over himself.

312
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,795
No, he won't.
I'll speak to all your steady customers

313
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,529
and get them to drink twice as much.

314
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,731
Well, if you don't mind
my saying so, Mrs...

315
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,740
- Just Lily.
- Lily, then.

316
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,568
If you don't mind my saying so,

317
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,510
I think you're handling
this thing all wrong.

318
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,106
It's not enough just to say no
to anyone who is threatening you.

319
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,517
You have to make it very clear to them
that every street runs both ways.

320
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,488
- I'm afraid I don't understand.
- Maybe I could help you out.

321
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,082
I'd like to make you
a business proposition.

322
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,718
- Oh?
- I've got $6,000.

323
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,956
I'd like to invest it all
to redecorate the place

324
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,489
and back the play
for a half interest in the Lady Gay.

325
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,661
It sounds like good sense to me, Lily.

326
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,105
Why, operating straight,
you could pack them in here.

327
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,934
I know I'm through unless I...

328
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,706
Unless I get help.

329
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,679
Well, what do you say?

330
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,239
If you open that mouth and mumble
something about thinking it over,

331
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,310
I'll have a very positive professional
opinion about your head.

332
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,153
You could probably strike
a harder bargain for yourself.

333
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,454
I'll stick by my first offer.

334
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,459
- I'll take it.
- I hope you won't regret it.

335
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,482
- Where are they going to get dealers?
- We'll see tonight.

336
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:11,157
- Well, Ed, how does it look to you?
- Just fine, Lily.

337
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,322
I sure wish you all the luck.

338
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,492
- Hey, that's quite a dress.
- Too extreme?

339
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,593
Not for me, it isn't,
and not for our customers, if any.

340
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,434
Let's have a drink
before we open the doors.

341
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,973
All right.

342
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,079
Bat, I sure hope you know
what you're letting yourself in for.

343
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,710
I might say the same thing about
you running against Regan for Sheriff.

344
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,654
But win or lose, Ed, I want you to have
half my share in the Lady Gay.

345
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,352
No, I couldn't do that, Bat,
but thanks anyway.

346
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,484
Why not?

347
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,961
I don't think the Reverend
and Pauline would approve.

348
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,055
Well, it's partly that,

349
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,966
but mainly because I don't have much
interest in anything but my job.

350
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,732
What is it that makes a man
want to wear a badge?

351
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:58,071
Bat, I don't know about other men,
but with me it's just Dodge City.

352
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,135
This used to be a nice town,
a good place to raise a family,

353
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,544
but it isn't anymore.

354
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,081
Could be.

355
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,044
To you.

356
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,453
- Well, watch out for Regan.
- I will.

357
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,990
- Drop in later.
- I will. Good night.

358
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,852
We'd better get ready for
some customers, huh?

359
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,769
Hey, cowboys!

360
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,636
Howdy, Texans.

361
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,078
I'll be a dirty name if it ain't Sue Ann.
What y'all doing, honey?

362
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,639
- Oh, not much.
- Not much is right!

363
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,478
- They're doing pretty good.
- Yeah.

364
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,040
It'd be a shame
if the place caught fire tonight.

365
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,982
The paint's hardly dry.

366
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,953
If that place burns,
you'll put it back up board by board.

367
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,185
The idea is to get rid of them,
not the saloon.

368
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:30,163
All right, get your bets down,
get your bets down.

369
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:35,138
And around and around she goes
and where she stops, nobody knows.

370
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,309
All right, gentlemen, place your bets!

371
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,971
- I'm on the number 6.
- Place your bets!

372
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,043
There we are.

373
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,415
Nine and black.

374
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,581
All right, folks,
get a hunch and bet a bunch.

375
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,454
Hey, Doc, what happens
if somebody gets sick?

376
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,756
They get free medical attention
if they're in here.

377
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,956
If they're somewhere else,
they're out of luck.

378
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,299
Well, look who's paying us a visit.

379
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,672
Our handsome popular sheriff.

380
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,547
All right, gentlemen, place your bets.

381
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,892
- Masterson.
- Good evening, Sheriff.

382
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,559
The house would like to buy
a drink for you and your friends.

383
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,866
Now, that's nice of you, Masterson.

384
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,428
I'd like to talk to you
when you get a minute.

385
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,839
I don't know when that'll be.
It looks like I'm the only dealer here.

386
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,502
You win, son.

387
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,274
- It's important.
- I'm sure it is, Sheriff.

388
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,214
These are all my friends,
I don't mind if you talk in front of them.

389
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,309
Place your bets, gentlemen.

390
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,115
One of my men will take over
the deal for you.

391
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,918
I don't know what would be
wrong with that, Sheriff.

392
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,892
What could be more honest
than a dealer with a badge?

393
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,794
Don't take advantage of him, boys.

394
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,958
Purley, take over the deal
for Mr. Masterson.

395
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,774
It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Purley,
it's just that the box is full.

396
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,243
Put your cash in the slot there,
there's plenty of chips for the bank.

397
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,837
If you need any more, holler.

398
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,372
- This way, Sheriff.
- All right, place your bets.

399
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,231
All right, get your bets down,
get your bets down!

400
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,792
And around and around she goes

401
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,395
and where she stops, nobody knows.

402
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,601
- Would you mind waiting outside.
- What's the idea?

403
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,635
You said you wanted to see me privately.
This is about as private as we can get.

404
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,305
Jim! Jim!

405
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,178
If he breaks that door down,
you get the first bullet.

406
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,914
I advise you to tell him to wait quietly.

407
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,149
Jim, you all right?

408
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,158
He's all right now, but he won't be
if you try to come through that door.

409
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,353
Forbes, just wait there.

410
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,027
You're pretty jumpy,
aren't you, Masterson?

411
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,828
- Just average.
- Mind if I sit down?

412
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,064
I came here to make you a proposition.

413
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,867
I'd like to buy the Lady Gay.

414
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,240
- Oh, you would?
- Is it for sale?

415
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,272
Everything is for sale at the right price,
you ought to know that.

416
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,608
Well?

417
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,380
For my half, $50,000.

418
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,616
$50,000?

419
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,154
Yeah, it's the best location in town.

420
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,883
I figure the take ought to go $500 a week,

421
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,482
that'd be $50,000 in only about two years.

422
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,290
- Make that $75,000, Regan, cash.
- What are you, smart?

423
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,926
No, come to think of it, a man would be
stupid to give up a good place like this.

424
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,866
I don't believe I'll sell after all.

425
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,767
I'm not going to bother
closing you up, Masterson,

426
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,432
because you're not going to
live through the night.

427
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,066
Just a minute.

428
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,734
I'm not much like the former proprietor

429
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,406
and what I said before still goes.

430
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,678
If I see one of your men
make a move or even cough,

431
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,015
you'll get it first.

432
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,159
Nice of you to drop in, Sheriff.

433
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:26,331
Come on, honey, let's go over
to The Silver Dollar and get another drink.

434
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,857
Better sleep it off, friend.

435
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,328
$800.

436
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,164
Yeah, and I got a lot more here.

437
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,727
Charlie probably picked up
a couple of hundred over at the bar.

438
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,467
That's more than this place has made
in the last six months.

439
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,032
Bat, if I live to be 90,
I'll never be able to thank you enough.

440
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,205
Well, if you live to be 90,
I'll be too feeble to care.

441
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,079
- You're asking for trouble here, you know.
- Maybe.

442
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,448
Maybe I am, too.

443
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,317
Oh, I know,
women are supposed to be timid.

444
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,550
They're not supposed to enjoy life at all,
I guess.

445
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,388
They're brought up to leave
something on their plates.

446
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,122
Even though they're hungry, they say no.

447
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,430
You better keep counting your money.

448
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,079
- Hello, Doc, Bat.
- Hello, Ed.

449
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,644
- Howdy, Miss Lily.
- Hello, Ed.

450
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,622
Well, it looks like you had
quite an opening.

451
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,158
Yeah, and when we get dealers,
we'll do even better.

452
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,127
What do you mean?
I'm thinking of giving up my practice.

453
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,390
I haven't had so much fun

454
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,625
since the Reverend
showed up one day with a carbuncle.

455
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,997
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed. It was only on his neck.

456
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,161
That's all right, Doc.
How are things outside?

457
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,068
Well, you know how it is
on a Saturday night.

458
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,664
It gets awfully quiet
just before it explodes.

459
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,041
- Well, maybe they'll skip it this one time.
- Doc, I doubt it.

460
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,172
They haven't missed
a Saturday night shoot-up in over a year.

461
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,580
In fact, it's 10 after 2:00.

462
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,278
Why, this time last week, it was over with.

463
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,220
Well, don't worry about it, Ed.
We'll douse the lights and sit it out.

464
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,518
Charlie.

465
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,457
Lily, get back there with Doc.

466
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,754
Ed.

467
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,940
- They're just letting off steam.
- But somebody always gets hurt, though.

468
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,329
Bat.

469
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,932
Ed. Doc, Ed's hit.

470
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,206
Take it easy, take it easy. Don't move him
any more than you have to.

471
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,179
Lily, get me a light.

472
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,417
Bat, look out.

473
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,272
- He's hurt badly, Bat.
- I'm all right.

474
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,543
I tell you, I'm all right.
I just had the wind...

475
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,861
Well, he was sure well-liked.

476
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,764
- Everyone was there.
- Everyone but Jim Regan.

477
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,068
Oh, I hear he's left town
till this blows over.

478
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,335
It's not going to blow over.

479
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,438
Let's go in.

480
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,914
Hello, Bat.

481
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,029
Hello, Dave.

482
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,237
There's no need for that, Bat.

483
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,067
I just got into Dodge this morning.

484
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,836
I heard about it. I'm sorry.

485
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,545
I know how you feel.

486
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,281
But I just want you to know
that there's no more hard feelings

487
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,015
as far as I'm concerned.

488
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,183
- What do you say?
- All right, Dave. All right.

489
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,959
- Dave, can you still deal Faro?
- Sure.

490
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,296
- Want a job?
- Working for you?

491
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,494
- When do I start?
- Tonight.

492
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,300
Well...

493
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,274
You've got yourself a dealer.

494
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,680
Who was that?

495
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,190
Dave Rudabaugh, a dealer I just hired.

496
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,955
Maniac if I ever saw one.
What do we need him for?

497
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,552
I'm going away for a while.

498
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,565
I'm not going to wait
for Regan to get back.

499
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,640
Oh.

500
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,840
Pauline, what are you doing here?

501
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:30,081
I came to ask you if I could have
those pictures of Ed and myself.

502
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,249
- Why, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

503
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,234
I think there's something else
I ought to say to you.

504
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,237
I hold you directly responsible
for what happened to Ed.

505
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,466
I hold myself responsible.

506
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,171
I don't know what it is,
but everywhere I go,

507
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,767
I seem to make trouble.

508
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,439
One thing you must believe, though,
I did love my brother.

509
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,010
It's too bad you're not more like him.

510
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,645
Ed was an exceptional man.
He was better than I am.

511
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,689
He was better than you.

512
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,286
But he's dead,
so let's both try to stop feeling guilty.

513
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,426
Why, what do you mean by that?
Why should I feel guilty?

514
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,797
When he was alive, were you sure
of your feelings toward him?

515
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,200
Sure enough to marry him?

516
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,207
Well, now you've confessed and so have I.

517
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,577
Maybe we both ought to feel better,
I don't know.

518
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,879
But there's something I have to do,
so please go.

519
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,680
I...

520
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,421
I know what it is you're about to do.
It's all wrong.

521
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,323
Please go, Pauline.

522
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,954
The place is closed, come back tomorrow.

523
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,154
Ben.

524
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,726
Ben, it's Bat.

525
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,236
Bat? Bat Masterson, wait a minute,
I'll be right down.

526
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,877
Billy, light the lamp,
then you go on back to bed.

527
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,713
Hello, Bat. This is a surprise.
What are you doing back in Hays City?

528
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,219
Just passing through.

529
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,687
- I see you've changed that sign.
- I had to.

530
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,656
Ever since that Sergeant King business,

531
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,286
just the sight of your name is
enough to start a riot.

532
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,852
Hello, Billy.

533
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,096
Bat, I heard about your brother. I'm sorry.

534
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,137
I'll get us a drink. Something to eat?

535
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,228
No, thanks.

536
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,966
But if you've got a bed
I could use for a few hours,

537
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,167
- I'd sure be obliged.
- Why, sure, you can use Billy's.

538
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,142
He can bunk in with me.

539
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,312
Hey, you sure look beat.

540
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,646
I've been riding all over Kansas,
looking for the man that killed Ed.

541
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,512
The paper said there were two of them
and you got them both.

542
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,885
Paid guns.

543
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,153
I'm looking for the one who paid them,
Jim Regan.

544
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,689
Bat,

545
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:30,056
you kill a county sheriff and you're
going to be running for a long time.

546
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,366
You're wasting your breath.

547
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,897
Election is in Dodge next week.
He'll have to come back there for that.

548
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,446
Look at the pretty girl! Ain't she darling!

549
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,855
- Now, there's a pretty lady!
- Oh, you are pretty!

550
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,620
Why don't you come on down
to the Long Branch Saloon

551
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,754
- and have a drink with me, honey?
- Oh, she is a pretty little thing!

552
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,633
Look who's back.

553
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,144
Father, I wish you'd reconsider.

554
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,774
I have, dear. I still feel the same.

555
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,081
Now it's up to him.

556
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,849
I'll leave you at the doctor's office.

557
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,327
Bat, I'm glad to see you.

558
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,588
You've been gone so long, I was afraid

559
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,596
I'd never speak to you again
without tea leaves.

560
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:34,688
Has Regan come back?

561
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,995
- Yeah, I saw him in town yesterday.
- Good.

562
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,695
Bring some black coffee
up to my office, will you?

563
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,964
Bat?

564
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,272
All right, I'll go get him.

565
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,904
No, I think that we should go to see him.

566
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,505
You mean, you're actually going
into the Lady Gay?

567
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,313
Now, you wait here, Pauline.
Come along, Sam.

568
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,547
Will you pardon my expression, Reverend,

569
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,784
but I wouldn't miss this
for a month of Sundays.

570
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,102
- Bat?
- Yeah?

571
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,762
Don't do this.

572
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,410
This time it could be you
and I couldn't stand that.

573
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,846
Lily, you talk too much.

574
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,820
So she says, "Absolutely not."

575
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,255
- Yes?
- "Not until we're married."

576
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,726
That's just what she said to me.

577
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,989
- Let's have another drink.
- Excuse me.

578
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,032
- Hey, a minister.
- Could we get through, please?

579
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,226
And look who's with him, the Doc.

580
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,533
Hey, this is your lucky day.

581
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,096
You can get married and have
your head examined at the same time.

582
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,665
Let's get another bottle, come on!

583
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:01,077
Number 3. 3 the winner!

584
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,818
Oh, Reverend Howard,

585
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,756
what are you doing
in a gambling place like this?

586
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,850
Well, if you're not too busy,

587
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,451
- we'd like a word with you, please.
- Sure.

588
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,087
- Hello, Doc.
- Good to see you back.

589
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,824
Lily, perhaps the Reverend
would like a drink?

590
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,766
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
- I'm sure Doc will take a beer.

591
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,497
Yeah, I will.
I never drink during office hours

592
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,731
unless I have the opportunity.

593
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,968
Well, I'll leave you gentlemen alone
and I'll send Charlie up with some beer.

594
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,100
Sit down.

595
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,666
Well, we'll get right to the point.

596
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,237
- Sam, would you care to fill him in?
- No, I'll leave that pleasure to you.

597
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,751
- Why don't you flip a coin?
- Please, this is a serious matter.

598
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,378
The committee that was backing
your brother for County Sheriff

599
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,048
has voted to run you in his place.

600
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,725
Well, I can't think
of a less likely candidate.

601
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,660
There, you see? This is a waste of time.

602
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,460
Well, to be honest,
that's exactly what I thought at first.

603
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,392
You want to stop drunkenness
so you run a saloonkeeper.

604
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,561
Worse than that,

605
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,264
you're a professional gambler
and a gunfighter.

606
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,465
But your name is Masterson

607
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,100
and that seems to mean
a great deal in this town.

608
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,906
As Doc says, you're wasting your time.

609
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,915
Well, if you want my honest opinion,
I think Bat would be crazy to run.

610
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,077
He'd be sure to win, I'd like to see it,
but he'd hate the job.

611
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,417
Anyone in his right mind would.

612
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,356
Sheriff Regan has been
feeding on this county like a vulture.

613
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,553
His influence has been so corrupting

614
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,893
that Dodge City is now a synonym for vice

615
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,126
and he must be defeated.

616
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,261
And while under normal circumstances
I would oppose your candidacy,

617
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,637
the people here admire
the way you defied Regan.

618
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,407
As a matter of fact, you're the only person

619
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,706
we have any hope of electing.

620
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,345
I'd be the lesser of two evils, is that it?

621
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,815
- Yes, sir, that's about it.
- Well, at least you're honest about it.

622
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,079
Well, I have a sneaking suspicion
you are, too.

623
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,782
Why not? In my business,
the percentages favor the house.

624
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,751
No, Reverend, you tell the committee
I'm highly honored.

625
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,523
The Masterson they need is on Boot Hill.

626
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,087
As far as Regan is concerned,
tell him not to worry.

627
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,895
He may be a candidate today,
but he won't be tomorrow.

628
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,493
Now, you listen to me.
If you've an idea of avenging Ed,

629
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,663
that's not the way.

630
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,933
The sermon's over, Reverend.

631
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,532
But this type of lawlessness
and irresponsibility

632
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,839
is the very thing that Ed fought against
all of his life.

633
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,503
- Good day, Reverend.
- Come on.

634
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,775
Mr. Masterson, a moment ago I told you

635
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,181
that I thought you were an honest man.

636
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,618
If you are, ask yourself this question:

637
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,316
Am I doing this for my dead brother

638
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,724
or am I doing this
because I've become a wild animal?

639
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,661
Morning Reverend, Doc.

640
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,794
I understand you've been looking for me?

641
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,697
Too bad about your brother.

642
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,866
Too bad about my deputies, too.

643
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,930
I've been in Wichita,
I wasn't here when it happened.

644
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,999
But that's all ancient history.

645
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:43,205
We can either call it a standoff or settle it.

646
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,879
Whichever you say.

647
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,143
If you'd come in here
five minutes ago, Regan,

648
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,980
I'd have killed you.

649
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,320
Now I'm only going to half kill you.

650
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,602
Well, Doc, you'll have to patch me up if...

651
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,172
If I'm going to run for Sheriff.

652
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,542
Why...

653
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,241
The people of this miserable town
don't deserve you.

654
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,782
Mr. Masterson?

655
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,650
Yeah?

656
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,849
Mr. Masterson, if you don't mind,
I think I'll take that drink now.

657
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,067
- Congratulations, Sheriff.
- That's fine.

658
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,467
- Congratulations, Masterson.
- Thank you.

659
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,836
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

660
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,602
Congratulations, Mr. Masterson.

661
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,610
All right, let's have a little quiet, eh?

662
00:46:56,847 --> 00:47:01,284
Now that our erstwhile Sheriff,
Mr. Regan, has graciously conceded

663
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,182
and sent over his badge,

664
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,450
which I've taken the precaution
of disinfecting,

665
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,991
I think a few words
from Mr. Masterson are in order.

666
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,120
But before this,

667
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,265
before the Reverend decides
to introduce him,

668
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,769
I have it on good authority
he's prepared a long speech,

669
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,101
a sermon he had left over,

670
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:27,567
I want to tell you how moved I am
by this landslide victory.

671
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,447
In fact, tonight, I feel young again.

672
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,813
- Almost as young as I felt...
- MAN: All right, Doc, all right.

673
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,875
- That's enough.
- Let's hear from Bat.

674
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,012
Sit down, Doc, sit down.

675
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,323
I give you our new sheriff, Bat Masterson.

676
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,386
Thank you.
Thank you very much, everyone.

677
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:50,263
I've never made a speech in my life
and I'm not going to try to make one now.

678
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,100
I'd just like to tell you what I have
in mind concerning law enforcement.

679
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:57,231
There'll be law
and there'll be enforcement.

680
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,706
Thank you.

681
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,803
- Hey, what about Regan?
- What about him?

682
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,938
As of now, he's a citizen,
same as you or anyone else.

683
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,447
If he breaks the law, I'll deal with him.

684
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:06,948
And the Saturday night shoot-ups?

685
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,281
- There'll be no more of them.
- There'll be saloons?

686
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,615
Yes, ma'am, there'll be saloons,

687
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,383
but they'll be run in an orderly manner
and shut up at midnight.

688
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,482
And how about the gambling?

689
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,290
Well, the way I see it, there'll be gambling
as long as there are people.

690
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,921
Aren't you in the life insurance business?

691
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,556
Yeah.

692
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,500
Are you going to sell your saloon
now that you're Sheriff?

693
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,969
I intend to be Sheriff 24-hours a day,

694
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,700
but I'm also going to hold onto
what I've got.

695
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,105
For your information,

696
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,905
there's a town marshal in Wichita
by the name of Wyatt Earp

697
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,843
who seems to be doing a pretty good job.

698
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,007
He owns three saloons.

699
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,518
Well, all right, we've elected a sheriff,
not reached the millennium.

700
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,487
Let's let the sheriff have
a little refreshment.

701
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,324
What's the matter, Pauline?

702
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,394
You don't seem very happy
about my election.

703
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,939
Well, I'd like to see
what kind of a sheriff you'll make.

704
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,339
You're a suspicious nature.

705
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,434
No, it's just that

706
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:11,038
I'd hate to see father and all those
other people disappointed.

707
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,344
All I can do is my best.

708
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,908
Now, Ed would have been a fine sheriff.

709
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,786
He was firm but he was
also kind and considerate.

710
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,224
He understood people.

711
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,927
- Pauline?
- Yes?

712
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,296
Ed's dead.

713
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,760
- I know.
- I didn't ask to step into his shoes.

714
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,099
- All right.
- But if I did...

715
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,166
Yes?

716
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,537
I'd step into them all the way.

717
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,550
Howdy, Jim!
Oh, howdy, Sheriff!

718
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,255
Howdy, Jim.

719
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,491
I didn't expect you back so soon.

720
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,761
We wouldn't miss the new sheriff's
first Saturday night.

721
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,268
No, sir! I've got to see this.

722
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,305
It's been a long time
since Dodge had a sane Saturday night.

723
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,069
Let's start getting in the mood, boys.

724
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,776
- Sorry about the election, Jim.
- Can't win every time.

725
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,644
Hear Masterson's pretty good
with his gun.

726
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,206
It only holds six shots, like anybody else's.

727
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,945
Now, that's just what I was thinking.

728
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,544
Maybe you won't have
to wait till next year

729
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,452
to get your badge back.

730
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,632
- That's him now, ain't it?
- Yeah.

731
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,408
I see you've given up firearms.

732
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:56,316
No need for a gun
now that I don't have to enforce the law.

733
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,944
Did you ever?

734
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,118
In case you missed the newspapers,

735
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,682
there'll be no hurrahing tonight
or any other night.

736
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,389
- What's that got to do with me?
- Just a friendly warning.

737
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,493
- They all know about it.
- Well, that's good.

738
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,026
Because the fine for not knowing about it
will be $100.

739
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,605
Give me a drink.

740
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,513
Hey, Bob, how are you?

741
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,212
Looks like you folks went
and elected yourselves a crazy sheriff.

742
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,345
Figure he'll last a week?

743
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,412
I don't know.
We'll find out tonight, I reckon.

744
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,650
Ain't nobody ever tried to stop

745
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,157
the doings around here
on a Saturday night.

746
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,353
Well, if he does,
he's just asking to be shot up.

747
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,089
Yeah, and it'd be a shame, too.

748
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,495
He seems like a right nice fella,
doesn't he?

749
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,931
Here, have a drink.

750
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,550
Let's get things started!

751
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,122
Come on, y'all.

752
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,687
That's for having a fight out in the
middle of the street, you understand?

753
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,700
Come on, let's go back in and have a fight.

754
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,635
Come on, men...

755
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,264
Bat, you can't stop them.

756
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,934
Get back inside, I don't want you hurt.

757
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,639
Hey, Bat, you are in about
the best place to get stampeded.

758
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,410
Take her back inside, will you, Dave?

759
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,214
Come on, honey.

760
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,449
You don't belong out here either, Doc.

761
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,425
I know when a man needs a doctor.

762
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,961
Thanks, but I have to do this alone.

763
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:49,055
You don't have to do it at all,
but since you're going to do it anyway,

764
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,394
you're better off with me along.

765
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,094
Most of these crazy punchers know me.

766
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,831
They'll think twice before
they shoot the only doctor in town.

767
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,736
Get off the street.

768
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,536
Ed was my friend and so are you.

769
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:00,837
Thanks, Doc.

770
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,903
But either you get off the street or I will.

771
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,182
Oh, all right, Bat, you win.

772
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,845
You promised them
you'd stop the hurrahing.

773
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,550
If you don't make a try,
you might as well throw away that badge.

774
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,593
I'll tell you what, if things go as planned,
I'll be making a few arrests.

775
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,221
I'll need someone at the jail. How about it?

776
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,286
Fine.

777
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,266
Now I'm the only combination
roulette croupier and jailer with an MD.

778
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,166
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

779
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,005
Hey, Sheriff,

780
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,276
here's a present for you.

781
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,751
Let's have a little quiet out here!

782
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,259
Let's go!

783
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,198
It's about that time.

784
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,064
What are we waiting for, boys?

785
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,832
If you want to ride up and down
the city streets, take your guns off.

786
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,305
Well, listen to the sheriff, boys.

787
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,535
He's going to kill us all with six shots.

788
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,841
Oh, out of the way, Sheriff,
this thing is bigger than all of us.

789
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,012
There'll be no hurrahing tonight.

790
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,464
I've got just five shots left.

791
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,863
I can't guarantee they'll all be
as straight as the first one.

792
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,960
- Somebody may get killed.
- Come on, let's rush him.

793
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:43,068
All right, you and you,
pick them up and carry them to the jail.

794
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,174
Can you get up?

795
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,451
The jail's that way!

796
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,432
Put them in there.

797
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,811
You and I are quite a team.

798
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,944
But next time, try to avoid the bone.

799
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,386
I was lucky to avoid the horse.

800
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:56,185
- Shall we eat over here?
- All right.

801
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,446
You know, I could never understand

802
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,080
why people take their food off
nice clean kitchen tables

803
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,624
and then eat on the dirty ground.

804
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,159
Here, help me with the blanket.

805
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:08,789
I guess it's an old tribal custom like
drinking and gambling and marriage.

806
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,702
- How come you never got married?
- Oh, I almost did once.

807
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,670
- Oh, really?
- Sure.

808
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,731
Found a ranch
and even looked at furniture.

809
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,604
- Well?
- Well...

810
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,841
Then I got a good offer
to do some scouting for the Army.

811
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,179
Oh, you're impossible.

812
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,310
Look, I made some potato salad.

813
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:36,085
Well, this was a good idea of yours.
It's really nice out here.

814
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,423
It's good to get away
from people, sometimes.

815
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,963
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

816
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,056
You don't really like people
very much, do you?

817
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,502
I guess I'm a little afraid of them.

818
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,665
It was quite a while before
I understood that about you.

819
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,140
Oh?

820
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,904
When a man would say
good morning to you,

821
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,240
you'd snap back at him

822
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:59,804
as if he'd asked you
to meet him back of the barn.

823
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,176
I think we'd better eat.

824
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,411
Here.

825
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,822
Are you afraid of me, too?

826
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,424
- Yes.
- Why?

827
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,024
I don't know why.

828
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,062
Maybe it's because you're...

829
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,829
You're the exact opposite of Ed.

830
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,201
He was comfortable to be with.

831
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,637
But you're different.

832
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,470
Maybe it's because
I don't quite understand you.

833
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,206
Oh, don't worry about that.

834
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,976
I don't think I quite understand myself.

835
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,573
For instance?

836
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:38,181
For instance,
one part of me says, remember Ed.

837
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,952
Another part says,
she's an awful lot of woman.

838
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,459
And a third says, she'll tie you down.

839
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,764
And still another, the tallest one says,

840
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,393
don't be a fool.

841
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,040
Oh, I...

842
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,315
- I shouldn't have let you do that.
- Why not?

843
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,045
Well, you've...

844
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:14,015
How can you expect there
to be anything between us?

845
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,190
I'm a minister's daughter
and you're the owner of a saloon.

846
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,220
Is that all that stands between us?

847
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,848
- Who is it?
- Bat.

848
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,850
Oh, just a minute.

849
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,908
- Something wrong?
- No, I just...

850
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,408
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

851
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,139
I've been walking around
just trying to figure something out.

852
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,805
Yes?

853
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,846
Lily, I'm going to give you back
my half of the Lady Gay.

854
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,977
Oh?

855
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,821
Things have settled down here
and you don't need me anymore

856
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,687
and I've taken out much more
than I invested,

857
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,817
so let's just call it even.

858
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,363
That's generous of you.

859
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,866
I suppose this is Pauline's idea?

860
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,462
Why? Does it show?

861
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,532
You wear it like that badge.

862
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,201
You sure you know what you're doing?

863
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,904
Yeah, I'm sure.

864
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,510
Men usually don't, you know.

865
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:23,211
Sometimes they can only see one side,
the side that shines the brightest.

866
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,255
They think of love as something
that only happens in a garden.

867
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,485
They pretend to themselves
it's bigger than time.

868
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,289
Well, it's not.

869
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,831
It's got to survive every rotten condition...

870
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,404
You told me
what you came here to tell me.

871
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,236
Now I wish you'd go.

872
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,970
- Lily, I...
- Please, just go.

873
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,147
- Ben.
- Hello, Bat.

874
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,914
What are you doing in Dodge?

875
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,424
I'm in plenty of trouble
and I'm here to unload half of it on you.

876
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,958
Anything I can do.

877
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,891
- Let me get you a drink.
- Thanks.

878
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:40,952
I sure could use one.

879
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,257
It's my brother, Billy.
He shot a deputy in Hays City.

880
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,771
- Bad?
- Yeah.

881
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,897
He died a few hours later.

882
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,769
I don't know how it happened
or where he got the gun.

883
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,846
I was sitting in a game.
All I can tell you is,

884
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,974
there was a lot of loud laughter
over at the bar, then this shot.

885
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,417
Poor kid, they were probably ragging him.

886
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:09,049
I ran over, Billy was standing there,
white and trembling.

887
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,650
I'd never seen him like that before.

888
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,962
Then he ran out back
and started to get sick.

889
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,224
One of the deputies in the place
ran after him

890
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,294
and shot him in the shoulder
before I could take his gun away from him.

891
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,968
Billy was lying there still trembling

892
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:29,806
like a cottontail in a trap.

893
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,776
Bat,

894
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,848
they're going to hang him
day after tomorrow.

895
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,911
Well, they can't do that. The boy's sick.
He belongs in a hospital.

896
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,651
If they hang anybody, it should be me.

897
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,525
I know, I should have
had him put away before,

898
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,823
but I figured maybe with me
to look after him...

899
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,302
Well, any way you look at it,
they're not going to hang him.

900
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,306
- I'm going to break him loose.
- You're going to what?

901
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,898
The execution will be in Wichita.

902
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:03,810
Two deputies are taking him up there
on the stage tomorrow morning.

903
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,440
I figure I can get him off at Culpepper,
but it'll take two of us.

904
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,074
Ben, you're crazy. You can't do that.

905
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,812
What you should do is appeal
and ask for a stay.

906
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,616
Yeah, there's not time for that.

907
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:16,146
Billy will be in his grave
before there's a decision.

908
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,457
Well, I know...

909
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,826
I know, Bat, it's asking a lot,

910
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,932
but will you help him?

911
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,797
I can't do that, Ben.

912
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,469
- I'm not asking you to use your badge.
- I know.

913
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,734
It'd be easy. I've got it all figured out.

914
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,140
The stage stops at Culpepper
for 10, 15 minutes.

915
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,974
No, no, shut up, Ben. I don't want to hear.

916
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,076
I'm sheriff of this county,
sworn to uphold the law.

917
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,242
The law? The law?

918
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:47,880
What kind of a law takes
a feeble-minded boy and hangs him?

919
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,984
Why, he doesn't know up from down,
much less right from wrong.

920
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,824
All I want is time.

921
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,862
Time will save Billy's life.

922
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,569
I'm sorry, Ben, I'd like to help you,

923
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:05,368
but if I did, I'd be unworthy
of the decent people who trust me.

924
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:48,579
Bat? Is that you?

925
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,144
Yeah, it's Bat.

926
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,122
Will that make you quit crying?

927
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,922
What are you doing here, Dave?

928
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:03,261
Well, Lily, I just came by
to sort of cheer you up.

929
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,492
- You get out of here.
- Oh.

930
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,966
Now, is that nice?

931
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,239
If you don't get out, I'll call someone.
I can scream loud, Dave.

932
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:15,539
Why, don't be scared, Lily, don't be afraid.
I'm not going to hurt you.

933
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,580
I've just been meaning
to tell you something.

934
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,306
I go for you.
Do you know what that means?

935
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,875
That means that I am in
and everybody else is out,

936
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,513
including and especially Bat Masterson.

937
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,488
You're crazy.

938
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,622
You talk fresh.
I don't like a woman that talks fresh.

939
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,597
I just like a woman.
Now, don't fight and don't make a sound,

940
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,066
because if you do,
Bat will come through that door

941
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,434
and I'll have to finish him
just like I finished his brother, Ed.

942
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,995
You killed Ed?

943
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:45,997
Tell you what,

944
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,635
we'll talk about it in the morning.

945
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,343
That's Lily.

946
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,760
Ben.

947
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:19,567
- Lily, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

948
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,337
- Dave killed your brother. He told me so.
- What happened?

949
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,502
Do you think it's possible?

950
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:25,775
I don't know. I guess so.
It doesn't matter now.

951
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,243
- Somebody get Doc Tremaine.
- I'll fetch him.

952
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,448
Don't worry, Ben, it doesn't look serious.

953
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:39,017
You're wrong, Bat.
It hardly grazed me, but it sure killed Billy.

954
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,495
No, it didn't.

955
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:45,523
It missed him by 20 miles,
by about from here to Culpepper.

956
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,389
I ought to have my head examined,
letting you talk me into this.

957
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,298
You know you're probably throwing
your career right out the window.

958
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,630
Anyway, what good can we do here?

959
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,136
He's coming through
under an armed guard.

960
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,833
Well, the stage stops here for 10 minutes.
Maybe we'll get an idea.

961
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,000
I've got an idea.

962
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,907
Let's go back to Dodge
and forget the whole thing.

963
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,469
Quiet. Here they come.

964
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,528
Stay with the boy, Joe.

965
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,467
We'll get some coffee
and we'll bring you some.

966
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,903
All right.

967
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,244
Would you like a drink, son?

968
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,910
Yes, please.

969
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,578
All right.

970
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,328
This is going to be easier
than even Ben thought.

971
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,665
What do you mean?

972
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,728
You get in with Billy and keep him quiet.

973
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,603
Leave the rest to me.

974
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,322
What happened?

975
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:57,888
I don't know.
I was getting some water for Billy

976
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,195
and someone took off with the stage.

977
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,931
- Looked to me like Bat Masterson.
- Let's get some horses.

978
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,424
All right, Doc.

979
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,157
That hurt, sonny?

980
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,894
No, sir.
Yesterday, it hurt something fierce.

981
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,064
Now I don't feel anything.

982
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,537
- Does that mean I'm going to die?
- Hmm?

983
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,403
Does that mean I'm going to die?

984
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:13,964
Now, what ever gave you that idea?

985
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,341
It just means you're getting well,
that's all.

986
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,346
My brother Ben said

987
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,006
when you die you don't feel nothing.

988
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:23,779
Yesterday I felt something
but today I don't feel anything.

989
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,714
You feel that fire, don't you?
You feel the breeze in your face?

990
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,690
Don't worry, Billy,
you're going to be all right.

991
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,522
None of us will be all right
if Ben doesn't hurry up and get here.

992
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:33,687
He'll be along.

993
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,730
Fact is, I hear someone coming now.

994
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,306
- Is Billy all right?
- Yeah, Doc's been fixing his shoulder.

995
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,640
- Ben!
- Billy!

996
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,442
Say, you look good to me.

997
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,641
I don't want to break this up,
but you two better get moving.

998
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,742
- Yeah, that's right.
- When you get to Fort Leavenworth,

999
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,411
go right to the commandant
and give him this.

1000
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,114
It'll admit Billy to the government hospital

1001
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,214
where no one can touch him
until he's been examined.

1002
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,485
Thanks, Doc.

1003
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,050
Bat, I hate to have to tell you this,

1004
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,323
but the reason I took so long
getting here, I was followed.

1005
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:09,625
- What?
- Yeah.

1006
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,327
Everybody in town knew I was leaving.
I had to take a round-about route.

1007
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,029
Then they know.

1008
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,128
I'm sorry, Bat.

1009
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,697
Those two deputies rode into town
looking for you.

1010
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,299
And when the council found out
what you'd done,

1011
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,709
they voted to take away
your badge and arrest you.

1012
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,906
Malfeasance in office, they called it.

1013
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,573
I see.

1014
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,880
You paid a sweet price for helping me.

1015
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,352
Not half the price I would have paid
if I had refused.

1016
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,889
- You'd better get moving, Ben.
- Thanks.

1017
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,682
Come on, Doc.

1018
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,657
Come on, Billy.

1019
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,322
So long.

1020
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:52,033
Have a cigar on
Jim Regan, and if it don't make you sick,

1021
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,541
cast a vote for him at the polls
on next Tuesday.

1022
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,375
Jim is for law and order

1023
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,177
and he don't turn any
dirty murderers loose.

1024
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:04,276
Have a cigar. Have a cigar on Jim Regan.

1025
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,910
Honest Jim.

1026
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,890
He'll be the next sheriff of Ford County.
There you are, sir.

1027
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,955
I never would have believed
it could happen so quickly.

1028
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,691
You mean Regan getting back in?

1029
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,165
No, there will always be Regans
waiting for us

1030
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,702
if we show one sign of weakness.

1031
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,933
No, I mean the way Dodge City
is slipping back to what it was.

1032
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,601
You wait until Saturday night.
They'll shoot up the place

1033
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,372
and we'll wish we had Masterson back,
no matter what he did!

1034
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,539
What Masterson did was
to commit a crime,

1035
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,674
but worse than this,
he violated his sworn oath.

1036
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:40,053
He'll have to live with that.
And we'll have to live with this.

1037
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,827
- Good afternoon, Sheriff.
- Not till Tuesday.

1038
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,126
It might as well be right now,

1039
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,633
seeing they got nobody
running against you.

1040
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,601
- Oh, they'll run somebody.
- Can you beat it?

1041
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,071
Some of those folks are so desperate,
they're going to nominate Masterson.

1042
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,472
He's a wanted man,
he won't come back here.

1043
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:04,103
But if he does, any man-jack
has a right to gun him down.

1044
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,423
Well, we'll be in in a minute, Bat.

1045
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:27,796
Have you made up your mind
what you're going to do?

1046
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,861
It seems to me I've already done it.

1047
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,099
I'd do it again, I'm not sorry at all.

1048
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:37,009
- You're not sorry about losing your badge?
- Yeah, strangely enough, I am.

1049
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,547
You know, Doc,
this job was pushed on me.

1050
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:42,277
I never wanted it, I never asked for it.

1051
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,649
But for the first time in my life,
I really felt good.

1052
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,086
- I don't know how to explain it.
- Well, you don't have to.

1053
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:51,354
You've displayed all the symptoms
of a man doing something unselfish.

1054
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,158
That's the only way anyone ever
comes down with a case of happiness.

1055
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,289
But I'll tell you one thing,

1056
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:00,494
when we arrive, I personally am
going to have plenty to say.

1057
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,730
- Yeah?
- I'm as guilty as you are.

1058
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:06,172
When they take away your badge,
they can take away my stethoscope.

1059
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,871
There are enough chronic ailments
on that council to make them think twice.

1060
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,209
Doc,

1061
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,544
we'll be at the Reverend's in a minute

1062
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,175
and there's a few things
I'd like to attend to

1063
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,514
before the fireworks start.

1064
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,282
Would you mind riding on ahead?

1065
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,617
Certainly.

1066
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,215
I've been wondering
when this was going to happen.

1067
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,056
Why, what do you mean?

1068
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:30,326
Well, people are always so surprised
by events and by themselves.

1069
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,833
They should read more chemistry.

1070
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,585
- Oh, hello, Bat.
- Pauline.

1071
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,026
I didn't think you'd come back here.

1072
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,594
No? Why not?

1073
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,332
Certainly you've heard what's happened.

1074
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,374
You've been removed as Sheriff

1075
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,637
and I'll be very much surprised
if you're not arrested.

1076
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,737
I'm on my way into town now
to give myself up.

1077
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,874
I feel that people will understand
when I explain the circumstances.

1078
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:28,154
There can be no circumstances.
What you did was inexcusable.

1079
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,555
Pauline,

1080
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,651
Billy Townsend's mentally an infant,

1081
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,822
but because it was an officer he shot,
they're railroading him.

1082
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,866
I don't want to hear.

1083
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:41,528
Somehow I knew, even before I came here,
how you'd react.

1084
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,628
You'd sit there and read me a sermon

1085
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,469
and never drop a stitch
of that embroidery.

1086
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,275
I don't like that kind of talk, Bat.

1087
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,372
I may as well talk plain.

1088
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,607
I don't think
we're the same kind of people.

1089
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,654
We'd do nothing
but make each other unhappy.

1090
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,490
Don't feel too badly about it.

1091
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,221
It was only a question of
which one of us would admit it first.

1092
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,226
Goodbye, Pauline.

1093
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,748
Mr. Regan! Mr. Regan!

1094
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,120
- Masterson's back.
- You're out of your head.

1095
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:37,317
No, I just saw him
riding past the church yard.

1096
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,326
Do you think he's going
to run on Tuesday?

1097
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,554
He's going to be in jail, ain't he?

1098
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:44,065
No. No, he's not going to be in jail
because this is going to be settled today.

1099
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:46,965
Do you want me and the boys
to back you up?

1100
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,666
If we bushwhacked him, I'd never be able
to show my face in this town again.

1101
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:56,142
No, this is something
I'm going to have to do myself.

1102
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,207
There he is now.

1103
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,226
Bat.

1104
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,597
- Hello, Lily.
- You look tired.

1105
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,031
Yeah, I could use some of that coffee.

1106
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,771
- Well, I'll get some more.
- Thanks, Doc.

1107
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,242
I can use the exercise, anyway.

1108
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,749
Well, I sure made a mess of things.

1109
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,547
- You only did what you thought was right.
- Yeah, I don't know.

1110
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,884
When I was riding down the street,
everybody looked at me

1111
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:43,516
as though I was
some kind of a wild animal or something.

1112
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,059
Maybe I am.

1113
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,486
Doc doesn't think so and neither do I.

1114
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:52,090
- You're prejudiced.
- Yes, I guess I am.

1115
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,602
As I told you, I'm giving you back
my share of the Lady Gay.

1116
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,696
Oh?

1117
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:01,037
Only this time
it has nothing to do with Pauline.

1118
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,102
You thought
when you took me in as a partner

1119
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,942
I'd be some help.

1120
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:09,343
All I've done is make things worse.

1121
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,051
Bat, shut up!

1122
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,224
Funny how a man has to sweat out
the whole deck before he finds the ace.

1123
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,632
Masterson?

1124
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,971
Regan is waiting for you out in the street.

1125
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,409
Bat, you're not going out there.

1126
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,568
Don't be a fool, Bat.

1127
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,078
Do you think Regan's out there alone?

1128
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,273
He's got half a dozen gunslingers
on his payroll.

1129
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,680
- I know.
- Well, are you coming?

1130
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,778
I'll be there in a minute.

1131
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:50,482
Doc, I don't know much about legal stuff,
but I want everything I own to go to Lily.

1132
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,424
Everything except this.

1133
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,793
Give it back to Dodge.
No matter what they think, I did my best.

1134
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,889
Don't go out there, Bat.

1135
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,059
I don't want to, Lily.

1136
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,762
But the distance between
here and the street

1137
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:04,601
is the difference between
a rabbit and a man.

1138
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,939
<i>Mr. Masterson,</i>
<i>what's it like to kill a man?</i>

1139
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,280
<i>You're scared.</i>

1140
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,515
<i>And you want to run and hide,</i>
<i>hide anywhere.</i>

1141
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,251
<i>But you don't, because you can't.</i>

1142
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,919
<i>And you can't because you know</i>
<i>if you make even the slightest move,</i>

1143
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,757
<i>he's bound to draw.</i>

1144
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,957
<i>So you watch his eyes,</i>

1145
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,229
<i>praying to God Almighty</i>
<i>he'll back down or say something,</i>

1146
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,430
<i>anything to give you</i>
<i>a chance to get out of it.</i>

1147
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,840
<i>Then you try to make yourself</i>
<i>say something.</i>

1148
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,268
<i>But before you can, it's too late.</i>

1149
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,014
I cleared the street, Masterson.

1150
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,277
But everybody in Dodge is watching.

1151
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,786
- Will you call it or shall I?
- Either way you say.

1152
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,287
Why not let the people call it
at the election?

1153
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,658
You'd like that.

1154
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,632
This town has grown up quite a lot
in the past few months, Regan.

1155
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,760
No matter what happens out here,
you're through.

1156
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:10,732
Draw!

1157
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:33,318
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that takes care of Tuesday's election.
