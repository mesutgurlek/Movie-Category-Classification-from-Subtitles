1
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:55,100
With the Indians!

2
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,770
Avram !

3
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,250
I want to talk to you in private.

4
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,593
Speak only English.

5
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:30,226
And no matter what I say, don't smile.

6
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:46,740
Out of 88 students graduating
from this yeshiva...

7
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,912
you came in a close 87.

8
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:53,811
Don't smile.

9
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,524
Look sad.

10
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:02,531
There is a new congregation...

11
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,623
In America?

12
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,065
Wait!

13
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:20,849
<i>Some meshuggener suggested your
name to become the new rabbi.</i>

14
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,711
I am forced to take an official
vote of the board of rabbis.

15
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,977
Close.

16
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,624
It's a close vote.

17
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,184
But I am the Chief Rabbi!

18
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,498
I am the one who has to decide!

19
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,057
So, cowboy...

20
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:16,568
I am sending you to San Francisco.

21
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:21,807
- Where is San Francisco?
- By New York.

22
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,112
Get out, quick.

23
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:46,964
<i>And so, on a wonderful
sunny day in 1850...</i>

24
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,199
<i>I started out my great adventure...</i>

25
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:53,538
<i>and I left Poland for Philadelphia...</i>

26
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:57,101
<i>the city where all the
brothers love each other...</i>

27
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,849
The boat's gone.

28
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,961
Understand?

29
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:50,465
Somebody should have told us!

30
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,625
This is the devil's work.

31
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,362
- What'd he say?
- Says the boat is gone.

32
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,870
Mister, what'd you just say
about the boat to San Francisco?

33
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,030
- Gone!
- Well, that can't be.

34
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,404
That boat's supposed to leave
first tide in the morning!

35
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,806
Supposed to?

36
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,640
What the hell's the matter with you?

37
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,077
It's a gold rush.

38
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,306
Haven't you people heard anything?

39
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,873
- Next boat two months.
- Oh, God!

40
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,881
Oh, my God, help me!

41
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,449
Just this morning me and
my brother got the news.

42
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,116
All right. Who's next?

43
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:24,595
Our mama's dying in San Francisco.

44
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,268
What am I gonna do?

45
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:32,272
There must be some way that a
person can go to San Francisco...

46
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,865
in another way than the boat.

47
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,570
Not for us, sir.

48
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:40,281
Just 10 minutes ago, me and my brother
sold our horses and our wagon...

49
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:43,614
so as we could purchase
tickets on this here boat.

50
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,345
And now we ain't got neither.

51
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,913
Well, perhaps if you go to the man...

52
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,822
and you told him your troubles
and you give him back the money...

53
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,987
he would give you back the wagon.

54
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,264
You think he'll do it?

55
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,665
If he is a good man, I
think he would do that, yes.

56
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:03,136
Mister, would you help me, please?

57
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:06,307
I'm not much good at
explaining myself and...

58
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,942
I usually just start to cry.

59
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,344
I will do that.

60
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,814
I would be happy to do it.

61
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,249
But I don't know if I
would be much help to you.

62
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,786
<i>With the way I speak English...</i>

63
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,015
Wait, you don't have
to carry the bags.

64
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,920
My brother, his name is Matt.

65
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,152
- Oh, say, what's your name?
- Avram.

66
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,195
Avram. My name's Darryl, Darryl Diggs.

67
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,526
Anyway, my brother's got a temper.

68
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,725
Sometimes he just unloads,
you know what I mean?

69
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,734
- Can't I help you to carry...
- No, that's all right.

70
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,326
I've got it all. Don't
worry about a thing.

71
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,803
Just step in here, anyway. Come
on, what is it again, Avrum?

72
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,273
Avram. But you didn't
do nothing wrong.

73
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,811
- Everything go all right?
- Well, we missed the boat.

74
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,414
- What?
- The boat sailed yesterday.

75
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:49,349
The whole town's gone crazy, Matt.
It's gold rush. It sailed yesterday.

76
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,649
Yeah, but what are
we supposed to do now?

77
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,122
Well, God may be on our side yet,
Matt, thanks to this here gentleman.

78
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,416
Avram, this is my
brother, Matthew Diggs.

79
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,620
- How do you do?
- Mr. Jones!

80
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:04,229
Mr. Jones, we missed our boat and we
find ourselves in a desperate state.

81
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,824
We need our horses
and our wagon back...

82
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,463
so as we can get to San Francisco
to see our mum before she dies.

83
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,163
So if you'd be kind enough
to take your money back...

84
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,642
I sympathize with your misfortunes,
fellows. But you've got to understand...

85
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,236
I'm in the business of
buying and selling...

86
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:21,744
and I don't sell unless
I can make a profit.

87
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:24,710
But we don't have no
money to give you a profit.

88
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,687
Then we don't do no business.

89
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,721
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

90
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:36,498
How much profit do you
need from these gentlemen?

91
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,423
$50.

92
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,535
$50. That's it, Matt, we're sunk.

93
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,139
I'm sorry, Avram. Sorry
I wasted your time.

94
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,437
Well, perhaps I could pay the $50.

95
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,357
It's real kind of you, Avram.

96
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,757
I don't know how's we could
ever pay you back. Do you, Matt?

97
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:09,193
$50, look, I don't know.

98
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,193
If I could have a seat on
your wagon to San Francisco...

99
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,259
I would be more than paid back.

100
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:15,799
Well, you pay the $50...

101
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,034
you could have a seat with a
cushion on it. Can't he, Matt?

102
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:20,736
All the way.

103
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,006
I would share the cushion.

104
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:27,143
Matt, the Lord is smiling
on you and me today!

105
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,342
Amen.

106
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,346
Gentlemen, quiet!

107
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,189
Wonderful, marvelous news.

108
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:38,151
Just this morning, I
received this letter.

109
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,589
"Dear Mr. Bender:

110
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,329
"This is to inform you
that soon, God willing...

111
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,433
"you will have a rabbi and a Torah.

112
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,375
"Rabbi Avram Belinski
has left Poland...

113
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:02,315
"to join you in the
village of San Francisco.

114
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:06,410
"Avram thanks you for the
picture of your lovely family.

115
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,251
"He is looking eagerly forward to
meeting your daughter Sarah Mindl...

116
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,420
"with an eye towards matrimony."

117
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,257
- Papa !
- Not now, Sarah Mindl.

118
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,663
But, Julius!

119
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,002
Go to your room.

120
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,896
What's the matter with Sarah Mindl?

121
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,603
Bender, a rabbi is
better than a Rosensheine.

122
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:46,952
You want a bite?

123
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,326
Oh, thanks.

124
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,344
There she is, Avram.

125
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,644
That little shortcut I
was telling you about.

126
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,552
Gonna get us to San
Francisco four days earlier.

127
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:13,645
Good.

128
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,517
Whoa !

129
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,529
What happened? Is it Indians?

130
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,429
Mr. Jones, what's happening?

131
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,600
<i>I don't understand. What's...</i>

132
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,109
Darryl, tell him I paid the $50!

133
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,273
He paid the $50.

134
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,915
- You paid the $50?
- Yeah, I did.

135
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,648
Is it clothes what you want?

136
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,455
You want to take my clothes?

137
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,463
You need my clothes so much?
You don't have your own clothes?

138
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,461
No! No! Not the Torah, please!

139
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,505
<i>Take my money, you can have the...</i>

140
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:39,097
God! God, help me!

141
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,471
Mr. Jones, please don't do that!

142
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:48,181
Please! Please! No!

143
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,218
What's you need my tallis for?

144
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,051
Why are you doing this?

145
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,421
- We love you.
- Mr. Jones...

146
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,357
why are you doing this?

147
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,793
- You're not happy with our service?
- No.

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,264
God! I don't want to be
with these filthy crooks!

149
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:12,000
- We'll fix that for you, bucko.
- No!

150
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,541
There you go!

151
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,491
- How'd we do?
- I got the rest of his money.

152
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,665
This you couldn't throw out first!

153
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,159
America.

154
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,630
Landsmen! Landsmen!

155
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,238
Hello!

156
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,107
Landsmen!

157
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,266
Landsmen!

158
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,605
Hello!

159
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,578
Landsmen!

160
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,511
Dost thou speak English?

161
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,215
Dost thou...

162
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,795
<i>speak...</i>

163
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,173
You know, I think he's crazy.

164
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:19,256
We have decided...

165
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:23,367
that thou shouldst have this
money for the train to Akron.

166
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:31,269
We are sorry it cannot be more.

167
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,479
We all hope it will help
thee on thy journey...

168
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,485
Brother Avram.

169
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:50,524
I will never forget thy kindness.

170
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,596
Thanks.

171
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,878
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, children.

172
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:16,516
Good-bye. Thank you very much.

173
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,617
Thanks.

174
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,095
- Good-bye. -
Good-bye, Avram.

175
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,759
My parents have a farm...

176
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:30,601
not big like this one,
but they have a nice farm.

177
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,503
How is it that thou are not a farmer?

178
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,835
Well, God made me a rabbi.

179
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,843
- Why?
- Why?

180
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,107
I think he had enough farmers.

181
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,914
What a wonderful country.

182
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,683
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

183
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,511
Simple Simon says, "No laughing."

184
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,887
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

185
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,158
I really have to go!

186
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:33,529
Simple Simon says, "Put
your fingers on your nose."

187
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:37,237
Don't bother the man, honey.

188
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,204
Simple Simon says, "You
don't have to play."

189
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,615
I think we're an hour and a half away.

190
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:44,494
- Mommy, I'm getting sleepy.
- Then take a nap.

191
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,674
- Can you stop it?
- Mama, I'm hungry.

192
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,561
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?

193
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,525
Now I want you all to
stay calm and listen...

194
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,565
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

195
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,628
First thing is: don't turn around.

196
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,397
There's a man behind
you with a big shotgun...

197
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,633
and he don't care to be recognized.

198
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,538
Them that don't
believe me is gonna die.

199
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:35,808
All right now. You all put
your hands on top of your heads.

200
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,918
Good. That's real good.

201
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:42,484
Now we're all gonna play
like we're in church.

202
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,317
You got something for
the collection, sir?

203
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:47,422
Very kind.

204
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,558
Ma'am? Thank you.

205
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,463
Thank you very much.

206
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,590
Ma'am?

207
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,833
Thank you.

208
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,937
Well, thank you all very much.

209
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:06,810
Mr. Jake, I'm jumping here,
you go at the next bend.

210
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:08,682
Remember, folks...

211
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,117
the best way to keep your heads
is keep your hands on top of them.

212
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,779
And don't turn around.

213
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,891
Better to give than to
receive, ain't it, folks?

214
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,577
Simple Simon says, "Everybody laugh."

215
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,427
Don't you get the joke?

216
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:33,593
Simple says, "Everybody gotta laugh."

217
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:37,022
<i>It's difficult to explain that
a Jew can't ride on a Saturday.</i>

218
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:41,492
<i>And, for a Jew, Saturday
begins on Friday.</i>

219
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,135
- Name?
- Joseph Pellerton.

220
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,310
See the foreman. Name?

221
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,811
Good? Good.

222
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,546
See the foreman. Name?

223
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,985
You funny looking fellow.

224
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,752
- Yes. Yes.
- See the foreman. Name?

225
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:05,684
Yes.

226
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:08,520
See the foreman.

227
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:12,032
- You ever work on railroad before?
- No. This is the first time for me.

228
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,089
<i>K-O-V...</i>

229
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,026
See the foreman.

230
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,096
- You sure talk funny.
- Name?

231
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,471
- Yes.
- See the foreman.

232
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,569
- Yes.
- Name?

233
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:25,635
John Browning.

234
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:27,977
Strange-looking characters
looking for jobs.

235
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,448
See the foreman.

236
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,641
- Name?
- Belinski.

237
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,933
Sorry, Paco. Sorry. It
wouldn't happen again.

238
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,900
You can bet your boots on that.

239
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,218
He did it again.

240
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,795
Wait, Paco. Wait!

241
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,164
Wait, it wasn't done on purpose.

242
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,075
- Avram, some water over here.
- Coming right up.

243
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:34,110
Got nice, fresh water coming right up.

244
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:37,480
- Avram.
- What? What happened?

245
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,812
Paco? No!

246
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:43,619
<i>- It was an accident. I didn't mean to...
- I kill you, pendejo!</i>

247
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,522
I'll bust your Jewish bones!

248
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:49,088
You smart, you listen.
We open a big restaurant.

249
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,688
You work one year, make
enough money to buy a wagon.

250
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,199
Maybe we even go with you, huh?

251
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,361
Open a big joint in San Francisco!

252
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,133
Paco, would you show
me where to buy a horse?

253
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:02,669
<i>Hey, pendejo. How you
going to find your way?</i>

254
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:07,076
Paco, please, just show
me where to buy a horse.

255
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:16,586
You're crazy, Jew-boy!
You gonna get lost!

256
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:21,154
Believe me, I won't get lost!

257
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,259
Oh, yes, you will.

258
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:30,331
Good-bye!

259
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,107
Good-bye, Paco.

260
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,173
Good-bye, Mr. Ping!

261
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,346
Wait! Wait, horsie!

262
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,778
Wait, wait, horsie! Take it easy.

263
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,577
Nice horsie. That's a good horsie.

264
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,780
That's it.

265
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,216
Let's take it slow and easy.

266
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,056
Slow! Slow.

267
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,529
That's it. You're a good horsie.

268
00:31:55,597 --> 00:32:00,500
Sarah Mindl. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

269
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,637
Oh, my Sarah, Sarah.

270
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:13,207
Oh, show me what you meant to me.

271
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:34,691
Oh, my food! My food!

272
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,440
Why me?

273
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,310
My food, you're gonna take?

274
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,315
You got the whole world,
you're gonna take my food!

275
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,158
Not you! Wait!

276
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,457
Not you! Wait! Horsie, wait!

277
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,932
No food and no horse.

278
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,934
Come back!

279
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,699
Come here, horsie!

280
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:14,298
I'll be good to you! I'll be nice!

281
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,343
I'll pick grass for you!

282
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:18,275
I'll scratch your back!

283
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,041
I'll give you a nice rub!

284
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,921
Chicken, chicken.
Chickie, chickie, chicken.

285
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,653
Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.

286
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,691
I just want to eat you.

287
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,427
Come here, wait! I
don't wanna hurt you!

288
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:45,071
I just want to make you kosher!

289
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,144
How hungry are you?

290
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,248
I'm pretty hungry.

291
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,734
If you had been here yesterday...

292
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,777
we could've had roast chicken!

293
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,251
So that's Jewish cooking, huh?

294
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:08,311
Pretty good, huh?

295
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,587
Where're you coming from?

296
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,121
Back there.

297
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,195
You're from California, huh?

298
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,737
California is that way?

299
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:30,073
You're lost, ain't you?

300
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,041
- Got any money?
- No.

301
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,910
Got any food?

302
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:41,243
No.

303
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,859
Sure talk funny.

304
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,261
- Where you born at?
- Poland.

305
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,590
Is that near Pittsburgh?

306
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,994
No. That's near Czechoslovakia.

307
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:00,306
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

308
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,969
And you're going to California?

309
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,704
Yes.

310
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:11,979
You ain't gonna make it.

311
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:14,749
Excuse me...

312
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,888
in the morning, would
you be kind enough...

313
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:21,190
to point out in which
direction is San Francisco?

314
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:23,627
- Sure.
- Good.

315
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,494
- In the morning.
- In that case...

316
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:29,199
would you like to fight
for that last fish?

317
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,301
You think you got a chance?

318
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,347
I think I can say, with complete
confidence, none whatsoever...

319
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,107
but I'm still hungry.

320
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,616
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

321
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,058
What you call this kind of fish?

322
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:56,955
- That's a trout.
- A trout?

323
00:36:58,366 --> 00:37:00,129
It's got a lot of bones.

324
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,396
You got family waiting for you?

325
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:08,967
I'm promised a wife when
I get to San Francisco.

326
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,601
But I haven't never met her.

327
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:13,738
You gonna marry a woman
that you never seen?

328
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,316
I didn't say I never seen her.

329
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:18,011
I said I never met her.

330
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:23,016
They sent me a picture
before I left Poland.

331
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,455
Well.

332
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:32,658
What you think?

333
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,360
Well, that's my kind of woman.

334
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:35,800
You son of a gun.

335
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,937
You son of a gun, you.

336
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:41,636
Shee-it!

337
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:44,875
I guess so.

338
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:47,239
This other one ain't bad, neither.

339
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:54,281
- Good night, Rabbi.
- Good night, cowboy.

340
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,277
Well, it's nice meeting
up with you, pard.

341
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,402
Nice meeting up with you, pard.

342
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,838
- You got it straight?
- Oh, sure.

343
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:23,507
Right from this tree...

344
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,916
I head straight north
five or six weeks...

345
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,012
till I come to the flat country.

346
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:32,385
- Yeah.
- Then I make a left for two days.

347
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,451
That way I avoid the Indians.

348
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:37,191
Then I cross the river...

349
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,296
and I make a sharp right,
away from the mountains.

350
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,929
Once I get to the
desert, God willing...

351
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:49,174
I just continue straight as piss...

352
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:52,813
till I come to the
ocean. Take a left...

353
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:55,782
keeping the ocean on
my right shoulder...

354
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,908
and just hot-tail it
right into San Francisco.

355
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,243
Good?

356
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,917
Pretty good.

357
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:05,881
Well...

358
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:08,985
I hope you make it.

359
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:20,163
Okay, wait, horse. Good.
All right, go, horsie.

360
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,877
That's it, straight ahead.

361
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:33,249
- Speak any Mexican, do you?
- No. Why do you ask?

362
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:37,649
Oh, nothing. Just curious.

363
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,727
If you should ever come to San Francisco,
I hope that you'll call on me...

364
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,297
and we could talk
over some nice times.

365
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:56,268
- Come on, horsie.
- Hey...

366
00:39:58,512 --> 00:39:59,979
that way.

367
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,506
That way?

368
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:07,747
Of course, I know it's that way...

369
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:11,788
but first I have to go around that
big log before I can go that way!

370
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:15,927
You mustn't turn a horse so
quick. That's how accidents happen.

371
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,029
You gotta start nice and slow. That
way you get off on the right foot.

372
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:32,742
Hey! What kind of crazy horses
they got in this country?

373
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:42,245
<i>- What do you call this in Jewish?
- A tokhes.</i>

374
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:47,655
<i>Well, you keep your eyes on this tokhes
and don't take them off till I tell you.</i>

375
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,529
<i>Keep my eyes on the tokhes...</i>

376
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,004
Shee-it! Don't get no
closer to that edge, Rabbi.

377
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:06,245
- What kind of word is that?
- What word?

378
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:08,973
You always say, "shee-it"
at a certain moment.

379
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,448
Shee-it?

380
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,019
<i>Well, that's a... That's a...</i>

381
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:20,487
<i>What do you... You must have a
word in your language that you...</i>

382
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:24,994
What do say when you get
really took by surprise?

383
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:26,560
<i>Oy gevald.</i>

384
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,423
<i>Oy gevald?</i>

385
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:33,263
- Yeah. - That's it.
That's what "shee-it" means?

386
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,802
<i>Oy, shee-it!</i>

387
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,843
Yeah, that makes sense.

388
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,844
Slow. Slow, horsie.

389
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,324
Well, this is it.

390
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,926
- Where are you going?
- Back down the river a few miles...

391
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,488
it's a good place to cross.

392
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,460
- Why not here?
- Here?

393
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:03,800
Here's a good place to die...

394
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,133
but it ain't a good
place to cross the river.

395
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,473
We just jump in and swim
straight across. Simple as pie.

396
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,310
You wanna kill yourself, go ahead.

397
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:17,077
I don't like the odds.
I'm taking the long way.

398
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,327
Well, that shouldn't be so difficult.

399
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:42,267
Wait a minute! Where
you going, horsie?

400
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:45,410
I didn't say where to go yet!

401
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,843
Oh, no! Oh, no!

402
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,995
That snake could've killed me!

403
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,936
Well, damn me! If he
can do it, I can do it.

404
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,715
<i>Help! Oy gevald!</i>

405
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,207
God damn!

406
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:35,960
Shit!

407
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,137
You know, Rabbi, you're
one crazy bastard!

408
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:45,627
Remember...

409
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:50,273
I'm the kind of person when he says
he's gonna do something, he does it.

410
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:54,809
You got a guarantee, huh? He could
be laying out there somewhere...

411
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,510
- dead in the wilderness!
- Bite your tongue!

412
00:43:57,785 --> 00:44:00,253
You're talking about
my future son-in-law.

413
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,357
Somebody, maybe, should
remind Sarah Mindl.

414
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,334
Rosalie.

415
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:19,661
Rosalie.

416
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:24,543
- Get your sister away from that idiot!
- I'm not mixing in. I'm not mixing in.

417
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,680
This is a nice little
town. Cold, but nice.

418
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:33,214
Yeah, I guess.

419
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:37,682
I don't think that fellow is 100%.

420
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,526
I'll see if I can find
us some place to stay.

421
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:51,463
- Someplace pretty cheap.
- Yeah, pretty cheap.

422
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,393
<i>About tomorrow morning...</i>

423
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,004
This ain't traveling weather.

424
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,036
I know this place ain't
fancy, but it's got a roof.

425
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:32,004
And like you say, it's cheap.

426
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:36,648
So we just stay here for a
couple months and then head south.

427
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:39,151
No. I've wasted too much time already.

428
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:48,183
When they banged on your head,
they must've mushed your brains!

429
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:52,395
So goddamned worried about time,
how come you don't ride on Saturday?

430
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:55,729
I told you, it's against my
religion to ride on the Sabbath.

431
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,770
I got me a new religion, too! And one of
the things you ain't allowed to do is die!

432
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:05,043
There's real mountains out there, and
that's a real blizzard building up.

433
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:08,240
- I'm telling you we can't make it.
- I can make it.

434
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:13,876
God damn! I ain't gonna let you talk
me into this. It's just impossible!

435
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:18,147
Every goddamn Indian knows that!
Every goddamn trapper knows that!

436
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:24,226
I know, you don't like
it when I talk that way.

437
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:29,293
But I'm telling you, you ain't
gonna talk me into it this time!

438
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,197
Am I trying to talk you into anything?

439
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:41,406
Good night! Have a nice trip.

440
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:46,619
Good night. And thanks for
everything you did for me...

441
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:50,916
up until the time I
needed you the most!

442
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:57,095
Don't wake me in the morning!

443
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:02,230
I'll try to be as quiet as possible!

444
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,963
What do you think now, Rabbi?

445
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:08,802
It's cold.

446
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:14,977
You should see it in winter.

447
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:27,654
<i>In the Talmud it says,
"Find thyself a teacher."</i>

448
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:30,020
<i>And this I had done.</i>

449
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:39,196
<i>However, there were times I feared
that he would find another pupil.</i>

450
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,904
Get your horse down!

451
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:08,429
If we'd have gone on,
we'd have froze to death!

452
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,536
No, make one!

453
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:17,441
Move! Come here...

454
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:21,675
closer!

455
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,275
Wait.

456
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:29,122
We are doing this to
keep warm, aren't we?

457
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:32,717
In that case, you can
put your arms around me.

458
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:36,762
Come here, darling.

459
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,025
That's better.

460
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:52,975
Hey, look.

461
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,682
I think we've found
the Garden of Eden.

462
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:09,460
Well, it ain't exactly
the Garden of Eden.

463
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,795
What a wonderful place America is!

464
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:17,964
There are no walls
around these cities.

465
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,734
You don't have to worry about soldiers
coming in from the next town...

466
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:21,899
and killing people.

467
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,610
You know, I think this is the West.

468
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:30,248
We're in the Wild West here, just
like the books I read in Poland.

469
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:35,744
This is a wonderful city. They
got banks and restaurants...

470
00:49:36,857 --> 00:49:41,021
they got merchants of all kinds
here. And look at the people...

471
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:44,495
how they're dressed. I
think those are cowboys.

472
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,628
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

473
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:52,967
Hold up here. I got a little
business I wanna take care of.

474
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,298
Hold on to the horses, will you?

475
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:01,174
I'll be right back.

476
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,438
Move it!

477
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:35,443
- What's happening?
- We just robbed the bank!

478
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:38,678
- What did you say?
- We just robbed the bank!

479
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,621
What do you mean, "we?"

480
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:48,861
The bank, they just robbed the bank!

481
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:49,951
<i>Oy gevald!</i>

482
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,435
- We need a posse, boys, let's go!
- What for?

483
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:57,492
I said, we need a posse!

484
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,539
To hell with you! I ain't
got any money in the bank.

485
00:50:59,606 --> 00:51:02,939
- But they robbed it!
- Well go get 'em. It's your bank.

486
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:05,136
- $5 a man when we catch them !
- $5?

487
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:06,679
- $7.50!
- Not worth it...

488
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:08,578
- I'll go for $11.
- $10!

489
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,583
- $11 !
- All right, you bastards...

490
00:51:11,685 --> 00:51:13,482
$11. Let's go!

491
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:36,141
Don't get comfortable.
We can't stop here.

492
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,212
- How could you do this to me?
- It's what I do. I'm a bank robber.

493
00:51:48,418 --> 00:51:52,184
- But you made me a bank robber!
- So what? You get your half.

494
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:56,553
- Get out of my life!
- What?

495
00:51:58,295 --> 00:51:59,887
Get out of my life!

496
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:02,261
Get out! I don't want you here!

497
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:04,193
Get out of my life!

498
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:11,196
Take it easy!

499
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:14,205
Take it easy. You better cool off.

500
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,055
Guns?

501
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,492
You gonna shoot guns at me?

502
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:35,887
Guns!

503
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,840
- You know, you're really crazy.
- Sure I'm crazy. I'm a bank robber.

504
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:52,905
Who else would rob a bank but a crazy?

505
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:55,884
You, you ain't no bank robber.
All you did was hold the horses.

506
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:58,216
- Think I could tell them that?
- Sure!

507
00:52:58,555 --> 00:52:59,902
- And would they listen?

508
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:03,070
- Yeah, they'll listen.
Then they'll hang you!

509
00:53:03,593 --> 00:53:06,756
- And what if I gave back the money?
- You mean, your half?

510
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,999
- Yes, I mean my half!  - First they'll
string you up by your balls...

511
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:16,732
till you tell them where the other
half is, then they'll hang you!

512
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:23,572
Make up your mind, pardner.

513
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:40,218
<i>Oy gevald!</i>

514
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:43,658
Go fast, horsie! Go fast!

515
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:46,494
Wait, Tommy, wait! I'm coming.

516
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,505
Looks like fresh tracks.

517
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,512
They was here all
right. Here's some blood.

518
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,373
Hey, that was me. I
knew I got that one.

519
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:04,751
If you did, he sure took a
long time to start bleeding.

520
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:08,279
All right, let's go, men. Let's
look for a tree for the hanging.
