1
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,630
It's almost done...

2
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,180
Are you with the law?

3
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,180
-From Denver, huh?
-Yeah. Are you a bounty hunter?

4
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,180
No, just in a hurry to get across
the desert, like you.

5
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,600
It's a pretty crowded desert, ain't it...

6
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,140
Do you happen to have some ammunition?

7
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,430
-Thanks.
-Forget it.

8
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,250
-You had us jumping there boy.
When you took aim at us, I thought:

9
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,170
"Boys, this time we had it..."

10
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,130
Let go with the belts.

11
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,680
Go get your horses.
Put one under my saddle.

12
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,930
-You skunk. You'd pick off a beggar!
-Why not? Sit down and cool off.

13
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,350
Hey. The beans...

14
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,000
Good.
-You're welcome.

15
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,350
Hey, you're planning to starve us to death?

16
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,510
Empty...

17
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,410
You'll pay for this. You're a no-good
low-down vulture and hyena!

18
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
- Trinity Is Still My Name -

19
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,900
Well, what's the matter?

20
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,600
You're a good horse.

21
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,710
Poor Saddler...
That must've been some punch.

22
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,410
Get your hands up!

23
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,330
-Did you say...
-I said get them up!

24
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,660
If you're looking for a hole in the head,
I'm happy to oblige.

25
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,860
-You ain't lawmen, are you?
-What was that?

26
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,580
You know, the law, or the rangers maybe?

27
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,250
You got something on your conscience, stinky?
What are you worth 500?

28
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,500
I've just started out. But Judge Fitzpatrick
told me that if I keep up like this -

29
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:20,080
-I'll be worth 1000. Now I'm up to 50.
-50? Have you been stealing some chickens?

30
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,480
No. Turkeys...

31
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,080
Put them down, turkey.

32
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:40,740
Relax, we're no lawmen. Sit down. By the way,
have you seen anyone around these parts?

33
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,600
No, they had a posse after me,
but they gave up when I across the desert.

34
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,250
Did you got away on that nag?

35
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:56,450
-Why, what's wrong with her?
-She's no beauty.

36
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,370
-It's a damned good horse.
-We'll see about that a little later...

37
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,500
-What's wrong with him, is he sick?
-No, he has been beaten.

38
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,830
-Who hit him?
-A starving buffalo.

39
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,660
The old man was never too bright...

40
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,160
I heard if a man gets hit again,
he'll come back to his senses.

41
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,330
-Yeah, I heard the same thing.
-My uncle...

42
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,660
...hit my dad right on the brain.
And hit him again to finish him off.

43
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:52,750
But pop, instead of going down, snaps back
and drops my uncle - his brother.

44
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,080
Why don't you give it a try.

45
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,710
Sorry, old buddy, but maybe stinky is right.

46
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,300
-Well, it does not always work.
-Yeah, I heard the same thing, exactly.

47
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,160
-Well, it's been nice, and thanks.
-Yeah, for your horse...

48
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,830
Your horse... turkey-rustler.

49
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,040
I ain't got no objection,
as long as he don't mind...

50
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,630
What do you say?

51
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,200
He says: "No".

52
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:27,110
-I guess now we're supposed to shoot it out?
-Yeah, that's right sonny.

53
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:35,550
-Boss, do you mind if I take care of him?
-No, he's all yours, but just hurt him...

54
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,360
Finish him off, will you? The beans are done.

55
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,100
Drop the beans... um, gun-belts.

56
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,950
Now sit down and cool off.

57
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
Tasty.

58
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,950
-You ain't gonna kill us in cold blood?
-To tell you frankly, I don't know.

59
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,350
I'm new at this sort of thing.
What do you usually do in a case like this?

60
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,930
If I were you I'd forget the whole thing.
We were just joking.

61
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,860
But you ain't me...

62
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,780
You guys fight it out, and the one who
remains on his feet will be spared...

63
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Go on, go to it boys.

64
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,500
Hey, watch out!

65
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,280
Tell me, boy, what did you just tell me
about your brother a while ago?

66
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,950
If I ever again get my hands on that idiot...
If I catch him again...

67
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Who is a pain in the neck did you say?
- Who would it be? Joe, your little darling.

68
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,750
What has he done now?
- Well then, listen good.

69
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,000
A few days ago the boy pinched
a herd of horses.

70
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,890
Then "tired joe" is showing up...

71
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,830
...and couldn't think of anything better than
to give away the horses to starvelings.

72
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,830
If I were you, I would have reported him
to the cops immediately.

73
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,100
He should have reported his
very own brother to the cops?

74
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,780
That was a mess.
-Come on, come on.

75
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,950
Where?
-Hurry up, the water is hot.

76
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's see if we can't get
that dirt crust off.

77
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,790
Wake up from your delirium and go fetch
me some buckets of water.

78
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Yes, yes, all right.

79
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,960
Will you get up, you lazy bastard?

80
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,340
Drinking and sleeping the whole day!

81
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Hurry up with that rinse water!

82
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,900
Lousy wench throwing you on the ground
like that... Poor you.

83
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,400
Not even for you this fury is considerate.

84
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,530
-Pearl, come here!
-What the hell is it now?

85
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:47,510
-There is something going on!
-Not with you anyway...

86
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I bathe Bambino. If he get up now,
he won't get up until the next spring.

87
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,160
-What's the matter now? Have another attack?
-Breathe in the breeze...

88
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,810
Trinity!

89
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:24,850
-So you're back!
-We thought the vultures ate you.

90
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,350
-Why didn't you write to mom?
-Because I can't write and you can't read.

91
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,160
I have a surprise for you.

92
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Hey Bambino, tell me if this ain't the most
prettiest sight you ever seen?

93
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,550
Hi!

94
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,430
Ain't you glad to see your own brother?

95
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:58,500
Bambino is right. This blasted coyote
gave away a whole herd of horses.

96
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,680
Set the table and shut up.
- And you my little lamb, wash up.

97
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,970
-Are you leaving right away?
-If you're staying, yes.

98
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,260
Hey, listen, if I were you,
I'd drown him right there in that tub.

99
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:07,480
Hey, you're ain't gonna take the old geezer
up on that, are you?

100
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:17,300
-Mom...
-Allright, peace to men of good will.

101
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,640
So cut it out for a while, it's time to eat.

102
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,760
Look what a beauty!

103
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,220
-What is it?
-Don't know, it few around here yesterday.

104
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:09,100
-It looks like an eagle.
-It might be... First, we'll pray.

105
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,770
There she goes again with the religion!
Always trying to break a guy's...

106
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,490
Dear lady up in heaven...

107
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:27,850
You were a mother, and you
had also a son who gave you worries.

108
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:36,260
So you can understand when I ask you
to look after my sons. Amen.

109
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,680
-I said "amen", you womits!
-Amen.

110
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
Let's drink, boys.

111
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:46,680
-Down in the throat, and may the Lord...
-He's probably eating right now, like us.

112
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,830
He better protect us.

113
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,680
Give me back my bird!

114
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:14,100
Boys, did you ever feel like
settling down around here?

115
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,430
-To do what?
-Work?

116
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,510
No. But you can of course get married.
There are some beauties in the saloon -

117
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,010
-who really wants a husband.
-And they make the best wives!

118
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:39,350
You should have seen your mother the day we
got married. But you were too young to-

119
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:46,930
-remember, and you were still crawling.
But we had a wild party in that saloon!

120
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,760
And I can still see her now.
She had a red velvet dress -

121
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:59,680
-with her frontals sticking out.
She was just as happy as a vulture

122
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,600
just before a hanging.

123
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,710
After you stop chasing the lice around,
how about getting us another bottle?

124
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,760
-We got visitors.
-How many?

125
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,800
-Four.
-Anyone a sheriff?

126
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,990
-Nope.
-What do they look like?

127
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,750
-Can't tell, they got their faces covered.
-You take good care of them, dear?

128
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Look who's here... !
Small world, ain't it.

129
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,680
Yeah, and a little overcrowded...
Drop your guns.

130
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,100
You too...
OK, outside.

131
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,500
Wait a minute, dear...

132
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,610
-Allright, you can go.
-Come on, move!

133
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,320
-He is a little...
-Yeah, he's a little back, yes.

134
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,530
If you open your mouth wide,
I'll fill it up with buckshot!

135
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,460
-Here, choke.
-Thank you, love.

136
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:24,850
Boys, old drivel over here wants to talk to
you. But don't contradict him, he's shaky.

137
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,280
-Did he eat too fast?
-No, it's the usual attack...

138
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:53,330
Boys, the odds are pretty good that my
generous old heart will stop ticking soon.

139
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:01,240
But before I go, I want to make sure that
there's a pretty high price on your heads.

140
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,990
You worry me, my son.
For years now, you've been dragging your ass...

141
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,580
...and you still got no trade.
You can cardshap I hear -

142
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:20,540
-but I've never seen you play.
I advise you to become a horse-rustler.

143
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,820
You don't become a good
horse-thief over a night, you know!

144
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,600
Look at Bambino here...
He's on the right track.

145
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:41,130
Even though he has a lot to learn,
he'll make a great horse-thief some day.

146
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,180
And boys, promise me that from now on,
you'll always work together.

147
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,050
What?

148
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,480
Look after your brother.
He is young and green still. Protect him -

149
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:01,700
-as if he was your... own brother.
-I've got to protect me from him!

150
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,360
Let him go away in peace.

151
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:16,330
Allright, I'll protect him.
But then he must obey me.

152
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,950
-And please leave your damn sledge here!
-Well, if you aren't pleased by it...

153
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,160
No, it does not please me!

154
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:43,410
Keep an eye on him.
He's just a baby with a foot in his mouth.

155
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:51,600
Peral, this calls for another whiskey... two!
Bring the bottle. You don't want any, right?

156
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,610
I do.

157
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:04,400
-Can't you sit on the saddle normally?
-I get tired that way. Where are we headed?

158
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,650
-North.
-Why north?

159
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,460
Because I say so.

160
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,100
I got the right to know, don't I?
-No, you don't!

161
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,910
-Either do what I tell you, or I'll dump you.
-Where would you dump me?

162
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,150
Wake up - there's a little work ahead.

163
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,750
-Cover up.
-Why?

164
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:41,200
Rule number 1: When you rob a wagon, you'll
cover you face. So no one recognizes you.

165
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,200
I can't get enough leverage...

166
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,700
Hurry, get in the cart!

167
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Stay right where you are!
Nobody make a move! Get 'em up!

168
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,850
What the hell are you shooting at?

169
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,360
-I'm warning you mister.
-If he lifts his hand, he'll drop the kid.

170
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,550
-Hand over your gold!
-The only wealth we got is the kid.

171
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:47,230
-We came west, looking for work.
-I got a good mind to plug you for that!

172
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,900
Howdy.

173
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,480
-I said "howdy".
-Howdy. Are you an outlaw?

174
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,950
-Well, under the circumstances, I guess so.
-But we got nothing, we're just farmers.

175
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh, oh, sorry about that.

176
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,980
-Hey, hurry up in there!
-Bye now, just sit tight and don't worry.

177
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,100
-You're coming? What did you find?
-An old lady, a few rag and some stale bread.

178
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,910
We've been sitting here for three days now,
and Fred here got a sour stomach.

179
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:45,880
-Yeah, I see what you mean.
-We got to get into town and see a doctor.

180
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,780
-Then you got money after all, you coyote!
-We'll sell the wagon, maybe...

181
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,150
That's ridiculous.

182
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,450
-Hurry up!
-Hang on, don't forget the lady inside.

183
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,550
That wasn't so hard, was it.
Don't forget to grease the wheel.

184
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,360
Give them some money...

185
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:41,360
-Much obliged. If everyone was as generous...
-...you'd let yourself be robbed forever.

186
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,350
Get a move on!

187
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,780
Strangest pair of outlaws I ever seen.

188
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,080
-So far so good, huh?
-Even better if you'll look there.

189
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,430
But a little worse if you look here...

190
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,800
First of all, try not to catch his eye.

191
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,150
Keep an eye on them. They're up to no good.

192
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,500
Welcome to Tascosa boys,
where the West really begins.

193
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:19,700
-It's the right place to get a job.
-Just worry about the horse.

194
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,850
I need to find a gunsmith.
Take a look around in the town.

195
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,650
So if your hand take the itching,
just scratch it...

196
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,650
-God bless you, brothers.
-Thanks, old-timer. See you at the saloon.

197
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:04,630
I didn't ask for a drink.
Hey, bartender, give me a drink.

198
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,500
-You like to play, huh?
-No, not now. I'm tired now.

199
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,800
-It's a pretty quiet town, isn't it?
-Say that again, and you'll break the spell.

200
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,490
Why?

201
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,000
Because Wildcard Hendricks is in town,
and it don't take much to set him off.

202
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,030
-Wildcard, who's he?
-He's a cardsharp, a professional.

203
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,190
He's shifty,
but don't tell him that, he's very touchy.

204
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,950
You can watch him play at the saloon,
but be careful not to stare him in the eye.

205
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,030
Mister, aren't you getting you gun?

206
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,950
Where are you going?

207
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,750
You know who that is?
Wildcard Hendricks - a pro.

208
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,010
So what, are you afraid of him, maybe?

209
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,160
You got a couple of bills?

210
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,730
Now you're talkin' brother...

211
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,810
I like to be able to tell people that
Wildcard Hendricks played with me.

212
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,510
Can we play in five?

213
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,120
High card deals, doesn't it?

214
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
No cut.

215
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,450
-I pass.
-I open for 30...

216
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,090
Let's see your openers, friend...

217
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,700
Allright, how about we cut the pack, huh?

218
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,380
-Opening for 10.
-Let's make it 50...

219
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,850
100, if you wanna stay in.

220
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,460
Two...

221
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,160
-Two for me.
-Serve yourself...

222
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,600
100...

223
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,130
If you don't mind... 200.

224
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,330
I say you've been cheating...

225
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,900
-You think so?
-I think so.

226
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,060
The drinks are on me, boy.

227
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:17,230
When the lead hits you, it'll hurt less
with a little whiskey in your gut.

228
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,030
Oh yeah, give the gentleman a double,
that way you won't feel a thing.

229
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,890
Get going.

230
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,300
You like to see that again?
It's hard to catch the first time.

231
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,800
Cut it out...

232
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,590
Did you get it?

233
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,000
-So you think it's going to end here, huh?
-Yeah, I think so...

234
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,960
I'll get back at you!

235
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,460
Well brother, it's a good start.
Hey, how much did we win?

236
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,130
You mean how much did I win - you lost.

237
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,880
Allright, you know my share.

238
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,000
-Just what this town needs.
-See you. -See you.

239
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,170
Mr. Parker!
Mr. Parker!

240
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,200
Yes?

241
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,500
Over in the saloon are two tough guys,

242
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,300
you should hire them.

243
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,490
It's nice of you to put my attention
to it, Stevens,

244
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,170
but I am sufficiently supplied.

245
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,080
Furthermore, I expect a couple of
skilled gunmen from Denver soon.

246
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,370
Of course, Mr. Parker.
You are the boss.

247
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,120
Yes, Stevens, this time you're right.

248
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,250
-Goodbye, sir. Thank you.
-Bye.

249
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,650
Holy god!

250
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,140
Holy god...

251
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,730
Howdy!
I said "howdy".

252
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,800
You talking to me?

253
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:20,410
We wanted to thank you...
for having robbed us. Oh, I mean helped us!

254
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:30,560
-Well, that wasn't exactly a robbery...
-I could tell you weren't real outlaws.

255
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:41,670
-We were on a special mission.
-Oh, you are federal agents?

256
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:49,080
Yes and no.
It's not exactly federal, but...

257
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:57,000
If your pop is looking for work,
this is the place.

258
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,630
But it ain't no place for us farmers.
I think we'll moving on to San José.

259
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,620
San José is a great place!
Where the west... really nice.

260
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,960
If he'll get worse, then don't hesitate
to bring him to me.

261
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,580
Goodbye now, miss. And good luck...

262
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:23,170
No wait, I would like my folks to know
that you are no real outlaws.

263
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:30,880
-Mom, pop, this here is the fellow...
-Of course, he's the gentleman who helped us.

264
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:39,080
-We are much obliged to you, mister...
-He's a federal agent.

265
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,230
There's some mighty bad business going on,
and the government wants to fix it.

266
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,410
Don't tell the captain what I told you about us.

267
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,400
-Did they rat on us?
-We know how to keep a secret.

268
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,160
-Hm, good for you. And how's little windy?
-The doctor said it's nothing to worry about, only...

269
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:28,410
-...a little airofogy.
-Oh, it's that what they call it in these parts?

270
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:32,640
The kid is really suffering.

271
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,510
A couple of whiskeys will fix him up fine.

272
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:44,810
-If everyone was as generous as you...
-...the kid would be an alcoholic.

273
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,360
I heard it's the fanciest place
until Frisco...

274
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:02,900
-I'm sorry gentlemen, you have to be members.
-What do you think we are?

275
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,750
There ain't no mistaking a lawman, huh...

276
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,510
This way, please.

277
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,300
There they are now...

278
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,800
-Well?
-Well, what sir?

279
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,610
-Bring us some food.

280
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:05,330
-Perhaps the gentlemen would like to begin...
-Right, we'd like to begin.

281
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:11,050
-May I suggest...
-No, you may not! Just bring us some food.

282
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,300
Wine for the gentlemen...

283
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:36,730
-Sooner or later the goverment will...
-Curiosity killed a lot more than cats.

284
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:44,010
You don't go killing federal agents.
You buy them.

285
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:49,050
And I never met one that wasn't up for sale.

286
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,450
You'll pull that again, and you'll had it.

287
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,200
That was a bit exaggerating.

288
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,870
Even their worst enemy has to admit...

289
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,740
that they're good at their job.

290
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,700
If until now we were only suspicious
that they are secret agents...

291
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,490
...now they've proven us.

292
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:46,200
Chasse á la Magdalen, petite oignons,
marrons glaces, pommes de terre...

293
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,860
-I hope it is to your liking, gentlemen.
-So what's so funny, huh?

294
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,000
Voilà...

295
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,700
i voilà.

296
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,730
It looks like it's going to be even easier
than I thought, right gentlemen?!

297
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,950
Chateaux neuve de pape.
A very special wine.

298
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,550
Clara, don't do that.

299
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,600
You're flirting with them, stop it!

300
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,050
They're ruminating like cows.
Outrageous...

301
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:54,880
-Would the gentlemen top the meal with...
-Wanna top it? -Yeah. -We'll top it.

302
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,750
George!

303
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:16,650
-Cointreau, Curacau, Grand Marnier?
-Well, how about it?

304
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,650
-If it suits you...
-It suits me fine.

305
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:44,830
-I saw him firing that up!
-But that's flambé suzettes!

306
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,380
Voila!

307
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:04,630
I'll have a little talk with them,
first thing in the morning.

308
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,680
Here they are now...

309
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:42,750
-Howdy, mister...
-James Parker. Mr Lopert.

310
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:49,810
-Sir, I'd like you to meet captain...
-That's a mighty fine looking animal.

311
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,710
-I imagine that you're an expert.
-Huh?

312
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:04,330
I imagine, being quick as you are, you have
already guessed the reason for this meeting.

313
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:11,450
I'd like to ask of a rather simple
favor of you captain.

314
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:18,210
All you have to do is close an eye...

315
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:27,610
May I, captain?
-And while we close an eye, you...

316
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,340
Exactly.

317
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:39,360
Even if the captain does close an eye,
he sees with the other.

318
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,000
2000 dollars should close them both, huh?

319
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:50,300
And two times two makes four...
You don't wanna leave my eyes open, do you?

320
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:56,900
Allright 4000. I was dead certain that we'd
come to a friendly agreement.

321
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:02,100
The government never was very generous
with its secret agents.

322
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:07,700
-The matter ends here, of course.
-Of course.

323
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:12,750
-It's been a real pleasure gentlemen.
-I hope to see you soon again.

324
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:21,500
Murdoch, must you always make such a inferno?
You hardly need to practice.

325
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:28,750
Murdoch said he would prefered to
close your eyes a little differently.

326
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:35,360
He may be right, Mr Parker. But sometimes
it's better to figure the odds first...

327
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,090
-You're right lieutenant.
-Heading back to Tascosa?

328
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,630
-To San José.
-There's nothing there that could interest-

329
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:57,360
-the government.
-Yeah, especially when your eyes are closed.

330
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,950
Warn our guys down at San José.

331
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,630
Leave me alone, and go to hell.

332
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,880
Hjälp oss - vi är också amerikaner.

333
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:45,760
I don't know about that!
Vamos!

334
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,700
-I think that he's a harsh sheriff.
-Double it...

335
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,450
Senjores, welcome to San José!
I'll take your horses to the stable.

336
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:11,010
-You'll be plenty satisfied.
-If that eye is a sign of customer-

337
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,200
-satisfaction, you better leave them here.
-No, senjor, it's not because if the horse.

338
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:42,250
-The guns... No hardware allowed in here.
-You thinked this up by yourself?

339
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:47,560
Noj, but it's a good idea anyway.
That's the law in this town.

340
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:54,410
And don't forget it, if you don't wanna get
bounched out before you can drink.

341
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,830
You're always in such a good mood?

342
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:04,750
No...
Sometimes it's worse.

343
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,080
That's the two federals that they
warned us about...

344
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,570
-Quite a collection, huh?
-Anybody you know?

345
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,180
-The guy talkin' is Reap Smith, the rustler.
-Is he good?

346
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:50,400
-The one in the middle is Lenny Smith, robber.
-And the other one?

347
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:56,210
That's Stingaree Smith. gunslinger,
bountykiller - a rough guy.

348
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,550
So relax.

349
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:28,280
One of those riders who passed us coming
to town is pointing at you and laughing.

350
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:44,830
You seem to strike his funny-bone, it's
the third time he looks at you and laughs.

351
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,300
-I suppose you let me in on the joke?
-Well now, how are you two doing?

352
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:06,160
-Hey, he put his hand on you.
-If you do that again...

353
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:10,810
-...we'll flat the whole bunch of you.
-You don't mind showing us how you'll do it?

354
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,860
What a rotten bunch...
Is he coming with us?

355
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,910
I'll be seeing you.

356
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,840
I bet they all got a price on their heads.

357
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,850
Are you crazy or something?
I told you not to show up in town.

358
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:40,200
-Howdy sheriff.
-What can I do for you?

359
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:44,670
To begin with, you can start giving us $800
for this merchandise!

360
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:55,280
-Certainly. Where did you nail them?
-In town.

361
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,160
-Lock 'em, sheriff.
-Oh yeah, sure.

362
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:11,910
Lets get a move on!
You too...

363
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,660
Just get in there and shut up!

364
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,720
They don't seem to know
who they're dealing with...

365
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,240
Sign here.

366
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,610
-That's an even $500.
-Fair enough, so long sheriff.

367
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:24,220
Oh, I almost forgot...
Regards from Mr Parker.

368
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,830
-Hey wait, then you're the two?
-Yeah, that's us.

369
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,350
-Well, what do I do with them?
-They work for Parker too, don't they?

370
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:39,950
-So does everybody else in San José.
-So what's the problem?

371
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:46,760
I don't suppose there's any reason
to keep them locked up, is there?

372
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:52,600
Let them cool off for a couple of days, then
let them tie you up and hit you on the head.

373
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:58,700
And put a price of $500 on their heads,
alive if you like...

374
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:02,990
You know that Parker doesn't want anybody
hanging around the mission?

375
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,850
Oh, sure we do.

376
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:15,660
Would you mind telling what we're doing here
like a couple of horsethieves?

377
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,830
We are a couple of horsethieves.
At least I'm trying to teach you to be one...

378
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,160
Do we wait for horses to come to us?
Let's go down to the mission instead.

379
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:33,650
-Something tells me that...
-Hush!

380
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:43,100
There must be at least 30 of them.
Wanna make a bet I'm right?

381
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:51,570
Move!

382
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,400
Pig-headed mules...

383
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:08,780
-Looks like their wagon is acting up again.
-Yeah, just for a change...

384
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,800
-We'll give them a hand?
-No.

385
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,840
-We're stuck if no miracle don't happens.
-It happens pop!

386
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:37,080
-We thought you might need a hand.
-They just stopped, these critters...

387
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:49,400
Ain't nothing to it, miss.
Hang on tight on my arm.

388
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:54,830
-We're going to take off like lightning.
-It's getting late, lieutenant.

389
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,730
They're just as stubborn as... a mule!

390
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,430
Now we can go.

391
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,850
-What you whispered sure worked.
-Are you moving out now, right away?

392
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:12,950
We'll camp here for the night. Why don't you
join us? My daughter is a mighty good cook.

393
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,230
Wow, she's also a good cook?

394
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,950
You know, you're a very good cook,
I've never eat boiled beans so... boiled.

395
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:50,400
-The stars are sparkling just like diamonds.
-Yeah, especially the big ones.

396
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:57,190
That's right, I've never thought about that.
You federal agents don't miss anything.

397
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:03,360
And do you know that rivers always flow
in the same direction?

398
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,400
And did you know that you and me...

399
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:23,690
-Where are you headed?
-North.

400
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:32,130
-We're headed north.
-It's nice up there.

401
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,360
I'll come up and visit if you like.

402
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,400
Oh, no, lieutenant...

403
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,820
Hey, lieutenant!

404
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:10,820
-You federal agents work at night too?
-Yeah, just like horsethieves.

405
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,860
Well, here they come now...

406
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:24,900
-Lieutenant, you've forgot we're on duty?
-Aren't we allowed to do some exceptions?

407
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,760
-Is that an order?
-Yeah, it's an order.

408
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,830
Mam, miss, it's been a pleasure...
-Hi young fellow. Heads up now.

409
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,230
-He seems better now.
-He's really sick.

410
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:53,390
Buy a barrel of whiskey,
that'll cure him.

411
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,690
-If everyone was as generous as you...
-...you'd be millionaires.

412
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,830
Nice boys.

413
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:27,210
-There's one leavnig for Chihuahua tomorrow.
-No, that's filled with starving peons.

414
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,960
-San Antonio and Houston is better.
-Where do you plan to do the hold up, river?

415
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,800
We ain't back in pops days.
The best place to rob a wagon-

416
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,380
-is near the poststation, when the passengers
are stretchy, and the cabby is off-guard.

417
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,000
Well, what are you looking at?

418
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:56,300
You come for the monks?
The ones by the mission...

419
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:03,500
I came to confess, and the monk
gave me a black-eye.

420
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:12,460
Once the monks were saints,
but now they're devils.

421
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:18,550
-They drink and swear. And when we confess...
-They hit you?

422
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:28,380
-We'll see about the monks.
-Really? Muchos gracias.

423
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:40,630
This business that bad monks beats up peons
bothers you, don't it?

424
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,350
-No, so if you think that I...
-No, I didn't think that at all...

425
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:49,300
It's just that Parker paid us 4000 to close
our eyes and the sheriff wants us-

426
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:56,880
-to stay clear of a bunch of drunken monks...
So, something stinks here.

427
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,130
-May the Lord be with you...
-Why?

428
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,360
Welcome.

429
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:51,500
When a brother knocks at our door, we greet
him by saing: "May the Lord be with you".

430
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:57,010
And he should answer: "And with your spirit."
-Now I get you, "And with your spirit."...

431
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:03,010
-Ain't you got a spirit?
-Oh, "And with my spirit."

432
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:18,540
-See if we can get them to talk, Bambino.
-Don't worry. And don't call me Bambino.

433
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,060
Ugly bunch...

434
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,900
Who's the boss here?

435
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:47,030
Let us say that I'm the shepard here.
What can we do for you?

436
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,990
Let us say that this pilgrim here
wants to get himself confessed...

437
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:54,700
...and this traveller wants to rest.

438
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,610
The traveller shall be restored,
and the pilgrim cleansed of sin.

439
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,530
Come with me, brother.

440
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:33,630
Don't tell me you're just drinking water?

441
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,130
Sure, is there anything better?
-Whiskey, for example.

442
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,400
And how about a game of dice,
what do you think about that?

443
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:43,790
Dice, brother?
-Yes, you've never heard of it?

444
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,700
And women are also frowned upon here?

445
01:20:46,735 --> 01:20:49,500
I do not understand you, my son.

446
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:51,600
Don't play innocent...

447
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:54,437
It's better if you speak to the prior.

448
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:58,438
No. The prior is very busy at the moment.

449
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,570
Hey, what're you doing?

450
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:49,360
-Allright, were are you going?
-In the confession.

451
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:56,210
-They should've made the darn place bigger.
-This is my place, you'll be outside.

452
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:07,190
-I got to neel down?
-You may sit, if neeling bothers you.

453
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:36,030
-It's the first time, isn't it?
-Yeah, and the last...

454
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:45,450
-Tell me, my son...
-What?

455
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:53,230
-Well, aren't you here to confess?
-Yeah, among other things.

456
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,780
To see if you can absolve me too.

457
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:07,640
First you must confess,
then I'll absolve you.

458
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:15,280
Hey, I'm warning you, friend!
No ratting on me, huh?

459
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:21,780
No, no. Aside from myself,
only He shall know.

460
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:27,900
No, either it's between you and me,
or nothing to it!

461
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:33,490
-Very well. Begin my son.
-Begin what?

462
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:37,530
-To confess.
-Oh...

463
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,860
Go on, my son.

464
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:14,550
And when I was 12, my old man took me in
with him and his gang of rustlers.

465
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:19,860
And one of the boys got killed.
We pulled off a lot of neat jobs.

466
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:24,490
-That's enough, I beg you.
-Yeah, and now what?

467
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:31,240
-You must do penance, and be sincerely sorry.
-Yeah, allright, I'm sorry.

468
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:36,200
-Now, absolve me. If you got the guts.
-I don't understand...

469
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:41,030
-Come on. Absolve me!
-Certainly, certainly. I'll absolve you

470
01:24:55,130 --> 01:25:00,090
Why you, I'll teach you for going around
and absolving people!

471
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:09,450
-Take it easy! Come on, what happened?
-He started off by talking to himself-

472
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,730
-and then really sneaky went with the right!
-I only wanted to bless you, brother.

473
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:21,030
There's something wrong with this mission.
Why did you beat up the peons?

474
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:29,050
It's not we who do the beating up -
it is Lucifer.

475
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,510
-You know him?
-No, never heard of him...

476
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:39,570
-Sounds like a professional from back east.
-Well, if this Lucifer shows up-

477
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,140
-tell him to go to hell.
-May the Lord be with you sir...

478
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:56,610
Lord, deliver us from the hands of evil.

479
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:59,110
In nomine Padre, et...

480
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,750
Come on, hurry up.

481
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,390
Piss off and don't show up here for a while.

482
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,280
Bring on the reward.
-Worked out fine, eh?

483
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:05,600
You really know your stuff.

484
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:07,800
Are all of Parker's guys that dumb?

485
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,300
More or less.

486
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,400
Ok, now I have had enough
of your silly laugh.

487
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:27,200
It's 2000 dollars, right?

488
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,800
What's your name?
-Mitch.

489
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:34,950
Okay, here's your share, Mitch.
Plus 200 for the bump in the head.

490
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,750
Say "thank you".
-Thanks, buddy!

491
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,700
Stupid traitor!

492
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:46,160
Maddock will give you what you deserve!

493
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:49,450
You nasty bastard!
He'll send you to hell for that!

494
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,670
Bastard!

495
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:54,180
So, what's up on the mission?
-I've no idea.

496
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:58,240
I only take care of things here
in this town, that's it, I swear.

497
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,990
Will you be paid for by Parker for that?
-Yes.

498
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,950
What do you know about the mission?
-Nothing.

499
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:07,410
They get their money for killing people.

500
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,790
If they succeed, you mean?
-Yes.

501
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:13,330
Farewell and bon voyage.
-Thanks.

502
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,080
We still see each other?
-Sure.

503
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,660
Brave man.

504
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:29,950
Hey, look...

505
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:39,570
-Well now, what a nice surprise.
-We were just saying the same thing.

506
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:45,360
-I thought you were heading north?
-I was, but I got a letter to a mister...

507
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,130
...Stingaree Smith.

508
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:56,360
Good old Stingaree? A friend of ours.
He's out of town right now.

509
01:28:56,530 --> 01:29:01,780
-We can give it to him when he come back.
-Who do we tell it its from?

510
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:07,830
Murdoch. Yes, brother Murdoch.
A monk we ran into a couple a days ago.

511
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:14,030
He also told us that Mr Stingaree should
not forget to set up his scarecrows.

512
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:19,740
Fine, we'll tell him.
By the way, how's the family?

513
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:23,860
-They're fine down at the mission.
-The mission?

514
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:28,540
Yes, those lonely monks had a nice time
feeding our little Fred.

515
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:33,970
You better get back. Their gruel may
unsettle little Fred's stomach.

516
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,480
-Well, goodbye then, and thanks again.
-Goodbye.

517
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:54,070
-Now we can worry about that stage.
-How about going to the mission?

518
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:59,280
No, you're riding to the postalstation at
Apache Springs.

519
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:06,550
-That's where you got to hold up that stage.
-Now? That's 20 miles from here!

520
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:15,360
Son of a buzzard.

521
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,960
That's for the little ones.

522
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,050
This potion will do him good.
It'll cure his suffering.

523
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:44,570
Brother Clementino knows all secrets
of the herbs.

524
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,870
Thank you very much.

525
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,700
I'm sorry that we can't accommodate
you in our house...

526
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,290
but the rule of our order
strictly forbids it.

527
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,320
We have to live in seclusion.

528
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:57,250
We sleep in our wagon, we're used to that.

529
01:30:57,270 --> 01:31:00,550
Good night, my friends.
Sleep well. Quietude.

530
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,830
Good night.

531
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:04,330
Good night, darling.

532
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:21,750
Jag är inte trött.
Jag kan väl få vara uppe lite till?

533
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,400
-Hi!
-Hi!

534
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:18,760
-What are you doing there?
-What am I doing here? I'm on duty.

535
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:25,280
-On the wall?
-Captain ordered me-

536
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,280
-to keep an eye on this wall, so...

537
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:35,820
Wait there...

538
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:01,030
I was on duty on the wall, but...

539
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:30,400
Bring your bottle to your room.
We close at midnight.

540
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:43,540
What... are you doing?

541
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:54,730
-Where's the sheriff?
-He disappeared. Over a week ago.

542
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,560
-Do you know were Stingaree Smith is?
-In jail.

543
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:07,060
-Who put him in?
-The sheriff, I guess.

544
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:27,310
-What time is it?
-Exactly 10 o'clock.

545
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,640
-They're probably still in town.
-What are you gonna do?

546
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:40,150
-Take care of them two federals!
-I wouldn't push my luck with them...

547
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:48,100
They are no more federal agents than I am,
they're a couple of fast drawing pro's.

548
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:51,600
Parker got another shipment for Gonzales!

549
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,700
Back, march march!

550
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,460
This time you've been lucky, but...
-Shut up!

551
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:29,350
-Do you love me?
-You said it...

552
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:36,720
-Are you gonna settle here?
-We're hoping to, there's good land and all.

553
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:42,560
The prior was willing to give us an old
farmhouse, but the bishop wouldn't let him.

554
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,330
-Maybe because we're protestants.

555
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:56,100
-What are you, lutheran or baptist?
-Is that so important?

556
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,600
No, I do not care which.
But my father and mother, you know...

557
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Ok, I see, but you know...

558
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:08,240
In the secret service we're not allowed
to talk about private things.

559
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,390
But we...

560
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:16,950
Open up!
-We'll break the gate!

561
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,600
Run into the carriage. Hurry up.

562
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:25,600
It's me. Gonzales is here!

563
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:37,930
Oh, no, they're back again...
Hurry up brothers, come out!

564
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:59,750
-May the Lord be with...
-Gonzales and his men!

565
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,790
-It's almost full.

566
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:09,970
Vamos, let's go to work!

567
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:28,080
Hey, you can pray later, now you work!

568
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:09,600
Here... it's 50 000 dollars brother.

569
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:19,050
Be careful - or señor Parker
will give you his blessing.

570
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:33,070
Every monk who is a monk, hands up!

571
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:44,210
Every monk who is a monk,
punch a monk who isn't a monk.

572
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,510
Hands up!

573
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:58,260
Stay there, and don't move.

574
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:03,930
This is the last time you sneak guns
across the border, right?

575
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,750
And don't you forget it.

576
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:14,400
-You almost killed him.
-No, I just hurt him, so I'll find out more.

577
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,130
-But maybe you'll explain why they're here.
-Lieutenant, what happened?

578
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,380
-Lieutenant?
-Yeah, a federal lieutenant.

579
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:31,010
Heaven protect us from Parker's wrath.
Even the mexican bandits are out-

580
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:35,870
-to get us now... Parker sells arms and ammo
to bandits-

581
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:42,730
-across the border. And he's uses our mission
as a tradingpost... and as a bank too.

582
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:49,580
-I have to keep this, as evidence.
-If Murdoch doesn't find the money-

583
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:53,550
-there's no telling what he'll do.
-He won't do a thing-

584
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:59,510
-not with me and my captain around.
-But they're a gang of cutthroats!

585
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:05,210
And you think one horde is enough to scare
two federal agents?

586
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,200
Hey...

587
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:20,930
-Have you seen Stingaree Smiths and his boys?
-They're in jail.

588
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:26,960
The sheriff came back, slap them
into jail and rode off again.

589
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,800
-Well, good night senjor.
-What time is it?

590
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,210
It's about 10 o'clock...

591
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:56,030
Get the keys.
-So lets get moving.

592
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:22,190
You may have the upper hand now,
but when we get out of here...

593
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:39,000
Where the heck have you been?

594
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:56,710
-It took you so long time to come back?
-40 miles in two hours isn't too bad.

595
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,350
-How do things look?
-Mighty sad...

596
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:07,740
For the stage, not for us though.

597
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:26,150
Allright, once more now...
I don't want no slip-ups.

598
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:32,480
When the stage pulls in...
at the Apache Springs poststation...

599
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:38,710
I'm going to the stage and hold you up,
You go for your gun, I shoot wide,

600
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:44,190
I ride with you on my tail,
and we split the loot.

601
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:51,650
Well, here we go.
This is your first stage, isn't it?

602
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,130
Just relax and everything will go smooth.

603
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:42,980
God, you don't think there will be any
trouble, do you? I am so afraid.

604
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:51,150
-Don't worry, Agnes - I'm here.
-No one with his right mind would attack-

605
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:59,810
-a stage, when the drivers are rested.
Believe me, no one is gonna stop us now.

606
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:10,900
Hold your horses!

607
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:17,860
Everybody out, on the double!

608
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:33,780
Let's go fatso. Get a move on!

609
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,180
You thought I wouldn't do it, huh?

610
01:45:46,410 --> 01:45:51,400
A little ventilation is good for you brain,
huh, gunslinger?

611
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:54,380
Allright, drop your belt.

612
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:04,500
And now you can hand over the money.

613
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,980
1000 dollars more...
Fork it over, before it's too late.

614
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:28,900
Oh, don't bother, thanks anyway.
I got to be going now. Mam...

615
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,900
See you around.

616
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:45,690
-Ain't he the weirdest now...
-Come on, Agnes.

617
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:54,060
We're all in one piece.
-No one would attack us right outside town?

618
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:11,730
-I'm sorry, father.
-It's nothing, it happens to the best of us.

619
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:13,860
Someone is coming!

620
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,790
-It could be someone who come to confess.
-I kind of doubt that.

621
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:53,410
-May the good Lord...
-Put a bullet between your eyes!

622
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:58,830
I won't kill you here on the spot, because
mom says that maybe you're my brother.

623
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:05,810
-You fork over my share, or you'll die!
-You thought I was out to rob you?

624
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:13,010
I wanted to show I learned robbing from you.
You may be heads-up, but I'm ain't sleeping.

625
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:24,310
I wanted to go to the mission and lay my
hands on that bunch of money.

626
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:30,230
-Bunch of money, huh? Where's the money?
-Right there in the mission.

627
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:33,810
Parker was forcing those poor monks there...

628
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:46,150
-What do you say to that?
-Let's see the money.

629
01:49:01,150 --> 01:49:05,900
-I thank you for coming, captain.
-It's my duty, where's the money?

630
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:11,230
-Money.
-Go and fetch the root of all evil...

631
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,830
Hurry up, Clem.

632
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,410
-You know, they're farmers.
-They're nice though...

633
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:32,830
Here's the root of all evil...

634
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:39,880
-Isn't that terrible, captain?
-Yeah, it's dreadful.

635
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:46,000
Lieutenant, you go get things organized,
while I take the cargo down to headquarters.

636
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:49,200
Maybe it's better if I go, sir?

637
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:57,800
-No, I prefer that we handle it together.
-Yeah, later...

638
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:06,480
-In the meantime, get your guns.
-What guns, captain?

639
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:10,020
Ain't that something, they don't carry guns.

640
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:13,880
Father, father... they're coming!

641
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:21,660
-Keep calm, brothers!
-Get the gate closed and try to gain time.

642
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:31,730
Halt!

643
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:35,400
Now, where's that fool going?

644
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Open up!

645
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:52,200
Open up, I said!

646
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:05,100
This is the Lords house, brothers!
Come in peace, and he shall enter.

647
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:14,250
He sure is nagging...
Allright, off with your guns.

648
01:51:56,430 --> 01:52:00,800
You think you're invulnerable
behind those robes?

649
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:07,400
It seems you haven't limited yourself to
preaching, but shot my clients with buckshot?

650
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:17,390
Murdoch... Pick up the money,
and blow up this barn.

651
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,060
-Blow up the barn...?
-Quiet you old fool!

652
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:35,030
There isn't a nickel in this whole well,
Mr Parker.

653
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:43,440
The money. Well, you're asking for it...
- Murdoch, it's all yours!

654
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:54,600
Allright, lets move it.
I said get out of the... !

655
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:06,830
Now you move it, over there with the others.

656
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:19,100
-You again?
-Yeah, us.

657
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:23,000
Drop 'em, or she's dead!

658
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:28,260
It looks like the show is over, huh.

659
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:33,000
Allright, hold it...

660
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:44,510
Well done, Murdoch. One moment...
First a little detail worth 50 000...

661
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:02,910
Nice work, boys.

662
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:07,500
Where are you going, you fool?

663
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:16,180
Hey, boys!

664
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:34,760
-Do you have any use for this?
-I don't know, ask them.

665
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,850
You have any use for this?

666
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,930
-Hold it!

667
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:46,930
I said, hold it!

668
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:57,950
-It's empty...
-Go to it.

669
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,200
That money is mine!

670
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:27,700
Let us throw the moneychangers
out of the tempel!

671
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:44,280
Go on!

672
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:22,750
It's locked, my friend.

673
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:30,500
Your guardian-angel wants you
to stand over here.

674
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:59,920
Violence lacks strength when reason
can prevail.

675
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:04,700
You meddling fool!

676
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,750
Why all this violence?

677
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:10,800
-Just like I said, there were nothing to it.
-Yeah, but I'll take that. So long...

678
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:23,180
Stay right where you are, all of you!
Get the monks to one side.

679
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:35,550
I never thought they'd get here.

680
02:03:36,610 --> 02:03:43,450
-Did you sent a monk to fetch the rangers?
-Are you out of your mind.

681
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:48,180
I did, I didn't expect you would arrive
in time.

682
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:51,840
-Did I do wrong?
-No, not at all.

683
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:59,250
Our guardian-angels here, sir.
Without them, all would have been lost.

684
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:05,300
-Captain, ain't it time we go back to HQ.
-Right you are, lieutenant.

685
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:10,540
You know, for a while I mistook you for a
horse-thief we've been hunting for a while.

686
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:15,160
It ain't the first time that happened,
huh, captain?!

687
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:22,280
Sir, here's 50 000 of Parker's bloodmoney.
Take it to the judge.

688
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:27,100
You got the most amazing likeness.

689
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:34,400
Listen, the captain got this for capturing
five of Parker's boys.

690
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:39,660
I guess they're yours, according to the law.
Amazing likeness...

691
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:47,950
-Our salary is pay enough.
-The government can be very proud of you two.

692
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:18,300
I hope you're satisfied now. All the money
lost, just because a ranger recognized you.

693
02:05:19,110 --> 02:05:22,800
The fact is, you can't be trusted.
And thet's the truth.

694
02:05:28,700 --> 02:05:30,200
Oh, no.

695
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:55,000
