1
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:30,078
More, more, Mr. Walsh.
You got to kill them all.

2
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:34,817
The last thing in the world youd want
is to be captured by those heathen redskins.

3
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,561
Rush to him, Miss Sampson.
Rush to your protector.

4
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,864
Seek the shelter of his manly arms.

5
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:44,997
True love, Adrian.

6
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,598
True love laced with heartrending,
devotional gratitude.

7
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:50,932
And cut.

8
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,477
Cut, everybody.

9
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,774
-Next setup, Charlie.
-Yes, Mr. Griffith.

10
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,979
Go get those horses.

11
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,056
l know youre freezing. Were all freezing.

12
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:13,232
There he is, Frank.

13
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,035
Ask him over, gently.

14
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,030
Very good, my dear. Very good, indeed.

15
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,574
Mr. Griffith, sir....

16
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,641
Mr. Aitkens in the car.
Hed like to have a word with you.

17
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,409
-Duffy, how are we with Mr. Walsh?
-Hello.

18
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,473
A bit higher than usual.

19
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,711
How about there?

20
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,220
Be more generous with the blood.
Lay it on thick.

21
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,688
Hes over there, sir. Says that its important.

22
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:40,851
When will Mr. Aitken understand
that when Griffith is filming...

23
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,555
nothing is of greater importance to Griffith?

24
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,667
Sorry, David,
but we need to move fast on this...

25
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,705
if you think its worth moving at all.

26
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,831
Eli Morton in our Texas office...

27
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:57,741
went for some kind of press conference
over the border...

28
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,904
pulled together by this Pancho Villa fellow--

29
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,641
-Villa.
-The Pancho Villa?

30
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,478
Right. According to Eli...

31
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,213
Villa is offering exclusive rights
to any motion-picture company...

32
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,983
interested in filming
his revolutionary army...

33
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,456
-with the vision del norte--
-Del norte.

34
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,354
...in action against the federal forces of,
who he calls...

35
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,694
the despotic President of Mexico, Victorio....

36
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:22,428
-Victoriano Huerta.
-Huerta, right.

37
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,169
Villas terms as follows.

38
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:27,798
Hes asking for &25,000 in advance
against 20% of the profits.

39
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,274
-He wants the money in gold.
-Quite the horse trader.

40
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,743
Hes supposed to be some kind of lnjun
or something.

41
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,837
Hes mestizo. lts a racial mix.

42
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:36,609
Whered you get all that stuff?

43
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:40,813
ls it worth a shot? No story, no actors.
Just shooting an actual military scrap.

44
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,856
-Just that, and that alone.
-Just filming men at war?

45
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,687
Being allowed to place cameras
in the thick of battle?

46
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,422
This may prove as much a revolution
for motion pictures...

47
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,863
-as the one Villa is waging on the ground.
-Real death, real blood.

48
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:55,366
People will get sick to their stomachs
with that show.

49
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,732
Hold it a minute, Harry.

50
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,161
Give her your gloves, will you?

51
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,165
Excuse me.

52
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,341
-Miss Sampson.
-Hello.

53
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,072
lm Frank Thayer.
lm with the Mutual Company.

54
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,047
Mr. Griffith said that....

55
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,914
Youre in charge of gloves, are you?

56
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,791
Harry, thousands of words could be used
to describe individual achievements.

57
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,227
But the historians pen
over time will be no match...

58
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:27,198
for the image the moviemaker captures
in the eye of his camera.

59
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:30,430
20% of the profits for some guy
whos never done a movie before.

60
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:31,902
Theres not a day that passes...

61
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,168
when this guy is not featured
on the front pages of the world press.

62
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:38,870
The man is a star. And stars
are the mothers milk of box office.

63
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,272
You wouldnt consider going down there
and try getting us a better deal?

64
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,251
A bird hasnt been bought yet that
D. W. Griffith couldnt charm down a tree.

65
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,313
Be serious. lf all lve got to do
is setting up the California studio....

66
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,755
Just how competent would you say he is?

67
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,989
You think hes ready
to do something useful?

68
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:00,260
-Who? Who are we talking about?
-Your nephew.

69
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,633
Who, Frank?

70
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,468
Anyone else bidding on the rights?

71
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:06,766
-Hand me those.
-Thanks.

72
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:12,200
Any other movie companies
showing an interest that you know of?

73
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:13,836
We got the inside track.

74
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,643
Money does a whole lot of talking
around here...

75
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,817
-and the heavier it is, the better its heard.
-Right.

76
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,945
You gotta keep your wits about you
around here.

77
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,353
-Yes, sir.
-First, number one thing to remember:

78
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,518
When you meet him,
never look Villa straight in the eye.

79
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,960
You forget that,
you wake up deader than a doornail.

80
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,088
And making any sudden moves
around him...

81
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,861
thats another real good way
to get your scalp creased.

82
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,630
When do we actually meet? Whats the plan?

83
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,569
Villa calls the shots.

84
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,541
Gotta work out how to slip over the border
and find out wherever hes hiding out.

85
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,942
We have to be smuggled into Mexico?

86
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,412
There aint no 创we创 in that equation,
Mr. Thayer.

87
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,314
Eli Morton has got a wife and kids
to think about.

88
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,681
-Thats not gunfire, is it?
-Step right this way, Mr. Thayer.

89
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,783
Lets get you boys a ringside seat
at the Revolution.

90
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,557
Come on up.

91
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,464
The chairs are in there. Come on, fellows.
Lets get a look.

92
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,694
Lets go up to the front, come on.

93
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,167
Lets go right up here. Excuse us for a sec.

94
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,402
Colonel, howre you doing?
Do you mind? Thanks.

95
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,446
These guys are from back East.
Theyve never seen.... Thank you.

96
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,242
Come here, step right up.

97
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,643
There you go.

98
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,253
Thank you.

99
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,338
Feels almost like watching a show
from up here, doesnt it?

100
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,335
Well, its a bit more than playacting, sir.

101
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:57,073
What youre watching is a dictatorship
in the throes of dying.

102
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,174
Yielding up one life at a time.

103
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:03,582
John Reed, Metropolitan magazine.

104
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,783
Frank Thayer, Mutual Film Company.

105
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:09,328
Youre taking the bait, Mr. Thayer?
Youre going to film the battle?

106
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:10,589
lm going to try.

107
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,756
Have a peek at your picture show.

108
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,983
-lts my turn.
-Dont push.

109
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,253
Look at that. To your left.

110
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,018
Hope you dont have any stock
in Doheny Oil, Mr. Thayer.

111
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,426
Oh, God.

112
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:48,194
Shows you what Pancho Villa thinks
of Americans owning Mexican oil.

113
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,299
The bastard doesnt care
whose property he burns.

114
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,237
There he is.
Theres your bloody Robin Hood of Mexico.

115
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,712
Whats he doing?
Hes only taken half the town.

116
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:30,627
-lts off to bed, fellows.
-Good night, Frank.

117
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,568
-Get some sleep.
-Yeah.

118
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,113
Wait. lve never been on a horse.

119
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,049
You will like it.

120
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:49,643
Come on.

121
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,795
He wants to know why the movies
sent him such a clown.

122
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:40,066
He wants to know was Charlie Chaplin
too busy to show up down here?

123
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,341
-He wants to know--
-Griffith wanted to come. He truly did.

124
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,469
Only, hes kind of involved right now.

125
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,674
And this guys
just fucking around down here, right?

126
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,757
He says he dont trust nobody
who dont look him straight in the eye.

127
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,228
l was told that he would kill a man
for doing that.

128
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:08,097
Thats a pile of crap. They dont stop
telling stories about this guy.

129
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:14,933
-Whats that all over your tie?
-lts my school emblem.

130
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:17,303
My colleges.

131
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,576
To which college do you go?

132
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,279
Did, sir. Harvard in Boston.

133
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:31,922
Si. Thats the school
where you make presidents. Si?

134
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:33,954
A few have attended, yes, sir.

135
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,323
One day...

136
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:39,157
Pancho Villa will send his son
to Boston, Harvard.

137
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,434
He says hes knocked out enough sons
to fill every college in America.

138
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,345
ls that the gold?

139
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:58,814
Cash would have been a whole lot lighter,
l can assure you.

140
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:03,618
The last person who tried to give him cash,
Pancho cleaned up his glasses with a bullet.

141
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,021
-Your contrato?
-Yes, sir. lts right here, sir.

142
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,254
Those are the glasses.

143
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,527
One for you, one for me.

144
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,975
Those actresses you work with,
theyre like nurses, right?

145
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,313
They got to have it all the time, dont they?

146
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:33,875
lm not sure thats really true.

147
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,354
Yeah, right. Like youre not
jazzing your brains out, are you?

148
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,318
What?

149
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,333
Whats this 10% of the profits bullshit?
His cuts supposed to be 20%.

150
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,373
You lie to Pancho Villa,
you go back to Harvard in a box!

151
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,070
Sir, that is a mistake. Somebody must have
changed the figures before l had a chance....

152
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,781
lts just my pen.

153
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,812
El plumo, or whatever you call it.

154
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,258
Let me change all these 10s here
into 20s, okay?

155
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:17,656
Here we are. Fixed.

156
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,231
20%, 20%, 20%, 20%.

157
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,733
See, you gotta understand.
He needs the money.

158
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,770
With Wilsons goddamn embargo...

159
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,032
you gotta go the black-market route
to get guns.

160
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,836
lt costs an arm and a leg
to kill somebody down here.

161
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:36,574
No, please.

162
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,814
This pen has gone to college.

163
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,383
lts for your son. Any of your sons.

164
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,686
But your Senor Hearst...

165
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,463
he only writes bad words about Pancho Villa
in sus periodicos.

166
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,932
ln his newspapers.

167
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,934
People, l think...

168
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:03,141
they believe more what they see
on the picture screen.

169
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:07,706
When your President Wilson
sees my movie...

170
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:10,338
he will know he must support Pancho Villa.

171
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,312
He will see that Pancho Villa is a good guy.

172
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,377
That hes not like Presidente Huerta.

173
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,055
-That donkey fucker.
-Yeah, got it.

174
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,772
l hope hes not gonna be offended.
lm not much of a drinker.

175
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,639
Dont worry about it.
He never touches the stuff.

176
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,546
You are Frank.

177
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,272
-Thats your name?
-Frank Thayer, yes, sir.

178
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,386
Pancho is also Frank. Pancho is Francisco.

179
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,149
Thats his real moniker.

180
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,390
Tell me, what would you like,
Francisco Two?

181
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,553
Lemon, vanilla.

182
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,800
Thank you.

183
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,380
lve never seen anyone like him.

184
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,609
There is nobody like him, sonny boy.

185
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,481
lf there was, he would blow their brains out.

186
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,890
-How do we do this?
-You got a plan, Frank?

187
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,550
Besides praying a lot.

188
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:31,323
l think you all just fan out.
Catch whatever you can.

189
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,931
Other than bullets, you mean.

190
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:43,372
Those crazy bastards are not gonna last
10 minutes out there.

191
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,642
Gentlemen, the Mutual Film Company
is about to make history.

192
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:58,614
Thanks to an exclusive arrangement
with Gen. Pancho Villa...

193
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,182
who joins such illustrious Mutual artists...

194
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,922
as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford,
and Fatty Arbuckle...

195
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,260
the public will, for the very first time...

196
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:10,234
be treated to the thrills and chills
of an actual battlefield...

197
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:13,066
as seen through the lens
of the motion picture camera.

198
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,524
Are you worried about the physical danger
your people might be exposed to?

199
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:43,295
Gen. Villa has assigned
his crack guards, his dorados...

200
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,202
thats D-O-R-A-D-O-S...

201
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,604
to guarantee the safety of each
and every one of our camera operators.

202
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,903
Set up in the doorway. Hurry!

203
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,670
Turn around and film the gunner.

204
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:08,118
Sir, you must be really devoted
to this cause!

205
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:12,229
For &1,000 a month, theres nothing
Sam Drebben cant get devoted to.

206
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,289
Plus all the gold teeth l can pull.

207
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,863
Watch your ass, sonny boy.

208
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,875
Another day, another dollar.

209
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,952
Hearst Publications.

210
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,289
You dont have any qualms
about manipulating public opinion...

211
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,916
in favor of a man
many people consider to be...

212
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:42,620
nothing more than a socialist rabble-rouser?

213
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,526
Unlike your employer Mr. Hearst...

214
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:48,431
this company has no interest whatever
in meddling in politics...

215
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:49,991
foreign or domestic.

216
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:53,997
For the millions hes trying to free
of a cruel dictatorship...

217
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,371
Pancho Villa hardly needs Mutuals help...

218
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,673
to enhance his reputation
as the George Washington of Mexico.

219
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:24,696
Bloody hell!

220
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,408
Francisco, youre not dead yet?

221
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:32,671
Still alive, sir.

222
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:32,934
These are just civilians, arent they?

223
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:37,169
Yeah. You make the mistake
of supporting Pancho Villa...

224
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,369
you wind up being a tree ornament.

225
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:10,171
Saves ammunition.

226
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,107
That ones mine.

227
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,224
Next patient.

228
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:22,407
The kids gonna have a playmate soon.
Somebody knocked her up.

229
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:34,648
-That figures.
-What?

230
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:36,722
The Fathers the father.

231
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:46,803
Hes swearing to take care of the kid
and the baby however long they need it for.

232
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:17,124
Hi, Charlie.

233
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:23,168
Good work, Frank.
You didnt get in my way once.

234
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,673
Thank you, Hennie.

235
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,809
And how did it feel today, Mr. Thayer?

236
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,977
Being smack in the middle
of the killing ground.

237
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:34,515
lts shameful to admit
how exciting l found it.

238
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,147
Thats strictly a survivors sensation.

239
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:40,289
Someone elses death
serving as your own reprieve.

240
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,254
Youre in good company, Mr. Thayer.

241
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:46,086
Shamelessness has a big following
down here.

242
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:51,226
Bank robbers, painters, poets,
soldiers of fortune.

243
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:54,637
Enough anarchists to blow up Wall Street
10 times over.

244
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,603
Healing Jews and fighting Jews.

245
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:59,075
Maurice Grossbaum,
a surgeon from lndiana.

246
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:02,136
Sam Drebben,
machine-gunner from the Bronx.

247
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,809
Gen. ngeles came over from the Federales.

248
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:10,577
Studied von Clausewitz,
well-read, an idealist.

249
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:13,657
Hes the other side of the peso
to Gen. Fierro.

250
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:17,887
He gets really ugly unless he kills
at least one prisoner before breakfast.

251
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:20,965
From the merely curious
to the merely morbid.

252
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
All of this on Villas order.

253
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,933
All of this in Villas thrall.

254
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:56,867
You take home a nice recuerdo,
verdad, amigo? A souvenir.

255
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:58,927
But be careful...

256
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:03,140
should they give you some crawly souvenir
in your underwear.

257
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:20,791
Her husband got killed in the fighting today.

258
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,617
And her youngest son, too.

259
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,628
Get this.

260
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:39,402
He just gave her more money
than her old man saw in his entire life.

261
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:45,540
What will they think, my American friends...

262
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:48,108
when they see the movie of Pancho Villa?

263
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,381
l think Mr. Doheny
is gonna be very impressed indeed.

264
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:59,560
He worships the ground that is Mexico.

265
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,962
Doheny worships whats underneath it.

266
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:06,367
Your Senor Hearst
is also muy nervioso. Sientense.

267
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,302
Very nervous.

268
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,537
You know how much
he owns of Mexico, Francisco?

269
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:13,836
Senor Hearst. You know how many acres?

270
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,112
More like 8 million.

271
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:18,806
8 million acres?

272
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:22,812
How many head of cattle
have you stolen from him? 60,000, he says.

273
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,590
You are loco, Juanito. 60,000.

274
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:30,651
50,000, maybe. Maybe 50,000 at most.

275
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,426
So, Francisco, today was not too....

276
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,704
-Boring.
-Boring. lt was not too boring?

277
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:44,867
You became more a man a little,
l think, today.

278
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:48,769
-Maybe you and your amigos--
-Yeah, ld say we had a good start.

279
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:53,315
Today l think they found,
a little bit, their huevos.

280
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:56,079
Even though a few of them got a little wet.

281
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,212
Yes.

282
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,032
You will help.

283
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:22,474
Youll help Americans know
that hope does not stop at the border.

284
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,412
lts my Virgin of Guadalupe.

285
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:27,618
lm deeply honored, sir.

286
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,488
He says you should be.

287
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,519
Youve got the only virgin left around here.

288
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:53,074
Please bear in mind
that our camera operators...

289
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:56,273
had to constantly deal
with movement of men and horses...

290
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:59,840
exploding bombs, clouds of gunpowder.

291
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,348
But what youre looking at is,
without a doubt...

292
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:06,915
never-before-seen footage of live action
shot on an actual field of battle.

293
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:10,052
Never-before-seen footage?
You still cant see it.

294
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:19,702
Theyd have bit the dust a lot better
if D.W. Griffith had directed it.

295
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:25,368
Let me assure you that every one
of these men and women, and every child...

296
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:27,708
died in the very best way that they could.

297
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,448
There he is, boys, on motion-picture film
for all the world to see:

298
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,316
Gen. Pancho Villa.

299
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,878
Despite its technical flaws...

300
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:10,183
clearly more people
would discover Pancho Villa...

301
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:12,519
from a few feet of this crude, historic film...

302
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:15,219
than from the reams that are written
about his struggle...

303
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:18,194
to rid Mexico of its greedy robber barons...

304
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,731
the only ones to profit
from their cozy marriage...

305
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,926
with rapacious American interests.

306
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:27,335
Unfortunately, not everyone happens to be
the socialist-lover that John Reed is.

307
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:31,242
Hearst, no surprise,
is putting our nuts through a wringer.

308
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,535
Pardon me.

309
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:35,313
With all hes got invested in Mexico...

310
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,315
Hearst stands to lose
one or two of his fortunes down there.

311
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,750
Speak up, Harry.
Were a whole country apart, for Gods sake.

312
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,014

322

You know whats so galling about all this?
lts all true.

323
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,305
We had so little control
over what happened.

324
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,510
Villa comes off as some kind of simple,
starstruck cowboy.

325
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:14,813
Give me the strudel.

326
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,821
We didnt offer a clue to his complexity,
to his greatness.

327
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:19,686
What a movie that would make.

328
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:23,626
This would all be better said
to someone with a checkbook, wouldnt it?

329
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,955
Hes been beaten and tortured all his life.

330
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,762
They say that he still has whip scars
across his back.

331
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:32,962
He was a convict before he turned 20.

332
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,130
lts midnight.

333
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:37,369
Before he was 1 2,
he was already being hunted by the law.

334
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:40,409
Now there are places in Mexico
where he is the law.

335
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:42,469
Dont make me fire you twice in one week.

336
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:46,210
Hes the James Boys, hes Billy the Kid,
hes Napoleon...

337
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,512
all rolled into one.

338
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:51,317
But he asks nothing for himself.
He takes nothing.

339
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,390
He builds schools where there were none.
He seizes the homes of the wealthy.

340
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,554
He redistributes the land.
He gives it to the poor. He feeds them.

341
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,530
He even prints his own money.

342
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:03,460
Prints his own money?
The mans not all bad, is he?

343
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,834
Tell me that this material would not make
a fantastic moving picture.

344
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,897
Forget it. The Times said the one we made...

345
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:13,411
looked like a high-school play
that couldnt afford the costumes.

346
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:17,073
For my money, and thats sure as hell
what every penny of it was...

347
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:19,582
we gave Pancho Villa more than his shot.

348
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:23,178
-But we didnt. Thats the whole point.
-Be realistic.

349
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:26,884
Youd never crowd all that stuff
into a two-reeler, not in a million years.

350
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,858
ld make it more like seven.

351
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:32,325
-Seven reels?
-Seven reels.

352
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:35,457
Did you smoke some of that funny stuff
down in Mexico, Frank?

353
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,023
Who in their right minds...

354
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:40,367
is gonna wanna sit through a movie
that runs for over an hour?

355
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:43,407
Theres never a first until someone tries.

356
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:47,235
Dont give me fortune cookies
in the middle of the night, Frank.

357
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,404
And seven reels is a whale of a show...

358
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:52,279
youre ready to give away
for a nickel a ticket.

359
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:54,184
Then double it.

360
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,912
Double it?

361
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,018
-A dime a ticket?
-A dime a ticket.

362
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,351
One good first deserves another.

363
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,926
-These are exciting thoughts, Frank.
-They are.

364
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:12,098
-lm definitely getting excited.
-Dont let me stop you.

365
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,373
lf only they didnt all look
so crummy down there.

366
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,944
For 10 cents,
people are gonna wanna see a lot more...

367
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,879
than a bunch of barefoot buggers
jumping around in the cactus.

368
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:26,473
We can help them look better.
l know we can.

369
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,476
l have to run this past D.W., of course.

370
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:33,383
Hell see the possibilities in a minute.
l promise you.

371
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,858
The Life of General Villa.

372
00:33:58,683 --> 00:33:59,672
Okay.

373
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,779
Hey, you moron, watch the vase!

374
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,134
-Hello, sir.
-Francisco Two.

375
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:49,006
-Do l know you were coming?
-l sent a telegram.

376
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:52,147
When l see it, then l will know you are here.

377
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:56,682
-l missed you many times, mi amigo.
-lve missed you.

378
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,244
Yeah, good. Bueno.

379
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,814
The Virgin, does she answer your prayers?

380
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:04,126
Not with my Spanish, she doesnt.

381
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,892
lts not Spanish. Never Spanish. Mexicano.

382
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:11,991
There are two things
Spain give to my people:

383
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,835
the church and the weapon.

384
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,435
You should write a book.

385
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,572
Maybe l have to read one or two first.

386
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,219
This is the battle?

387
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:38,326
So much there.

388
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:41,523
Two little circles.

389
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:44,795
Magic.

390
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:49,567
Tomorrow, we must liberate
a projector somewhere.

391
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,532
Tell me are you hungry, thirsty?

392
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,506
House of great wealth.

393
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,409
Not one drop of ice cream.

394
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:10,053
lf my father saw us here,
me and my brother, he would say:

395
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,393
Before your head grows a boot.

396
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,062
A room like this.

397
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,831
Such a room could be only for a don.

398
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:22,939
Or for a foreigner.

399
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,740
lnto a room like this,
my father could only crawl...

400
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:34,376
to beg for some food for himself,
for his family.

401
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,783
There are books here
that weigh more than he did when he died.

402
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:48,127
Welcome back to Mexico.

403
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,116
-Are you all right, Francisco?
-Yes, thanks.

404
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,086
ls the horse riding you well?

405
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,620
You did not come all this way...

406
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,923
-only to bring me my film, right?
-Right.

407
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:27,499
Another movie? You want to make
another movie with Pancho Villa?

408
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:30,200
Yes, sir. Same deal as last time.
Same money.

409
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:35,569
Your President Wilson
has lifted the arms embargo.

410
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,078
Money is not a problem
for Pancho Villa anymore.

411
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:44,215
Tell me, has there ever been
a movie of Don Quixote, do you know?

412
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,850
No, not that l know of. No, sir.

413
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:49,558
Not one movie of Don Quixote?

414
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,691
And Senor Aitken wants to make
two of Pancho Villa.

415
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:56,461
We believe that this story, this photoplay...

416
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,525
will greatly enhance your popularity...

417
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,299
and its gonna go a long way
to helping the Revolution.

418
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,000
You still have a lot of enemies
in high places though.

419
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:08,068
Yeah. Thats the best place for enemies,
high up where you can see them.

420
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,908
Youd be doing me a very big favor.

421
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:14,281
Remember Don Quixote, mi amigo.

422
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,616
A man must not fight windmills.

423
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,259
Villa positively not interested.

424
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,266

425
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,938

No.

433

Soldiers of Pancho Villa are no bandidos.

434

Youve been robbing me blind
and you bloody well know it.

00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:15,912
No Francisco, no Francisco.

468
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:18,838
l promise you, General...

469
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:23,182
this fine young man is gonna be with you
every damn momentum of the day.

470
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:26,548
Whatever you need, whatever you want,
this is gonna be your man.

471
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:28,489
Every bit as hes gonna be mine.

472
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:32,452
lts right here, sir.

473
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:38,702
&25,000, as before.

474
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:41,337
l take it we have a deal, sir.

475
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,171
The soldiers of Pancho Villa...

476
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:50,873
have left behind many huerfanos y viudas.

477
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:53,374
Lots of widows and orphans.

478
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,179
Hes up to his ass in them.

479
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,247
They are very sad. Theyre very poor.

480
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,017
The General is most sensitive.

481
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,796
A leader must be muy sensitive.

482
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,831
You must give to Pancho Villa,
when into Mexico City...

483
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:15,932
after the Revolution....

484
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:20,641
-A print?
-A print.

485
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:25,004
He wants his own print.

486
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:27,910
l think he wants to have
his own premiere here.

487
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,145
Pancho Villa, too, needs nickels.

488
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,850
Many nickels for those who lost so much...

489
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:39,157
and for those who lost so many.

490
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:44,193
l will be very happy to write that
into the agreement this very minute, sir.

491
00:48:45,836 --> 00:48:48,304
No es necesario, my good sir.

492
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:52,034
For Pancho Villa, your hand is your word.

493
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:57,576
Certainly. Of course.

494
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,374
lts my pleasure, sir.

495
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,900
-Hiya, Duffy.
-Hey, Frank.

496
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:03,845
-Everything okay? Nice to see you.
-At least we made it.

497
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:06,077
Hi, Charlie, how are you?

498
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:12,284
-Wheres the Scotch, Frank?
-Didnt you bring it?

499
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,747
l see youve got gloves this time.

500
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:17,489
-Welcome to Mexico.
-Thank you.

501
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:25,029
Gen. Villa...

502
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:29,706
please allow me to introduce our director.

503
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,139
This is Mr. William Christy Cabanne.

504
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,671
l am so looking forward, sir.

505
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:39,510
And this is Miss Teddy Sampson
who will play the role of your sister.

506
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:46,521
And this is Miss lrene Hunt
who will be your mother.

507
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:57,428
And Charlie Rositer of course you know
from Ojinaga.

508
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,866
Are your huevos all dry now, Charlie?

509
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,267
For the moment.

510
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,908
And this, sir, is Mr. Raoul Walsh.

511
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:08,235
General.

512
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,712
Hell be playing the young Pancho Villa.

513
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,508
Tell me, Raoul Walsh...

514
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:15,811
you know even
which end of the horse shits?

515
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,417
You can be me.

516
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:29,286
Okay, Carl, camera. And action.

517
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:33,621
And say goodbye, Mom.

518
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:37,364
Very nice, yes.
Sis, go get you a little of that.

519
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:41,561
And lovely. Okay.

520
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,973
And its farewell, Pancho. Lets go.

521
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:47,232
And he goes.

522
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,314
And cut! Okay.

523
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,642
Very nice.

524
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,983
Little more of a routine goodbye, Raoul.

525
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,456
Listen, your character
has no way of knowing...

526
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:03,755
what tragic events the days gonna bring.

527
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:07,058
-So keep it big, make it small, okay?
-Christy, l want--

528
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,497
Adrian, give me a wee bit less.
Just hearts, no flowers.

529
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:11,556
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

530
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:12,795
Uno ms, people.

531
00:53:13,303 --> 00:53:17,330
As pronto as possible por favor, makeup.
Okay, lets go, people.

532
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:21,371
-l was just thinking that maybe--
-No, dont think, darling. Just act.

533
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:23,343
Lets just make a movie here.

534
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:26,712
Thats enough, okay?
Look, hes a Mexican. Mexicans sweat.

535
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:28,375
Hes fine. Leave him alone.

536
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:30,943
-Carl, crank them.
-Okay.

537
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:34,089
And from the kiss, por favor.

538
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:36,254
And action.

539
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,962
Much better. And sis....

540
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:41,453
Lovely.

541
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:44,097
Okay, and farewell, Pancho.

542
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,935
Off he goes. Goodbye, Pancho.

543
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,731
Thats good.
One last look at Mom and Sis. A fond look.

544
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:52,432
Fond!

545
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:56,308
You love them. Good.
Wham-bam, out the door.

546
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,375
And, perfect!

547
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,241
Cut, print. Beautiful!

548
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:01,643
Next setup.

549
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:06,655
创Unquestionably the most expensive and
longest motion picture ever contemplated. 创

550
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,652
So reads
the Mutual Film Company publicity.

551
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,558
An unprecedented seven 15-minute reels...

552
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:16,027
two of which will be filmed
during the upcoming battle of Torreon...

553
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:18,624
for which Villas forces are now preparing.

554
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,831
Mutual Company promises
an additional 5 reels...

555
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:28,343
devoted to a specially written photoplay.:

556
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:31,813
The Factual Story
of the Heroic Life of Pancho Villa.

557
00:54:35,018 --> 00:54:37,213
Every page is a page of lies.

558
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:42,458
l dont understand.

559
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,456
Mierda means 创shit.创

560
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,186
l know that.
l just dont know why you say that--

561
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:51,701
创Pancho Villa becomes an outlaw when
the Federales take away his fathers land.创

562
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,930
The land of Pancho Villas father
was his grave!

563
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:58,304
Mr. Aitken feels thats more colorful.
Thats only dramatic license.

564
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,967
lt is a license to lie!

565
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:02,511
-You dont understand.
-Yes, l understand.

566
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,514
l understand that never does Pancho Villa...

567
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:08,847
want the world to see his sister Mariana
raped by Federales.

568
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:11,319
But thats what turned you into a rebel.

569
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:14,152
l know why l became what l became.

570
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:18,588
Pancho Villa does not have to see a movie
to find out who is Pancho Villa.

571
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:23,263
Presidente Villa.

572
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,767
From where does this fantasia come?

573
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,595
You have learned nothing from Juan Reed.

574
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:32,108
-There will never be a Presidente Villa.
-But there could be.

575
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:34,700
The Revolucion
is to feed the peoples hungry bellies...

576
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:38,771
-not the ambition of Pancho Villa.
-All right, but its a wonderful scene.

577
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:49,849
Okay, we can make it a dream sequence.

578
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,286
Pancho Villas dream...

579
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,330
is for a man of education
to be presidente of Mexico.

580
00:55:54,398 --> 00:55:57,799
Your Presidente Wilson,
he was a professor, si?

581
00:55:58,335 --> 00:56:01,361
Pancho Villa is a professor
of horses and soldiers.

582
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:05,802
See, thats exactly what General Grant was,
and he became president.

583
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:08,602
That drunk dogface.

584
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:12,006
He killed Mexicanos
like he killed his whiskey bottles.

585
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,542
l had no idea.

586
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:17,178
No, in your history books
there are no bad Americanos.

587
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:20,250
He came before there was oil to steal.

588
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:24,521
He came for the gold. He came for the silver.
He came for the azcar. Es un insulto.

589
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:27,893
You want to shoot the battle of Torren,
you bring your cameras there.

590
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:31,365
You dont shoot the life of Pancho Villa
that he has never lived.

591
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,995
Mutual has a fortune sunk into this.

592
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:36,335
Lies are expensive, Francisco.

593
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:41,901
Senor Aitken, he tells to the world
he will tell the truth about Pancho Villa.

594
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,311
Esta basura! This is fake garbage!

595
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,883
May l ask you, sir...

596
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:59,686
did you murder William Benton?

597
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:09,871
l dont believe you did.

598
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,601
But a hell of a lot of your enemies...

599
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:15,372
are trying to convince
a hell of a lot of other folks that you did.

600
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,546
lf you can believe Jack Reed...

601
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:20,048
there are plans in the works
in Washington right now.

602
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:23,780
Plans to invade Mexico
and make Chihuahua our 49th state.

603
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:27,551
Plans to finish you off, knock you off,
any way they can.

604
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,089
You have to understand...

605
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:36,292
that this is the kind of story
the public expects, that they demand.

606
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:39,261
When they go to the movies,
you give them what they want.

607
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:40,860
They give you what you want.

608
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:44,873
And what you want is something
you have never needed more in your life.

609
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:47,708
Their approval.

610
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:54,643
l think every time you see me...

611
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,782
you grow one more huevo, Francisco.

612
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:09,058
And dismount, Raoul.

613
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:10,932
Everyone dismount.

614
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:15,095
And run to greet them.

615
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:17,434
Welcome your hubbies home.

616
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:20,574
Ladies, come on.

617
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:23,110
Lets go, ladies!

618
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,236
Come on.

619
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,644
Mr. Cabanne.

620
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:33,916
Can l get some hugs and kisses here?

621
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:40,327
Ladies, come on.

622
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:43,697
Sweet Jesus! Cut!

623
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,832
Thats a cut, everybody.

624
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,302
lts just not in their nature.
These women are shy.

625
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,566
Shy? They are as wooden
as fucking lndians.

626
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,733
Most of them are fucking lndians.

627
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:54,470
Give me five minutes.

628
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:09,914
Come on, lets go.

629
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:16,294
And dismount, Raoul.

630
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:21,203
-And cue the ladies.
-Ladies.

631
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:41,417
He has his own train.

632
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:45,088
lts just one more thing
hes liberated from the government.

633
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:49,393
Fitted out a few hospital cars to take care
of the wounded, made one for the press.

634
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:53,293
Like a city on wheels.

635
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,271
l walked it the other day.
lts almost 2 miles long.

636
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,337
-Hiya, fellows.
-Hey, Frank.

637
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:04,573
Hello there.

638
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:09,012
These are the Sanchez brothers.
Abraham, Anastasio.

639
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:15,014
Ever paralyze anybody in Spanish before?

640
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:20,251
So this will be the lab.
Well be able to develop our own film.

641
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:22,692
This is the editing room.

642
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:24,461
We can watch our own dailies...

643
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:27,560
which l think will make a real difference
in our work.

644
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,168
Going on and on, arent l?

645
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:34,269
-Youve changed down here.
-Have l?

646
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:37,745
When l first met you,
it was hard to know you were even around.

647
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:42,783
l never once had that problem with you.

648
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:45,880
l gathered.

649
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:48,820
Guess l was fairly obvious.

650
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:51,526
Girls dont mind that one bit.

651
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,772
-What have we got here, boss?
-New wardrobe.

652
01:01:11,581 --> 01:01:13,048
Civil War surplus?

653
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:15,344
Yeah, Aitken got a good deal on it.

654
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:18,953
You dont think these guys are gonna mind?

655
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:23,254
-Dressing up like the losing side.
-l think well keep that our little secret.

656
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:44,545
Pretty impressive.

657
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:48,081
French, 75 mm. Perfect for the job.

658
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:06,534
Really! Mary Pickford doesnt take this long
in makeup.

659
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:09,003
Mary Pickford isnt running a revolution
on the side.

660
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,767
Dont think she couldnt.

661
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,966
Here we go.

662
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:16,839
How do l look?

663
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:34,955
Youre weary, General.

664
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,532
Trappings of power mean nothing to you.

665
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:41,796
Your every goal has been achieved.

666
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,200
Youve avenged your family.

667
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:46,902
Youve righted the wrongs
against your people.

668
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:49,304
Many lives have been sacrificed...

669
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,274
but in the end, you have
saved the life of your beloved Mexico.

670
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:58,910
But the work of a president is never done.

671
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:00,378
Lawrence.

672
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,519
And return to your desk, General.

673
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:08,353
Pick up the pen...

674
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:10,657
and sign the document.

675
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:12,890
Good.

676
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:17,068
Lawrence, take the paper and leave.
Bow and go.

677
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:21,910
And now the weariness returns.

678
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:27,006
Can you give me a sigh, General?

679
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:37,985
Beautiful.

680
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:40,251
And now your speech.

681
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,929
lnto the camera...

682
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:45,830
into the lens that is the eye
that sees for all the world.

683
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,906
Chapeau to you, sir. One take.

684
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:33,942
ls there anything the man cannot do?

685
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,987
lt is easy to be president in a movie.

686
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:43,182
ln a movie, Pancho Villa could be the Pope.

687
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:48,162
ln the end, there will be other better men
who will sit in Mexico City.

688
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:51,631
And youll do what? Surely not retire?

689
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:56,796
l think the government would open a factory
to make good saddles at Frago.

690
01:04:57,974 --> 01:05:00,704
Pancho Villa, his hands filled with leather.

691
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,442
Pancho Villas hands are leather.

692
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:06,515
And you would settle for just doing that?

693
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:10,146
That and watch that Mexico
does not become...

694
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,848
another star on the flag of your country.

695
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:14,355
And what about you?

696
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:19,390
What Pancho Villa wants...

697
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,590
for himself?

698
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:27,996
A parade when he dies.

699
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,741
A parade, many tears, and many flowers.

700
01:05:35,011 --> 01:05:37,275
For the children to miss his candy.

701
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:40,915
A funeral...

702
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:44,446
with many poets and singing.

703
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:47,554
And at the end, a tomb.

704
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:49,686
A big tomb...

705
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:52,155
where they can come...

706
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:57,822
where people can come,
and see Pancho Villa...

707
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:01,098
will be always there for them.

708
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,302
Always.

709
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:55,513
You know, l wrote this scene in my head...

710
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:58,158
the very first time l laid eyes on you.

711
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:00,221
Was l okay?

712
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,897
You want to try one more take?

713
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:05,666
ls it too soon?

714
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:08,503
l dont know. Maybe not.

715
01:07:11,841 --> 01:07:13,331
lm sure not.

716
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:21,241
创Onward and upward创 is the ticket.
Thats what Mom always taught me.

717
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,948
Tomorrow we leave...

718
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:33,754
to begin the last chapter of the Revolucion.

719
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:03,349
Bravo, General.

720
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:12,759
You have much to film in the battle,
my friend.

721
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,232
-The battle, sir?
-The battle of Torren.

722
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:18,668
l wont be going with you.

723
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:21,236
No, l finished my part in this film.

724
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:23,072
lm going to New Jersey.

725
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,213
To start a new one.

726
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:27,640
Really. You can call my agent.

727
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:29,780
Excuse me, Gen. Villa.

728
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:33,545
Me, l dont go, sir.

729
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,460
You, too? Youre not going?

730
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:47,565
No, sir, my works through here.

731
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:50,232
Only the camera operators are going.

732
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,645
-Whats happening?
-lm not sure.

733
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:05,613
Oh, my God!

734
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:08,886
Calling for a firing squad.

735
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,204
Here, Pancho Villa is the director.

736
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:29,777
Here Pancho Villa says
who is finished and who is not finished.

737
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,439
Now you know
what you will miss at Torren.

738
01:10:28,237 --> 01:10:30,000
Will you take this?

739
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:42,382
Too bad them actresses dont do no jazzing.

740
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:09,576
The hell they are!

741
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:14,314
Put the gun away.

742
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:23,484
General, these boys
have been such a help to the movie...

743
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:25,493
and now youre turning them into soldiers?

744
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:36,462
You cant.

745
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:39,337
ls this what you want
for the children of Mexico?

746
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:43,139
Schools for only some,
Harvard just for yours, death for the rest?

747
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:56,148
One boy for you, one boy for Villa.

748
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:58,793
How can anyone possibly make that choice?

749
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:34,660
That one for you. lll take the winner.

750
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,455
Now we find the end of the shots.

751
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:44,954
Close your stinking mouth.

752
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:59,663
-You remember our agreement.
-Pancho Villa forgets nothing.

753
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,670
All right, got your cameras?

754
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,619
Ready?

755
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,708
Everyone ready?

756
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,947
Start cranking!

757
01:16:47,216 --> 01:16:50,117
And action!

758
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:23,044
Keep firing.

759
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:43,123
Come here.

760
01:18:43,832 --> 01:18:47,461
ln the center in the valley of Torren...

761
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,967
is the armory of Huerta.

762
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,302
Enough guns for Pancho Villa
to make a hundred revolutions.

763
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:55,969
At Torren...

764
01:18:56,045 --> 01:19:00,277
Pancho Villa will give his General ngeles
and your Senor Aitken...

765
01:19:00,382 --> 01:19:03,146
the mucho boom-boom.

766
01:19:04,253 --> 01:19:05,584
Excuse me, sir.

767
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:09,314
Youre attacking from here. This is the east?

768
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:12,520
Youre firing at the Federales from the east?

769
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:15,028
ls there any special reason
for that plan, sir?

770
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:16,689
Si. Because its mine.

771
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:19,890
What?

772
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:24,767
Your cameras going to shoot
into the sun, huh?

773
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,905
Your lenses are not strong enough.

774
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,704
Nowhere near enough, no, sir.

775
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,642
Maybe you can move the cameras
to the side.

776
01:19:30,712 --> 01:19:32,771
This way the sun can come across.

777
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:33,837
Or....

778
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:36,746
Or what?

779
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,621
Could you change your attack
so that you fire from the west...

780
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,180
instead of the east?

781
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:46,594
That would give us so much better a picture.

782
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:12,519
We kill them all your way.

783
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:30,658
Action, Senor Griffith.

784
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,156
Action.

785
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:47,751
The thing is, its always easier for an army
to defend a position...

786
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:49,757
than it is for one to take it.

787
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:53,886
l suppose youre right. Took the Turks
500 years to capture Constantinople.

788
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:20,314
Whats this?

789
01:26:20,922 --> 01:26:24,255
lf we fight the Federales for 1,000 years
we cannot beat them...

790
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:25,953
unless we fight them this way.

791
01:26:26,027 --> 01:26:29,292
By day we can win the battle,
by night we will win the war.

792
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,956
But you always mustve known that.

793
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,501
ln the dark l can smell the Federales fear.

794
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:35,797
With fear comes defeat.

795
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:39,034
You never really intended
to honor our contract, did you?

796
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,768
My only contract is honored with Mexico.

797
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:44,508
Theres no choice.

798
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:47,309
lts better for me to lose the movie
than the Revolution.

799
01:27:20,048 --> 01:27:21,845
What the hell was in there?

800
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,880
The Federales hide their ammunition
in the church.

801
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:27,887
This way they go to heaven faster.

802
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:30,350
Plenty of light now, Francisco.

803
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,792
-Hello, sonny boy.
-Hi.

804
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:56,802
Take some of this.

805
01:29:57,372 --> 01:29:58,361
Thanks.

806
01:30:09,651 --> 01:30:11,118
Frigging rainwater.

807
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:12,950
Thats all there is.

808
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:15,615
lf you ask me, cows have been pissing in it.

809
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,956
Hell of a show the boss put on last night.

810
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:24,094
l didnt get one foot of it.

811
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:27,429
There are those days, kid.
There are those days.

812
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:31,730
-Sorry, Sam.
-Dont worry about it.

813
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:35,105
You can take a Jew apart,
you can never kill him altogether.

814
01:30:36,444 --> 01:30:39,140
Used to aggravate the hell out of my mother.

815
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:41,007
Theres a law, you know.

816
01:30:41,082 --> 01:30:45,018
Anybody with a tattoo, no Jewish cemetery
will let you get buried there.

817
01:30:45,553 --> 01:30:48,920
As if its gonna bother somebody
in the next grave, right?

818
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:54,358
l cant tell you how happy
this is going to make my mother.

819
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:40,240
Charlie, set up fast.

820
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,502
This is the scene we missed at Ojinaga.

821
01:32:44,138 --> 01:32:45,127
My God.

822
01:32:47,175 --> 01:32:48,403
How could you?

823
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:52,307
Dont speak to me of God.

824
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:55,405
God has never been to Mexico!

825
01:32:56,517 --> 01:32:59,077
lf he has been, he has a heart of stone!

826
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:18,368
Go home, Frank.

827
01:33:21,743 --> 01:33:22,869
All of you!

828
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:29,577
Go where to be born is to be equal.

829
01:33:30,618 --> 01:33:33,587
The children of Mexico are not yet so lucky.

830
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:01,971
Mr. Walsh.

831
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:03,311
One more!

832
01:34:04,852 --> 01:34:06,683
Very still, now. Very still.

833
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,385
As far as lm concerned,
two-reel films are a thing of the past.

834
01:34:14,462 --> 01:34:15,986
l can imagine the time...

835
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,292
when a 5-reel picture was....

836
01:34:18,266 --> 01:34:21,326
lts not gonna be an easy thing to see
for us, because we....

837
01:34:29,911 --> 01:34:31,139
Good evening.

838
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:33,179
Nice to see you again.

839
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:34,475
Good evening.

840
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:39,113
Onward and upward. Thats the ticket.

841
01:39:33,281 --> 01:39:34,407
Jack.

842
01:39:36,884 --> 01:39:40,342
l want you to know
l fought against editing that shot that way.

843
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:43,918
lt means a lot to me
for you to understand that.

844
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:48,226
l understand the difficulty
in selling tickets to see a hero...

845
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:50,457
who mows down widows in cold blood.

846
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:56,459
l even understand the commercial need
to transform an outlaw into an aristocrat.

847
01:39:58,806 --> 01:40:02,071
Or passing off whores as loving wives.

848
01:40:02,843 --> 01:40:05,038
Barefoot peasants who are
entitled to freedom...

849
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:08,343
only after theyve been properly dressed
for the occasion.

850
01:40:09,417 --> 01:40:11,544
lts a process of evolution.

851
01:40:12,553 --> 01:40:15,750
lts the movies turn to make truth
the first casualty of war.

852
01:40:15,823 --> 01:40:19,350
-ls there a second?
-Well, if thats the first, who cares?

853
01:40:21,062 --> 01:40:22,927
Why did he kill her, Jack?

854
01:40:23,698 --> 01:40:27,156
So coldly, so brutally.

855
01:40:27,735 --> 01:40:30,499
lts as though
he killed the whole Revolution.

856
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:35,334
You know what it is
to say to a whole country:

857
01:40:35,409 --> 01:40:38,401
创Let me make everything thats wrong
right for you.

858
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:41,611
创Let me carry you all on my shoulders创?

859
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:45,544
Eventually you begin to resent the weight.

860
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,489
Youd never know that from the movie
l let it become.

861
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:52,284
Well, youll find a way to live with yourself.

862
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,420
Youll find a way to live with Pancho, too.

863
01:40:56,497 --> 01:40:59,660
You used each other, Frank.
Mutual and Villa.

864
01:41:01,035 --> 01:41:03,560
Together you proved that the lens...

865
01:41:03,704 --> 01:41:06,298
is a hell of a lot mightier than the sword.

866
01:41:39,673 --> 01:41:41,766
Hey, sonny boy!

867
01:41:46,213 --> 01:41:47,840
Sam Drebben.

868
01:41:49,517 --> 01:41:51,144
My God.

869
01:41:51,419 --> 01:41:53,114
Sit im here. Park it.

870
01:41:59,293 --> 01:42:00,920
Yeah, careful, sweetheart.

871
01:42:00,995 --> 01:42:03,054
Shes got a bladder like a faucet.

872
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:05,724
Watch what you say.
She thinks lm a paint salesman.

873
01:42:07,902 --> 01:42:09,096
Yeah, right, Ma.

874
01:42:11,105 --> 01:42:13,505
-ice cream.
-Okay, Ma.

875
01:42:14,508 --> 01:42:16,271
Shades of Pancho Villa.

876
01:42:16,343 --> 01:42:18,334
Shes tougher, believe me.

877
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:22,309
Got too good a look at a Federale bayonet.

878
01:42:23,217 --> 01:42:27,449
-You dont still work for him, do you?
-No, not since after the Revolution.

879
01:42:27,888 --> 01:42:30,880
Funny guy, Pancho.
He gave me a letter of reference.

880
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:33,859
He said Moses should have used me
for a machine gun.

881
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:36,862
Wrote it with your pen, too.

882
01:42:38,232 --> 01:42:42,464
He was pretty browned off with you guys.
He never did get to see that movie.

883
01:42:42,536 --> 01:42:45,699
Jack Reed said that
we made him look so good...

884
01:42:45,773 --> 01:42:48,708
that Washington held off the idea
of invading Mexico.

885
01:42:48,776 --> 01:42:51,574
Be that as it may, you welshed on him.
l was there...

886
01:42:51,645 --> 01:42:54,205
when you promised him
a print for the widows, remember?

887
01:42:54,281 --> 01:42:57,512
-And the orphans, remember?
-Aitken was mad he broke the contract.

888
01:42:57,585 --> 01:43:00,315
Like Aitken needed an excuse
to be full of shit.

889
01:43:01,889 --> 01:43:03,652
Some revolution.

890
01:43:03,724 --> 01:43:06,852
The new fuckers
are the same as the old fuckers.

891
01:43:07,027 --> 01:43:11,191
Big guys up here still control
everything thats going on down there.

892
01:43:11,298 --> 01:43:15,962
Both sides of the border still scared shitless
Panchos going to start shooting again...

893
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:18,436
because the Revolutions turned sour.

894
01:43:19,607 --> 01:43:22,235
You want my two cents,
for what theyre worth?

895
01:43:22,343 --> 01:43:24,368
Mexico would be a hell of a lot better off...

896
01:43:24,445 --> 01:43:27,972
if God had taken his goddamn oil
and shoved it under Brooklyn.

897
01:43:42,363 --> 01:43:45,161
l wish very much
that you had been in Baralf...

898
01:43:45,232 --> 01:43:47,223
for the christening of my first-born.:

899
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:51,269
Anastasio Francisco.
Named for my brother and for you.

900
01:43:51,839 --> 01:43:54,273
l hope he will be proud to say one day...

901
01:43:54,341 --> 01:43:56,901
that he is the godson of Pancho Villa.

902
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:29,504
At the christening party...

903
01:44:29,577 --> 01:44:32,842
the General was very much
as the General always was.

904
01:44:33,047 --> 01:44:37,416
Though some said later
he was more quiet, more thoughtful.

905
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:40,614
They say he had a premonition.

906
01:44:46,193 --> 01:44:49,720
After giving my son
his medal of the Virgin of Guadalupe...

907
01:44:49,797 --> 01:44:53,563
which many times over
he would say really belonged to you...

908
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:56,969
he started to drive back
to his hacienda grande...

909
01:44:57,037 --> 01:44:59,164
with his secretary and two guards.

910
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,270
And then, in the center of Parral....

911
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,565
Some say the government
killed Pancho Villa.

912
01:45:35,743 --> 01:45:39,509
Some say it was the gringos.
Some say it was both.

913
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:44,782
The General was dragged away
like an animal.

914
01:45:45,085 --> 01:45:47,349
Even in death they are afraid of him.

915
01:45:47,988 --> 01:45:50,786
He is without a grave. He has no tomb.

916
01:45:51,992 --> 01:45:54,392
How will they remember him, Senor Frank?

917
01:45:54,595 --> 01:45:57,792
How will the sons of Mexico
remember our Pancho Villa?

918
01:47:06,867 --> 01:47:09,859
Following his assassination,
the name of Pancho Villa...

919
01:47:09,937 --> 01:47:14,374
was stricken from all official records,
statues, monuments, even childrens books.

920
01:47:15,642 --> 01:47:18,770
When the government decided it was safe
to disinter his body...

921
01:47:18,846 --> 01:47:21,747
it was discovered
that someone had stolen his head.

922
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:27,077
ln 1976, after half a century,
the remains of his remains...

923
01:47:27,154 --> 01:47:31,887
were laid to rest in Mexico City,
alongside other heroes of the Revolution.

924
01:47:32,326 --> 01:47:35,989
Finally hed been given the funeral
hed always dreamed of.

925
01:47:37,931 --> 01:47:41,765
As in the case of his head,
the film The Life Of General Villa...

926
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:44,030
has been lost to posterity.

927
01:47:44,571 --> 01:47:48,632
lf anything at all, Frank Thayer
remains just a footnote in history.

928
01:47:49,276 --> 01:47:53,713
No complaints, its not too bad
being a footnote to a legend.
