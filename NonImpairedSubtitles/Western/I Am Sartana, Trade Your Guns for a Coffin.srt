1
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,702
- Are they dead?
- Yeah, let's go.

2
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,100
- The horses! Where are the horses?

3
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,944
- Look, Mantas! Here they come!

4
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,424
Let go.

5
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,506
I Am Sartana...
Trade Your Guns for a Coffin!

6
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,142
Hi, Burt.
How are you?

7
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,189
I was after you for a long time.

8
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,427
3000.

9
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,581
4000.

10
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,185
5000.

11
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,661
Not so fast.
I want to check first.

12
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,427
That's him.

13
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,508
Going for poker game, right?

14
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,628
Why should I refuse myself?

15
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,869
I have to invest money somewhere.

16
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,660
Wake up, buddy.

17
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,225
I want to buy your clothes.

18
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,466
That's enough?

19
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,624
Hey, Sartana!

20
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,181
- This is your investment?
- Yes.

21
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,826
Where the hell are you going?
Can't you read?

22
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,061
THIS IS THE VILLAGE CEMETARY

23
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,621
STRANGERS DO NOT ENTER!
OR DIE!!

24
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,140
What it will be then?

25
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,584
What do you want?

26
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,908
Whiskey, tequila,
something to eat?

27
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,666
Tell me something.

28
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,701
Who loves gold here?
Mantas?

29
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,942
I think, everyone loves the gold.

30
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,543
The gold diggers love the most.

31
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,340
And there are many who look for it.

32
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,468
Yes?

33
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,748
Hey, peasant!

34
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,470
Yes, you!.

35
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,307
Do not stick your nose in other people business.

36
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,581
Do you recognize this bag?

37
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,788
And what is that to you?

38
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,550
Are you looking for this?

39
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,671
You're in troubles!

40
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,188
It was Dead Eye Golfay.
He will not forget this!

41
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,588
Really.
I didn't know.

42
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,989
Do not worry.

43
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,109
Bring me something to eat.

44
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,181
I love eggs.

45
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,580
Make sure they're fresh.

46
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,945
What happened?

47
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,621
Golfay, you fell into the soup?

48
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,590
Don't laugh.

49
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,301
What did you eat?
Youy beard full of beans!

50
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,345
Shut the fuck up, stupid idiots!

51
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,743
I met one hombre who knows about the gold.

52
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,470
And he was asking for Mantas.

53
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,345
Damn it!

54
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,027
Paco, get Mantas.

55
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,784
Golfay! Go to the inn!

56
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,908
Sereno, Miguel, go with him.

57
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,630
The rest to the windows.

58
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,824
You stay quiet, understand?

59
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,824
Mantas asked to look after you!

60
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,230
You like them well cooked?

61
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,345
Yes, but hurry or I'll starve to death.

62
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,707
You'll die but not from hunger!

63
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,621
IIt seems he came back
for some more soup.

64
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,908
I never seen it before.
How do you call this?

65
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,150
Sandwich colt.

66
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,628
I hope they'll shot the gringo.

67
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,624
It would be the best.

68
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,621
Look!

69
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,226
They are coming!

70
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,022
Put them as far as you can from here.

71
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,468
Wait.

72
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,389
That is exactly what that bastard
expects us to do!

73
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,226
We will stay here till
Mantas is back.

74
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,951
Where's the kid?

75
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,066
Emiliano!

76
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,906
You should not have done it Maldida.

77
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,710
You'll be sorry!

78
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,785
Mantas will kill you.

79
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,702
Hey, wait a minute! Watch out!

80
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,945
It's all the money I have, senor.

81
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,387
I give them to you to save my mother.

82
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,228
Where is she?

83
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,062
In that opposite house, senor.

84
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,867
And kill all the men, they're bandits.

85
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,261
It's wrong to pay a man to kill someone.

86
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,660
What is he waiting for?

87
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,660
Salute!

88
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,590
Oh boy, surely defeat.

89
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,943
It's because of yours very good whiskey.

90
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,465
Obviously, yes.

91
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,748
Do you think our friends
started to be nervous?

92
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,830
I would say they're furious.

93
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,901
Fine.

94
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,710
In this case, I'm going.

95
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,706
Anyway, I'd like to know
if Mantas coming here?

96
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,670
I see him pretty much every day...

97
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,187
... but they never talk about their plans.

98
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,866
I believe you.

99
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,466
I got scared. There was such a shoot out.

100
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,185
I'm not an expert ...

101
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,027
...but now I'll see for a first time.

102
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,308
One man against four Mantas' guys?

103
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,260
I'm not going to attack anyone,
only use them a little.

104
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,262
Someone may get hurt
if it's not moving fast enough.

105
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,911
<i> Hey, you there!</i>

106
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,748
<i> Can you hear me? </i>

107
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,190
<i> Come out, slowly. </i>

108
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,502
<i> Have a little talk.</i>

109
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,347
<i>You hear me?</i>

110
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,070
<i> Let's talk but don't be silly...</i>

111
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,501
<i>... or I'm going to blow up the house.</i>

112
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,301
<i>You have 5 seconds.
Can you hear me better now?</i>

113
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,105
<i>Are you decided?</i>

114
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,060
Out!

115
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,548
<i> Sorry hombres...</ i>

116
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,981
<i>...but I'm here. </ i>

117
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,261
Mom!

118
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,587
Thank you.

119
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,789
God bless you!
They kept me prisoner.

120
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,147
Be thankful to the child.

121
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,102
They kept you here for a long time?

122
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,104
Have you heard them talking about the gold?

123
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,261
Yes.

124
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,990
They often spoke about certain place.

125
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,223
I think it's called Appaloosa,
but I do not know where it is.

126
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,068
I'm afraid I did not help you much with that.

127
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,991
Light?

128
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,707
Thank you.

129
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,987
Do not worry, ma'am,
I'll find something.

130
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,586
Dynamite.

131
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,186
Dynamite ...

132
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,783
God bless you.

133
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,031
Now we can go back to our farm.
They will never find us.

134
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,631
Good luck.

135
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,143
How much do I owe you for the eggs?

136
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,263
On the house.

137
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,150
I was never so entertained.

138
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,945
Thank you.

139
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,264
Cetendroit looks like a cemetery.

140
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,860
Before, it was different.

141
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,831
Then Mantas took control of our town.

142
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,584
I guess I'm stuck here forever.

143
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,028
Where are you going, amigo?

144
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,864
After Right Place.

145
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,421
Another mercenary
who wants to work for Mr Spencer.

146
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,582
Quit whining!

147
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,141
I don't think it's a reason he's here.

148
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,790
What happens there, Trixie?

149
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,586
Is there something interesting on the street?

150
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,231
Not really...

151
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,703
Just a stranger.

152
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,667
One of those
who are paid by Spencer.

153
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,226
Ask him, Hoagy.

154
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,384
Here, Baxter, Mr. Baxter ...

155
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,269
Apropos our gold ...

156
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,105
We learned that the cargo
had not arrived.

157
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,786
Mr. Spencer received the news this morning.

158
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,704
Surely bandits again
attacked the shipment.

159
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,990
Spencer spent a lot of money
to pay for the escort.

160
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,269
Now, he is going to pay for the funerals.

161
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,744
Next time all will be OK.

162
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,461
Tell your friends, the next
delivery will start on Monday morning.

163
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,261
But we lost three in a row, Mr. Baxter.

164
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,502
This time, we will be fine.

165
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,550
Mr. Spencer has a plan.

166
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,986
You'll see.

167
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,548
Good afternoon.

168
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,301
Who's in charge?

169
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,026
What do you want?

170
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,348
I'd like to get a room.

171
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,902
I oughta warn you. The beds are full of bedbugs and uncomfortable, too.

172
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,984
We ain't got roulette, there's no floorshow,
and there's no girls.

173
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,142
Our main activity is keeping out of the graveyard.

174
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,746
I like quiet places, ma'am.

175
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,507
If you do not work
for Spencer, I have a room.

176
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,824
I'm sorry ...

177
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,550
Goodbye, Trixie.
I greet Spencer from you.

178
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,584
Very rude guy.

179
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,108
Emiliano!

180
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,870
Hey, Mantas! It's me!

181
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,502
Where are the rest?
Let's go, search for them!

182
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,067
Hurry!

183
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,748
Mantas, they're all dead!

184
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,941
Find the old man!

185
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,347
I did not do anything!

186
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,350
Come on, Mantas wants to talk to you!

187
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,231
I did not do anything! Let me go!

188
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,821
You bastard! Tell me who did it?

189
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,186
I've done nothing.

190
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,061
It's your fault our friends are dead.

191
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,462
You're gonna pay.
It's all your fault.

192
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,987
Bastard! Where is my wife?

193
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,385
Maldida not here! She's gone.

194
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,587
I don't know anything!
Where did she go?

195
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,980
I know nothing.

196
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,744
You helped the gringo, right?

197
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,869
I wasn't helping anyone, I swear.

198
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,184
Where is a women? Speak!
I gonna kill you!

199
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,501
Speak!

200
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,391
Please, Mantas.
Please!

201
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,350
Damn gringo!

202
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,310
He killed seven of my men.
Seven!

203
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,622
And my women is gone!

204
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,631
He fooled Mantas.

205
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,462
He's a smart guy.

206
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,307
Yes. A gringo who
thinks with his head.

207
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,904
He mocked us.

208
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,785
He butchered our companieros.

209
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,587
Do you understand?

210
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,427
He is very dangerous!

211
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,224
We must be careful.

212
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,869
Who is this gringo?

213
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,345
Is he faster than me?

214
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,870
Faster than me?

215
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,906
I'm not going to waste my time on you.

216
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,427
Where did he go, you filthy worm?

217
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,940
Appaloosa.

218
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,545
Damn.

219
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,747
The only hometown I can not go.

220
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,024
Augustine, Machete, Antonio!
Go ahead.

221
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,106
Wait!

222
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,744
This gringo is fast.
He killed our friends.

223
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,751
Be careful.

224
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,910
You are like sons to me.

225
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,347
Quick, you bastards!

226
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,310
Move your asses!

227
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,742
Two pounds, three ounces. Right?

228
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,062
If you say so, Mr. Spencer ...

229
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,861
Here you go.

230
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,587
You OK with this?

231
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,467
...
I'm sorry.

232
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,547
And you.
Isn't it a gold in your purse?

233
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,586
I worked like a dog for six months.
I do not want to lose my money.

234
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,585
I do not force anyone.

235
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,704
I was just doing you a favor
buying gold from you.

236
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,223
Naturally, Mr. Spencer.

237
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,629
Do not worry, Tornovsky.

238
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,501
The gold will be delivered this time, I promise.

239
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,381
Maybe, if I pay you some money up front.

240
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,064
Say 50 dollars.

241
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,865
But this are two pounds!

242
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,984
You are not stupid man...

243
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,907
I thought you'll accept what I'd offer.

244
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,586
Hey, amigo!

245
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,183
Could you make me some eggs?
I want to eat.

246
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,991
Call me Angelo. One
or two eggs do you want?

247
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,266
One, Angelo.

248
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,741
Do not know that the eggs
are not good for the digestion?

249
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,941
Stand up!

250
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,951
Hold your hands
away from the bread!

251
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,226
And do not try to trick me!

252
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,950
Step away from the table!

253
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,780
OK?

254
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,150
Count to three, and then...

255
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,908
One

256
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,347
Two.

257
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,504
It all happened so suddenly.

258
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,267
I just washed the floor this morning.

259
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,427
I hope there will be many visitors.

260
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,786
I hope so too.

261
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,031
Where's the sheriff's office?

262
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,864
No sheriff, and we do not need it.

263
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,790
This city is run by just one man.

264
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,229
In other words Mr. Spencer.

265
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,502
Mr. Spencer...

266
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,307
Fine.

267
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,501
I think I need to talk to him.

268
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,910
Oh, what a surprise!
Glamorous.

269
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,022
You came to kiss me on the hand?

270
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,708
Can I come in?

271
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,349
Your friend refused to let me in.

272
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,186
What do you want?

273
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,787
You're the one who runs this town

274
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,310
You hold in your hands
mining company and the law?

275
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,862
And if there is a church,
perhaps you're also the priest.

276
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,866
You do not show respect
to believers.

277
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,586
A real priest is not
trying to pull out the gun.

278
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,662
- But I do not ...
- Do you mind?

279
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,791
Go back to sleep.

280
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,670
I'm sorry.
Baxter is a violent man.

281
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,466
But you must be tough around here.

282
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,386
There were three Mexicans in the saloon
trying to shoot me.

283
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,103
I'm afraid their idea went wrong.

284
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,464
One, however, looked very familiar.

285
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,145
May I ask why
are you telling me this story?

286
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,190
Your shipment of gold has been kidnapped

287
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,823
These three men
were among robbers.

288
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,541
Part of this gold was mine.
I pay for everything.

289
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,782
The transport, the guards and I pay
the miners as well.

290
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,431
How you could stay aside
to what was happening?

291
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,664
I couldn't do anything.

292
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,863
I was too far.

293
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,468
You did not try to stop them?

294
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,140
Free?

295
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,826
Nobody gets into trouble
for nothing.

296
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,630
But if you do not mind to pay me.

297
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,226
I can escort the next convoy.

298
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,982
Give me a day or two to
think, Mr. Sartana.

299
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,587
Think about it, Mr. Spencer.

300
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,462
But do not think too much about it.

301
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,342
I already sent for
two competent guys.

302
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,821
I hope they do better their jobs then...

303
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,903
...Travis, for example.

304
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,471
I do not know him.

305
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,981
Travis was recently hired by you.

306
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,101
I guess he was using fake name.

307
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,031
He preferred to still the gold
instead of to convoy.

308
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,388
Well, you know where to find me.

309
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,308
More.

310
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,106
Big whiskey is a dollar

311
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,667
So Trixie, what do we do?

312
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,591
To you, ma'am.

313
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,511
I'm not in charge here.
I don't know.

314
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,991
<i>You should talk to him.</i>

315
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,582
Tell me, Angelo.
What happens here at night?

316
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,069
Most evenings we drink,
then we go to sleep.

317
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,580
This sounds very exciting...

318
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,424
Mr. Sartana!

319
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,428
Mr. Spencer wants us to be friends.

320
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,148
Mr. Spencer is a smart man.

321
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,746
He doesn't want
to pay for your funeral.

322
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,346
A bottle for me and my friend.

323
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,027
No, thank you.

324
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,901
Some other time.
I'm going to bed early tonight.

325
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,910
He believs in healthy life.

326
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,020
Early to bad, early to wake up.

327
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,351
I'll do like him,
I'm going to sleep.

328
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,746
And I do not want you to be disturbed till
tomorrow morning. Understand?

329
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,111
Otherwise, I can loose my temper.

330
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,147
- I could't do anything, Mantas?
- Enough.

331
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,984
You stinky yellow coyote.

332
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,705
Nobody tells that to Mantas.

333
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,829
You upset me when I'm trying to eat...

334
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,870
But this damn Sartana.
I cursed his mother.

335
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,191
All right, all right. Do not be nervous.

336
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,024
Too much money is involved.

337
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,586
You make a mistake, if you think your
little money could do everything.

338
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,424
Everyone gets the money.

339
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,629
But you must first
get rid of Sartana.

340
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,024
It will not be difficult.

341
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,826
Fine.

342
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,470
You must do this before Spencer
sends next shipment.

343
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,150
And remember that Sartana
is far from bing stupid.

344
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,108
You must be careful, Mantas.

345
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,502
He's dangerous and very fast.

346
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,584
The best
men could not deal with him.

347
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,951
Now it's your turn.

348
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,226
Dirty pig!

349
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,381
Fine. I'll deal with him,
He thinks, he's smart...

350
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,505
...but Mantas is smarter.

351
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,949
We know the way he shoots.

352
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,460
Of course.

353
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,424
I send Caetano and two men
to do the job.

354
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,221
Caetano is young,

355
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,151
ambitious and very fast.

356
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,305
The idea, however, the idea is mine.
A great idea!

357
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,430
Perfect. I'd better go now

358
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,060
I would not want
to start look suspicious.

359
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,506
I'll get the horse.

360
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,221
He asked not to be disturbed.

361
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,742
Do not worry about it. From now on
it will rest in peace, Angelo.

362
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,500
Be sure of that.

363
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,750
And better if you stay calm...

364
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,829
...and do not open your mouth.

365
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,987
Otherwise, we'll transform you
into an angel with small wings.

366
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,821
Come on.

367
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,265
He is unarmed.
Naked as a baby.

368
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,987
Hello, my friends!

369
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,710
"Farewell" is more appropriate.

370
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,909
The bathtub will be your coffin.

371
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,269
I am completely clean,
I don't want to get spotted with blood.

372
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,865
Do not worry.

373
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,461
We always carefully
carry out the work.

374
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,385
Enough of this game.
Let's take care of him.

375
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,462
He's dangerous.

376
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,468
A moment.

377
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,629
I want beautiful funeral.

378
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,302
Do you understand? Promise me.

379
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,424
Of course, I'll pay you.

380
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,424
Then give the money to us.

381
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,742
We'll take care of your funeral.

382
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,468
Where are they?

383
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,022
Just look at them.
The boots are full of gold.

384
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,621
Do you mind?

385
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,828
Remember, beautiful funeral.

386
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,261
With music.

387
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,268
I'm faster than Sartana

388
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,862
Or he's faster than me.

389
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,468
I'm faster than Sartana.

390
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,144
Or he's faster than me.

391
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,869
Why do you ask the sunflower?

392
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,431
You can find out for yourself.

393
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,342
No, senor.

394
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,502
It can be dangerous for your health.

395
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,351
Boss! Pedro said,
they've seen Sartana.

396
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,788
How are you, my friend?

397
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,301
Of course I'd like to get
all Spencer's gold.

398
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,751
He collects every
ounce from the miners.

399
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,430
Do you think that you can do it, partner?

400
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,381
Paco!

401
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,191
Bring my friend something to eat.

402
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,501
An egg.

403
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,709
It's very simple, you'll see.

404
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,630
I'll be guarding next transport...

405
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,863
And then what? Baxter is always there.

406
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,662
The gold will be replaced with sand instead.

407
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,867
Please!

408
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,821
Paco! Cook this ...

409
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,143
Bring him a boiled egg.

410
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,306
Yes.

411
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,742
Yes, and make sure it's fresher than this.

412
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,229
Mescal, if you continue, I'll kill you.
Get out of here!

413
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,348
Forget it, amigo.

414
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,869
I can defend myself.

415
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,870
Go ahead, I'm listening.

416
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,863
Spencer keeps the gold
in the safe in his office.

417
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,182
You mean the gold
never leaves Appaloosa?

418
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,908
It is in his safe.

419
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,188
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

420
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,027
We can split the gold 50-50.
Are you fine with that?

421
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,862
Can we trust them, Baxter?

422
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,546
Brothers Brando are expensive,
but very effective.

423
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,067
Simply not everybody likes to talk
about their talents.

424
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,822
Whiskey and gin.

425
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,746
What the hell is wrong with you?

426
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,425
You idiot!

427
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,106
Gin is for me.
Whiskey for my brother.

428
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,822
Dry?

429
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,109
Do not ask too many questions
Otherwise we will be nervous.

430
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,185
Take it easy, Joe.
Everything is OK.

431
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,865
He is doing his job.

432
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,343
It is not his fault
he lives in this filthy place.

433
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,787
Remember, I want quality for my money.

434
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,942
Do not worry, Mr. Spencer.

435
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,184
They will take care of the gold.

436
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,461
Look, Baxter.

437
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,461
Who is this?

438
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,501
You know him?

439
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,866
I've never seen before.

440
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,345
Look who came.

441
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,308
This gin tastes bad.

442
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,748
This is normal.
Everything is rotten here.

443
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,311
Isn't it??

444
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,231
But I guess...

445
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,590
We have a few bottles of gin
hidden under the counter.

446
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,904
Good bottles.

447
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,266
Well, where is it?

448
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,227
Flint, man is little afraid
that we will not be able to pay.

449
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,950
Pay for it, Joe.

450
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,349
Easy.

451
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,181
Come on, my friend, pick up your money.

452
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,423
Or I'll make you to drink
that whole damn bucket of swill.

453
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,387
Leave it Angelo.
We do not sell gin to the pigs.

454
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,190
Could you repeat, madame?

455
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,263
Someone called me a pig.

456
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,906
You heard me.

457
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,066
You cut off her hair, Joe?

458
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,587
I am not a barber, Flint.

459
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,541
I understand.
You want to cut off her tongue.

460
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,102
I'm not a surgeon.

461
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,747
You have nothing to worry about.

462
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,906
You will have awfully good look
when I finished.

463
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,189
I guarantee, you look like
a lamb, you'll see..

464
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,662
Listen, Joe.
Perhaps you can start with the cheek.

465
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,470
Gentlemen!

466
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,141
Sabata!

467
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,027
Sabata ...

468
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,141
Joe, apologize to the lady.

469
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,709
It's too simple.

470
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,661
You need to kneel down, Joe.

471
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,627
Not like that, Joe.
Put a little more grace.

472
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,822
No, you do not know how to do it.

473
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,984
This is shameful.

474
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,024
Flint! Get your brother.

475
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,706
And don't even stop
untill you're in Mexico.

476
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,381
Help him out.

477
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,470
Today is your lucky day.

478
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,670
I never kill on Thursday.
I promised.

479
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,746
You promised who, sir?

480
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,381
To my mother.

481
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,227
I am very grateful.

482
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,144
You're welcome, ma'am. It was nothing.

483
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,941
You have a room?
I'd like to stay.

484
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,909
- Of course it is, I ...
- Hey, Trixie!

485
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,708
- Please excuse me for a minute.
- Of course.

486
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,385
It looks those guys will not get reward.

487
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,586
Is that so?

488
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,822
Yes, with the gold.

489
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,266
And you seem like a man to me
who I'm looking for.

490
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,548
I do not get a lot of work.

491
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,943
One thing I do know about the work:
that is a bad habit.

492
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,990
Can't we discuss about that work
around game of poker?

493
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,071
Right.

494
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,265
Do you play cards?

495
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,910
Sometimes.

496
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,186
Angelo!

497
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,991
Bring us a deck of cards!

498
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,586
This will be enough to play?

499
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,821
Obviously.

500
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,948
All players like to win...

501
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,550
...but only few succeed.

502
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,427
- Can I join you?
- Why not?

503
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,869
I have nothing against it.

504
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,387
It will be very entertaining.

505
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,383
I'm sure.

506
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,142
The Jack, Queen...

507
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,306
...and King.

508
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,746
And an Ace.

509
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,543
You have a fourth player.

510
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,420
If he joins us, the bet will double.

511
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,141
Small world, Sabata.

512
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,869
Become too small for both of us.

513
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,149
Do not worry.
It'll expand....

514
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,467
Just a tomb of two meters

515
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,551
Two meters?

516
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,461
Too small for you.

517
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,861
Then?
Who distributes these cards?

518
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,465
I open 10.

519
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,465
I bet 25.

520
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,785
50.

521
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,226
50.

522
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,148
Two cards.

523
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,987
So do I.

524
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,260
I'm good.

525
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,905
Well, my friends?

526
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,301
Pass.

527
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,106
Pass.

528
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,985
Hundred dollars.

529
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,021
Right.

530
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,946
I stay.

531
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,941
200.

532
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,745
1000.

533
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,910
It is good for me.

534
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,906
For me, that's too much.

535
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,026
2000.

536
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,625
$ 3000.

537
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,261
To see.

538
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,151
You won.

539
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,425
Fantastic.

540
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,703
It was a bluff, or perhaps both.
Is not it?

541
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,226
Who knows?

542
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,826
If you want to know
you have to pay.

543
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,705
Quite a lot.

544
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,266
$10,000.00 seems reasonable.

545
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,711
And your gold convoy
reaches the destination.

546
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,508
The word "Trust" does not seem
to exist in your vocabulary.

547
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,790
I trust everyone only
on 50 percent.

548
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,222
I was expecting this.

549
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,751
Why did you chose me
over Sartana?

550
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,220
You won at the poker.

551
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,231
This is a good reason.

552
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,869
You can come out.

553
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,029
Very good acting.

554
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,502
You think that Sabata was also a fool.

555
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,629
No matter now.

556
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,990
He played this game with us,

557
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,824
because he expected
to win. Do you agree?

558
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,461
All this is well guessed, Mr. Spencer.

559
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,942
You understand that Sabata
wasn't here by accident.

560
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,547
Mantas and his
gang also run for their money.

561
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,068
By the way...

562
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,628
What did you tell Baxter?

563
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,908
I have no reason to tell him anything.

564
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,264
Perfect plan.

565
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,582
It is necessary to divide the enemy.

566
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,262
Sabata is killing bandits ...

567
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,751
And I kill Sabata.

568
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,551
This is clear.

569
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,148
If the gold was with me
and not here, it would be in bigger danger.

570
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,870
Beautiful safe, though.

571
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,863
It's the best.

572
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,427
The Galagher manufactured specifically for me.

573
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,346
I do not regret the money...

574
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,743
...when it comes to protecting the gold,
the miners sweated for.

575
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,185
Unfortunately, only a few likes you.

576
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,263
Pair of aces. I won.

577
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,621
Let's see. I owe you ...

578
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,471
One million three hundred thousand...

579
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,029
Four hundred and seventy dollars.

580
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,347
...and 50 cents.

581
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,822
You tried to deceive me, Angelo?

582
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,744
Well. I'm going to bed.

583
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,302
Good night, sir.

584
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,741
You got the wrong room.

585
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,345
No.

586
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,821
I want to talk to you.

587
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,862
I get the feeling that the conversation
with the gun can be quite noisy.

588
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,227
It will not be...

589
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,503
...if you do what I say.

590
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,665
I am afraid that the
gun is not loaded.

591
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,904
You' don't understand.

592
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,308
I only want to talk business.

593
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:34,948
For now.

594
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,181
Pity.

595
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,940
I'm listening.

596
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,388
When I first came here, I thought
Appaloosa will be growing city.

597
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,101
I invested all my money
in the hotel and the bar.

598
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,586
And all for nothing.

599
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,741
Continue.

600
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,222
The miners work for
the gold like animals.

601
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,543
And those bandits steal everything.

602
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,828
- You think it's just?
- No.

603
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,189
They should spend it on you,
right?

604
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,229
Yes, I want their money.

605
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,464
If you steal the gold for me,
then I give you ...

606
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,740
...let's say 10%.

607
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,981
Okay?

608
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,781
I want 50%. I'm a pig.

609
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,784
Do not look so sad. The small
income is better than nothing.

610
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,189
I was wrong. I should rather talk to Sabata.

611
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,148
What? With that coyote?
It would have taken everything.

612
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,941
Bravo.

613
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,629
But we do it my way.
Undress.

614
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,791
You're doing it wrong.

615
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,702
I want everyone to think
I spent the night with you.

616
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,061
There are a few things I need to do.

617
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,984
To bad.
If it wasn't that damn gold...

618
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,903
You never enter through the door?

619
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:34,910
I wonder where you wonder at night
when a woman is waiting for you here.

620
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,910
You did not take my place?

621
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,710
I do not need to tie her up.

622
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,271
I like you.

623
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,263
But I do not her to be in
my way, when I'm working.

624
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,469
I always knew
you were a professional.

625
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,667
There will be no gold
in the coach tomorrow.

626
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,264
Very clever. They want to beat me.

627
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,180
They think I'm an idiot.

628
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,024
Obviously.

629
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,184
They think you were going to attack them,
as before.

630
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,708
But if you do not...

631
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,542
Then what?

632
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,387
Romero, you will attack the convoy.

633
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,304
With great pleasure.

634
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:11,265
While I with the rest
go to town.

635
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,181
This is the gringo idea.
The idea was that separate us.

636
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,148
Good idea.

637
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,982
But the other idea is mine,

638
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,506
Sartana.

639
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,782
I keep all the gold.

640
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,741
And we share only among us.

641
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,821
And if he comes and complains,
I'll kill him with my own hands.

642
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,502
Baxter!

643
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,665
Right, Mr. Spencer.

644
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,987
You do not have to hurry, Baxter.
Plenty of time.

645
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:37,464
Everyone else is working.
Mantas, Sartana, Sabata.

646
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,349
All chase bags full of sand.

647
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,871
Will anyone stay alive?

648
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,950
Maybe.

649
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,547
But by that time we'll be in Mexico.

650
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,026
Romero!

651
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,670
Companeros!

652
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,104
The convoy left.

653
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,025
Saddle up!
We do not wait Sartana to wait.

654
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,547
Miguel. You and 3 men go over the hill.

655
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,270
The rest come with me to the canyon.

656
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,625
Is everything ready, Baxter?

657
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,020
Yes, sir.

658
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,982
I left the horses in the back,
nobody will see us leave.

659
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,941
You know, it might be funny, but I'm
almost sorry to leave.

660
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,702
I spent here 10 years?

661
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,309
We had time to pick all the gold
from those idiots miners.

662
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,429
Our work is completed, partner.

663
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,747
Where I was, what I was...

664
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,267
Why and how I was...

665
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,463
Not far from the...

666
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,988
 whisper of the water coming out...

667
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,381
a cave.

668
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,981
Gentlemen!
It's me you're looking for...

669
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,301
or Sartana?

670
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,784
This means, me.

671
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,021
Is not it?

672
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,620
Here I am.

673
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,791
Here I am.

674
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,147
Get off.

675
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,902
Why were you looking over there?

676
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,591
Here I am.

677
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:24,868
Attention.

678
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:32,462
The worm came out of his hole.
I'll have a drink.

679
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,463
Come on! Where are you? I'm thirsty.

680
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,066
Whre are you vermin?

681
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,222
You don't need to talk like that.

682
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,705
I'm tired of waiting for you.

683
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,984
Thank you, partner.
Your plan worked well.

684
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,385
And I want to thank you.

685
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,468
For bringing me my share of the gold.

686
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,866
No. I didn't bring you your share.

687
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,025
You know, I still believe,
that I'm faster than you.

688
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,583
And maybe you want to test it.

689
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,061
OK.

690
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,382
This is a good opportunity.

691
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,107
I'd better warn you, Mantas.
I'm angry at you.

692
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,746
You are dishonest.

693
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,106
Thank you for the compliment.

694
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,106
I am wondering whether
your hands are as fast...

695
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,500
...as your mind.

696
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,262
Now, listen to me.

697
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,070
There are three of us.

698
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,661
You,

699
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,269
Keep an eye on the bread.

700
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:18,142
You, count to three
and then take the gun.

701
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,308
And I'm going to aim for your heart.

702
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,589
This is a real duel.

703
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,301
My gun against yours.
That one.

704
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,902
Because...

705
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,541
Where would you hide the gun?

706
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,146
How do you know that there is no
one under the table?

707
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,782
This time,
you have your boots on.

708
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,629
- Pedro.
- One...

709
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,861
Two...

710
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,784
You're leaving, senor?

711
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,865
Take care of these gentlemen.
They rather left us forever.

712
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,062
That's for the solid coffins.

713
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,229
Nad bury them deep
so they do not escape.

714
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,224
Adiós, Sartana!

715
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,461
You know what?

716
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,942
Look, this place is a ghost town.
Why do not you leave?

717
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,783
No. Mantas is now dead,
people will return.

718
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,426
You decide where you're going?

719
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,430
I have an important meeting.

720
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,991
With someone who thinks is
always lucky.

721
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,106
Do not shoot me, please!

722
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,310
Sartana waits you at the saloon.

723
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,307
Okay, Angelo, but better
if you're coming with me.

724
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,463
I do not want you to miss this show.

725
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,671
Very good.
As good as that of my mother.

726
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,390
Sabata...

727
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,341
Sartana is here.

728
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,627
He is a true professional.
Never misses not a single meeting.

729
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,460
Go back, the cup could break.

730
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,104
Well, should I open it?

731
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,986
My turn.

732
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,464
Excellent quality.

733
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,663
This is an excellent quality of the sand.

734
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,302
You did not ask
what was the content.

735
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,822
I already knew that there is sand in it.

736
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,506
How about fifty per cent?

737
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,228
I have nothing against that.

738
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,991
If you are satisfied with it.
You got it.

739
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,311
And this one too.

740
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,430
Do not bluff me.

741
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,430
I do not advise you.

742
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,550
We do not play poker.

743
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,189
I do not bluff.

744
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,746
Neither do I.

745
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,741
Bravo.

746
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,947
Enjoy your cigar...

747
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,105
Because this is the last one
you will ever smoke.

748
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,385
You're not offended ...

749
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,110
I did not. What about you?

750
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,545
Out of bullets, right?

751
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,345
No. I have one more, for you.

752
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:06,948
Will ten.

753
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,024
You're a scoundrel.

754
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,582
You cheated.

755
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,861
Yes, you're right.

756
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:14,660
You know, I promised my mother...

757
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,427
...not to deal with people like you..

758
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:21,666
Now... Slowly go to your horse.

759
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:28,063
And hold your hands away from everything.

760
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,747
Hold it!

761
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,823
Remove Winchester from the saddle.

762
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,105
With the left hand.

763
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,784
Take it to the barrel.

764
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:47,668
There, like this.
Leave it there on the barrel.

765
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,147
Now go.

766
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,064
Hey. What are you doing?

767
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,064
You forgot that I have this.

768
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,028
You're too far away from me.

769
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,500
You sure?

770
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,701
You wanted it, right?

771
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,945
A memory of his mother.

772
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,182
Forget about him. Where is the gold?

773
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,626
What are you doing?

774
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,631
Oh, my... Do not tell me
that Angelo sat on it...

775
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,270
...all this time.

776
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,188
But he didn't know.

777
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,867
Well, we did it.

778
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,941
Half and half.

779
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,389
You'll have to settle for $ 10,000.00

780
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,385
My dear!

781
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,704
This is not nice.

782
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:23,745
You would surely lose the whole gold
if not the two of us.

783
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,141
What do you mean "the two of us"?

784
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,271
When he said "we",
he meant "us".

785
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,943
Never trust the strangers, ma'am.
Never.

786
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,669
Now what, my friend?

787
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,270
Shall we?

788
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,783
No one ever found out
where did you put the gun again?

789
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:04,023
Of course not.
That is impossible.

790
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,468
And what's with Trixie?

791
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,543
She almost got us.

792
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,227
<i>Women... </i>

793
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:11,745
Women!

794
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:15,666
You can only do one thing with them.
You love them, then leave them.

795
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,541
Therefore, I never got married.

796
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:19,551
Sabata...

797
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:22,909
I'll bet you anything that
your mother was never married, either.

798
