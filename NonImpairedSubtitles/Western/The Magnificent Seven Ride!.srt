1
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,503
Hold it!

2
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,887
Jim, if you want to stay alive,
you'd better be more careful.

3
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,384
Chris, l've been on the trail
a long time.

4
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,863
l've been looking for you.

5
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,162
We better get you into town.

6
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,429
Come on.

7
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,518
l'm scared, Ma.
l'm really scared.

8
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,557
l'm not excusing it, ma'am.
He did wrong.

9
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,432
But the punishment
don't fit the crime.

10
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,164
He's only 18.

11
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,570
Only a boy.

12
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,938
What did you do?

13
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,536
l was just funning.
Busted into a store.

14
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,207
Help us, please, ma'am.
Talk to your husband.

15
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,683
Save your tears, señora.

16
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,552
The marshal has no mercy,
no sympathy, no compassion.

17
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,556
What did he do?

18
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,080
Pepe Carral?

19
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,356
He's knocked over most
every bank in this territory.

20
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,862
Big Walt over there...

21
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,763
he's just too strong
for his own brain power.

22
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,166
Chris.

23
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,673
Chris?

24
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,035
No.

25
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,116
But he's only a boy.

26
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:49,053
He had a man's wants
when he was robbing...

27
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,821
and he didn't spend the money
on grub for his family.

28
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,887
He spent it on
women, liquor, and cards.

29
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,296
And then when he's caught...

30
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,267
he calls himself a boy again.

31
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,328
lf you put him
in that Tucson hellhole...

32
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,669
he'll come out a wild animal.

33
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,509
That storekeeper
you robbed had six kids.

34
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,980
You ruined him.

35
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,677
You wiped out
ten years of hard work...

36
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,778
for just one night.
One good time.

37
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,482
l learned my lesson, honest.

38
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,388
Chris, please.

39
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,052
No.

40
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,290
You're supposed to be
an important man...

41
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,628
a friend of the governor's.

42
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,725
You're worse than any man
you ever sent to Tucson.

43
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:40,205
ls there any man in there
that killed as many men as you?

44
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,207
Not by half, there isn't.

45
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,007
l didn't kill for
the same reasons they did.

46
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,379
You're not as pure as them
that stands before you.

47
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,461
Name's Noah Forbes, Marshal.

48
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,426
l've decided to do for you...

49
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,991
what Ned Buntline
did for Bill Cody.

50
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,060
Make a damn fool of me.

51
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,299
Make you famous.

52
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,931
You're a writer?

53
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,671
You name a big-city newspaper
and l've worked on it.

54
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,771
That's means
you're pretty good...

55
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,476
or you can't hold a job.

56
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,950
All you have to do
is talk to me.

57
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,850
l'll do the writing,
you get a third.

58
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,782
l met Buntline.
Read his stuff. Mostly trash.

59
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,191
Things weren't anything
like that.

60
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,162
Listen,
what people think is true...

61
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,893
is a lot more important
than what really is true.

62
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,424
Can't get rich telling them
they're wrong.

63
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,528
l don't make my living that way.

64
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,132
Marshal, somebody's going
to write about you anyway.

65
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,233
Why shouldn't it be me?

66
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,776
All right.
But you get half...

67
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,716
and you don't print anything
l don't like.

68
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,514
lt's a deal.

69
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,021
Rye! Bring a bottle...

70
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,717
and put it
on the marshal's bill.

71
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,988
l'll be a little short
till l finish the book.

72
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,689
You better write good.

73
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,237
Jim, what the hell
are you doing here?

74
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,864
You should be flat
on your back for a week.

75
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,169
l ain't got a week, Chris.

76
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,403
l ain't got an hour to spare.

77
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,174
Come on.
Have a drink anyway.

78
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,878
Jim MacKay, Noah Forbes.

79
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,545
Here's a man
you could write about.

80
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,520
He's ridden with me
more than once.

81
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,954
You a lawman, Mr. MacKay?

82
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,958
l used to be a bounty hunter.

83
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,290
One of the few that tried
to bring them all in alive.

84
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,794
But l'm a lawman now...

85
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,456
and don't you laugh, Chris...

86
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,933
a legal and respectable
town marshal.

87
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,299
They've got a good man.
What town?

88
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,634
Magdalena, down Sonora way.

89
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,435
lt's a farming settlement.
Mostly Mexicans.

90
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,773
A few American families.
We get along just fine.

91
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,335
An American marshal
in a Mexican town?

92
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,871
They couldn't be too particular.

93
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,440
They needed help bad.

94
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,181
You see,
we border De Toro's territory.

95
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,849
Who's De Toro?

96
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,758
Bandit. Raids both sides
of the border.

97
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,160
The Cavalry and the Rurales
could stop it...

98
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,857
if they'd cooperate,
but they don't.

99
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,059
Neither side lets the other
cross the frontier.

100
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,592
Those two pistoleros...
De Toro's?

101
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,400
l guess they figured...

102
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,236
l'm coming to look for
some of the old bunch.

103
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,808
Jim, l've crossed that border
three times to fight bandits.

104
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,438
l ain't going down there again.

105
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,474
Chris,
he's bound to hit us anytime.

106
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,955
He's got 50-60 men.
l got a handful of farmers.

107
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,390
And l've got a good job.

108
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,260
And a new wife
who's still practically a bride.

109
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,165
l don't like
to bring this up, Chris...

110
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,431
but l saved your life one time.

111
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,167
That doesn't give you
any right to ask for it now.

112
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,903
Besides,
didn't l save your neck today?

113
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,242
Doesn't that make us even
if you're keeping score?

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,113
You told me then, Chris,
''l owe you.

115
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,243
''You want something,
you ask, you got it.''

116
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,982
l hung onto that promise
for 10 years.

117
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,489
l saved it like grubstake...

118
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,354
waiting for something
important to come along.

119
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,860
And l'm asking now.

120
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,394
No, Jim, l can't.

121
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,832
Remember that first time, Chris?

122
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,568
Seven of us got $350,
50 bucks apiece.

123
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,168
Those folks in Magdalena,
they trust me...

124
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,476
me, Chris...
with everything they got.

125
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,482
l got $3,000 here.

126
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,316
$1,000 of it's yours
for just a couple of weeks work.

127
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,223
Well, maybe some of the others?

128
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,262
Dead mostly...

129
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,527
or semi-retired like me.

130
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,625
Skinner or Elliot?

131
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,502
Tucson Prison.

132
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,234
Who brought them in, Chris?

133
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,041
Times change, Jim.

134
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,445
They couldn't accept it.

135
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,440
Yeah, well...

136
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,147
l guess l don't, neither.

137
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,548
Luck, Chris.

138
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,022
Luck.

139
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,008
l'm glad you didn't lock it.

140
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,645
l figured
you'd break it down if l did.

141
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,673
Chris...

142
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,085
He's only 18.

143
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,049
Hickock...

144
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,958
Clay Allison...

145
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,519
The Daltons...

146
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,963
How do you figure
l outlived them?

147
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:52,164
By knowing when not to take
unnecessary chances.

148
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,001
Now, that's hard...

149
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,973
but it's the only way
that works.

150
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,102
Works against who?

151
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,081
Shelly's no Mark Skinner
or Pepe Carral.

152
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,709
l'm not asking you
to help gunfighters.

153
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,615
Judge Parker said to me once...

154
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,591
''Men l hanged
never killed again...

155
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,322
''but plenty
that l didn't hang did.''

156
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,023
You tell me he's wrong.

157
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,998
He wasn't talking about a boy
who robbed a store.

158
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,292
l've buried
a lot of friends...

159
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,804
who thought fuzzy-faced kids
weren't dangerous.

160
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,309
lt means a lot to you, huh?

161
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,122
l don't owe Shelly
a damn thing...

162
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,599
and l do him a big favor.

163
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,397
l owe Jim MacKay a lot...

164
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,563
and l don't do anything for him.

165
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,096
Can't seem
to do anything right.

166
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,574
Sure you can.

167
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,243
Come on.

168
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,281
Chris...

169
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,251
how come l'm in chains
and Walt isn't?

170
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,618
He promised not to get away.

171
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,213
And you believed him?

172
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,021
Yeah, l believe him.
Come on.

173
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,526
Hold it!

174
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,973
Sorry, Chris,
but these irons spoil my aim.

175
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,437
Hello, Skinner.

176
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,607
l'll see you next time
l bust out.

177
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,879
l'll be here.

178
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,718
Beats me where he hid it.
He learns hard.

179
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,222
Forget about it.

180
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,281
lf you say so.

181
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,059
All right, bring them on.

182
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,125
Hold it. Wait a minute.

183
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,035
Leave him. Shelly...

184
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,598
You go on home
and stay out of trouble.

185
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,439
Hold it, Marshal.
l got an order to bring him in.

186
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,004
You had an order.
Go on, git.

187
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,445
Come on!

188
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,753
Bust him, Pepe!

189
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,121
Damn you, Chris!

190
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,422
You give everybody a break
but me!

191
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,951
Kill the bastard!

192
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,224
That lousy kid doesn't
deserve it and you know it!

193
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,845
l'll kill you.

194
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,207
l will, Chris.

195
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,843
l'll kill you.

196
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,581
Not if l get to him first.

197
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,386
Right, Pepe?

198
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,408
Thanks.

199
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,248
Glass of water.

200
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,356
l put this on your bill.

201
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,869
You can play me for things
that aren't important.

202
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,099
Just don't try it
with anything that is.

203
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,700
l already figured
that out for myself.

204
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,266
Want to get some work done?

205
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,206
The Battle of Adobe Walls.

206
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,716
What was that like?

207
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,953
There were 28 of us.

208
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,047
Bat Masterson, me...

209
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,685
Billy Dixon, one woman...

210
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,922
the rest of them
were buffalo hunters.

211
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,556
Quanah Parker
had 600 Comanches with him.

212
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,826
28 against 600?

213
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,199
That's great. What happened?

214
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,761
We had a hell of a fight.

215
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,774
And?

216
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,307
We won.

217
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,874
When l saw that wagon pulling
out for Tucson without me...

218
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,645
l never felt so good
in all my life!

219
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,085
My feet kept saying,
''You're free! You're free!''

220
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,749
To do what?
Go back to that same life...

221
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,259
that made you risk Tucson
in the first place?

222
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,785
You're no better off
than you ever were, Shelly.

223
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,109
You feel like
coming home for lunch?

224
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,634
Yes.

225
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,141
lf you think
you're following us, forget it.

226
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,344
l'll run over
to the restaurant.

227
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,148
You run a bill there, too,
don't you?

228
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,952
Shelly, no!

229
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,950
No!

230
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,095
Oh, Chris.

231
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,664
No! No! Chris!

232
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,109
Any more shooting'll hit her!

233
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,771
-Get up!
-No!

234
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,042
-Get up! Come here!
-No!

235
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,024
You're going to be all right?

236
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,084
Hell, l already wrote
your epitaph...

237
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,720
had the governor
come to your funeral.

238
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,822
Thanks.

239
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,728
She nursed you, Chris.

240
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,930
She hasn't slept in 48 hours.

241
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,869
Where's Arrila?

242
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,708
They took her.

243
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,579
Oh, God.

244
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,282
l guess he just couldn't
stand the farm.

245
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,988
What are you going to do?

246
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,859
Kill them.

247
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,278
Hey!
Don't die just riding along.

248
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,008
That'd be a real anti-climax.

249
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,281
On the other hand,
we could say...

250
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,014
you left your deathbed,
just died on the trail.

251
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,386
That has a real good ring to it.

252
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,690
How far you figure we've come?

253
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,059
Hundred miles?

254
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,360
l tell you,
it feels more like a thousand.

255
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,060
Damn it, my ass hurts.

256
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,093
How can anything stuffed
with hay be this hard?

257
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,074
There's something down there.

258
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,235
lt looks like hers.

259
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,276
lt's a tough climb, Chris.
l'll go.

260
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,275
Dead?

261
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,050
Don't go, Chris. Don't.

262
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,266
They use her?

263
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,344
Raped, killed,
and left for the buzzards.

264
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,288
Hank?

265
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,952
Hank, you using
all your blankets?

266
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,921
l'm cold.
lt's so damn cold.

267
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,294
Go to sleep.

268
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,998
Thought we was out of coffee.

269
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,029
We are.

270
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,849
-Get up.
-What?

271
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,793
You want it lying there
or on your feet?

272
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,624
Marshal, please,
you got to understand.

273
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,862
We've been getting up
before light...

274
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,426
to milk cows since we was five.

275
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,199
Work all day,
then go to sleep at dark...

276
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,763
because we couldn't
afford kerosene for a lamp.

277
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,934
Was we wrong wanting
to get away from that?

278
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,342
Wanting to get away from it
wasn't wrong.

279
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,539
How you did it was wrong.

280
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,879
Where's Shelly?

281
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,281
Find him yourself.

282
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,981
You're a lawman.
You got to take us in to trial.

283
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,256
He won't shoot us in cold blood.

284
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,492
l don't bluff.

285
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,860
Where's Shelly?

286
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,772
He cut out for Mexico.

287
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,367
When?

288
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,503
Right after we left town.

289
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,014
Your wife--lt was Hank.

290
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,983
l had nothing to do with it.
l didn't even watch.

291
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,680
And you didn't help her.

292
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,716
He's my brother.

293
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,891
Him for what he did...

294
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,829
and you for what you didn't do.

295
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,058
No!

296
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,603
You could have taken him back.

297
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,945
Do you have any doubt
they were guilty?

298
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,879
lf l waited around
for what you ask...

299
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,909
Shelly's trail would go cold.

300
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,388
lt still wasn't right.

301
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,707
Chris!

302
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,876
Chris! Up here!

303
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,514
l knew you wouldn't let me down.

304
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,225
Have you seen a young fella
riding past here...

305
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,358
in the last few days?

306
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,770
Blond? About 5'10'',
18 years old, maybe?

307
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:04,605
Yesterday. Tried to hire him,
but he was in a hurry.

308
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,134
-De Toro's on a rampage.
-As usual.

309
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,943
l got nothing behind me
but a pack of good intentions.

310
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:15,043
Farmers, shopkeepers.
Them two l hired yesterday.

311
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,849
Paid them one quarter
what l offered you...

312
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,753
and they ain't worth that.

313
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,950
As for the rest...

314
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,858
they're willing enough
to get killed...

315
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,293
but l need killers.

316
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,490
That why you thought of Chris?

317
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,159
Didn't mean it
the way it come out.

318
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,227
Before De Toro hits, Jim,
you'd better ride out of here.

319
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,434
Staying's suicide.
That won't do you no good.

320
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,771
Would you ride out?

321
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,573
Hell, no, but l wouldn't be
in this mess to begin with.

322
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,708
Lemonade. Unsweetened.
lt helps fight the thirst.

323
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,410
Thanks.

324
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,953
Thank you.

325
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,652
You make a hell of
a posse man, Padre.

326
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,057
Where's your gun?

327
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,153
l told him
he didn't have to wear one.

328
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,187
Not that l would have anyway.

329
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,466
l fight a different battle.
l use different weapons.

330
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,471
This is De Toro's kind
of a battle.

331
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,030
You're not impressed
with my congregation.

332
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,100
They've been welded together
by adversity.

333
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:17,012
ln many ways, l've already won
my biggest battle.

334
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,141
God works in strange ways.

335
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,813
l know. He's got me confused
most of the time, too.

336
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,617
When we first
came to Magdalena...

337
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,887
the only things we felt were
the differences between us.

338
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:32,022
Now He's taught us,
bound us together.

339
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,088
Under the circumstances...

340
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,896
l'm not sure
he's done you any favors.

341
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,699
You realize you're likely
all to be dead soon?

342
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:44,071
lf that's His Will,
we're ready to die.

343
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,167
l'm not too worried
about meeting him.

344
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,146
Somehow l'm not so sure
you won that exchange.

345
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,279
l'm not so sure he did, either.

346
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,257
lf your whole posse is made up
of tigers like him...

347
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,122
you're in bad trouble.

348
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,060
Aren't you being
a little tough on them?

349
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,723
No tougher
than De Toro's going to be.

350
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,130
Where's that leave me?

351
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,069
Alone.

352
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,832
Chris?

353
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,938
Good luck, Jim.

354
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,528
Shelly's in a mighty big hurry.

355
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,999
Let's go.

356
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,015
-De Toro?
-Yeah.

357
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,519
lt looks like
Shelly's joined them. Come on.

358
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,546
Take it easy! We're liable
to catch up with them!

359
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,796
That's how Shelly
bought his way into the gang.

360
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,138
Those hills are
where MacKay set up his ambush.

361
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,939
Shelly's led them
right in behind him.

362
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,344
-Damn it to hell!
-Come on!

363
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,035
You're not going down there,
are you?

364
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,597
Come on.

365
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,760
l don't see MacKay.

366
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Maybe he took your advice
and lit out.

367
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,599
l didn't think he would.

368
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,830
l don't know
whether l'm glad or not.

369
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:11,308
Sure been a lot of killing
since l met you.

370
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:15,904
Should we bury them?

371
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,472
The living need us more.

372
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,746
There can't be anything
left in their town...

373
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,377
but the women...

374
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,910
and De Toro.

375
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,842
l guess they took off.

376
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,287
There's one by the cantina.

377
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,256
There's another in the door
of the mission.

378
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,781
They're covering us.

379
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,724
Ease off your saddle.

380
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,425
Keep your horse
between you and the mission.

381
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,659
Right.

382
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,957
Noah!

383
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,555
lt's safe now.

384
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,393
You sure?

385
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,366
Chris.

386
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,559
Thank you.

387
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,868
l'm Laurie Gunn.

388
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,236
Miss or Mrs.?

389
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,936
Mrs. l mean...

390
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,539
l'm sorry.

391
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,354
Let her cry.

392
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,948
She'll feel better. Here.

393
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,626
l'm Noah Forbes.

394
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,856
Call him Chris.

395
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,338
Jim MacKay talked about you.

396
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,863
He said you were coming to help.

397
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,570
Only you got here too late.

398
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,246
How are the other women?

399
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,921
Oh, God. l hope
none of us gets pregnant.

400
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,790
Can you tell me about it?

401
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,897
There are
only 17 of us women...

402
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,993
and De Toro
came riding in here...

403
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:12,032
with about 40...50 men.

404
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:19,209
He told us that he had found
our men in the hills...

405
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,310
and that
he had killed them all.

406
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,845
Did he say where
he was going from here?

407
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,484
Did he say when he'd be back?

408
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:33,190
l think
they were going to Texas.

409
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,256
They'll stop here
on their way home.

410
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,063
Probably take you back with him.

411
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,966
That's what he said.

412
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,774
Most of the others are asleep.

413
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,679
Oh, Madge!

414
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,257
When can you take us
away from here?

415
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,418
We'll round up horses
in the morning.

416
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,859
They took them all away.

417
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,122
We can walk.

418
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,188
Walk? Across the desert?

419
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,860
You'll all die
the first day out.

420
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,835
At least it's a chance.

421
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,667
Look...

422
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:18,197
De Toro can ride twenty miles
while you're walking one.

423
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,937
lf he catches you
out in the open...

424
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,376
he'll just butcher you.

425
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,607
We'll go for help.

426
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,616
Where? lf the Rurales
could've done anything...

427
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,947
they'd have done it by now.

428
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,714
The U.S. troops
can't cross the border.

429
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,017
Volunteers won't come down here
and fight De Toro.

430
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,752
-Chris...
-MacKay's already tried it.

431
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,191
What are you saying?

432
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,695
There must be something.

433
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,493
l'm open for suggestions.

434
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:45,468
lf they come back here,
l'll kill myself!

435
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,098
Damn you!
Think of something!

436
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:01,443
Maybe l can get a few men
tough enough to match De Toro.

437
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,975
Where?

438
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,056
Tell me everything
you know about him.

439
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,654
What's he like,
how he acts, everything.

440
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,328
Well...

441
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,166
The first thing
you notice about him are...

442
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,370
are his eyes.

443
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,682
They tell you that he's mad.

444
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,014
Crazy mad.

445
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,250
Come on, Chris. Let's go.

446
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,455
You better eat something.

447
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,361
You won't get a chance again
for quite a while.

448
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,459
This isn't like with MacKay?
We're not cutting out on them?

449
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,060
No...

450
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,970
or l'd have told them
so they could make other plans.

451
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,868
Suddenly it's not so bad, huh?

452
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,172
What?

453
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,974
Me being a killer.

454
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,471
No. lt's turned out
to be quite useful.

455
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,479
There's something else, too.

456
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,750
We don't have to go
looking for Shelly now.

457
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,314
He'll come riding in
with De Toro. Come on.

458
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,392
You will come back?

459
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,428
Yeah.

460
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,832
Suppose they come back
before you do?

461
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,709
Just pray they don't.

462
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,678
Stop worrying.
We'll be back.

463
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,276
l knew he wouldn't run.

464
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,690
Shelly.

465
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,390
MacKay killed him.

466
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,266
The women need you anyway.

467
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,240
You got to help them, Chris.

468
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,970
You promised.

469
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,276
He did my job.

470
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,807
l'll do his.

471
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,396
l don't think
this is quite legal.

472
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,765
l don't care what you think.

473
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,794
The governor's approved it.
He's the boss.

474
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,137
l won't turn these men loose.

475
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,642
You're not turning them loose.

476
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,043
You're paroling them
in my custody.

477
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,673
lt don't seem right...

478
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,706
turning them loose
to do the very things...

479
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,187
they were put in here
for doing in the first place!

480
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,413
Marshal,
l think you ought to know...

481
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,688
they're not quite
so tough anymore.

482
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,820
l had to do a bit of taming.

483
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,026
You didn't tame them,
you broke them.

484
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,229
They weren't sent here
for a vacation.

485
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,402
Pepe.

486
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,335
Chris, l've been thinking
about you.

487
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,902
Have you?

488
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,115
You better believe it.

489
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,379
How's it going, Walt?

490
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,753
Answer when you're spoke to!

491
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,193
-lt's all right!
-lt's not all right.

492
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,697
They're in my custody now.

493
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,565
Captain.

494
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,771
May l ask what you mean about us
being in your custody now?

495
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,375
Can you still
handle dynamite, Elliot?

496
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,850
Good.

497
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,016
Still smiling, Skinner?

498
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,117
Only on the outside, Chris.

499
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,354
Fast as ever?

500
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,522
l wish you'd try me.

501
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,571
l've got pardons here...

502
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,870
signed by the governor,
for each of you.

503
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,433
When l countersign them,
you'll be free men.

504
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,705
Then sign them!

505
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,406
You're going to earn them first.

506
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,075
-How?
- Join a posse l'm leading.

507
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,311
Go to hell.

508
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,650
All right,
put him back in his cell.

509
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,679
Hey, wait a minute!

510
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,558
All right, Chris.
Whatever you say.

511
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,395
Who are we going after?

512
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,333
Juan De Toro.

513
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,199
lnto Mexico?

514
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:58,166
Pardons, hell.
That's seven against seventy.

515
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,039
You're taking us in there
to get killed.

516
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,740
The odds are long,
pay's good...

517
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,748
but there is one hitch.

518
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,148
lf l get killed, by you,
by accident...

519
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,244
or by De Toro's bunch...

520
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,450
the governor will assume
that you did it...

521
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,618
and he'll track you down
and hang every one of you.

522
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,321
But we'll be in Mexico?

523
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,262
All right, who wants to go?

524
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,326
Walt?

525
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,872
Get the chains off of them.

526
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,744
Right face! March!

527
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,711
You damn fool! Can't you see
what they're thinking?

528
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,815
They'll let you lead them
into Mexico right enough...

529
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,258
then they'll blow your head off
and join De Toro.

530
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,786
l'm sure that's exactly
what they're thinking.

531
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,897
That's all we're taking?

532
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,030
Yeah.

533
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,903
Let's get more men.

534
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,035
Seven's always been
my lucky number.

535
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,878
Damn it, Marshal,
couldn't you have waited...

536
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,147
till you got farther away
from here?

537
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,450
Take them.

538
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,329
Here's a double for you,
Skinner.

539
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,924
You only need one
if you're really good.

540
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,366
Figured you'd like to have that.

541
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,078
Didn't think you'd want one.

542
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,022
Haven't been in a situation
like this lately.

543
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,116
Don't blow your foot off.

544
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,320
Who's the dude?

545
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,854
He takes notes.
He'll write all about you.

546
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,763
All right,
when you're ready, mount up.

547
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,963
Elliot,
you're driving the wagon.

548
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,005
Hear you had a little trouble.

549
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,136
Few of the boys cut me some.

550
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,442
They have good cause?

551
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,142
They thought so.

552
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,141
Warden made me take charge
of a work detail.

553
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,518
Had to build up
a new cell block.

554
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,580
And you built it solid.

555
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:30,684
You'll be building again.

556
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:31,989
Stone or brick?

557
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,964
Barbed wire this time.

558
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,794
Hayes!

559
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,770
At your trial, you promised...

560
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,796
you were going to blow
my brains out.

561
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,740
That was the mood of the moment.

562
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,837
l picked you because l need
a man who knows battles.

563
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,849
Not gunfights, battles.

564
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,579
Let's cut through it, Chris.

565
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,678
l'm out and l'm not going back.

566
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,949
You can depend on me.

567
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,253
l hope so.

568
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,892
Let's go.

569
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,469
Why don't we ride in the rear?

570
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,203
l don't like having my back
to this bunch.

571
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,471
lt don't matter.

572
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,002
You won't be able to stop them
once they make their move.

573
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,345
How long do you figure
they'll wait?

574
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:29,113
This ain't a patient bunch.

575
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,650
This way.

576
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,454
Come on.

577
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,520
Chris, this isn't the way
to Magdalena.

578
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,031
Where are we going?

579
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,966
De Toro's stronghold.

580
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,525
He's not there.

581
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,696
lf he was,
we wouldn't be going there.

582
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,184
That's got to be her.

583
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,118
De Toro's woman.

584
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,154
l hope De Toro's as
proud of her as Laurie said.

585
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,656
Laurie was wrong
about one thing.

586
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:55,535
He's not completely crazy mad.

587
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,405
Let me see her.

588
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,569
l'll introduce you to her
in time.

589
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:10,077
How many guards you figure?

590
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Enough to give you your share.

591
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,283
There's a hacienda
just over that hill.

592
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,190
There's a few risks...

593
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,425
but there's enough loot in there
to give you all a fresh start.

594
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,898
You're going to help us
rob a hacienda?

595
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,696
You'll all be rich by morning.

596
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,703
-Rich?
-Wait a minute.

597
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,364
Why are you being so good to us?

598
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,134
l don't think
l'm doing any more for you...

599
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,471
than you'd do for me.

600
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,339
How the hell do you mean that?

601
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,245
Like he says it.

602
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,477
You're on his side?

603
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,918
Kept that prison guard
from busting me with that club.

604
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,422
You damn fool,
he didn't do that for you.

605
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:24,120
He knew if your ass was busted,
you couldn't ride a horse.

606
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,494
Was that the reason?

607
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,933
Not exactly.

608
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,065
Hold it.
Chris, do you mean that?

609
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,838
We go in there and
we can take anything we want?

610
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,074
That's exactly what l mean.

611
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,617
All right, what's your plan?

612
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:52,019
l figured
we'd just ride in there...

613
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,580
and shoot down anyone
carrying a gun.

614
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,957
That's sloppy.

615
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,622
Who's in the assault wave?
Who are the reserves?

616
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,188
You have to have flankers.

617
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:06,134
Suppose you get hit,
who assumes command?

618
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,639
Noah.

619
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,300
l've got better qualifications.

620
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,741
-Relax, Hayes.
-Captain Hayes!

621
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,937
-l've ambushed Apaches.
-Oh, shit.

622
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,947
Anything in this world
is child's play after that.

623
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,949
He's got a good argument there.

624
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,778
All right, Hayes...you.

625
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,017
You all heard that?

626
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,461
Yeah, we heard that...Captain.

627
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,861
All right,
l'll work out some tactics.

628
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,389
Hayes,
you're a pain in the ass.

629
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,130
But a useful one.
Come on, let's go.

630
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,036
Pepe!

631
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,507
Here.

632
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,412
That Gatling gun right up there.

633
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:30,044
Everybody else gets
a better deal again, Chris?

634
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,553
How come l get the worst job?

635
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,385
Because you're the best
with that.

636
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,913
Am l?

637
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,118
You cross me, Pepe...

638
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,218
and you'll be killing
your friends, too.

639
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,558
Now get going.

640
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,565
Ain't no friends of mine.

641
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,334
Around the gate.

642
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,601
Walt! You got the stable.

643
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,808
Skinner...

644
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,681
got a good one for you.

645
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,654
See those two right there?

646
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,679
Go get them.

647
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,023
Come on!

648
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,768
Take that one alive.

649
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,740
Yeah. We're just leading
damn recruits.

650
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,332
We better give them
a few more minutes...

651
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,604
to get in position.

652
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,736
Hey, amigo.

653
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,050
Pepe!

654
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,781
Pepe! Pepe!

655
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:29,785
Pepe!

656
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,533
l'll have to get around.

657
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,099
l'll draw their fire.

658
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,393
Pepe!

659
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,561
Pepe!

660
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,264
Where are you?

661
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,465
Aw, hell.

662
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,063
Up here.

663
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,858
Come on.

664
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,506
Noah...

665
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,502
tie her up.

666
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,350
Hayes...

667
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,378
bring me the live one.

668
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,951
Do you speak English?

669
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,623
Now, you go to De Toro...

670
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:54,102
and you tell him that
l, Chris, degrade his woman.

671
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:55,468
Skinner.

672
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,145
And you tell him the names...

673
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,482
of the rest of the men
that did this to him.

674
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,488
Pepe Carral...

675
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,022
Walt Drummond...

676
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,751
Walt Drummond...

677
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,156
Andy Hayes...

678
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,886
Scott Elliot, Noah Forbes...

679
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:24,696
and Mark Skinner.
Now, you got that?

680
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,532
And you tell him that
we'll be waiting for him...

681
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,768
with his woman, at Magdalena.

682
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,140
Now get going!

683
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,407
Stop him!

684
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,450
What the hell you doing, Chris?

685
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,926
You bastards.

686
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,829
You can't go back to the States
because they'll hang you...

687
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,628
and you can't join De Toro...

688
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,635
because
he'll cut your hearts out.

689
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,503
Now we're ready for Magdalena.

690
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,368
They're back!
They've come back!

691
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:44,209
They've come back!
They're back!

692
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,010
The marshal, he's come back!

693
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,603
l knew you'd be back.

694
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,037
l want her watched every minute.

695
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,514
She's De Toro's woman.

696
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,654
Martha? You watch her.

697
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,789
You...

698
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,816
come on with me.

699
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,820
l said, come with me.

700
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,613
Who are they?

701
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,382
Volunteers.

702
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,151
They came to help us.

703
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,919
Why?

704
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,360
They're humanitarians.

705
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,129
Get some food in your guts...

706
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,464
then we'll go to work.
Come on.

707
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,595
We'll serve everybody
over in the cantina.

708
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,833
Just bring whatever
you have on the stove.

709
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,542
We haven't got much time,
so listen to me, please.

710
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,139
Will all the women get over
against that wall?

711
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,117
The men against the bar.

712
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,994
Now, we've got two days,
three at the most...

713
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,195
before they get here...

714
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:50,000
so we'll be working
day and night.

715
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,507
You men will be heading
work parties.

716
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,203
You'll also need the women
to load guns for you...

717
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,371
so pick your partners.

718
01:06:57,413 --> 01:07:00,177
Try to make it mutual, huh?

719
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,394
No.

720
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,763
No.

721
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,312
What about them?

722
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,378
Keep picking till they're gone.

723
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,767
You women will be working,
loading for your men...

724
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,932
feeding them,
taking care of them.

725
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,908
Draw your own lines.

726
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:04,242
Now, let's unload that wagon.

727
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,325
Long-range target rifles.

728
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,521
This are single shots, Chris.
We need repeaters.

729
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,554
Keep digging.
Watch those sights.

730
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:39,343
Got Winchester rifles.
Caliber 30-40. Model 1885.

731
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,815
They're brand-new, Captain.
Get the grease out of them.

732
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:45,082
You'll be able to inspect them
with white gloves.

733
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,319
Ladies, l want boiling water
to get rid of that grease.

734
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,294
Shotgun shells,
1 2-gauge double-ought buckshot.

735
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,767
And official police riot guns.

736
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,377
You would get official
police guns, wouldn't you?

737
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,572
You would get official
police guns, wouldn't you?

738
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,012
Captain,
tell Pepe what you want.

739
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,241
l'll need you with me.

740
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,442
Come on, Pepe!

741
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,280
Go to hell.

742
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,808
Move!

743
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,549
And take your women with you.

744
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,487
And don't go empty-handed!

745
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,370
Laurie, l need everything
in town that can hold dirt.

746
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:44,539
Pillow cases,
flour sacks, trouser legs.

747
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,640
Get the women to sew bags
out of anything.

748
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,583
All right, Chris.

749
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,447
All right, come on,
construction foreman.

750
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,354
l'll show you why l brought you.

751
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,135
They'll have to come in
right over there...

752
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,969
and we'll have
to whittle them down.

753
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:15,033
Those target rifles
have got range...

754
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,068
so we use those
on the first line.

755
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,443
How many do you think
he'll have?

756
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,847
Forty...fifty.

757
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,511
We'll dig a row of pits...

758
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:27,215
then sight in the rifles
and set out range stakes.

759
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,621
When they pass a stake,
we'll know exactly...

760
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,785
how far away they are
and save misses.

761
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:35,558
Those pits'll go right in here.

762
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,361
lf his horses are covering...

763
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,266
a hundred yards
every five or six seconds...

764
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:44,432
that means he'll be here
a minute after we open fire.

765
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:47,067
That should give us time
for about three rounds.

766
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,576
With seven of us shooting...

767
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,102
we should get about
15 to 20 of them.

768
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,910
Or less.

769
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,008
When they're
about 300 yards away...

770
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,849
we'll start falling back
to the second line.

771
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,481
They're going to be
crawling all over us.

772
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,753
Then we'll have to do
something to stop them...

773
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,953
from crawling all over us, huh?

774
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,896
Plant a series of charges
in these pits.

775
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,196
That'll take care of about
five more of them.

776
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,963
Chris...

777
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,404
when we're retreating,
you have to figure on losses.

778
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,701
With all that lead flying...

779
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,641
odds are
they'll get a couple of us.

780
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,770
Well...then
there'll be five or six of us...

781
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,143
at the second line.

782
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,377
Which five or six?

783
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,183
We'll make the Winchester line
right here.

784
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,519
Same thing--pits.

785
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:37,491
lf the charge is broken,
they'll take cover.

786
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,051
You can see where they'll go--
those little gullies.

787
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,325
l'll plant charges in them.

788
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:45,333
You're both as crazy as De Toro.

789
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,029
What makes you think
he'll do everything you want?

790
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,537
He'll charge the first line...

791
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:51,562
because he's got contempt
for us.

792
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,700
When we fall back
and he sees how few we are...

793
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:56,176
it'll hurt his pride and
make him charge the second line.

794
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,304
Then what?

795
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,939
Then he'll start being careful.

796
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,416
-And flank us.
-Yeah.

797
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,682
By then, we should have
a third to half his men...

798
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:08,383
and only lost a few of us.

799
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,415
Wish he'd stop saying that.

800
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,825
They'll be coming in
from all sides.

801
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:18,321
l'll figure out some stuff.
Wires, charges...

802
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,561
Strong as you can.

803
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,001
But what happens
when they break in here?

804
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:26,064
We'll put the biggest charge
in the altar in the mission...

805
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,941
and take
those bastards with us.

806
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,841
l wonder if we'll reach water?

807
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,628
Come on, time to eat.

808
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:36,927
l got to keep working,
get this done.

809
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:40,230
Put the shovel down.
You gotta have something to eat.

810
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,499
Got to keep up
all that strength.

811
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,673
ls that enough?

812
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,575
Almost.

813
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:57,779
Getting killed...

814
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,152
will at least
bring us some rest.

815
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:05,125
lf you can't handle it,
Pepe, go to sleep.

816
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:49,799
They say...

817
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,863
if a tree
falls in the forest...

818
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,397
and no one hears it...

819
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,468
there's a question of whether
it makes any noise.

820
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:04,644
lf none of us
lives to tell about this...

821
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:07,621
can we be covered in glory?

822
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,684
Sure we can.

823
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,228
Feels good to be building again.

824
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,530
We've built good.

825
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:24,835
Not good enough, maybe, but...

826
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:26,932
the best we could.

827
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,936
l'm satisfied.

828
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,440
Enough money to last me
my whole lifetime.

829
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,283
Clothes to turn any girl's eyes.

830
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,154
Women for the taking.

831
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,385
And l'll be dead...

832
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:47,486
before l can enjoy any of it.

833
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:58,102
Old Chris,
he really had me pegged.

834
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,541
Right from
the first minute we met.

835
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,635
Said l couldn't hold a job.

836
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,446
Boy, he was more right
than he knew.

837
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,918
He must have
seen something else...

838
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,581
or else he wouldn't have
wasted his time on you.

839
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,619
Butterball...

840
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:21,618
you are looking at
a 14-karat sharpie.

841
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,257
A guy who's always known
all the angles.

842
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,861
None of the principles.

843
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,840
You know a few or else you
wouldn't know the difference.

844
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,902
You're really determined
to make me feel good.

845
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,641
l hope you won't get angry...

846
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,675
but l think we have
enough real problems...

847
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,517
without you hashing over
your old ones.

848
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,648
That's just the point.

849
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,420
l have started knowing
what's real.

850
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,658
For the first time, l know.

851
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:59,428
This thing...

852
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:03,427
or any other story...

853
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:06,908
l can tell it...

854
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,309
because l've learned how
to feel it.

855
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,180
This trip with Chris...

856
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:17,413
has really taught me
what l've always needed to know.

857
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,420
Now it's too damned late.

858
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:33,699
Noah said you never had
any children.

859
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,264
Don't you like them?

860
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,068
Sure l like them.

861
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,541
We get along just fine.

862
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:44,669
Come on.

863
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:48,282
Down you go.

864
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,452
He said
your wife was very pretty.

865
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,012
Why was he talking
so much about me?

866
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,019
Because l asked him.

867
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,195
Night-night.

868
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,465
Night.

869
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:21,015
What was your husband like?

870
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,546
You wouldn't have noticed him.

871
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:32,048
He didn't stand out
very much in a crowd.

872
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,029
l don't mean like that.
He was a good man.

873
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,768
Not much of a farmer.

874
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,862
And no fighter at all.

875
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,397
But he was good to me.

876
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,433
He loved them.

877
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:52,344
l wasn't unhappy.

878
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,448
Why'd you marry him?

879
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,754
l'd rather talk about you.

880
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:08,490
You've got enough answers
and l don't have any?

881
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:13,162
He promised me a better life.

882
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,735
A place of our own.

883
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,038
He kept his promise.

884
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:25,775
l'm a lousy farmer, too.

885
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,544
And l don't keep promises.

886
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:31,177
Of course you do.

887
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,949
You promised you'd come
back here and you did.

888
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:37,049
l don't make a habit out of it.

889
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,867
lf we get through
this thing tomorrow...

890
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,606
l ain't sticking around here.

891
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,505
l know.

892
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,987
Six hundred!
Lower the range!

893
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,421
Let's go!

894
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,040
Let me see!

895
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,878
He'll be coming back
on our flank...

896
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,684
and we won't be able
to hold him.

897
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:04,191
Get the women out of here!
Go on, girls!

898
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,293
Go!

899
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,524
No!

900
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,314
Get ready!

901
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:07,815
Pepe, help me!

902
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:15,861
Come on!

903
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:24,399
Get up, Pepe! Come on!

904
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,333
They're coming back!
Let's go!

905
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,643
Anything?

906
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,147
From what l can count...

907
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,809
we've already
got about half of them.

908
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,909
They got about half of us.

909
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:20,716
The odds are the same
as when we started.

910
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,825
Now, everybody sit down.

911
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,695
Sit down on the floor.
Everything.

912
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,198
Come on.

913
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,776
Here. Come on.

914
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,420
No, Chris! No! Please!

915
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,786
Laurie, stop it!

916
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:31,155
You know
this is the last resort.

917
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:34,389
Chris! Give her back to him.

918
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,726
Maybe he'll go away.

919
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,630
l would give her back to him...

920
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,863
but she's not important
to him now.

921
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,370
He'd see her in Hell...

922
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:44,962
before he'd let us
get away with this.

923
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,997
Laurie...

924
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:52,435
you'll have to decide
for yourself...

925
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,345
and do it or not.

926
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:59,283
l can't!

927
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,921
All right.

928
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:08,086
De Toro will let
the children live, won't he?

929
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,892
l don't know what he'll do.

930
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,594
You told me yourself
he was crazy mad.

931
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,173
Laurie...

932
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,511
they're fine kids.

933
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,633
Sorry.

934
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,668
He was a good man.

935
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,718
What was his name?

936
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:11,020
l never thought to ask.

937
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,753
Didn't seem important.

938
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:19,357
He wasn't much for talking.

939
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:23,398
Walt.

940
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:25,337
Walt Drummond.

941
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:14,783
On the roof!

942
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:53,086
Get down!

943
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:10,631
De Toro!

944
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:09,324
Oh, Chris!

945
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,790
Hey, Chris...

946
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:54,964
Where's my pardon?

947
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:10,455
This town needs a sheriff,
Skinner.

948
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:14,194
lnterested?

949
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,662
Ain't much of a town.

950
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:19,996
Three men and
a passel of women and kids.

951
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:22,798
The women are scarce
in this part of the country.

952
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,532
Men'll come.

953
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,334
Why not?

954
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:43,846
Chris! l ever tell you
l was born in Salt Lake?

955
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:45,882
l'm a Mormon.

956
01:37:58,572 --> 01:37:59,937
Noah?

957
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:20,991
Guess l won't be coming
this way again.

958
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:25,055
The sheriff here's
an old enemy of mine.

959
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:27,033
lf you behaved yourself...

960
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:29,228
you wouldn't get
into any trouble.

961
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:48,915
You put him up to that.

962
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:51,481
-l did not.
-The hell you didn't!

963
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:54,426
They've grown used to you,
that's all.

964
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:57,294
Yeah, well, kids pick up
bad habits easy.

965
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,629
So do adults.

966
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:09,609
l ain't making no promises.

967
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,804
Who asked you to?

968
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:15,809
Skinner!

969
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,750
You just been demoted
to deputy!

970
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:22,449
Well, that figures.

971
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:26,289
Wouldn't have had much time
for work anyway.
