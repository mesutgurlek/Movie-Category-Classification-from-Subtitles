1
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,901
This is that part of Afghanistan
where the people...

2
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:11,131
...comprise of 2 tribes that
are bitterest of enemies.

3
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:17,276
Like every year; today, the tribes
are meeting for a local sport.

4
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:23,809
lt may be considered a sport, but
it's no less than a brutal war!

5
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:31,320
The tribe who lifts the goat, and
takes it to a certain point, wins.

6
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:38,933
Every rider, in an effort to win
strikes the foe so horribly...

7
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:44,271
...as though it's a question of
life and death, and not a game!

8
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,902
Victory is ours, Badshah Khan.

9
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,284
What have you done? Turned
a victory into a defeat!

10
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,986
l'm struck by lightning.

11
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:22,026
l've not lost a contest,
but my life itself!

12
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,862
You've always solved my problems.

13
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:33,598
Solve this one too.
How do l win her?

14
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,640
- There's only one way to win her.
- What's that? - Death!

15
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:50,196
Your actions make me mad, and...

16
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:54,543
...and surprise me too!
This madness of yours...

17
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,301
...could prove to be a
lesson to both the tribes.

18
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,350
My war's with beauty,
not the tribe, Benazir.

19
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:06,717
His tongue wags too much!
lt must be cut off.

20
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:12,419
Before you do that, l'll cut your
sword in so many pieces...

21
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,895
...that you'll spend your
lifetime, in gathering them all.

22
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:20,565
An answer to an ignorant is silence!

23
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:26,475
You call me an ignoramus?

24
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:34,574
Benazir, l'll marry you.

25
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:40,717
- That's impossible!
- l'll make the impossible, possible.

26
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,887
- For this you'll have to sieve
grains of sand in lndia. - Fine.

27
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:51,031
- What madness! - You'll have to
bring the head of my father's killer.

28
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:55,426
- l'll get it for you.
- Careful now. - ln this test...

29
00:19:56,071 --> 00:20:00,064
- ...you may lose your life.
- l've already lost that to you.

30
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:06,977
lf you do that, then...
l'll be yours.

31
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:12,883
Benazir... you are already mine!

32
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,328
May Lord fulfill your wish.

33
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:50,724
Son, your friend is going faraway,
and you're keeping silent?

34
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,693
Stop him, else he'll die
in trying to search that killer.

35
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,599
Nothing new in it. What
kind of love is it...

36
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:05,705
...which isn't sacrificed
for love? And which moth...

37
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:11,143
...doesn't kill himself on
a flame? Am l right or not?

38
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:16,177
Come on, my dear friend...

39
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:20,379
l'm going so far away, and
you get cross with me?

40
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:24,392
Do you take me to be
a statue of stone?

41
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,194
You're inviting death, and you
ask your friend to embrace you?

42
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:33,826
Dear friend, the heavens
decide about life and death.

43
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:39,772
Don't think so seriously. lf you
do that, it weakens the decisions.

44
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:44,811
lndia is a huge country.
Your destination is miles away.

45
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:49,581
Look through my eyes. There
stands my destination.

46
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:51,683
At the feet of Benazir.

47
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:03,130
Khan, take a good look at
the killer's photograph.

48
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:08,064
Don't bring an ass's head,
in a hurry to win Benazir!

49
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,596
- You swine!
- Keep quiet!

50
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,880
lf l wanted to present an
ass's head to Benazir...

51
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:28,288
...l'd have cut your head off
a long time ago!

52
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:39,093
- l don't think you'll return!
- lf God...

53
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:42,165
...wills light, then lamps
burn even in storms!

54
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:47,504
- l beg your leave, my beloved.
- May God keep you, Khan.

55
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:53,776
- Just a question of a smile.
- lt'll be difficult.

56
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:58,142
Ease that difficulty
for me then.

57
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:03,723
l won't go without it.
Just one smile.

58
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:09,629
Broader...

59
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:16,129
A bit more broader...

60
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:21,709
Slightly more now...

61
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,042
Wonderful, dear friend.

62
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:35,585
Sacrifice!

63
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:44,989
Symbol of love!
ln the name of beauty!

64
00:23:54,076 --> 00:24:00,504
Whenever you look at this
flag, you'll touch me.

65
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:07,453
Whenever it flutters, you'll hear
my heart beating in yours.

66
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:11,517
Whenever your delicate hands
touch this flag...

67
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,956
...their fragrance
will reach my soul.

68
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,265
Goodbye, Benazir.

69
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,906
Goodbye, dear friend.
Goodbye, Kabul!

70
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:31,911
Goodbye... Goodbye...

71
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,159
O land of lndia,...
Greetings to you.

72
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,595
My name's Badshah Khan.
Love is my faith...

73
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:07,772
Love is my religion.

74
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,708
Love! for which Farhad...

75
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:19,047
...cut open the mountains, and
got milk to flow from them!

76
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:28,487
Love! for which Majnu searched
every grain of sand in a storm.

77
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,324
For that very love,
this Pathan from Kabul...

78
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:35,633
...has come to this soil of
lndia to acquire that love.

79
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,703
lt's a trying test.

80
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:48,773
A difficult test. But
the confidence is strong!

81
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:55,247
Love her always been victorious.

82
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:00,790
lt's been so for centuries.
And it'll always be so too!

83
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,354
God is witness.

84
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:17,202
For one whole year,
in search of Habibulla...

85
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,781
...Badshah Khan left no
stone unturned in lndia...

86
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,452
But he was unsuccessful.

87
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:34,988
Forget him, Benazir. Nobody
returns from the jaws of death!

88
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:40,267
He won't find Habibullah.
And even if he does...

89
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:47,175
...Habib's brother, will chop
your Khan to pieces. Forget him!

90
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,302
He has let you down!

91
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,312
Why did you do that?

92
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:03,450
You've fanned a dormant fire.

93
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:08,258
l had come with the intention
of proposing to you.

94
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:14,099
Now l'll put my seal
to that intention.

95
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,157
l sent the swine to hell!

96
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,832
lt's a whole year now.

97
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:55,238
There's no news about Badshah.
He will come, won't he?

98
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:59,411
He's gone like a storm, he'll
return as one! And when he does...

99
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:03,040
...l'll not call you Benazir...
but ''sister-in-law'' !

100
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:29,400
- May God keep you, Badshah.
- Same to you, dear boy.

101
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:34,911
- How do you know my name?
- Mummy says, a customer is a guest.

102
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:38,047
And every guest should be served
like a '' Badshah'', a king!

103
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:43,622
That's a noble thought. Your
mother guides you well.

104
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:48,688
- Greetings brother. - Greetings.
- Badshah, this is my mother.

105
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,432
- My respects. - You called me
''brother'', l'm very glad.

106
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,930
By God! l'm really happy.
l don't have a sister, that's why.

107
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:06,306
l also don't have a brother. May
God bless this relation. Come in.

108
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,115
Greetings, Habibullah Khan.

109
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,300
Forgive me. l took
you for somebody else.

110
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,840
Sorry. l thought you
were somebody else.

111
00:30:56,264 --> 00:30:57,458
Why have you come here?

112
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,361
- To meet my son.
- l won't let you, in this state.

113
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:10,136
My son is sleeping with such
a dream in his eyes...

114
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:15,109
...in which you are an honest,
righteous person. l won't...

115
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:17,212
...let you spoil
that dream of his!

116
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:27,252
l'll die, but l won't let your
evil shadow fall on my son!

117
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:31,960
- He'll live like a human, not
an animal like you! - Animal?

118
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,196
You call me an animal?

119
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,099
Shame on you, you devil!
You strike a woman?

120
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,807
Who's he? Your lover-boy?

121
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:54,017
You swine! You call
a brother, a lover?

122
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,217
A lover?

123
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,361
You call him a lover?

124
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,828
You lifted your hand at me?
An officer?

125
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:14,872
- l'll have you arrested in 2 days.
- How can you do that to a good man?

126
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:19,444
Now get lost. Go on... Out!

127
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:21,306
Better go, else l'll debone you!

128
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:24,176
- l'll show you!
- What will you show me?

129
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,290
Go, sister. Go.

130
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:39,357
He won't come here again.
Pray to the Lord and sleep.

131
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:58,710
No noose on earth
can reach my neck...

132
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:04,425
...while my brother is living.
He'll take me out of this cage.

133
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,493
His name is Pasha.

134
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:36,582
My God! This area is as terrible...

135
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:41,191
...as the man who owns it! The
name too is apt. '' Burial ground''.

136
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,437
This is the pigeon who challenged
me and held his head high!

137
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:36,809
He looked in my eyes!
l was betrayed! Betrayed.

138
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:42,951
- But l didn't do any treachery.
- My brother's in your jail.

139
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:47,620
Did you allow him to escape?
No! Well, that's betrayal!

140
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:52,130
The rest is all fine.

141
00:34:57,672 --> 00:35:01,733
What's fine, Pasha? You men
are piling earth on me.

142
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:07,078
l tried my best to help him escape
but the jailer kept a tight security.

143
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:13,519
- l want my brother! - l'll sneak in
4 of your men in the police guard.

144
00:35:14,456 --> 00:35:18,950
l'll steal the uniforms, and you
shoot down the jailer from afar.

145
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:22,488
- That'll be fun.
- Your brother will then escape.

146
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,667
Take him out.

147
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:04,103
Don't defy fate.
Forget Habibullah...

148
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:09,234
- ...and go back home.
- My dear sister...

149
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,538
A spent arrow, a falling star...

150
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:19,920
...and a spoken word, never return.

151
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:26,617
Habibullah's found. See this.
He's jailed here.

152
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:36,730
Dear child, you brought
Habibullah to me.

153
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:44,202
You've obliged me greatly.
And l'll never forget it. Never!

154
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:38,459
- Who are you?
- l'm Badshah Khan, from Kabul.

155
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:42,628
- What do you want? - Habib's
head! - This is a Br. Jail.

156
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:47,772
Not a cage in Kabul to hand
over a fowl or a goat to you!

157
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:53,813
You son of a gun! Why do
you talk nonsense?

158
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:57,278
l'm a Pathan. l'm not used
to being talked to impudently!

159
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,822
l'm a Rajput too, Khan.
l'm also not used to it!

160
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:08,125
Rajputs are courageous men too.
Then talk like a Rajput.

161
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:13,030
- Bring that useless being out.
l want his head. - He's not a goat...

162
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:16,035
...for you to carry him away
on the tip of your sword from here!

163
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:21,600
Every convict is my responsibility,
who either serves his term fully...

164
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:26,170
- ...or dies! - Before he became
a wanted man in your country...

165
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:31,111
...he's wanted in mine! My nation
and this sword will, punish him!

166
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:37,391
Khan, Habibullah has already
got his punishment.

167
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,993
Tomorrow, he'll be hanged
before dawn, in public...

168
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,092
...in the village square.

169
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,897
Then; by God's Holy
word, O Rajput Khan...

170
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:56,666
...either this Pathan will take
him back, or the sun will not rise!

171
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,148
Wonderful! How you defeated
Death, by saving me!

172
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:52,887
My brother will reward you of course
but l too will reward you. Shake!

173
00:40:55,163 --> 00:41:00,294
You goon! Life wishes to
shake hands with death!

174
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:05,498
- Death? Death is miles behind us.
- lt's in front of you too, rascal.

175
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,968
- What do you mean by that?
- Justice!

176
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,941
- What justice? - By stabbing
Benazir's father in the back...

177
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:18,511
...you brought enmity in the two
tribes. l'm hoping to change that.

178
00:41:19,887 --> 00:41:21,411
By severing your head!

179
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,873
Don't worry, Habib.
Don't you worry.

180
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:49,748
Why do you wish to kill my brother?

181
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:55,645
Pasha, l think he too
is Benazir's lover-boy.

182
00:41:56,123 --> 00:42:00,457
He wants to kill me and win her.
Shoot him! Kill him!

183
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:03,588
Shut up! Kill him, indeed!
Put your rifles down.

184
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:10,699
This Pathan is our friend.
One of us.

185
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:15,003
- Who are you, Pathan?
- Who are you?

186
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,567
At your service, Pathan!

187
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:23,610
And name? A small one. Pasha.

188
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:30,257
But l do very dangerous deeds.

189
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:36,025
- Hey you! This is my prey.

190
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:40,298
- Forget him! Else...
- Else what? - Else, not one...

191
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:42,928
...but 2 heads will be severed.

192
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:49,272
Better worry about your own head.

193
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:54,477
Better show your back and go.
Else your head will fly to Kabul!

194
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:56,407
Damn you!

195
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:09,560
Not his, my head.
You talked too much, eh?

196
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:14,200
Why don't you speak now?
Go on, talk.

197
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,126
Talk!

198
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:05,462
Thank you very much.
You saved my life.

199
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:12,231
l'll be obliged to you.
Okay then. Goodbye.

200
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:20,536
- What's this?
- Handcuffs. To arrest you.

201
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:27,317
Oh God! You save my life,
and you'll handcuff me too?

202
00:47:28,422 --> 00:47:32,950
l saved you, as a fellow being.
But it's my duty to arrest you.

203
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:37,028
- What duty? - ln the eyes of our
law, you've committed a crime.

204
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:38,691
What law?

205
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:45,029
Your law was to hang him.
He was to die anyway.

206
00:47:45,773 --> 00:47:49,072
- You didn't kill him, l did.
We're quits. - That's your crime.

207
00:47:55,516 --> 00:48:00,385
Rajput Khan, l'll take
his body to Kabul.

208
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:03,953
Nobody can stop me. Nobody!

209
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:10,327
A Rajput stands before you.
He too knows how to bid.

210
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:16,360
- Sorry l can't permit you to go.
- l didn't ask you permission.

211
00:48:17,204 --> 00:48:20,002
- l just told you my decision.
- Then l too have spoken of my duty.

212
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:24,276
lt's better if our
principles don't clash.

213
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:30,040
Because of this traitor, our 2
clans have become bitter enemies.

214
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:34,943
He's a murderer. He killed
Benazir's father...

215
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:38,483
- ...and sowed seeds of enmity
in our tribes. - Who's Benazir?

216
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:45,859
She... who has become a
part of Badshah's heart.

217
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:51,969
lf l take this corpse to her,
she'll accept me.

218
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:57,541
- That was her promise.
- No, Badshah. No.

219
00:48:58,946 --> 00:49:02,143
- My duty forbids you from
doing this. - Look Rajput Khan...

220
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:05,374
Try to understand me.

221
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:11,422
lf l go back, our 2 clans
will come together again.

222
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:15,584
There'll be peace. Hatred
will turn into friendship.

223
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:20,165
l'll be able to wed Benazir.

224
00:49:32,146 --> 00:49:33,374
Look, Rajput Khan.

225
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:37,507
l give you my word.

226
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:46,053
Let me go now. l'll come back
to you within 30 days.

227
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,692
You can do your duty then.

228
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:57,260
This is a word of a Pathan.
A Pathan.

229
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:04,807
Okay. You may go, Badshah.

230
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:09,306
Go for now. But, remember...

231
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:12,849
A Rajput has trusted a Pathan.

232
00:50:14,555 --> 00:50:18,286
30 days from today,
we'll meet again.

233
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:33,237
Long live Badshah Khan.

234
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:38,770
Sister-in-law!

235
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:45,945
Dear Lord! You called
me sister-in-law?

236
00:50:46,553 --> 00:50:49,283
Yes. He has come back.
Badshah Khan is here.

237
00:59:42,722 --> 00:59:45,384
ln this very place;
ln this very earth...

238
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,126
...hadn't Badshah Khan spilt
my brother's blood?

239
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:54,398
Remember this spot.
Never forget it.

240
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:59,062
l too shall spill that bastard's
blood in this very earth!

241
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:15,082
This line is the border line
of Badshah Khan's life.

242
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,826
He shall repay my brother's
life with his own!

243
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:24,961
Everything else is fine.

244
01:00:36,142 --> 01:00:40,203
Badshah, if you don't keep
your word just once...

245
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:44,078
...what difference will it make?

246
01:00:47,587 --> 01:00:52,047
Benazir... How can
you say that, love?

247
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,858
Being a tiger's cub,
you talk so cowardly?

248
01:00:58,732 --> 01:01:01,223
You know very well that
l'm not a coward.

249
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:05,764
But, what can l do?
l'm so very scared.

250
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,444
That this separation may not drive
me mad! How do l convince my heart?

251
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:19,876
Control it. Convince it. There's
something beyond the heart too.

252
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:25,548
One who can betray his own word,
can betray anyone.

253
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:31,128
Even God, or you too.
Treachery is a crime, sweetheart.

254
01:01:32,098 --> 01:01:34,623
l don't mind this crime.

255
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:38,904
For your Benazir,
commit this crime too.

256
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:47,478
For you l can commit 100 crimes,
but then, l won't remain myself.

257
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:50,342
l'll die of shame.

258
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:57,287
That courageous Rajput,
trusted this Pathan's word.

259
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,893
And l should break my own word?

260
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:11,370
Take this dagger, and thrust it
in this ungrateful being's heart.

261
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:17,369
For God's sake!

262
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:24,214
Don't say such things.

263
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:43,562
Badshah Khan, we're quits now.

264
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,405
Jailer, Ranvir Singh. The Sun
will set in 5 minutes.

265
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:57,776
And with it will set, the time
limit of 30 days you gave.

266
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:03,048
ln the eyes of the law,
you too will be a criminal.

267
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:09,691
There's still a distance of 5 mins.
between the truth and a lie.

268
01:08:10,763 --> 01:08:15,462
How can 5 minutes bridge a gap,
that wasn't bridged in 30 days?

269
01:08:17,003 --> 01:08:20,962
Aziz Mirza. Badshah Khan is a man.

270
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:24,643
He'll give his life, but
he'll never betray.

271
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:32,348
And, even a moment is enough,
for luck to turn the table!

272
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:51,630
Better remove your pips.
That Pathan has betrayed you.

273
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:21,562
A Pathan has kept his word.

274
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:25,396
Here, sir.

275
01:09:28,574 --> 01:09:33,034
This is called a ''Rakhi''.
My wife has tied it on your wrist.

276
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:37,277
We lndian ladies tie this
on our brother's wrist.

277
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:41,951
- And they protect our marriage
from harm. - Which you have.

278
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:46,087
You've saved a Rajput
from humiliation.

279
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:51,893
What nonsense you talk. That
two-penny worth Pasha...

280
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:57,465
Had he beheaded me, l'd have
come with my head in my hand!

281
01:10:42,915 --> 01:10:48,285
What an illness love is!
No hope of her husband's return.

282
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:51,454
Yet she lights lamps
everyday, and awaits him.

283
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:57,255
She has no sense of day,
or night, the crazy girl.

284
01:11:12,845 --> 01:11:16,110
What news do you have?
When is my Badshah coming?

285
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:21,416
- After 5 years!
- 5 years?

286
01:11:24,223 --> 01:11:27,249
Why? Why? Why not today?

287
01:11:28,728 --> 01:11:32,596
- Why not?
- The lndian law...

288
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:37,596
...has proved him to be a
criminal and sentenced him.

289
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:47,579
Sentenced him?
Punished a lover?

290
01:11:49,782 --> 01:11:53,775
Doesn't lndia have a heart?
Hasn't it heard of Love?

291
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:58,719
l had heard that lndia
is an ocean of love.

292
01:11:59,992 --> 01:12:04,827
Why didn't they think? How can
two lovers live without each other?

293
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:10,225
A thousand days and nights,
without my beloved Badshah?

294
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:15,432
O God! Why did you do this?

295
01:12:16,876 --> 01:12:23,008
Why? Why?

296
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:30,455
Give alms to the poor.
Your sister-in-law is pregnant.

297
01:16:31,063 --> 01:16:34,499
- Your Badshah Khan will be
a father soon. - God's grace.

298
01:17:40,065 --> 01:17:43,125
Have some sweet-meats. Our
jailer is blessed with a child.

299

302

Congratulations!

303
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:08,824

on my daughter's birthday...

304
01:18:09,228 --> 01:18:11,423
...your Benazir has given
birth to another Benazir.

305
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:16,363
- What are you saying?
- lt's true, Badshah.

306
01:18:20,105 --> 01:18:23,563
What have you named my daughter?

307
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:28,278
- Hena. - And do you know
what l've named your daughter?

308
01:18:28,981 --> 01:18:32,576
- How will l know?
- The same name in Hindi.

309
01:18:34,787 --> 01:18:35,811
Mehndi?

310
01:20:22,628 --> 01:20:24,789
Hello! l'm here. How do l look?

311
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:29,900
- Wonderful! Lovely!
- Come with me. - Where?

312
01:20:30,536 --> 01:20:34,802
- To play. - Oh! l can't come.
- You won't come, eh?

313
01:20:35,174 --> 01:20:36,664
l won't listen to you anymore!

314
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:02,032
Jailer Ranvir Singh...
l have your daughter.

315
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:07,904
lf you want to see her alive,
handover Badshah Khan to me.

316
01:21:17,216 --> 01:21:20,310
O Rajput Khan.
You're a funny father!

317
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:25,185
He has kidnapped your child and
you sit here. Order me...

318
01:21:25,857 --> 01:21:28,758
l'll stake my life and bring
Hena darling. l'll bring her.

319
01:21:30,395 --> 01:21:34,729
l can also go and get my daughter.

320
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:40,470
- But l'm held back by my duty.
- What duty are you taking about?

321
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:43,701
Which holds back a father from
saving his own daughter. Tell me.

322
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:51,839
That duty which is expected of
a jailer towards his convict.

323
01:21:53,151 --> 01:21:59,852
That duty which is between 2 pals.
How can l risk my friend's life...

324
01:22:00,192 --> 01:22:03,093
What are you hiding there?
Give it to me. Come on.

325
01:22:13,372 --> 01:22:15,135
They want me, and you...

326
01:22:19,645 --> 01:22:23,809
Okay. Badshah Khan will himself
come to you, you curs!

327
01:22:24,283 --> 01:22:27,343
No! No, Khan.

328
01:22:27,786 --> 01:22:30,755
- l won't let you go.
- What are you saying?

329
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,258
lf l don't go, those fiends
will kill my darling girl.

330
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:40,998
Khan, l'll not agree to
a life for a life.

331
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:46,899
ln 4 days, you'll be a
free man to go back home.

332
01:22:47,673 --> 01:22:52,474
Damn you! lsn't this my home?
This is my home too.

333
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:56,477
Hena is my child too, and,
l'll die willingly for her.

334
01:22:56,915 --> 01:23:01,818
Look Khan... l...

335
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:11,389
l'll not allow you to buy death
for my daughter's life. No!

336
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:25,700
For a friend, you're willing
to sacrifice your daughter?

337
01:23:28,113 --> 01:23:31,640
What do take me for?
What do you think l am?

338
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:35,716
Will l be able to live with
such a huge burden? l'll die!

339
01:23:37,656 --> 01:23:43,219
- Get aside. That child needs me.
- No fuss. l won't let you go.

340
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:47,464
- Get aside. God forbid, but if
something happens, it'll be the end.

341
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:57,232
Forgive me, friend.
Don't get me wrong.

342
01:23:58,677 --> 01:24:00,907
But it's my duty to keep you
within these walls.

343
01:24:02,114 --> 01:24:05,845
And l forget all other relations,
where my duty is concerned.

344
01:24:06,818 --> 01:24:11,278
- Forgive me. - This Pathan too
can forget anything before duty.

345
01:24:13,058 --> 01:24:16,118
Rajput Khan... forgive me.

346
01:24:33,412 --> 01:24:36,939
- Khan Uncle. - My dear girl.
- Hold on, Khan.

347
01:24:37,682 --> 01:24:42,244
You dare! Else before we severe
your head, l'll behead her!

348
01:24:43,889 --> 01:24:46,551
- Save me, Khan Uncle.
- You fiend!

349
01:24:47,726 --> 01:24:50,286
You kidnapped an innocent kid to
seek revenge on me! Shameless!

350
01:24:51,062 --> 01:24:55,192
One has to achieve one's aim
by hook or by crook!

351
01:24:56,001 --> 01:25:00,700
Throw that sword away.
Go on, throw it!

352
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:11,248
Now it'll be a confrontation
on equal terms.

353
01:25:14,186 --> 01:25:17,815
You're unarmed, and so am l!

354
01:25:27,265 --> 01:25:28,994
Pick up the dagger. Go on.

355
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:11,742
- Mercy! Mercy, Pasha.
- Not mercy, Khan.

356
01:26:12,644 --> 01:26:15,670
Your neck! A neck for a neck!

357
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:17,514
Mercy, Pasha, Mercy!

358
01:26:21,353 --> 01:26:24,083
Let my kid go!
Else l'll have your head!

359
01:26:24,723 --> 01:26:27,954
Let the child go!
Let her go, l said!

360
01:26:28,426 --> 01:26:30,826
Leave the girl.

361
01:26:41,172 --> 01:26:44,266
- Nobody move!
- Rajput Khan! You?

362
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:49,845
- Don't worry. l'm here now.
- You see to your daughter.

363
01:26:59,658 --> 01:27:01,091
Save my daughter, Khan.

364
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,860
l will, friend. l swear on God!

365
01:27:19,477 --> 01:27:22,275
- Remember the slap?
- Damn you!

366
01:27:23,682 --> 01:27:29,552
Your wife was right. She's better
off as a widow, than as your wife!

367
01:27:30,322 --> 01:27:34,588
l won't spare you! l'll
kill you, you rascal!

368
01:27:36,595 --> 01:27:39,393
Take a step forward, and
l'll kill this girl.

369
01:27:42,534 --> 01:27:46,095
l've changed my plan.

370
01:27:47,272 --> 01:27:52,574
Now l'll not kill him.

371
01:27:53,578 --> 01:27:56,775
But l'll make him lead
a life worse than death!

372
01:27:57,682 --> 01:28:02,176
Now he'll understand
Pasha's language!

373
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:09,493
Do you plead guilty, or not,
to the crime you're charged with?

374
01:28:21,873 --> 01:28:24,842
''Save my Hena, Khan.
Save my daughter.''

375
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:30,507
Guilty!

376
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:38,186
l killed jailer Rajput Khan.
Yes! l killed him.

377
01:28:42,293 --> 01:28:48,061
After taking into consideration
all the proof and statements made...

378
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,966
...this Court sentences you
for life imprisonment.

379
01:29:23,835 --> 01:29:25,826
My darling girl...

380
01:29:41,653 --> 01:29:42,642
Sister-in-law...
