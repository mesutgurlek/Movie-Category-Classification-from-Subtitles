00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,634
FOR REASONS WE NEEDN'T EXPLORE,
THAT MY PLANS HAVE CHANGED.

156
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:31,400
AS SOON AS I CAN
ARRANGE TRANSPORTATION

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,033
I'LL RETURN WITH THE CHILD
TO NEW YORK CITY.

158
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,300
WHY NEEDN'T WE
EXPLORE YOUR REASONS?

159
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,234
BECAUSE, MR. BULLOCK,
I'VE ALREADY

160
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,934
QUITE SUFFICIENTLY
IMPOSED UPON YOU

161
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,734
MY PRIVATE REASONS
AND FACTS.

162
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:50,300
AS REGARDS TO THE CLAIM MY HUSBAND
PURCHASED BEFORE HIS MURDER,

163
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,601
I'M INCLINED TO ACCEPT
THE LAST BID

164
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,400
FROM MR. SWEARENGEN'S
HAND-PUPPET

165
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,701
AND I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL
IF YOU WOULD TELL MR. FARNUM SO,

166
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,868
AS SPEAKING TO HIM
DIRECTLY MAKES ME ILL.

167
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,467
I'M GONNA ASSAY YOUR CLAIM,
MRS. GARRET.

168
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:06,167
I PROMISED MR. HICKOK,
AND I PROMISED YOU.

169
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,801
I RELEASED YOU FROM YOUR
PROMISE TO ME YESTERDAY.

170
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,267
AND TODAY I INSTRUCT
YOU NOT TO KEEP IT.

171
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,801
YOU DO TEND
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND,

172
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:16,100
AND THE FIRST PROMISE,
YOU WEREN'T A PARTY TO.

173
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:21,234
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE CHILD
INOCULATED? I'LL GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS,

174
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:24,334
AND WE'LL REVISIT
THE WHOLE MESS SUBSEQUENTLY.

175
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,434
DON'T FUCKING LEAD
ELLSWORTH RIGHT TO IT

176
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,033
SO HE CAN HOOT AND HOLLER
AND HAIL FUCKING BULLOCK.

177
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,000
YOU WALK AROUND.

178
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,701
YOU'RE DISCOURAGED.

179
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,934
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT
TO MAKE THE STEEP ASCENT.

180
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:45,434
I START FROM BELOW?

181
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,434
YOU START
AT THE FUCKING CREEK.

182
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,267
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
TO START AT THE CLIFF?

183
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,200
THE THREE OF YOU LEAP THE
FUCK OFF HOLDING HANDS?

184
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,767
TOP O' THE MORNIN'.

185
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,267
I'M TO LEAD YOU
TO THE WIDOW GARRET'S CLAIM.

186
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:05,501
- YOU'RE THE ASSAYER?
- NOPE.

187
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,634
- I'M TO TAKE YOU TO HIM.
- HE'S ONE CLAIM OVER.

188
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,367
<i>NICE FUCKING GUY</i>

189
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,667
AND A DEAD EYE
FOR THE FUCKING COLOR.

190
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,534
- ELLSWORTH.
- ELLSWORTH...

191
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,834
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

192
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,367
WELL, COME ON.

193
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,767
I WAS INOCULATED
SOME TIME AGO,

194
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,834
BUT I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD
BE TREATED BEFORE OUR TRIP.

195
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,968
I AM DELIGHTED
YOU'RE TAKING HER WITH YOU.

196
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:40,033
IT WAS TRIXIE
WHO MADE ME REALIZE

197
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,200
<i>THAT MY REASONS
FOR STAYING WEREN'T SOUND.</i>

198
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,601
GLAD SHE SUCCEEDED
WHERE I FAILED.

199
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,267
I INTEND TO WRITE HER
A NOTE OF PROFOUND THANKS.

200
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,033
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL
DELIVER IT TO HER

201
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,567
AT MR. SWEARENGEN'S
SALOON.

202
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,400
IS THAT WHERE SHE WENT
WHEN SHE LEFT YOU?

203
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,067
YES, I CERTAINLY
ASSUME SO.

204
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,868
SORRY, I'M SORRY, HONEY.
IT'S ALL OVER.

205
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,734
WHEN WILL YOU
BE LEAVIN'?

206
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,167
AS QUICKLY
AS IS PRACTICAL.

207
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,501
STAR'LL SEE TO
YOUR TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS.

208
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,434
SOON AS HE GETS HIS WITS
BACK, I'LL SEND HIM TO YOU.

209
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,200
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

210
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,100
THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

211
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,367
WHAT DID SHE SAY
ABOUT TRIXIE?

212
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,200
NOTHIN'.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,901
HOW'D YOU DO
WITH THAT BLOODSTAIN?

214
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,801
I SCRUBBED IT
REAL HARD.

215
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:51,701
DID I ASK YOU HOW HARD
YOU FUCKING SCRUBBED?

216
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,200
- NO.
- NO.

217
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,567
I ASKED IF
YOU GOT IT OUT.

218
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,834
GET ME THE FUCKIN'
SCRUB BRUSH.

219
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:07,000
EVERY FUCKING THING
I GOTTA DO MYSELF, HUH?

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,734
- WHERE IS SHE?!
- TRIXIE?

221
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,367
NO, QUEEN
FUCKING VICTORIA.

222
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,801
LAST I SAW HER WAS YESTERDAY
WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE YOU.

223
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,901
JUST GET ME
THE FUCKING SCRUB BRUSH.

224
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,300
GIVES HER WORD
SHE'LL RETURN.

225
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,601
WHERE THE FUCK
IS SHE, HUH?

226
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,067
WHAT'D SHE SAY TO YOU
WHEN YOU SAW HER?

227
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,534
SHE SAID HER PUSSY HURT
WHERE YOU GRABBED IT.

228
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,801
THAT HAS A RING
OF FUCKING TRUTH.

229
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,934
SHE SAID YOU
NEARLY KILLED HER.

230
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,968
SHE SAID TO ME
SHE'D BE RIGHT BACK.

231
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,667
A FOOL'S
FUCKING ERRAND, ANYWAY.

232
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,734
I FOUND OUT WHAT
I NEEDED TO KNOW

233
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,300
WHEN I LOOKED IN THAT
COCKSUCKER BULLOCK'S EYES

234
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,167
WHILE DORITY WAS
SPILLING BLOOD

235
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,334
<i>THAT YOU HAVE FAILED
TO ADEQUATELY CLEAN UP.</i>

236
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:51,067
YOU WANT ME
TO DO SOME MORE?

237
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,868
NO, SHUT THE FUCK UP.

238
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,634
NOW, WHAT'S SHE DOIN'?

239
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,567
SHE MAKING A POINT?

240
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,934
NO GRABBING AT THE CUNT?

241
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,901
- IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU?
- NO.

242
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,567
I MEAN, Y-YOU- SHE TOLD YOU,
RIGHT, THAT I GRABBED HER?

243
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,234
DID SHE HAVE
AN ATTITUDE ABOUT IT?

244
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,100
SHE DIDN'T HAVE AN ATTITUDE.
SHE JUST SAID HER PUSSY HURT.

245
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,033
AGH.

246
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,968
POINT'S MADE WITH
THE SNATCH GRABS, OKAY.

247
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:19,334
50 OTHER FUCKING THINGS
I SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO,

248
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,734
ROSIEST PROSPECTS
OF MY CAREER,

249
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:25,100
AND HERE I AM ON
MY FUCKING HANDS AND KNEES

250
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,601
DISCUSSING SNIPPETS
OF INFORMATION WITH A GIMP.

251
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,000
THERE!

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,267
NOW THAT'S HOW YOU SCRUB
A FUCKING BLOODSTAIN!

253
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,100
I COULDN'T
FIND TRIXIE.

254
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,934
YOU SEE HER,

255
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,667
YOU SEND HER
THE FUCK BACK TO ME,

256
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,167
'CAUSE IF I
SEE HER OUTSIDE,

257
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,133
SHE'LL WISH I HAD
KILLED HER BEFORE.

258
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,801
THAT SHOT DIDN'T
HURT TOO BAD, AL,

259
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,567
BUT IT FUCKING ITCHES.

260
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,634
YEAH? GOOD.

261
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,267
YOU HAD YOUR
SHOT YET, KID?

262
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,834
NOT YET. THE LINE
WAS TOO LONG,

263
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,834
AND I DID NOT WANT
TO BE LATE FOR WORK.

264
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,801
OPEN FOR BUSINESS
AND TALK LIKE HIM

265
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,701
<i>- UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTED.
- ( rasps ) YES, SIR.</i>

266
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,467
<i>AW, JESUS.</i>

267
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,234
TRIXIE?

268
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,701
GOD DAMN IT, TRIXIE,
WAKE UP.

269
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,067
<i>- WAKE UP, TRIXIE.
- ( knock on door )</i>

270
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,534
<i>- TRIXIE, WAKE UP-
- A.W.: DOC! DOC!</i>

271
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,367
- WHAT?!
- DOC!

272
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,534
- STAY THE FUCK OVER THERE!
- IT'S A.W., DOC.

273
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:42,100
STAY THE FUCK
OVER THERE, ANYWAY.

274
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,400
AW, I DON'T TAKE YOUR
BAD TEMPER PERSONALLY, DOC.

275
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,834
THE HOURS YOU'RE WORKING
WOULD TRY A SAINT.

276
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,400
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

277
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,701
( panting ) I'M IN PAIN,
DOC, IN THE SMALL OF MY BACK,

278
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:56,100
WHICH I'M AWARE IS
A PRECURSOR SYMPTOM.

279
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,067
- WHEN DID THE PAIN START?
- AM I WARM?

280
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,100
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

281
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,801
WELL, IT'S BECOME MORE
CONCENTRATED AND SEVERE.

282
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,667
- WHY DID YOU STRIKE ME?
- TO SECURE YOUR ATTENTION.

283
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,767
WHEN DID
THE PAIN START?

284
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,767
THE ORIGINAL PAIN I'VE LIVED
WITH FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

285
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,234
BUT IN THIS LAST PERIOD,

286
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:18,968
IT'S BECOME MUCH MORE
CONCENTRATED AND SEVERE.

287
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:21,901
IN VIEWING THE CONTEXT
OF THIS OUTBREAK,

288
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,033
I KNEW I SHOULD
CONSULT YOU.

289
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,934
- OW.
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE A FEVER.

290
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,400
- I DON'T?
- NO.

291
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,934
YOU PUT ON WEIGHT?

292
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:32,801
MAY I ASK THAT
QUERY'S RELEVANCE?

293
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:36,133
IT'S HARDER ON YOUR BACK
AS YOU GET FATTER.

294
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,234
SO, IN CONCERT
WITH THE SYMPTOMS

295
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,200
I'M ALREADY EXHIBITING,

296
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,567
YOU'D SAY BE
ALERT FOR FEVER?

297
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,801
AND WORK HARD
ON YOUR PAPER.

298
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,100
- AND GET YOURSELF
INOCULATED. - UH-HUH.

299
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,834
AND TRY TO EAT LESS.

300
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,934
YOU BOTCHED
THIS JOB PRETTY GOOD,

301
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,567
DIDN'T YOU, YOUNG LADY?

302
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:20,100
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,
IF YOU WANT,

303
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,868
I WILL DO THE JOB
FOR YOU RIGHT.

304
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:26,200
BUT FIRST, I WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT

305
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,133
THAT RICH WOMAN
IS LEAVING TOWN,

306
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,367
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT
SHE WOULD TAKE YOU WITH HER.

307
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,367
I KNOW THAT YOU
THOUGHT ENOUGH OF THAT WOMAN

308
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,734
TO HELP HER
GET OFF THIS... STUFF

309
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:39,601
YOU TRIED TO USE
TO KILL YOURSELF WITH.

310
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:43,167
BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS, IS
IF YOU WANTED TO DIE, PERIOD,

311
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,868
OR 'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T HAVE A WAY OUT OF HERE,

312
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,467
'CAUSE YOU DO
HAVE A WAY OUT.

313
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,801
IS THAT A VOTE
FOR NEW YORK CITY?

314
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,400
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

315
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,968
<i>( door opens )</i>

316
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,234
MORNING,
MR. TOLLIVER.

317
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,033
GOOD MORNING,
FLORA.

318
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,400
I SWEAR I SAW YOU LEAVE
LAST NIGHT AFTER YOUR SHIFT.

319
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,868
I COME BACK.

320
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:18,167
A MAN WAS MURDERED WHERE MY
BROTHER WORKS, AT THE GEM SALOON,

321
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,734
- AND I GOT SCARED.
- YOU SAW IT, HONEY?

322
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:23,767
YES, SIR. I WAS THERE
PICKING MY BROTHER UP.

323
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,801
YOU'RE BRAVE TO EVEN BE
IN A JOINT LIKE THAT.

324
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
AND AFTER,

325
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,434
YOU SOUGHT REFUGE
WITH JOANIE, DID YOU?

326
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,701
- YES, SIR.
- NO BETTER PORT IN A STORM.

327
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,100
- ANYWAYS, I'LL GO CHANGE.
- GOOD GIRL. GOOD FOR YOU.

328
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:48,434
- YOU SETTLE IN REAL GOOD, FLORA.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

329
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,868
MM-MMM,
JOANIE STUBBS.

330
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,601
IS THAT A FRESH SCALP
I SEE HANGING FROM YOUR BELT?

331
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,167
SHE SAW A GUTTING
LAST NIGHT.

332
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,267
SHE WAS UPSET.
I HELD HER.

333
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:06,267
<i>Terrance: I WAS WATCHING
FOR YOU AT THE DOOR, FLORA,</i>

334
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:08,901
BUT HERE YOU ARE
ALREADY INSIDE.

335
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,534
NOT WORKING YET,
TERRANCE.

336
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,434
POOR THING.

337
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:15,567
ADJUSTING SO SMOOTH
TO LOSING HER CHERRY

338
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,334
AND YET THAT UPSET
BY BLOOD.

339
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:21,267
SHE LOST HER CHERRY
BACK HOME. I TOLD YOU THAT.

340
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:22,934
GONNA PUT YOUR
GARTERS ON NOW?

341
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,801
I'LL GIVE YOU $2 FOR THAT
APPLE AND A PIECE OF CHEESE.

342
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,667
IT'S MY KNIFE.
YOU WANT TO BUY THAT?

343
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,901
I'VE GOT
A FUCKING KNIFE.

344
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,667
I'LL JUST BE A SECOND AND
TAKE MY BROTHER HIS LUNCH.

345
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,133
SURE, HONEY.

346
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:11,167
UNLESS SHE AIN'T
UPSET AT ALL.

347
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,033
WHAT HAPPENED NOW,
FLORA?

348
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:28,634
I THOUGHT YOU WAS CHANGIN'
INTO YOUR GARTERS.

349
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:30,501
YOU GEEK-LOOKING FUCK.

350
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:33,467
GET AWAY FROM ME BEFORE
I CUT YOUR FUCKING HEART OUT.

351
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,901
<i>( knocks )
IT'S DR. COCHRAN.</i>

352
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,067
DOCTOR.

353
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,367
TRIXIE TRIED TO COMMIT
SUICIDE WITH LAUDANUM.

354
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:05,000
<i>- MY GOD.
- SHE PUNCTURED HER VEIN.</i>

355
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,834
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WHY SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

356
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,267
WHO'S WITH HER?

357
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:24,300
NO ONE AT THE GODDAMN MOMENT
IS WITH HER, MRS. GARRET.

358
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,934
HER SITUATION IN THIS CAMP ISN'T
SUCH THAT THAT WOULD BE SAFE.

359
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,033
WHICH IS WHY, WHILE
TRYING TO DISSUADE HER

360
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,434
FROM FUTURE EFFORTS
AT MURDERING HERSELF,

361
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:36,701
I TOLD A FIB,

362
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:39,834
INVOKING YOUR NAME
AND WILLINGNESS

363
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,834
TO TAKE HER WITH YOU
ON YOUR TRIP.

364
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:44,934
LAST NIGHT, DOCTOR,

365
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,000
I MADE THAT
VERY OFFER TO TRIXIE.

366
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,501
SHE REFUSED.

367
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,567
MORE PRECISELY,

368
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,934
I OFFERED TO SEND
TRIXIE TO NEW YORK

369
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,634
WITH THE CHILD
TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE

370
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:01,334
INTRODUCTIONS
TO MY FAMILY,

371
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,968
AND TO PAY
TO SEE THEM ESTABLISHED.

372
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,434
IS IT POSSIBLE,
MRS. GARRET,

373
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:10,167
THAT LEAVING THIS CAMP
AND HEADING TO NEW YORK CITY

374
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:13,467
IN SERVICE TO YOU
AND THE CHILD MIGHT,

375
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:18,133
TO A GIRL LIKE TRIXIE, APPEAR
A MORE REALISTIC PROPOSITION

376
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:22,567
<i>THAN BEING DISPATCHED
ON SOME CRUEL MASQUERADE?</i>

377
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:30,267
PLEASE TELL HER
SHE'S WELCOME.

378
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:33,300
TELL HER SHE'S NECESSARY.

379
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,067
IF HER INDISPOSITION
DOESN'T PRECLUDE IT,

380
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,100
I'D BE HAPPY
TO TELL HER MYSELF.

381
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,434
THANK YOU, MADAM.

382
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,467
IF I'M TO GET
MY THROAT CUT, DAN,

383
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:25,601
I'D RATHER NOT
EXERT MYSELF FURTHER.

384
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:29,033
IF I HAVE ANY CHOICE
IN THE MATTER,

385
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,601
I'D PREFER ONE
BEHIND THE EAR.

386
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,133
KEEP CLIMBING,
ELLSWORTH.

387
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,200
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR SEEING
THAT NEW YORK DUDE'S ACCIDENT.

388
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,434
WHEN SWEARENGEN
WAS MOVED TO TRUST,

389
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,601
I KNOW YOU SPOKE
FOR ME HARD.

390
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,834
WELL, I DIDN'T-
DIDN'T SPEAK AGAINST YOU.

391
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:51,834
YOU MIGHT TRY TAKIN'
A GANDER OVER TO YOUR RIGHT.

392
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,767
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHERE TO FUCKING LOOK.

393
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,601
IF YOU'RE
THE GODDAMN ASSAYER,

394
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:59,868
<i>SHOULDN'T I BE
FOLLOWING YOU?</i>

395
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,400
HEAD ON BACK DOWN,
MR. BULLOCK.

396
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,234
WE THINK WE FOUND
A FORMATION WORTH LOOKING AT.

397
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,601
YOUNG LADY,
THANK CHRIST.

398
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:21,167
I'D FEARED AFTER
THE MURDER YOU'D SHUN US.

399
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,534
I COME FOR LUNCH
WITH MILES.

400
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,868
WELL, BLESS YOU THEN
FOR BEING A CARING SISTER.

401
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:27,067
- MILES!
- SIR?

402
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,300
<i>MILES, YOU LUCKY SON OF A BITCH,
YOUR SISTER'S HERE WITH YOUR LUNCH.</i>

403
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,968
SHE BROUGHT YOU
A FRESH APPLE

404
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,334
AND SOME KIND OF DELICACY
WRAPPED IN SWADDLING.

405
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:40,467
I'VE BEEN SCRUBBING THAT BLOODSTAIN
ALL MORNIN', AND THE CRIPPLE HAS TOO.

406
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:44,067
SITUATE YOUR SISTER TO SPARE HER
TO STAND AT THAT FUCKING STAIN, HUH?

407
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,133
- LET'S DO IT.
- NOW?

408
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,767
- NOW, AND GET THE FUCK
OUTTA HERE. - WHAT IF-

409
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,801
FLORA, IF WE DO IT
SLOW AND RIGHT,

410
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:02,133
- WE'RE 50 MILES GONE BEFORE ANYONE KNOWS WE BLEW.
- MY BOSS IS ONTO ME.

411
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,100
SAVVY OPERATOR FROM CHICAGO AND
YOU COULD TELL HE'S ON TO YOU?

412
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,834
SAVVY ENOUGH THAT
HE DIDN'T CRACK,

413
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,467
AND I STILL
COULD FUCKING TELL.

414
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,834
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. YOU
WANT TO DO IT FAST AND DIRTY

415
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,601
SO YOU HAVE TO CUT
SOMEBODY'S THROAT.

416
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:30,033
- THIS JOINT YOU WANT TO TAKE?
- WHERE I WORK.

417
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:33,167
- WHERE YOUR BOSS IS ONTO YOU?
- I CAN MOVE THE DYKE.

418
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,868
HELD ME IN HER ARMS ALL NIGHT
LIKE I WAS A LITTLE FUCKING KID.

419
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,601
CAN I ASSUME THERE'S
A FUCKING PLAN?

420
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,300
MR. BULLOCK, WHAT HO?

421
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,834
MRS. GARRET'S ROOM.

422
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,634
NUMBER TWO.

423
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,267
DON'T SELL,
MRS. GARRET.

424
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:38,133
DARLING...

425
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:41,868
UM, I'M GOING
TO BE UNSPEAKABLY RUDE

426
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:43,934
AND LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE
FOR JUST A MOMENT,

427
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,934
WHILE I GO DOWNSTAIRS
WITH MR. BULLOCK,

428
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,434
WHO'S JUST ARRIVED
WITH THE MOST INTERESTING NEWS,

429
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:50,767
<i>AND WHOM I- I CAN'T
RECEIVE HERE IN MY ROOM,</i>

<i>PARTICULARLY
WITH YOU PRESENT,</i>

431
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:55,434
FOR REASONS TOO BORING
AND COMPLEX TO EXPLAIN.

432
00:29:55,434 --> 00:30:00,100
SO I'M GOING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
TO SPEAK WITH MR. BULLOCK

433
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
IN MR. FARNUM'S
ABSURD RESTAURANT,

434
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,734
THEN I'LL
COME BACK UP

435
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,667
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO READY
OUR LEAVING. ALL RIGHT, DARLING?

436
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,100
I'LL BE IN THE RESTAURANT
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT.

437
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,667
CAN I BRING YOU
A GLASS OF MILK?

438
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,133
ALL RIGHT.

439
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,300
I'LL- I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

440
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:34,234
MAY I INQUIRE
AS TO THE ASSAY'S OUTCOME?

441
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,934
- ASK THE OWNER.
- MRS. GARRET?

442
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,701
IS THE TECHNICAL TERM
"BONANZA"?

443
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,267
THAT'S THE LOOK OF IT.

444
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:42,868
IT'S A BONANZA,
MR. FARNUM.

445
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,067
I SEE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

446

447
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,400
DOES THE FIND CHANGE YOUR MIND
AT ALL ABOUT NEW YORK CITY?

448
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:03,033
I CAN'T SEE
WHY IT WOULD.

449
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,767
I CAN'T, EITHER,
BUT I DON'T COUNT.

450
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,501
OF COURSE YOU COUNT.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU?

451
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:12,033
'CAUSE YOUR CHANGES OF MIND
COME SO QUICK AND OFTEN,

452
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:13,434
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

453
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:16,334
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
CHANGED YOUR MIND FROM YESTERDAY

454
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,100
WHEN IT WAS MADE UP
TO STAY.

455
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:22,167
I WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND
LAST NIGHT THAT MY REASONS

456
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:25,100
FOR WANTING TO STAY HAVE
BEEN COMPLETELY SELFISH.

457
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,501
- BY WHO?
- TRIXIE.

458
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:31,334
I'D OFFERED TO SEND HER TO
NEW YORK CITY WITH THE CHILD,

459
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,634
WHERE TRIXIE, I'VE SINCE
COME TO REALIZE,

460
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:36,234
WOULD BE COMPLETELY
UNSUITED.

461
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:40,634
AND BECAUSE I WISHED
TO STAY HERE UNENCUMBERED

462
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:45,000
WHEN I SHOULD BE
CARING FOR THE CHILD.

463
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,934
WHY CAN'T YOU
CARE FOR HER HERE?

464
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,901
WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?

465
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:55,000
<i>SAID HE WAS GONNA GO TELL
THE WIDOW OF HER FIND.</i>

466
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,334
HOW THE FUCK LONG
DOES IT TAKE TO TELL HER?

467
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,567
I DON'T KNOW, AL,
I'M HERE WITH YOU.

468
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:02,000
- WHAT, ARE YOU GETTING SMART WITH ME NOW?
- NO.

469
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,934
COCKSUCKER BULLOCK.

470
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,934
WHEN YOU CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF HIM,

471
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,300
HE'S NOWHERE
BUT UNDERFOOT.

472
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,868
SIR, MY SISTER
WAS TOLD OF A MAN

473
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:14,501
WHO RESEMBLES OUR FATHER'S
PHOTOGRAPH DOWN BY LEAD,

474
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,434
<i>AND I'D BE GRATEFUL
IF THIS AFTERNOON</i>

475
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,400
I COULD GO LOOK AND MAYBE I COULD
TAKE A NIGHT SHIFT TO MAKE UP.

476
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,968
IF I SAID NO,

477
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:24,367
I'D HOPE YOU'D WALK OUT
AND GO LOOKING ANYWAY,

478
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:27,334
THEN SEEK A NEW JOB
ELSEWHERE AFTER.

479
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,734
THAT IS
WHAT I'D DO, SIR.

480
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:32,400
ALL RIGHT, KID.
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

481
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,501
TELL ARNETTE
AT THE LIVERY STABLE

482
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,701
I'LL STAND METAL
FOR THE HORSE.

483
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,968
IF YOUR SISTER LOOKS WITH YOU,
TELL ARNETTE I'M GOOD FOR HER MOUNT.

484
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,400
SO YOU THINK IT'S
A GOOD IDEA TO GO?

485
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,534
IT'S WHY THE FUCK
YOU'RE HERE, ISN'T IT?

486
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:47,400
RIGHT.

487
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,033
I'M GONNA GO GET
THE HORSES THEN.

488
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,000
PERMISSION TO LEAVE
THE BAR, TROOPER.

489
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,000
THANKS, TO BOTH OF YOU.

490
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,267
AH, STRUCK RICH
FOR THE WIDOW, HUH, BULLOCK?

491
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:07,667
FREE DRINK!

492
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,267
BIG, HUH?

493
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,133
RICH AND FUCKING THICK,
THAT VEIN IS?

494
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:22,767
- NOT BEING EXPERT, I CAN'T GUESS AT THE EXTENT.
- DAN'S A FUCKING EXPERT.

495
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,133
WHEN HE'S NOT SHIT-FACED DRUNK,
SO IS ELLSWORTH.

496
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,501
THE IMMEDIATE RESULT
IS SHE WON'T BE SELLIN'.

497
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:29,534
OF COURSE,
SHE FUCKING WON'T.

498
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,868
I SHOULD FUCKING
THINK NOT, HUH?

499
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:34,100
NOT FOR ANY $20,000
AT LEAST.

500
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,367
COME HERE. COME DRINK
WITH YOUR VANQUISHED FOE.

501
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,033
<i>Al: VERY GOOD OF YOU AND
MR. STAR, INCIDENTALLY,</i>

502
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:48,467
TO MAKE YOUR VENUE AVAILABLE SO
THE HOOPLE HEADS CAN GET VACCINATED.

503
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,100
I WAS THE SECOND
HOOPLE HEAD STUCK.

504
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,467
THEM RIDERS THAT
BROUGHT THE VACCINE,

505
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:56,033
SAY THE HEATHENS HAVE BEEN
CALLED BACK TO THE AGENCY.

506
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,367
- IN A SPASM OF GOOD SENSE, THEY'RE FUCKING GOING.
- I HEARD.

507
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:04,634
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'LL HAVE
LAWS HERE AND EVERY OTHER THING.

508
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:07,667
YEAH, WHICH BRINGS ME, BULLOCK,
TO THE MATTER OF THE WIDOW.

509
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:12,033
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
MY BONA FIDES FOR COOPERATION.

510
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,934
IF A TREATY IS SIGNED,
BE WISE FOR YOU AND ME

511
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,634
TO PADDLE
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

512
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:21,067
TICS OR HABITS OF BEHAVIOR EITHER
FINDS DISLIKABLE IN THE OTHER

513
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:23,567
GOTTA BE OVERLOOKED
OR TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

514
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:27,100
WOULD YOUR BONA FIDES EXTEND
TO MRS. GARRET'S FUTURE SAFETY?

515
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,467
MY OATH ON THIS:

516
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:36,100
EVERY DAY THAT THE WIDOW SITS
ON HER ASS IN NEW YORK CITY,

517
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,400
LOOKS WEST AT SUNSET
AND THINKS TO HERSELF,

518
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,167
"GOD BLESS YOU IGNORANT
COCKSUCKERS IN DEADWOOD,

519
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,400
WHO STRIVE MIGHTILY
AND AT LITTLE MONEY

520
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,033
TO ADD TO MY
EVER-INCREASING FORTUNE,"

521
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,334
SHE'LL BE SAFE FROM THE
WILES OF AL SWEARENGEN.

522
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,767
SHE'S STAYIN'.

523
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,367
THE OATH STANDS
AS A GESTURE TO YOU.

524
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,334
- CAN I TAKE A SHAVE OVER HERE?
- PLEASE.

525
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:09,000
BARNEY, BE CAREFUL IN THE
AREA OF THE THROAT, HUH?

526
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:15,033
IF YOU AUTHORIZED AN OFFER
OF 20 ON THE WIDOW'S CLAIM...

527
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,567
YOUR AGENT WAS LOOKING
TO SKIM A LITTLE CREAM.

528
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,167
- HOW HIGH DID E.B. GO?
- $19,500.

529
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:27,133
I WOULDN'T TRUST A MAN THAT
WOULDN'T TRY TO STEAL A LITTLE.

530
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:42,234
WHERE'S THAT
FUCKING WHORE?

531
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,467
YOU STAY HERE,
SWEETHEART.

532
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:20,067
I'M SO VERY SORRY...

533
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,634
FOR ANY PART THAT
I MAY HAVE PLAYED IN THIS.

534
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,400
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU BEING THE ONE

535
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,234
THAT MADE ME A WHORE,
MRS. GARRET.

536
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:36,067
I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE
CAMP WITH THE CHILD, TRIXIE.

537
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:40,734
DR. COCHRAN EXPLAINED
TO ME THE DIFFICULTIES

538
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,901
<i>YOUR EXTRAORDINARY
KINDNESS TOWARD ME</i>

539
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,234
<i>HAS PUT YOU IN, IN
RELATIONSHIP TO MR. SWEARENGEN.</i>

540
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:46,934
<i>IF YOU WISH TO STAY,</i>

541
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:50,467
<i>I'D BE SO GRATEFUL
IF YOU'D STAY WITH US.</i>

542
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:57,467
BUT PERHAPS YOU
WANT TO GO, TRIXIE.

543
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,634
IF YOU DO...

544
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,067
TAKE THIS.

545
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,400
AS YOUR EARNEST CLAIM
ON THE FUTURE.

546
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,934
I'LL SEND YOU MORE.

547
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,400
<i>I APPEAR TO HAVE
STRUCK IT RICH.</i>

548
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,000
I'LL SEND YOU
ALL THAT YOU NEED.

549
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,901
<i>Girl:
TRIXIE?</i>

550
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,000
TRIXIE?

551
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,634
HELLO, SWEETHEART.

552
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:33,234
<i>( whispers )
DON'T I LOOK TIRED?</i>

553
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:35,334
SOPHIA.

554
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,667
SOPHIA.

555
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,667
SOPHIA.

556
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,634
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

557
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,100
I SHOULD'VE GUESSED IT.

558
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,868
TAKE HER HOME,
MRS. GARRET.

559
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,501
HOW DO YOU TAKE
MY SUGGESTION?

560
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,067
ARE YOU SURE
THAT GOLD'S REAL?

561
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:13,133
ABSOLUTELY.

562
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,467
UH, LET ME THINK
THINGS THROUGH.

563
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,400
ALL RIGHT.

564
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,634
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

565
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:42,133
<i>- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- ELIZABETH.</i>

566
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:48,467
- I'M QUITTIN'.
- ALL RIGHT, FLORA.

567
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:51,567
I LEFT A PIN UP IN YOUR
ROOM. I WANNA GO LOOK FOR IT.

568
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,100
GO AHEAD AND LOOK.

569
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,334
WHEN DOES THE PART COME
WHEN THAT LITTLE PIECE OF TRIM

570
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,100
<i>FINALLY GETS INTO
HER WORKING CLOTHES</i>

571
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,167
<i>AND STARTS MAKING US
SOME FUCKING MONEY?</i>

572
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,234
SHE'S QUITTING, CY.

573
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,300
SHE'S QUITTING?

574
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,167
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE YOUR ROOM
SHE'S WALKING INTO YET AGAIN.

575
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,200
SHE LOST A PIN...
UP THERE.

576
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:20,534
A PIN?

577
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,901
CAN YOU TELL THE STONES
FROM THE PASTE?

578
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,501
SHOW ME
WHICH IS WHICH.

579
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

580
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:59,734
- LET ME TAKE IT.
- GET OUTTA HERE, FLORA.

581
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:03,334
PUT DOWN MY THINGS AND I'LL LET
YOU GET OUT WITHOUT RAISING HELL.

582
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,701
WHY DON'T LET ME
GO WITH YOUR THINGS

583
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:07,834
AND SHUT YOUR
FUCKING MOUTH?

584
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:10,968
BECAUSE I REMIND YOU OF WHOEVER
THE FUCK I REMIND YOU OF.

585
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:13,467
NO.

586
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:17,067
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
FLORA, KILL ME?

587
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,901
- MAYBE.
- DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE?

588
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,601
I'LL GIVE IT
A GODDAMN WHIRL.

589
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:26,701
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET OUT ALIVE.

590
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,100
YOU'RE GONNA DIE HERE.

591
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,734
WHO AM I?

592
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,367
YOUR LITTLE BABY?

593
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,667
YOUR LITTLE SISTER?

594
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,033
YOU?

595
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,534
I WOULDN'T MOVE THIS.

596
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,901
- DID YOU FIND YOUR PIN?
- I DID, SIR.

597
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,734
JOANIE TELLS ME
YOU'RE LEAVING US.

598
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,067
CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE, SIR.

599
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,000
DECIDED I WASN'T
CUT OUT FOR IT.

600
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,567
MY BROTHER TOO.

601
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,634
DECIDED HE WASN'T
CUT OUT FOR WHAT?

602
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:24,334
SWEEPING UP
AT THE GEM SALOON.

603
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,033

I SEE.

604
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:31,167
MY FIRST TAKE ON YOUR MEANING
WAS THEY WERE FUCKING YOUR BROTHER

605
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,734

A MAN AND SHOWING HER RULES!

<i>AND FOR BEING THE CUNT

- DON'T HURT HER?

664
00:45:15,934 --> 00:45:18,200
YOU MEAN
BEFORE I KILL HER?

665
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,234
YES.

666
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,467
LISTEN TO THAT, FLORA.
THAT'S THE PERSON YOU ROBBED,

FUCKING PITIFUL.

673

677
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:15,868
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO
WILL BE A MISTAKE.

678
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:19,467
YOU KEEP DRAWING BREATH

I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THE CARDS GO COLD.

683
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:50,100
FAR AS THE EVENTS
AT THE BELLA UNION,

684

<i>BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
IT WAS TWO YOUNG THIEVES,</i>

YOUR DICK
HAD YOU FOOLED.

690
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,701
AND IN THAT STATE
OF ADDLEMENT,

00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,167
YOU MISTOOK HER PURPOSE,
HER SO-CALLED BROTHER'S

AND THEIR ENTIRE
FUCKING COCKEYED STORY.

693
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:14,767
YOU DID DO EVERYTHING
YOU COULD, DIDN'T YOU, E.B.?

694
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,501
YOU WENT TO THE LIMIT
ON OUR OFFER.

695
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,734
- EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
- YOU DID GO TO THE LIMIT?

696
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,334
WELL, I WENT
TO THE LIMIT'S PRECIPICE.

697
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:23,868
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DIDN'T
GO TO THE LIMIT.

698
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:26,767
AL, I HELD BACK
A FEW DOLLARS,

699
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:28,901
AGAINST SOME
FINAL UNFORESEEN TURN.

700
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:30,834
SO WE'LL NEVER

DON'T WANT TO BE SUCKIN'
HIND TIT ON DISPOSAL FEES.

705
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:14,267
DON'T THINK I ENJOYED
THAT BULLSHIT, JOANIE.

706
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:17,734
CERTAIN THINGS YOU...

707
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:19,634
HAVE TO DO TO IMPRESS
UPON PEOPLE

708
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:21,801
WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO
DO. DO YOU LIKE IT? NO.

709
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:23,968
DO YOU ENJOY IT? NO.

710
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:27,801
<i>DO YOU HAVE TO
LOOK LIKE YOU DO? YES.</i>

711
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:31,834

712
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:33,467
GOTTA LET HIM KNOW.

713

CAPRA'S DOWNSTAIRS,
GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.

714
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:40,734
WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ROB YOU,
JOANIE, YOU GOTTA GET ROUGH.

715
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:42,767
IF IT LOOKS LIKE AN ACT,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

716
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:50,534
AND THEN
I GRAB YOUR HAND...

717
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:54,234
AND I THINK, "MY GOD,
THIS POOR FUCKING GIRL."

718
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:59,367
BUT I DID WHAT I HAD
TO DO IN THAT ROOM.

719
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,100
AND NOW I'M OUT HERE.

720
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,000
I'M TELLING YOU,

721
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,501
YOUR HAPPINESS
IS IMPORTANT TO ME,

722
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,467
AND WHATEVER
THE FUCK I GOTTA DO,

723
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:12,000
IF YOU'RE TOO MUCH
IN MY SHADOW,

724
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,634
IF I MAKE THINGS TOO TOUGH
ON YOU, THEN WE'LL STOP IT.

725
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:18,200
- WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ELSE.
- CY.

726
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,701
YOU BRING WARMTH
INTO MY LIFE.

727
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:27,234
I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU
UNHAPPY LIKE THIS.

728
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,534
I WANT...

729
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,734
TO SET YOU UP
IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS HERE.

730
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,501
<i>INDEPENDENT FUCKING OPERATOR.
I'LL PUT UP THE MONEY.</i>

731
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:41,701
<i>ANY KIND OF INTEREST
IN RETURN, THAT'S FINE,</i>

732
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:45,100
BUT THAT AIN'T WHAT THIS IS
ABOUT. IT'LL BE YOUR PLACE.

733
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,334
I WANT YOU TO FEEL
WHEN I WALK IN THERE

734
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,801
THAT YOU CAN SAY, "I'M
BUSY, CY. COME BACK LATER."

735
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:52,267
I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME
TURN AROUND WHEN YOU SAY THAT

736
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:55,000
LIKE I'M SOME RUBE TRICK
WITH MY CHIN DOWN ON THE FLOOR,

737
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,033
"WHEN SHOULD I TRY
YOU AGAIN, JOANIE?"

738
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,667
"I'LL LET YOU KNOW, CY."

739
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:01,000
THAT'S HOW I WANT
YOU TO FEEL.

740
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,868
I USED TO MAKE YOU WARM,
DIDN'T I, CY?

741
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:07,400
AND I COULD MAKE YOU FEEL
LIKE SOMETHING'S FUNNY.

742
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
YOU STILL DO, HONEY.

743
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,434
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY,
YOU STILL DO.

744
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:16,868
KILL ME TOO, CY,

745
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,767
OR LET ME GO.

746
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:24,200
I UNDERSTOOD MYSELF
TO BE SAYIN', JOANIE,

747
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,334
I WANT TO FIND A WAY TO
GIVE YOU A LOOSER REIN.

748
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:29,200
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MEAN IT.

749
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,033
IF YOU DON'T KILL ME
OR LET ME GO,

750
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,767
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

751
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:54,501
HAS HE GOT YOU AT YOUR HANDS AND
KNEES AT 2:00 IN THE FUCKING MORNING?

752
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:57,234
I GOT MYSELF AT
MY HANDS AND KNEES,

753
00:51:57,234 --> 00:51:59,567
WONDERING WHAT
BECAME OF YOU.

754
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,367
WAKE UP, DAVID.

755
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,734
