1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,127
- Previously on Wynonna Earp.
- We need to find out why Bobo

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:05,863
- showed up at the homestead.
- Memories, they're coming back.

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,532
Four days until the door opens.

4
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,200
Bobo's throwing a party tonight.

5
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,935
The whole town was invited. Damn!

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,604
Black Badge needs you. I need you.

7
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:15,272
So Bobo's gonna try again,

8
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,141
cross the Ghost River
Triangle with the heir.

9
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:19,723
We gotta stop all these people
from drinking the champagne now!

10
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,945
One lucky contestant will
receive the antidote.

11
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:24,715
Not good! All they have to do is

12
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,884
- bring me Ms. Wynonna Earp.
- (people screaming)

13
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,886
- Willa!
- Do you remember me now?

14
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,888
(Willa): Yes, Robert.

15
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,489
(people screaming)

16
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,291
It can't be true! How could
he have poisoned the whole town?!

17
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:37,594
- The champagne!
- (man): We need her!

18
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,400
- Everybody, just stay calm!
- We give this Bobo fella

19
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,402
- exactly what he wants.
- (man): What he wants

20
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:48,105
- is our resident bitch!
- Not now, Alan!

21
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,775
- You left!
- Why, I came back.

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,244
- Yeah? Did you miss me?
- I never miss.

23
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,313
- (gunshot)
- Doc!

24
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:57,789
You can't shoot them. I hate them and

25
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,346
they hate me, but they're still humans.

26
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,585
Hey, listen, we
gotta get you out of here.

27
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:03,295
I hope my sisters made it out OK.

28
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,489
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- No, I'll find them.

29
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:08,425
You get something that
will turn the townspeople

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,361
from rabid, drugged-up
assholes back into regular assholes!

31
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:13,163
- Get her!
- I'm sorry about this.

32
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:14,531
- For what?
- Me too.

33
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,467
What?! AAARGH!

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,101
(body crash in snow)

35
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:20,037
- Antidote?
- Weapons.

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,073
Angry townspeople. I
like where this is headed.

37
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,776
One, two, three, go!

38
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:31,014
Ready?

39
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,152
Let me just look at you for a second.

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,122
Oh, you are so beautiful.

41
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:42,893
I wasn't sure you'd remember.

42
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,429
It all came flooding
back the second I stepped

43
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,631
in the treehouse.

44
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:49,733
"O ye of little faith."

45
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,803
But I make up for it in other areas.

46
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,048
They'll be plenty of
time for that out there.

47
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:09,186
(grandiose music)

48
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:22,399
It's working. It's actually working.

49
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,735
You are the true heir,

50
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,770
and the best damn thing I ever...

51
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:28,438
(Bobo moaning and coughing)

52
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:30,140
- I'm fine.
- Are you OK?

53
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,076
- (Bobo screaming in pain)
- Robert! Robert.

54
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,646
Back! Take me back!

55
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,015
(grunting and gasping)

56
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,990
I don't understand.

57
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,026
The prophecy,

58
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,494
"The Willing Heir on the Winter Solstice

59
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,429
with the Revenant of their Choosing..."

60
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:53,931
Peacemaker.

61
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:57,100
The heir ain't the heir without the gun.

62
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,136
I have it.

63
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,438
Bobo, I have it. Look.

64
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,640
That's not Peacemaker.

65
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:06,610
No. No.

66
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,312
Waverly!

67
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:10,280
Where is your sister, pretty lady?

68
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:12,916
Come on, Waverly. We just wanna talk!

69
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,985
Forget talking. Where's Wynonna?

70
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,690
Bullshit, they do.

71
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,733
(Waverly screaming)

79
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:53,254
I had Peacemaker in my hot little hand.

80
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:56,927
- I was so close!
- Alright. Just concentrate, baby.

81
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,962
If Wynonna took Peacemaker,

82
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:01,865
- she knows we're together.
- There's no way.

83
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,034
I've given her no reason to suspect me.

84
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,070
- She's smart.
- She's a sucker.

85
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:09,106
And Waverly is useless.

86
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,842
- She's intuitive.
- What is this?

87
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,611
Talk-about-how-great-my-
goddamn-sisters-are day?

88
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,381
It's the one day a year this
thing's supposed to work!

89
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:20,017
What are we gonna do?

90
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,119
What are we gonna do?

91
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:25,088
OK. That's OK.

92
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,126
We have until sundown tomorrow.

93
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,094
I'll go get Peacemaker.

94
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,963
You hole up in our place.

95
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:35,966
We bolt, and everyone else dies.

96
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,636
You are one sick little
puppy, you know that?

97
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,371
And you're all mine.

98
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,041
Maybe we have time for a quickie.

99
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,275
OK.

100
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,611
You screw me, and then
we screw this town.

101
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:54,618
You go get that gun

102
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,620
and we'll do both.

103
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:58,722
Go.

104
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,095
We get a sample of the
poison that Bobo used,

105
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,297
and maybe Black Badge can
reverse engineer a cure.

106
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,130
There's a whole whack
of it in the basement.

107
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,496
And you know this how?

108
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,336
'Cause I was there
when Bobo's guy made it.

109
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:15,072
- (woman coughing)
- Shh! Hear something?

110
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,574
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

111
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,457
I doubt this building's up
to code. You could burn

112
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,145
- the building down.
- This coming from the lawman

113
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,520
packing enough heat

114
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,782
to firebomb Texas.

115
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,885
- You got any dynamite in there?
- No.

116
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,156
- Snookered yet again.
- Hey.

117
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,792
Look, we gave
Wynonna a lick and a promise

118
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,794
that we wouldn't take out any townsfolk,

119
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:40,330
but a drugged-up mob is
not our only problem.

120
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,333
- Where are the revenants?
- Oh, I doubt they're having tea

121
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,436
- at the trailer park.
- You never know.

122
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,306
We all have our vices.

123
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,608
I think it's time

124
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,543
we talked about yours.

125
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,679
It's not what you
think. It's just medicine.

126
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,248
Now see, that one I have heard before.

127
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:00,150
I am a doctor.

128
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,552
Look, I've taken this since I was a kid.

129
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,956
It helps keep me alive and
some parts of me dead.

130
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,124
(footsteps)

131
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,859
Have you seen what's going on out there?

132
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:10,794
The whole town's gone 5150!

133
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:13,563
Whatever you've got planned, I'm game.

134
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:16,433
Hey, this is classified.

135
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,503
Purgatory's overrun by demon revenants,

136
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,005
a. k. a. Wyatt
Earp's resurrected outlaws.

137
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:24,441
Bobo Del Rey is their
leader. I am Doc Holliday.

138
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,510
Yes, that Doc Holliday.

139
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,879
And Dolls here, he is just a dick.

140
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,315
Finally! Thank you.

141
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,384
It... Actually, It makes perfect sense.

142
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,487
Except for the last part.

143
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:39,956
Hmm.

144
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,160
You still in?

145
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,362
Like Flynn.

146
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,732
- What do you need?
- OK. Find the Earp girls.

147
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:50,834
See if Nedley's still vertical.

148
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,970
We've got an antidote to steal, people.

149
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,740
And, Agent Haught,

150
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,110
welcome to the Black Badge Division.

151
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,551
Willa!

152
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,553
Waverly!

153
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,822
Oh-oh-oh-ow!

154
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,024
Shitty shoes!

155
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:16,293
Waverly!

156
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,628
(Wynonna groaning with effort)

157
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,999
Guys!

158
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,272
(man groaning)

159
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:31,441
Now there's a sight for sore eyes.

160
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:33,844
(Wynonna grunting)

161
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,786
Pete.

162
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,955
You remembered my name this time!

163
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:47,023
It's not all I remember.

164
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,394
I remember, in
kindergarten, you couldn't tie

165
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,430
your shoes, so I wore

166
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,765
Velcro sneakers in solidarity.

167
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,934
- (Pete grunting)
- I remember, in high school...

168
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,338
You know what I
remember? How you broke my heart

169
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,740
and slept with my brother,

170
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,610
made fun of my mama's diabetes!

171
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,311
Yeah, I was messed up.

172
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:10,513
- But I'm not that person anymore.
- No,

173
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,549
you're just wrong.

174
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:15,318
Still wrong, and that Bobo guy knows it.

175
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,156
You're a cancer on this town.

176
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,659
A cancer that needs to be cut out.

177
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:25,095
And I need that antidote.

178
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:26,630
- Ah!
- Ugh!

179
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:28,331
You're sick,

180
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:31,101
but I can make you
better. I can stop Bobo.

181
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,536
I don't want to hurt you.

182
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,872
- Ugh! Ugh!
- OK.

183
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,874
See, I don't have that problem.

184
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,043
Willa! Oh, my God!

185
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:43,880
Oh, fighting off the local boys

186
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,782
in your underwear? Boy, you did grow up.

187
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:47,851
- What happened to you?!
- I got separated

188
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,886
from Waves. There
was clawing and kicking

189
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,854
and some well-chosen cuss words,

190
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,125
and then, next thing I
know, it was me and an empty...

191
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:58,061
Wynonna, where's Peacemaker?

192
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:04,287
Peacemaker was in the
purse at the party.

193
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,274
You saw it, I saw
it. Now gone, vanished.

194
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,643
- So you lost it?
- No. Someone took it.

195
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:10,612
Well then, we're really fff...

196
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:13,548
Phone. My cell died, but maybe Pete's...

197
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:16,384
- (Wynonna grunting)
- Why aren't you

198
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,919
- more freaked out?
- Well, 'cause

199
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,188
I can't dial the phone and throw a fit.

200
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:23,792
Awww, he saved
Waverly's number under "Cuties."

201
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,760
Could a revenant have nabbed it?

202
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:28,163
No. It fries 'em if they touch it.

203
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,931
She's not answering.

204
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,000
- Hey!
- Look, I know you're worried

205
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,603
about Waverly, but Bobo
has something up his sleeve.

206
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,872
I mean, he's psychic
electric "Koolaided"

207
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,874
all of those meatsticks!

208
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,942
Finding Peacemaker needs
to be our priority.

209
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,444
Aren't you?

210
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,247
- What?
- Worried about Waverly?

211
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,915
Of course.

212
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:52,187
Why are you bothering with that?

213
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,189
Just shoot him and be done with it.

214
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,825
Pete's a dumb dude, but
he's not a revenant.

215
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,594
None of them are. I
can't just kill them.

216
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:02,330
- Would you?
- Sometimes, being an Earp means

217
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,799
making tough decisions to survive.

218
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,768
For the greater good.

219
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:09,204
Yeah, well, if there's one thing
I've learned this year,

220
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,172
it's that good is a moving target.

221
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:14,242
(phone ringing)

222
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:17,245
I don't think that
thing's rung for 15 years.

223
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:27,055
Hello. Woman-you-currently-
want-to-kill. Please be Waverly.

224
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:30,058
No. But I've got her!

225
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,727
Where are my manners?
This is Chrissy Nedley!

226
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,997
- What do you mean, you got her?
- I found her

227
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,832
and I chloroformed
her and I tied her up.

228
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:40,802
All by myself! Can you come and get her?

229
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,704
- Yes.
- And bring your head

230
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:45,507
so I can chop it off to get the
antidote for me and my dad.

231
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,476
I'm at his office. Bye!

232
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,245
- Chrissy, wait!
- (dial tone)

233
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,414
Shit!

234
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,383
Change of plans. Super-fun-
times Earp family reunion.

235
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,137
Wait. I'm just
wondering, shouldn't we go and get...

236
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,386
Peacemaker is just a gun!

237
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,589
Waverly is Waverly.

238
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,224
And Chrissy sounded like
she's sniffed enough glue

239
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:06,161
to bankrupt a model airplane
factory. I'm not waiting to get her.

240
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:09,064
And neither are you. She's our sister.

241
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,701
As long as I get to kick someone's ass.

242
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:15,270
That can be arranged.

243
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,839
(Bobo grunting)

244
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,945
Jesus Christ!

245
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:26,915
Right initials, wrong fella. Robert,

246
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:29,384
- you don't want to do this.
- Oh, but I do.

247
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,553
I must be close to actually doing it

248
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,989
for you to be here. Let me ask you,

249
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:35,991
why negotiate with a demon

250
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:37,959
instead of pleading with the human?

251
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:39,961
She's too far gone.

252
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,797
- Whatever Willa once was...
- She's so much more.

253
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:45,400
Besides,

254
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,603
what are you gonna do
about it? Tell on me?

255
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,873
If the heir

256
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:54,576
crosses the boundary

257
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:57,579
with Peacemaker on this
day with hate in her heart,

258
00:11:57,612 --> 00:12:00,115
there won't be anybody left to tell.

259
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:03,451
You know why Willa and I fell in love?

260
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,321
- Slim pickings at the hostage hut?
- No.

261
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,657
Because the Earp curse's
brought us both nothing but pain.

262
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,592
You brought your pain on yourself.

263
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,594
You have no right to be
here. You're not allowed

264
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,696
to interfere, remember?

265
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,898
So step aside, old man.

266
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:24,139
I can save her.

267
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,875
If we get out there,

268
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,344
I can save us both.

269
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:31,346
Save her.

270
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,481
♪ ♪

271
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,323
Chrissy, don't make me break

272
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:44,125
that skinny little neck of yours!

273
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,628
- Wynonna.
- (woman moaning)

274
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,664
- God!
- My dad...

275
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,567
Daddy's out there
somewhere. And my friends!

276
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,536
I'm the only one who
can save them, Chrissy.

277
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,405
- Hey!
- OW! Who the hell are you?!

278
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,507
Another Earp.

279
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,210
- Oh, shit.
- Chrissy!

280
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,612
- Shit!
- (Waverly moaning, muffled)

281
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:06,481
Waverly!

282
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:10,418
Hi. Let's see.

283
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:12,220
Ah!

284
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:13,888
- There.
- You came.

285
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:16,725
Of course.

286
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:19,260
- Is Chrissy... Is... Argh!
- OK.

287
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:22,163
- Is Chrissy OK?
- Shake it off, sis. We have

288
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,499
- to get back to the Wainwright.
- What? What? Why?

289
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:26,434
We have to find Peacemaker.

290
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,214
You took it from me?

291
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:42,183
You?

292
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:43,985
Wynonna!

293
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,092
You OK, baby girl?

294
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,260
OK then.

295
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:03,304
I think Waverly ingested the poison.

296
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:05,907
- Did not!
- She's acting erratically.

297
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,610
Because I took Peacemaker away from you?

298
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:10,645
- Why?
- I saw something

299
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:13,047
in Willa's eyes at the
place where Bobo held her.

300
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,583
- What are you saying?
- I don't think

301
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:18,186
the Willa that came back is our Willa.

302
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:20,421
What I am is the goddamn

303
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:23,091
Earp heir, and I'm running
out of goddamn time!

304
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:25,560
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

305
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,089
Nobody's getting hurt on my watch.

306
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,597
Nobody else, you mean. Daddy, me,

307
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,066
everyone else out there. When are you

308
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,669
Gonna take responsibility
for all that you've done?!

309
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,139
Why did Bobo save you

310
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,876
at the homestead? Why did you save him?

311
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,245
(ringtone)

312
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,114
Hey, I knew I recognized that ringtone.

313
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:48,316
Whoa!

314
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:49,450
OK. OK.

315
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,753
Give me Peacemaker or I punch

316
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,955
a bunch of holes in
Waverly's girlfriend.

317
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,456
"Girlfriend"?

318
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,059
- Um, kind of.
- Kind of?

319
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,795
- I know you won't shoot.
- What do I care

320
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,665
- about some ginger butch cop?
- Wynonna, she'll do it.

321
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:05,900
- Waverly...

Please. I love her.

OK. OK!

- Now you know

333

what it feels like when
people take your things.

334

- Come here.
- I want...

I know, I know.

No blood.

337
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,102
- There's no blood!
- Shh-shh.

338
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,171
If my sister joined the dark side,

339
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:02,073
and you've been a
revenant this whole time,

340

It's kind of
standard operating procedure

344

- She shot my girlfriend!

360
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,097
Now, if we can just undo
it, we can get her back.

364

or alive, I think he said.

Oh, right. You guys.

Come on! You sure you don't want to

You don't go to war with a borrowed gun.

369

- I think they think

370
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,725
they are while he gets away scot-free.

371

Let Waverly go, and you can have me.

- Nedley. You seem

really saying something.

377

This is quite the pickle you
got yourself into, Wynonna.

You know me.

You have been a plague on this town,

380
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,089
destroyed a lot of lives

381

at getting out of this mess.

00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,563
me for the antidote?

485
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:00,332
I just want answers.

486
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:03,568
- Oh?
- Robert Svane.

487
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,103
Svane,

488
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,938
Norwegian for swan.

489
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:10,008
You never cease to impress me, Waverly.

490
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,011
And look at you now.

491
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:16,181
All grown up.

492
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:18,617
- Where's Willa?
- Your sister's not here.

493
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,553
But she's coming, isn't she?

494
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,822
- She's your lead.
- (amused exclamation by Bobo)

495
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:25,357
Bingo.

496
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,293
The thing is, if you open that door,

497
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:31,029
you're not the only
thing that can leave.

498
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:32,998
All the other revenants will flee.

499
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,133
You're letting... you're
letting filthy demons

500
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:38,170
- loose into this world!
- I am one of those demons.

501
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,839
- Oh, I know.
- They're not the only ones

502
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:43,141
who'll be set free.

503
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,310
Wyatt Earp's has been
dead and in the dark

504
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,345
for 80 years. Maybe it's time

505
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,314
for the rest of us to
step into the light.

506
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:51,216
Including you.

507
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,453
Is this how you did it with Willa?

508
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,989
Talked and coerced

509
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:01,159
and seduced a 13-year-old girl?

510
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:03,495
I never lay a finger on her.

511
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:05,497
You were her captor!

512
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,233
I was her saviour! Those
other revenants wanted

513
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,768
to do horrible things to her.

514
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,003
I told them I killed her.

515
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:14,139
I hid her away.

516
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:17,042
Here.

517
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,950
Sounds like one sick fairy tale.

518
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,219
It wasn't always like this.

519
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:28,854
After Clootie stole her

520
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:30,722
away from me,

521
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,225
I did go

522
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:35,193
a little crazy.

523
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:38,330
But days before she was due to turn 27,

524
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:40,832
Constance erases her memory...

525
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:45,136
and says

526
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,572
she will only give me back Willa

527
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,875
if I help her put
back together her boys.

528
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,610
The bones.

529
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,511
I rallied an army together

530
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:56,581
to dig in the dirt.

531
00:25:56,615 --> 00:25:59,184
And I dug,

532
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,853
and I dug, and I dug.

533
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:06,191
Do you know why?

534
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,102
Swans mate for life.

535
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:20,138
Please.

536
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,641
Please, let her go.

537
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,477
Have you been listening to me?

538
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:29,714
I used to watch you girls,

539
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:32,817
and I'd wonder how a man

540
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:36,021
like Ward Earp ended
up with so much goodness.

541
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,790
And then there was the baby.

542
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:42,027
And I used to think
about saving her too.

543
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:45,664
Only I wasn't the heir.

544
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:48,366
Ohhh,

545
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,402
Waverly.

546
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,676
You're not even an Earp.

547
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,911
(Willa): Robert?

548
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,448
You need to hide.

549
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,884
Now. Get behind that bed.

550
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:12,524
- (door opening)
- Hey.

551
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:16,328
- I got it.
- Yeah?

552
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,296
Little snitch Waverly took it.

553
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,131
We have to go, now.

554
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:21,900
Come on.

555
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:26,104
(door slamming shut)

556
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,142
Come on, Doc, spit it out.

557
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:33,478
- Spit what out?
- You know,

558
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:36,081
the rousing old-timey speech
that's gonna make me believe

559
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,116
I can take on my own sister.

560
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:40,552
Come on. WWWD.

561
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:43,388
What Would Wyatt Do?

562
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:45,824
(Doc clears his throat)

563
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:48,393
I once had a dog the name of Plucky.

564
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,496
Your big pep talk is "Plucky"?

565
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,665
She was a gorgeous black
and tan coonhound,

566
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:55,633
but she only had one ear.

567
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,869
Even so, she would run from miles

568
00:27:57,902 --> 00:27:59,838
when she heard me calling.

569
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:03,675
She got bit by something in the
woods, and she went rabid.

570
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,744
Wyatt, he offered

571
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:08,346
to put her down, but

572
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,415
I knew it had to be me.

573
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,519
Old Yeller might owe you some royalties.

574
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:17,389
I am sorry about your sister.

575
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,791
I never was a great judge of character.

576
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,027
Always ended up dating the drummer.

577
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,129
I mean we could run.

578
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:28,266
We could get a little
house in the country,

579
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,635
raise chickens, grow barley.

580
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,771
Is that why you came back?

581
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,806
To be a farmer?

582
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:38,743
No, I returned because a peculiar fellow

583
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:40,712
insisted you needed my help.

584
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,148
Was he a farmer?

585
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,150
He was a mechanic.

586
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:49,721
Willa's got Peacemaker.

587
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:52,457
Bobo's got telekinetic powers.

588
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,958
What do we got?

589
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,361
Things that go boom.

590
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,231
She's better than me, Doc.

591
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,467
Faster.

592
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:05,270
I don't think I can beat her.

593
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:08,406
But you are still gonna try.

594
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,443
- I have to.
- Careful, Earp.

595
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,478
Doing what's right

596
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:16,247
even in the face of ridiculous odds?

597
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,250
You are beginning to sound like a hero.

598
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:24,923
No matter what happens, Willa

599
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:27,425
is not a dog.

600
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,627
I'm not putting her down.

601
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:32,664
Let's hope she still comes

602
00:29:32,697 --> 00:29:34,833
when you call.

603
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,170
Ah...

604
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:42,173
R&D approximates 36 hours

until an antidote.

606
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:46,611
Meanwhile, we're
monitoring and have handed out

607
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:48,413
antipsychotics to about

608
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:51,449
- 80% of the town.
- In every report you've filed

609
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:55,019
you didn't once think to
mention there could be two Earp heirs?

00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,827
If we survive this, expect us to start

613
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:05,388
- being a little more hands on.
- From day one, I've been

614
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,158
following my orders,
to make sure the revenants

615
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,633
do not leave the Ghost River Triangle.

616
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,602
We have new orders.

617
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:12,637
If this Bobo Del Rey can open a gateway,

618
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,606
we observe what happens when he does.

619
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,375
And what happens next is
that people die. My people,

anyone else these
demons come into contact with.

621

There are other forces at play here.

622
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,082
We are not to interfere.
If you can't handle that,

00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,797
Go on.

651
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,469
Willa.

652
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:28,139
♪ ♪

653
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,375
(gunshot)

654
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,143
Respect your elders, bitch!

655
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:34,979
Wake up and remember
who the hell you are!

656
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:38,283
- You're Willa Earp!
- And the rightful heir!

657
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:40,985
Then you should know that what
you're doing is hella dumb!

658
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:42,620
No! Wait! Willa!

659
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,555
I'm serious, stop!

660
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,932
What did you do?

661
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:57,268
What I had to!

662
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,441
(supernatural howling)

663
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,843
OK, so what the hell was that?

664
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,885
I did it!

665
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:17,055
I am the lead! Hahaha!

666
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:19,324
The prison gates are open!

667
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:26,397
Willa, we can still stop this.

668
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,599
Stop this?!

669
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,835
This is better than I planned.

670
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,870
Bobo and I get out,

671
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,572
and Purgatory burns!

672
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:36,741
They hate us, Wynonna.

673
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:39,110
They're evil. They deserve that thing!

674
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,047
(Bobo screaming)

675
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,383
I doubt your lover's gonna make it.

676
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:48,753
- So, I go it alone.
- No, you're not alone. You have me.

677
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:55,665
Willa, either make it
stop or I'll stop you.

678
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:59,001
(Bobo): Wilaaa!

679
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:00,670
Funny, that it would go down here.

680
00:34:00,703 --> 00:34:02,972
Mom used to bring us here.

681
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:05,942
When she couldn't take
any more of Dad's fists.

682
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:19,655
We have to get
Peacemaker back over the line,

683
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,625
and then we can start
over. Just you and me.

684
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,961
Bobo doesn't know,

685
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:26,963
but he's not the only
one that came to visit me

686
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:28,965
in that treehouse

687
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:31,067
making promises in the dark.

688
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,036
What kind of promises?

689
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,239
That death can be a mercy.

690
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:39,041
I know you don't believe me,

691
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:42,078
but I'm doing this for you.

692
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:45,081
No more Purgatory, no more Earps,

693
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:47,249
no more curse.

694
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:57,426
- Not me.
- Well, who then?

695
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,830
- The old one.
- (thumping)

696
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:05,434
- (strange screaming)
- I'm faster than you.

697
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:07,703
You're my sister.

698
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,105
I promise this will be quick.

699
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:11,907
- You know you can't.
- You keep saying that.

700
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:14,506
(dramatic music)

701
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,316
Squeak.

702
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,222
- (Click)
- (Wynonna gasps)

703
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,258
- (Click)
- Willa.

704
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,461
- What happened?
- You went wrong.

705
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,631
(gunshot)

706
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,804
Did you get a clean shot?

707
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:43,839
That wasn't a clean shot.

708
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:48,210
(creature roaring)

709
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,681
See, Wynonna?

710
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:57,620
You can never really go home again.

711
00:35:57,653 --> 00:36:00,322
- (creature roaring)
- (Willa screaming)

712
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,331
- Wynonna!
- (Creature roaring)

713
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:11,367
(Willa screaming)

714
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,644
Make your peace.

715
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:32,088
(roaring)

716
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:42,731
(epic music)

717
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,380
(gasping)

718
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,088
- (crows cawing)
- (touching piano music)

719
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:28,725
Do it.

720
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,696
Do it.

721
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:34,798
I'm already in hell.

722
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,434
Did you love her, Robert?

723
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:39,603
Did you?

724
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,405
We'll take it from here, Deputy.

725
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,492
- What are you...?
- Taking him to a black site.

726
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,763
- Extraordinary rendition.
- Outside of the Triangle?

727
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:51,047
Wynonna! Don't let them do this!

728
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,486
Please! Shoot me!

729
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:54,596
- Shoot!
- I can't end the curse

730
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:56,601
unless I send every
single revenant back to Hell!

731
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:59,832
Be nice, and in a few months,
we might send him back to you.

732
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,969
You can dispatch whatever is
left of his quivering mass.

733
00:38:05,471 --> 00:38:07,807
- Dolls?
- He defied

734
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,510
a direct order from his
superiors. That's treason.

735
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:13,746
- He's a good man.
- He's a good liar.

736
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,416
You don't give a shit what he did.

737
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:18,451
This is personal for you.

738
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,186
Hahaha!

739
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:22,321
You are in no position to interfere.

740
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,524
What with your history.

741
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:26,993
The Bleaker case? So I pulled

742
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:29,629
- a few B&Es in the day.
- No, Wynonna.

743
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,498
We know what you did.

744
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,505
(Lucado sighs)

745
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:42,108
Did you get the town coordinates?

746
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:44,577
When we're out of range,
tell control to go in hot.

747
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,712
Tomahawks, the whole she-bang.

748
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:53,019
Boom.

749
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:06,666
You did aces, Wynonna.

750
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:09,635
Careful now. We all know how good

751
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:12,171
- you are with that thing.
- Who are you?

752
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:14,540
No revenant. See?

753
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:18,010
I'm outside the Ghost River Triangle.

754
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:20,079
There are things out there, too.

755
00:39:20,113 --> 00:39:22,248
Things that want to get in.

756
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:24,584
- Why?
- The Triangle is not only

757
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:27,820
a prison. It's also a sanctuary.

758
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:31,424
- For who?
- Not a who.

759
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:33,526
A what.

760
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,895
(sound of truck approaching)

761
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:39,398
Listen.

762
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:41,801
You know who I am?

763
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,970
I'm the goddamn Earp heir.

764
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,972
I got work to do.

765
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:47,974
Good luck, Wynonna.

766
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,409
We'll be watching you.

767
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:53,045
Super.

768
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,522
What did you do?

769
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:13,166
We're almost over the line now.

770
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,369
(Bobo laughing)

771
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,943

under a poplar tree.

The year she was taken, it
got felled by lightning.

791
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:29,175
Spring comes, I'm gonna plant a new one.

792
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:32,144
For the girl she was.

793

For my Willa.

794

(Doc): Well, that'll be lovely.

795
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:38,217
But first, I'm gonna kill

796
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,253
every single revenant from the Rockies

797
00:41:40,286 --> 00:41:42,255
to the big city.

798
00:41:42,288 --> 00:41:44,624
And then I'm gonna stop that
thing from getting in here.

799
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:46,592
And the deputy marshal?

800
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:49,929
Are we gonna go get him?

801
00:41:49,962 --> 00:41:53,065
He's in a maximum
security black ops prison,

802
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,967
and he shot my sister.

803
00:41:56,235 --> 00:41:58,638
Damn straight we're gonna go get him.

804
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,485
(sound of thunder growling)

805
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:14,920
What do you think that is?

806
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:16,822
I don't know yet.

807
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:18,758
(Doc): Well, it's coming.

808
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,793
Mm-hmm.

809
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,895
So am I.

810
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,866
(happy sigh)

811
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:31,170
- You ready?
- Sweetheart,

812
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:33,139
I'm ready for anything.
