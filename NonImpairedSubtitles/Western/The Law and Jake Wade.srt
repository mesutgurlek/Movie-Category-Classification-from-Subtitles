1
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't turn around.
Keep your hands to your side.

2
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
I'll move with you
while you get those keys off the desk.

3
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Come on, move.

4
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
All right. Now, open that center cell.

5
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
What if I don't?

6
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,600
If you don't, I'll kill you,
take your keys and open it myself.

7
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah, I guess you could.

8
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Well, who would have thought?

9
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Now, don't dawdle, Fred.

10
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I know this man,
he gets kind of jumpy in a crisis.

11
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,800
- How far do you think you'll get, Clint?
- I'm not gonna ask you once more, mister.

12
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes, sir, who would've thought?

13
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Turn around.

14
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Now, Fred, about them runny eggs
you been giving me for breakfast...

15
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,400
Sure couldn't have picked a worse time
to come walking in, could they?

16
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Hope I haven't woke the whole town.

17
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
That's enough shooting for today.

18
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Mind if I get down and stretch?

19
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Help yourself.

20
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,200
You living somewhere around here
these days, Jake?

21
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Nope.

22
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Then how'd you know
about my little predicament?

23
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I was just riding through, heard about it.

24
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
- Lucky for me.
- Yeah, isn't it?

25
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Hyah.

26
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Well, there they go.

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How come you didn't
let them hang me, Jake?

28
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,800
You think we got time
to talk this all out now, Clint?

29
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, just the same, I think you'd have been
way ahead if you let them hang me.

30
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Although I won't pretend
I was looking forward to it too much.

31
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Yeah.

32
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,400
When I was the one they wanted to hang,
I got downright resentful.

33
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Well, this is where I leave you.

34
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, which way you heading, Jake?

35
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Maybe we could ride together a ways.

36
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Not a chance, Clint.

37
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,200
Hey, you know,
this is a real nice, little horse.

38
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
- Gonna take it with you?
- The horse is yours.

39
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
No kidding?

40
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Well, thanks, Jake. Thanks very much.

41
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,600
That's real generous of you.

42
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course, I don't suppose...

43
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,800
I don't suppose even you'd suggest
that he's worth anything like...

44
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
...oh, say $20,000?

45
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I didn't keep that money, Clint.

46
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
You didn't?
Well, what did you do with it?

47
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Give it to some deserving family?

48
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
I buried it. And after I did,
I never went back there again.

49
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
As far as I know, it's still there.

50
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Now, that seems a peculiar thing
for you to do, Jake.

51
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Whatever come over you
to do a thing like that?

52
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
- You wouldn't understand, Clint.
- I might.

53
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I kind of doubt it, but I might.

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I guess you figure
this squares us up, huh?

55
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
You pulled me out
of exactly the same spot one time...

56
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
...now I've done it for you.

57
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
To me, one cancels the other.

58
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
But if you don't feel that way about it...

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
You know, you could save yourself
a lot of sleepless nights...

60
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,400
...if you just tossed me a gun
and we had this out right here and now.

61
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Not a chance.

62
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
What's the difference
whether it's now or later?

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
A lot of difference, Clint.

64
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
In the first place, I don't think
it has to be now or later or anytime.

65
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,200
But if it does,
I'll pick the time and the place myself.

66
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Uh-uh.

67
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
No, you won't, Jake.

68
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't try to follow me, Clint.

69
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,800
If you remember,
I'm pretty good with one of these.

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

71
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
But you're not as good as me.

72
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Just...

73
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just pretty good.

74
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,000
Glad to see you back, Jake.

75
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
- Hi, Jake.
- Hello, Luke.

76
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

77
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,400
- Hi, Avery.
- Hi, Jake.

78
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
- Get all your business attended to?
- Yeah, sure did.

79
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Anything important happen
while I was gone?

80
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, nothing much around here.

81
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,600
But did you hear
what happened to Clint Hollister?

82
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
No. What about him?

83
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
You knew he'd been tried for murder
and convicted at Morganville.

84
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Some of his gang broke him out.
Shot up a couple of men pretty bad.

85
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
- How bad?
- Well, they're gonna live.

86
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
- Haven't caught him yet?
- No, and they ain't gonna.

87
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
He's probably five states away
by this time.

88
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
The old town
wasn't the same without you.

89
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Well, it's always nice to be missed.
Thanks, Avery.

90
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
Say, what happened
to that little gelding of yours?

91
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
The one you took with you.

92
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Oh, I sold him to a fellow.

93
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
Oh. See you later.

94
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
You wanna get caught up on this?

95
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
No, that can wait till tomorrow.

96
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Do you mind hanging around a while longer?
I'll relieve you early tonight.

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Why, sure.

98
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Say hello to Peggy for me.

99
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Who's the young fellow
holding up the post?

100
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,000
Just a kid who drifted in yesterday
looking for a job on one of the ranches.

101
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll say one thing for him,
he's not looking very hard.

102
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
- See you later, Jake.
- Right.

103
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, the rig I rented from the livery stable.

104
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
The suit's mine.

105
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm overwhelmed.

106
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
But what's the reason for all this elegance?
You've already proposed.

107
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
And I'm glad I accepted.

108
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
- Dinner ready?
- Mm-hm. Ready and getting cold.

109
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
Where's your uncle?

110
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Oh, he had to go into town
late this afternoon for some supplies.

111
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
How come every time I come out here...

112
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
...that's the day he has to go into town
for supplies?

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, I hope you don't think
it's easy to arrange.

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Jake.

115
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
Peggy, did you find it a big wrench...

116
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,200
...when you pulled up stakes
in Philadelphia to come out here?

117
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,000
No, not nearly as much
as I thought it would be.

118
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Why?

119
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Suppose the same thing
might apply again?

120
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
I mean, if we suddenly left here
and moved on further west?

121
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
If we left here?

122
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, why should we, Jake?

123
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
We've built a real place for ourselves,
both of us.

124
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,800
The job you've done
as marshal here in the last year...

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
...why, it can lead to anything.

126
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
We could do the same thing
somewhere else.

127
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes, we could, but, well, why should we?

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
We're here and we've already done it.

129
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Don't you have any curiosity
about what it's like further west?

130
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000
No.

131
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
And I don't think basically you do either.

132
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh, Jake, you're not a drifter.
You love it here.

133
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
You couldn't have fooled everyone
about that.

134
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
No, and I wouldn't have anyway.

135
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
Well, then why do you want to leave?

136
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,600
Supposing it wasn't
that I wanted to leave...

137
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,400
...but that I felt
it might be better for both of us...

138
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
...to get a fresh start somewhere else.

139
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Well, then I'd say
that since this concerns me so much...

140
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
...I should know why
so that I can judge for myself.

141
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
And if I couldn't tell you?

142
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Then I'd say
you were asking an awful lot.

143
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
All right, I'm asking a lot.

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Jake, I never asked you
anything about your past life...

145
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,400
...because I didn't care about anything
that happened before we met each other.

146
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,600
But what you're asking me to accept
on faith now concerns our future.

147
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,200
And I just can't be casual and haphazard
about a thing like that.

148
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,200
All right, forget I said anything about it.

149
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Forget it?

150
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Oh, Peggy.

151
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,600
Peggy.

152
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm sorry, Jake.

153
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I know.

154
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,400
It's just that the way you talked,
it sounded as if you'd already decided.

155
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
That's not true. You're only guessing
when you talk like that.

156
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, what else am I to do but guess
when you won't tell me anything?

157
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Oh, Jake, can't you tell me?

158
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
No, Peggy, I can't. Not yet.

159
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
All right.

160
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
Well, when you can, you let me know.

161
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
- Marshal Wade?
- Yeah.

162
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
I've been kind of waiting
for you to get back to town.

163
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Is that so?

164
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I've been trying to find
a job around here.

165
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Al, the bartender
over at the Mint Saloon...

166
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
...said that you might be able
to steer me on to something.

167
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
- Where you from?
- Kansas.

168
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Well, I sure haven't got anything for you.

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
I can give you a letter
to somebody who might have.

170
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
If you don't mind hard work.

171
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Well, I ain't exactly crazy about it...

172
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
...but I can see the necessity for it.

173
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Pretty neat, Jake. Hold it.

174
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,400
Better drop your gun belt, Jake.

175
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,400
How you been, Ortero?

176
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,800
No complaints. How about you, Jake?

177
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Now, don't go blaming your deputy
too much for me having this gun, Jake.

178
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Who'd have thought a fat, sloppy drunk
lying in the gutter...

179
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
...would have a pistol hidden in his boot?

180
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Hello, Jake.

181
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Put him in the chair.

182
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
How do you feel?

183
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
How do you think?

184
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I can remember a time when all you'd have
done for a clout like that was scratch it.

185
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
How'd you stay so close behind me?

186
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,400
I backtracked a dozen times.
I'd have sworn I wasn't being followed.

187
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
You wasn't.

188
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
How'd you find me?

189
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,200
Easy.

190
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
When you left me,
I joined up with the boys...

191
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
...we turned loose
that nice, little horse you gave me...

192
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
...followed him home.

193
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,000
We've been here since early yesterday
while you was doing your backtracking.

194
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
And I must say, Jake,
it was worth the whole trip...

195
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
...just to find out
that you're the marshal here.

196
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
- Hi, Wexler.
- Don't talk to me, Jake.

197
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Wexler, my boy,
how many times have I told you...

198
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
...if you let your hate get the upper hand,
it'll throw your timing off.

199
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
What was it
we used to try to tell him, Jake?

200
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Something there we used to say...
Oh, yeah.

201
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeah, we used to say:

202
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
"Wexler, you go ahead and kill
anybody you want to, it's a free country.

203
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,600
If you do it with hate in your heart...

204
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
...you'll end up with nothing
but an upset stomach."

205
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't think he ever understood
what we was talking about, do you, Jake?

206
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What you got in mind, Clint?
What are your plans for me?

207
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm gonna kill you.

208
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
But not for a while, so you don't
have to try nothing desperate just yet.

209
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Let go of me! Take your hands off me! Oh!

210
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
She didn't wanna come along, Clint.

211
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Persuading somebody
don't usually take you so long, kid.

212
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,800
Some old man
came out of her house with a shotgun.

213
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It took me time
to work around behind him.

214
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
What did you do to him?

215
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
What do you care?
You his lodge brother?

216
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,400
- Jake, what is all this?
- Oh, say, Clint.

217
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,400
She was a little slow getting dressed,
so we had to help her along a little bit...

218
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
...on account of she was so slow.

219
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,400
- That's enough. That's enough.
- I'll kill him if he tries it.

220
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
You know why we're taking her along,
don't you...?

221
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,200
- I just know you're not going to.
- Oh, but we have to.

222
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
See, if you know something
might happen to her...

223
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,200
...if you try to play it too smart, then maybe
you'll take us right to the money...

224
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
...instead of leading us
all around the hills for days and days.

225
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
Just let her stay here.
I promise to take you wherever...

226
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh, come on, Jake,
you know better than to try that with me.

227
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
We'd better not hang around here
too long, Clint.

228
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,600
Is that a fact, Burke?

229
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,800
Is she gonna ride in that getup?

230
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
No, I grabbed some of her stuff.

231
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
All right, let's go.

232
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,000
- Jake, don't let them. Please, Jake.
- Now, listen, miss.

233
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You'd better get it through your head
we ain't playing games.

234
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,400
You three ride out of town ahead of us,
we'll meet you at the camp.

235
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Jake, I think it'll look better
if you ride out of town alone.

236
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
We'll see you at the end of the street.

237
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Wait a minute.

238
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,200
What makes you think he's gonna ride
to the end of the street and wait for us?

239
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,200
Wexler, Jake's in love.

240
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
He'll play along with us.

241
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Won't you, Jake?

242
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
All right, get moving.

243
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Hey, Jake.

244
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
Jake.

245
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
You wanna hear something funny?

246
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,000
- Yeah.
- You know that little gelding...

247
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
...you said you sold to somebody?
- Yeah.

248
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Well, I was going past Ed Hurley's place,
and you know something?

249
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,000
I thought I saw that gelding in his corral.

250
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,600
You know something?
I know you saw him.

251
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,400
- Evening.
- Evening.

252
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,200
All right, Jake, let's go.

253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
Yup.

254
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,600
I was afraid that when you
changed out of that dress...

255
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
...maybe you wouldn't look too good.

256
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,000
But even in them old things, you're
about the best-Iooking gal I've ever seen.

257
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Say, was you really gonna marry
that Jake guy?

258
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
Why?

259
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,200
Because maybe I'm kind of interested...

260
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,400
...in why girls
do some of the crazy things they do.

261
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,000
You see, I never had
a whole lot to do with girls.

262
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,400
I wonder why.

263
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,800
Because my old man thought
he was a preacher, that's why.

264
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,400
And because he used to whale
the daylights out of me...

265
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,800
...if he even saw me look at a girl,
or a girl look at me.

266
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,600
Your father was a preacher?

267
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Kind of a phony evangelist.

268
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,400
I tell you, he was about the meanest man
I ever met in my life.

269
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He just naturally would like to beat up
on anything that was smaller than him.

270
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,000
And of course, he could always say
he was beating the fear of God into you.

271
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Well, where is he now?

272
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,600
Well, I hope I know where he is.

273
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,800
You see,
he was the first man I ever killed.

274
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,800
Hey, Burke,
you'd better cook up more stuff.

275
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Some of the other guys are coming.

276
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Yes, master.

277
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Any trouble, Clint?

278
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No.

279
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Get him something to eat.

280
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
And tie his hands behind him.

281
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
From now on, he stays tied.

282
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
Why don't you just leave him to me?

283
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Sonny, I can see we ain't gonna
have you round long enough...

284
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,800
...to get tired of your company.

285
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
He ain't that tough.

286
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,000
He ain't, huh?

287
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, let's put it this way.

288
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's just say because I'm getting old
and hearing noises in the night...

289
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,000
...would you mind
tying him up for my sake? Hmm?

290
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,200
I see the kid didn't waste much time
getting your clothes changed.

291
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,600
Well, now, Burke, what tasty little dish have
you cooked up for breakfast this morning?

292
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,200
Take a stretch, Jake.

293
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,000
I told you,
there's no use fighting them ropes.

294
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,400
If I'm showing strain, it's from hanging on
to that horse for eight hours with my knees.

295
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,800
No kidding. Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

296
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,400
I did it once for a whole week.

297
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,400
They caught me up in the Dakotas.

298
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Rode me clear back to Kansas. Heh.

299
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,400
All that way just for a stage holdup.

300
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Of course,
I busted loose before we got there.

301
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,400
Killed one deputy with a rock.

302
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Killed the other one with a rifle.

303
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Maybe something like that
will happen to you, Jake.

304
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Mm.

305
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Trouble is, you got one problem
that I was never saddled with.

306
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
The girl.

307
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, it just goes to show...

308
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
...no matter how pleasant they are
to have around...

309
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,200
...a woman does slow a man up.

310
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,800
But then so does a busted leg.

311
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
How much further
are we going today, Clint?

312
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,400
Well, that depends on how much further
we got to go altogether, Jake.

313
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You know, you haven't been exactly what
I'd call explicit about where this place is.

314
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,400
You haven't satisfied me about what
happens to her after I do take you there.

315
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,400
It's what's gonna happen to her
if you don't take me there.

316
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,000
And as you know,
I ain't a great one for patiently waiting.

317
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I don't want you to think
I'm rushing you into anything, Jake.

318
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
You just think it over.

319
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,600
You've got a little time left.

320
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Boost him up.

321
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Now, come on, miss, cheer up.

322
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,800
We'll stop and camp when it gets dark.

323
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,200
Maybe tonight we'll sing a few songs
around the campfire.

324
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Move out.

325
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Jake, when you left
to take care of that personal business...

326
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,800
...was it to get him out of jail?

327
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah.

328
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
How long have you known him?

329
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Don't let me interrupt.

330
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,600
You in much pain, Jake?

331
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
You ever been
up in these mountains before, miss?

332
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
- No.
- Really?

333
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,800
Well, you've missed some of the most
breathtaking scenery in the whole world.

334
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
You know, I heard a foreigner say once...

335
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,000
...that there wasn't nothing
in the Swiss Alps...

336
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,000
...that could beat the Rocky Mountains
when it come to scenic grandeur.

337
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,200
It kind of made me proud to be an American
when he said that.

338
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,000
You ever been to Swiss Alps, miss?

339
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
- No.
- Hmm.

340
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,400
Jake and me,
we always figured on going...

341
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,600
...but something was always coming up
at the last minute, you know how it is.

342
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Remember how we was always
talking about pulling out...

343
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,000
...and taking a trip
to the Swiss Alps, Jake?

344
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Yeah, I remember.

345
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,800
The places we was gonna go.

346
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,000
The things we was gonna see.

347
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
Heh.

348
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,600
It was always the next job we pulled
that was gonna give us the money to do it.

349
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Something always happened.

350
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Then one day,
Jake wasn't around no more.

351
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,200
And I didn't figure
it would be much fun by myself.

352
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,000
All of which should have
a moral to it someplace.

353
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
Maybe it's...

354
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Maybe it's, "Them that robs too many banks
never gets to see the Swiss Alps."

355
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
- That stuff ready yet?
- As ready as it's ever gonna be.

356
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,800
Come on, let's eat.

357
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Peggy, don't get that close to me again.
Get back over there.

358
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,000
We're not going to have much chance
to talk anyway.

359
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,400
But if he figures you're trying to untie me,
that will be the end of it.

360
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,400
I know how you feel about all this and what
you must think of me for getting you into it.

361
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
That's not it.

362
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, I should have told you.

363
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Aside from all that, if we've got any chance,
it's going to be from working together.

364
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Jake, you saved his life,
he wouldn't kill you.

365
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Not after you take him to the money.

366
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,400
You don't think he's bluffing, do you?

367
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,000
Peggy, listen to me.
He's going to kill me.

368
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
There isn't a chance he won't.
Believe me, I know.

369
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
One thing's sure.

370
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,800
Sometime, at one point,
there's going to be a split second...

371
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,400
...when we'll have
a one-in-a-million chance, there always is.

372
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,800
Clint knows that as well as I do,
so do the others.

373
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Now, get back where you were.

374
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
All right.

375
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,000
Hold it.

376
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,800
- What happened?
- He fell off, almost landed on his head.

377
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,000
But not quite, huh?

378
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, I don't know how he stuck up
there this far, Clint.

379
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,400
Well, he can keep falling off
till he breaks every bone in his body...

380
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
...and he still ain't
gonna get his hands untied.

381
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,400
That's real smart, isn't it?

382
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,800
You want the money, yet the only man who
knows where it is, you let break his neck.

383
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Now, wait a minute, miss,
that falling off a horse is a real moldy trick.

384
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
I ain't about to let him
take me in with that.

385
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Supposing it isn't a trick?

386
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
- Oh, come on,
- There's something in what she says.

387
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,600
Tie his hands in front
so he could hang on to the saddle horn.

388
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
He stays the way he is.

389
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Get him back up there.

390
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,400
Clint!

391
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,600
He can't stay on this way, Clint.

392
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,400
All right, tie his hands in front.

393
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
And get him back in that saddle.

394
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,600
Cut him loose. I'll get some more rope.

395
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
Come on with that rope already.

396
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Clint!

397
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Clint!

398
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,800
You boys get back down
to the bottom of the draw.

399
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Back that way. Go on.

400
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,400
We're all right now, Peggy. We made it.

401
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,600
Almost.

402
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,400
Just toss up the gun, Jake.

403
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
How long you been waiting up there?

404
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,200
I've been around here
for a couple hours anyway.

405
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Why didn't you go
to the head of the canyon?

406
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
That'd have been the easy way out.

407
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,600
Yeah, but I've never known you
to do anything the easy way.

408
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,800
Ortero!

409
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
What a slide.

410
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,600
It was a good try, Jake.

411
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Must have been quite a shock
to you, miss...

412
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
...thinking you'd gotten away safe
and all.

413
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,600
Of course, if Jake had been alone,
it might have been different.

414
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
Then he wouldn't go without you,
would he?

415
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
Hmm?

416
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Well, I was guilty
of that kind of weakness myself once.

417
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Remember the time I just couldn't bear
to leave you behind, Jake?

418
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,200
Well, you seem kind of puzzled, miss.

419
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,200
Ever tell her how you happened
to get mixed up with somebody like me?

420
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,600
- Why are you so interested?
- I'd like to hear it.

421
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,000
- You wouldn't like my version.
- Probably wouldn't.

422
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
Jake, what's he talking about?

423
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,800
We were in the same outfit in the war,
all of us except Rennie.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,800
It was a guerrilla unit
raiding Northern-border towns.

425
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,600
We'd shoot out way in,
loot the town and then shoot our way out.

426
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,600
I was doing it as a soldier.

427
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,800
Clint did it because, well,
that's the same thing he'd always done.

428
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,600
The war hadn't changed his life a bit.

429
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Just made it legal.

430
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,600
After the war, we kept right on
with what we'd been doing...

431
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,200
...robbing banks, holding up stages.

432
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,200
Of course, you can guess
that this didn't seem to bother Clint at all.

433
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Well, why should it?

434
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,200
During the war they... Hey.

435
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,000
During the war,
they made me an officer and a gentleman...

436
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,200
...for doing the same things they
was gonna hang me for a few days ago.

437
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,800
Now, you can't tell me
that makes any sense, Jake.

438
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
There's a difference,
but you'll never understand it.

439
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,400
I suppose you're talking about
something like honor, ain't you?

440
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,600
Which is supposed to be
too deep for me to understand.

441
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, all I know is if you got honor,
you don't run out on a friend, right?

442
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,000
Why did you run out on me?

443
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
- You know why.
- No, I don't.

444
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
I didn't like killing kids.

445
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Jake, what are you talking about?

446
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
We'd held up a bank.

447
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,200
During the getaway,
a young boy got caught in the crossfire.

448
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
I killed him.

449
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
And that's what made you
run out on me?

450
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Just killing that kid?

451
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
That was it.

452
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Tssh...

453
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,600
Well, it could've been an accident.

454
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah, it could've been,
but the boy was killed.

455
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I got caught and they threw me in jail.
There was a lynch mob within 10 minutes.

456
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,800
That's when Clint, as he says,
just couldn't bear to leave me behind.

457
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
He broke me out.

458
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,000
In the mix-up,
I wound up with Clint's horse.

459
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,000
- And the money from the bank.
- Yeah.

460
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
And then I knew I'd had enough.

461
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I buried the money
and kept right on going.

462
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,000
And I waited for you a whole week.

463
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,800
Took me a whole week
to get it through my thick head...

464
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
...that he'd run out on me.

465
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,200
All right, friend,
when do we get to that money?

466
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,000
What are you really after, Clint?
The money or me?

467
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,800
When do we get to the money?

468
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,800
Tomorrow. We'll be there tomorrow.

469
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,600
We're gonna have some company!

470
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,000
Cavalry patrol.

471
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Have they seen us?

472
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
I don't know.

473
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Cut the ropes.

474
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,600
What are we gonna do now, Clint?

475
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,000
What do you think we should do,
turn and run?

476
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,800
Now, listen, miss.

477
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,200
Whatever happens, when we meet them,
it ain't gonna do you or Jake no good.

478
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,800
You try anything, you'll both be dead,
do you understand?

479
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,400
Relax, Mr. Hollister.

480
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm quite convinced
you'd kill me without a qualm.

481
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,400
You got that?

482
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah, I got it.

483
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Now, don't act jumpy.

484
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,800
They got no reason to suspect us,
so don't give them none.

485
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'll do the talking.

486
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,800
Howdy, lieutenant.

487
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,400
Well, we sure weren't looking to see any
of our brave Army boys around here.

488
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,800
You're no more surprised
than we are, Mr...

489
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Bricker, lieutenant. Morgan Bricker.

490
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,600
And this Jake Wade,
he's the marshal over at Coldstream.

491
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,400
- Where you headed, marshal?
- Up into the San Marcos range, why?

492
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
There's been some bad trouble
with the Indians.

493
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
And I don't think, Mr. Bricker...

494
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,600
...marshal, that this is any place
for a woman right now.

495
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,800
I'd suggest you let us escort you
back to the fort.

496
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,600
- You can make it home from there.
- Oh, I think we can handle this, lieutenant.

497
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,800
I have the authority
to order you out of here, you know.

498
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,800
Yes, I know you do, lieutenant.

499
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,400
But I sure wish
you'd leave the decision up to us.

500
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,200
I certainly hate to tell you your business,
Mr. Bricker, but I think under the...

501
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,000
Lieutenant,
could we talk to you alone for a minute?

502
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
All right.

503
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
Marshal.

504
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,200
See, lieutenant,
we got a little problem here.

505
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,600
The young lady's father took off
to go prospecting in these mountains.

506
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,200
He's about a month overdue.

507
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,800
Well,
I guess we all know what that means.

508
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
I was a good friend of her father...

509
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,800
...so when she was about to start off
on her own to look for him...

510
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,800
...we decided we'd better come along.

511
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,600
- I see.
- I tell you, lieutenant...

512
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,600
...since we know the situation now,
we'll just circle around here in the foothills...

513
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,400
...for a couple of days
like we was looking, see?

514
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,000
But really going no place where we might
be putting her in any danger.

515
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,800
How's that?

516
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You go along with that, marshal?

517
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,400
Yeah, that's the thing to do
under the circumstances.

518
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,600
You sure you wanna go on, miss?

519
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,800
- Yes.
- All right.

520
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,400
Goodbye, miss.

521
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,200
- Good luck, Mr. Bricker, marshal.
- Thank you, lieutenant.

522
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,800
- Sergeant.
- March out.

523
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,600
Thanks, Jake.

524
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,000
Tie him up.

525
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,200
We'll have every Comanche
for 100 miles on our necks.

526
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,000
What's the matter with you?

527
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,000
Don't try to make anything out of this,
Jake.

528
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,400
I may not have to.

529
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,600
I'm sorry, Clint.

530
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,000
It's just that I can't stand
the filthy coyotes.

531
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,000
- I didn't stop to think.
- We'll chisel that on your tombstone.

532
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,800
I said I was sorry.

533
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,400
Right about now,
I guess Jake's sorry too.

534
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,000
But that ain't gonna keep him
from getting killed.

535
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,400
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, what do you care what I mean?

536
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't like people
that talk to me like that.

537
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,800
You don't, huh?

538
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,600
So, what are you gonna do about it?

539
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,400
Some more of that doing
without thinking?

540
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,600
I'll do plenty.

541
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,800
You gonna draw on me, Rennie?

542
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,600
I ought to shoot your ears off.

543
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,600
- What are we gonna do now?
- About what?

544
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,400
You ain't just going and keep right on riding
right into a massacre, are you?

545
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,400
Why, no, Burke.

546
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,800
- I thought we'd avoid that if we could.
- And how are we gonna do that?

547
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,600
You don't think a single Comanche
for 20 miles missed those shots, do you?

548
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,600
Now, get this.

549
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,000
There's a lot of money buried around here
that belongs to me.

550
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,200
And what belongs to me, I get.

551
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,000
Now, anybody
that don't wanna go along...

552
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,400
...is perfectly free to just turn around
and start riding back down the canyon.

553
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,400
Of course, anybody that does
will get a bullet in his back.

554
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,200
Ain't nobody turning back, Clint.

555
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Ail right, boys.

556
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,200
Just a little difference of opinion, miss.

557
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,600
Happens in the best-run organizations.

558
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
Lead off, Jake.

559
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
This is it, huh?

560
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
This is it.

561
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,000
Go ahead.

562
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,800
Clint, there's some tracks there.

563
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,800
How many, you think?

564
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,200
Six or eight here.

565
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Not over two hours ago.
And it could've been 10 minutes.

566
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,200
What do you think, Jake?

567
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,000
They're still right around here.

568
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
Now, just how do you read that
from the tracks?

569
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,600
I don't have to.

570
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,400
I can see one of them from here.

571
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
Don't move, anybody.

572
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,600
Building's got you covered,
I don't think he's seen us yet.

573
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,400
Where is he?

574
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,400
If you step out, he'll be just to your left
on top of the ridge.

575
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,400
Hold it, Clint.

576
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Can I get him with a rifle?

577
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Well, I know I could,
but I haven't seen you shoot lately.

578
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,800
Rennie, the rifle.

579
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,600
He still there?

580
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,800
Yeah, but you'll only have one shot, Clint.
He's gonna see you the minute you move.

581
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,200
How far?

582
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, about a hundred yards.

583
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
You missed him.

584
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,400
Yeah.

585
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,400
Oh, and, Clint,
there's another thing I forgot to tell you.

586
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,800
What?

587
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
There's two more.

588
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,800
Well, you're real smart, ain't you?

589
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
You're wasting a lot of time
if you're going after them.

590
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,800
Oh, so that's it.

591
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,400
You think with me out of the way,
you'll be...

592
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You hear that boys?

593
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,000
Well, I am going after them...

594
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,200
...because they're riding off to tell the rest
of that hunting party about us.

595
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,200
But that ain't gonna help you a bit, Jake.

596
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
It'll be dark in an hour, hole up here.

597
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,800
- Can I go with you, Clint?
- No.

598
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,200
I want you all right here when he pulls
whatever it is he's got in mind.

599
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,000
Get the horses out of sight.

600
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
This might take a little longer
than I figure. Wait for me.

601
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,000
But if I'm not back by midnight...

602
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,800
...the money's all yours, boys.

603
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,000
And, kid...

604
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,200
...I hope you and the girl
will be very happy.

605
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Let's get out of sight.

606
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
After you, marshal.

607
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,000
Keep an eye on Jake.

608
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,000
He ain't going nowhere, don't worry.

609
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,400
No?

610
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,400
Like yesterday in the canyon, maybe?

611
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,200
Let's see how long
we can hold onto him this time.

612
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Sit down, Jake.

613
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Get a long piece of rope, Wexler.

614
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
Burke...

615
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,800
...you see any Indians,
don't tell me till we get some food.

616
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,600
Rennie.

617
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,800
You see anything?

618
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,200
Nothing.

619
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,000
You got an extra smoke, Ortero?

620
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,000
Hey, Wexler, maybe we ought to
send Burke on a little scouting expedition.

621
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,400
Shut up, Rennie.

622
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,800
Hey, what's the matter
with that kid, Rennie?

623
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,000
He's crazy.

624
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,800
Where'd Clint find him?

625
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Las Cruces, last June.
They were looking for you.

626
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm gonna kill him one of these days.

627
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
Remember those first days
when we were riding together, Ortero?

628
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, I remember.

629
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,200
I know what you're getting at, Jake.

630
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm not getting at anything.

631
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,200
You want me to remember
how we fought a whole war together.

632
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,600
How you took me with you
when you went to join Clint.

633
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,000
The number of times
we've saved each others lives.

634
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,400
Well, on that basis, I always figured
we came out just about even.

635
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,400
I hope you mean that, Jake, because
there's nothing I can do for you now.

636
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,200
You can get her out of here.

637
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,200
Not even that.

638
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,800
I found out what happens
when you cross Clint.

639
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,400
What are you guys doing in here?

640
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,400
We wanna eat.

641
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
All right, untie Jake so he can eat.

642
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,400
- You think we'd better?
- Sure, let him loose.

643
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,200
Then if he tries to make a break for it,
we can kill him.

644
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,200
He's the only one
who knows where the money is.

645
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,200
So we can get out of here
and the Indians won't get our scalps.

646
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Clint wants him alive.

647
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,800
And don't either of you forget that.

648
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,800
Now, untie him.

649
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,600
The kid give you an idea, Wexler?

650
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,200
I wouldn't cross Clint.

651
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
You know that, Jake.

652
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,400
Maybe Clint ain't coming back.

653
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,200
You hope.

654
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,800
No, you hope.

655
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,600
He'll be back, don't worry about that.

656
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,400
Clint always comes back.

657
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,600
Who said we didn't
want him to come back?

658
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,200
Now, if I had been Clint...

659
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,600
...and I really wanted to find myself
some Indians, I'd have stayed right here.

660
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,400
What do you mean?

661
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,200
Probably got more Indians
surrounding us right now...

662
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,800
...than Custer had to fight at Bighorn.

663
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,000
So what?

664
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,200
We don't have to worry till it gets light,
and we'll probably be out of here by then.

665
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,800
Who says you don't have to worry
until it gets light?

666
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,800
Indians don't attack at night,
everybody knows that.

667
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,600
Apaches don't attack at night,
but they're the only ones who don't.

668
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
These are Comanches.

669
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,600
Well, then get back outside.

670
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,200
You're wasting your time
working on them, Jake.

671
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,000
Do you think so?

672
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,400
Jake, I wish I could help you.

673
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,800
Yeah, I know.

674
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,000
Well, this much I can do.

675
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,000
Jake, you didn't kill that kid.

676
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,000
What?

677
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,800
- Well, who did kill him?
- Jake didn't do it.

678
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Of course, Clint always wanted him
to think that he had.

679
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,200
You know what Clint's like.

680
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,200
Always likes to have something
on everybody that's with him.

681
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,600
Well, who did kill the boy?

682
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,000
Well, I do know that Jake didn't.

683
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,400
Because the boy was already dead
when Jake and Clint come out of the bank.

684
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Thanks, Ortero.

685
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Now, the trouble is, Jake...

686
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,800
...Clint always liked you better
than anybody he ever met.

687
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah, I know.

688
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,200
What about you and Jake, Ortero?

689
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,200
It doesn't make any difference.

690
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,800
I didn't ask you for anything,
I just asked you how you felt about Jake.

691
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,600
- That's the end of this talk.
- Look...

692
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,800
I said, that's the end of this talk.

693
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,200
Now, get over there and sit down.

694
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,200
All right, Mr. Ortero.

695
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,400
What do you suppose them coyotes
is howling so about?

696
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,000
You really think them's coyotes,
don't you?

697
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,200
Sure they are.
I heard enough of them up in...

698
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,600
You mean...?

699
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,400
I mean, they're Comanches.

700
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,000
They're Comanches,
and what are we doing about it?

701
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,000
We're sitting right here
like customers in a barbershop...

702
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,400
...waiting our turn
to get a nice, close haircut.

703
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,400
- Yeah, but Clint said we should...
- Clint said.

704
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,800
Clint said.

705
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,800
You notice that Clint got out of here,
didn't you?

706
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,000
Rennie's right.

707
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,600
Let's go tell Ortero
we're getting out of here.

708
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,600
You wanna stay here alone?

709
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,600
Not me.

710
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,200
Jake.

711
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,200
We're getting out of here.

712
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,800
We feel like a sitting duck.

713
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,400
All we know, we're being lined up
in the sights of some Comanche right now.

714
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,000
Nobody's happy about it.

715
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,400
We're leaving.

716
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,000
Fine.

717
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,200
That way or that way?

718
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,200
I suppose you know just where
the Indians are. What about the money?

719
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,000
I don't know how you feel, but that money
don't mean a thing to me anymore.

720
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,800
That goes for me. You, Burke?

721
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't want any part of it.

722
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,800
What about them?

723
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,400
Leave them here with some food
and a couple of canteens, but no horses.

724
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,400
If they make it, fine. If they don't...

725
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,800
- They had their chance.
- That's right.

726
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
- Wexler?
- Leave them here or shoot them.

727
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,600
It don't make no difference to me.

728
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,000
All right, they stay.

729
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
And I think maybe I'll stay too.

730
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,000
And keep going for the money
now that I've come this far.

731
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,600
- By yourself?
- Sure.

732
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
That way,
he got nobody to split it up with.

733
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Let him stay, he'll get hisself killed.

734
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,400
Thanks.

735
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,000
Come on, let's get out of here.

736
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
That's all right with me.

737
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,200
But it ain't all right with me.

738
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,600
You boys
seem to be getting a little jumpy.

739
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,600
You can stay if you want to, Clint,
but we're going.

740
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,200
You are?

741
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,800
We don't want the money,
you can have it.

742
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
I can?

743
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,400
We're going, Clint!

744
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,800
Let's see if you are.

745
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
Stop it.

746
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,200
There ain't gonna be no shooting.

747
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
We're in trouble enough.

748
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,400
You got us in a real mess, Clint.

749
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,400
This is what, I'm ta...

750
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,400
I guess you boys
ain't gonna be going far now...

751
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,400
...so get down to the end of the street.

752
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,400
Cover the ridge in this end of town
and get him out of here.

753
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,000
Watch him.

754
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,600
All right, Jake, get in that chair.

755
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,400
Let go of him, let go.

756
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,200
Ortero, move over to the house,
you can cross-cover there.

757
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,200
Stay there.

758
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, you ain't gonna be needing this,
are you?

759
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,400
- Jake, I can't.
- Peggy, get a knife.

760
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,600
- Where?
- Burke, there's one in his belt.

761
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,800
Stay low.

762
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,200
You ain't gonna hit nobody that way.

763
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
Stay close behind me.

764
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,800
That's far enough, Jake.

765
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,800
Inside.

766
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,200
Ortero, that's the last of them.

767
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,000
Move.

768
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,800
Well, did you say a few words
over the boys?

769
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,200
Yeah.

770
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,000
Goodbye.

771
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,200
That's very touching.

772
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,600
All right, Jake, now's the time.

773
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,400
Where is it?

774
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,600
Right up there.

775
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,400
I should've known.

776
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,200
Now, look, Jake,
if you're stalling again...

777
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,600
Wouldn't be much of a stall.

778
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,400
Let's go.

779
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,800
This is it.

780
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,000
Here?

781
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,400
How long is it gonna take you?

782
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,200
- I buried it pretty deep.
- How deep?

783
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
- Three or 4 feet.
- Well, get going.

784
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,400
What do you bury that in,
or is all that money gonna be rotted?

785
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,800
I buried your whole saddlebag.

786
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Well, dig it up.

787
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,000
Toss him the shovel.

788
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,400
Just...

789
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:34,200
Just what did you hope to accomplish
by running off and burying this?

790
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,800
Why didn't you just come to me and say,
"Clint, I'm quitting"?

791
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,600
Why didn't you do that, huh?

792
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,600
Gotta loosen this up with something.

793
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,800
You never give up, do you?

794
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,400
Now, there's the chance
you've been waiting for, Jake.

795
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,600
The only question is...

796
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,800
...do you wanna die now
or in a few minutes?

797
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,400
Go ahead.

798
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,200
You might pull it off.

799
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,400
You sure couldn't have been in much of
a hurry that day, burying it down that deep.

800
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,800
I don't understand it.

801
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
How come you buried it...?

802
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Get them up, both of you.

803
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,000
Heh. I guess I forgot about that one.

804
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,800
Guess you did.

805
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,400
Drop your gun belt, Clint.
You too, Ortero.

806
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
Now, wait a minute. Not so fast, Jake.

807
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
That thing's been buried for over a year.

808
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,600
You don't really think
it's gonna shoot, do you?

809
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,200
We can find out if you want to.

810
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,800
Now, look, Jake.

811
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,200
You're bluffing, and we both know it.

812
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Am I?

813
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,800
All right, so it does shoot.
All you'll win is a tie for first place.

814
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You know I'd get you before I die.

815
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,400
Neither of us know that.

816
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
You ain't sure it'll fire.

817
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,000
You're not sure it won't.

818
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,200
How about those gun belts?

819
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,200
All right, Ortero.

820
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,600
Pick them up, Peggy.

821
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,200
Ortero, go get the horses.
Peggy, you go with him.

822
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,200
- What are you gonna do?
- Go on, Peggy.

823
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,000
Please, Jake, don't bother with him.
He can't hurt us now.

824
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,400
I just want to talk to him alone.

825
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,600
Start walking, Ortero.

826
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,600
What do I do, Clint?

827
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,000
He's holding the gun, do what he says.

828
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:16,400
Hey, Jake, you ain't gonna keep me
in suspense, are you?

829
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,800
- What about?
- Whether that thing would've fired or not.

830
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,600
Well, on the other hand,
it might have gone off like a cannon.

831
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,000
Then think how silly I would've looked.

832
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,400
Go on, Peggy, I'll be done in a minute.

833
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,600
- Jake, please be careful.
- Go on, Peggy.

834
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Well, what happens now?

835
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,200
You gonna shoot me down
like a dirty dog?

836
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,200
I wouldn't do it like this
and you know it.

837
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,000
Yeah, that's what I always
liked about you, Jake.

838
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,800
You're real fair and square.

839
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Now that I'm holding the gun, you're willing
to give me my honor back, huh, Clint?

840
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,200
That makes us even again.

841
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,000
Should be easy to settle the rest.

842
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,200
- Wait here until I get back.
- Let's settle it now.

843
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,200
- Wait here.
- Sure, Jake.

844
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,800
Seeing as you got my gun, my knife...

845
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
...you're pretty safe
to leave me sitting on my honor.

846
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,800
And you take your time, Jake.

847
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,200
Take your time.

848
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,600
I'll be here.

849
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
We are leaving now, aren't we, Jake?

850
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,000
That's right, Peggy.

851
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,800
Ortero.

852
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,200
Let's pick up some loose guns.

853
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,400
Mount up, Peggy.

854
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,400
Ortero.

855
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,600
You've got to get her back home for me.

856
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,600
If he was dead,
would that make any difference to you?

857
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,400
A threat or promise?

858
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,400
I don't know.

859
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
All right, Jake, I'll take the chance.

860
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,200
Leave Clint's horse there.

861
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,200
No.

862
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,600
No, Jake, you can't go back.

863
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,000
- We're safe now.
- Trust me to do what I have to do.

864
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,400
Jake, if you go back there,
he's gonna kill you.

865
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,800
No, Jake, please.

866
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,800
Please don't go back.

867
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,400
Well...

868
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,800
...I see she's on her way.

869
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
How about a smoke?

870
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh, come on.

871
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,600
It might be your last.

872
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,200
Or mine.

873
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,400
Either way, you can't lose. Hmm?

874
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,800
Tell me something, Clint.

875
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,400
Sure.

876
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,600
Things had worked out
the way you planned...

877
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,600
...were you gonna give me a gun
or just shoot me in the back?

878
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,400
Well,
that's an interesting question, Jake.

879
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,000
I'd say I was gonna give you a gun.

880
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,800
All right.

881
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,600
There's your gun.

882
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,800
I was gonna hand you yours.

883
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,000
Well, you like me a lot better
than I like you.
