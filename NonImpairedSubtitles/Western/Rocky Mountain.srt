nighttime's the only time I dares to travel.

to bust out of here as soon as it got dark.

CRAIGIE: You're just overwrought, son...

463
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:08,065
...because you been took.
- Yeah. And you know how it was done.

464
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,706
By using Miss Carter as a blind.

465
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,466
All I know is...

466
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,544
...I wouldn't be up here now,
all in one piece, if it wasn't for him.

467
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,112
Same goes for her too.

468
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,010
He knew what he was doing.

469
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:22,243
- It gave him a hostage in case of trouble.
- That isn't true, Rick.

470
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,684
Then why didn't he leave you up here?

471
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,187
He tried to.

472
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,554
I forced my way into it.
I didn't know what to do.

473
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:36,228
I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean that.

474
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,733
I'm just sore at myself for being stupid.

475
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,440
I wouldn't say you was exactly stupid.

476
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,872
The captain's just a little bit smarter.

477
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,873
Lieutenant.

478
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,174
As you know,
we can't stay here much longer.

479
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:58,049
There will be a search for your patrol.
From what you say, a search for me too.

480
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,713
You're right.
But you can't ambush the whole regiment.

481
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,689
I've made a fair start.

482
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,488
While you're my prisoner,
it will make it a lot easier...

483
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,063
...if you'll give me your word
not to try to escape.

484
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,756
You can have freedom of the camp.

485
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,529
I ain't going nowhere.
Not at the cost of getting shot at, I ain't.

486
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,901
- Well?
- I give you my word that I'll escape if I can.

487
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,975
And do my best
to see you caught and shot.

488
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,905
- Suit yourself.
- I will.

489
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,172
Miss Carter,
I must ask you the same question.

490
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,340
- See here now...
- Miss Carter can speak for herself.

491
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,315
Miss Carter is my fiancée.

492
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,615
I know.
That's the only reason you're alive.

493
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,724
Don't force your luck.

494
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,420
I regret this,
but you must see the necessity for it.

495
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,829
I promise you
I'll make no effort to escape.

496
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,558
Thank you.

497
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,961
Guess I'll be pulling out for a while,
soldier.

498
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,972
Hi there, lieutenant.

499
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,944
I always said the only way you could find
me would be to get yourselves captured.

500
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,277
- You know this man?
- Every garrison knows Cole Smith.

501
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,977
And the band of outlaws that follow him.

502
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,887
Why don't I just stroke you one
across the snout?

503
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,217
LAFE:
Never mind that.

504
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,960
LAFE: Jimmy.
- Yes, sir?

505
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,798
Miss Carter and Craigie
will have the freedom of the camp.

506
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,033
If the lieutenant or his men
make any suspicious move, shoot them.

507
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,836
Yes, sir.

508
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,651
Just a minute.

509
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,124
- I suppose you had a good reason for this.
- I always do.

510
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,024
Would it be asking too much,
why the "California Beal"?

511
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,763
I never go into deals blindfolded.

512
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,966
Before I go joining any army,
I wanna look the soldier boys over first.

513
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,441
- And now you've had your look.
- You're lucky.

514
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:06,140
You got yourself in a mess of trouble,
and I ought to let you stew in it.

515
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,877
But I got enough stake in this
to pull you out.

516
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,283
I'll be back in two days with my men.

517
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,389
Before it gets any more crowded up here.

518
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,449
Any objections?

519
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,787
How do we know you'll ever get back?

520
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,554
I don't think you got much choice.

521
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,565
Unless you fellows
wanna go along with me.

522
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,492
You couldn't travel
with all them prisoners, though.

523
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,730
You'd either have to let them go
or kill them off.

524
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,464
PAP:
We got this far without you.

525
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,541
We'll finish the job the same way.

526
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,235
You try to raise an army out here
by yourselves...

527
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,871
...and the war will be over
before you can even get up a platoon.

528
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,077
After all,
it ain't like you boys was winning.

529
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,917
Give him a hand with his gear.

530
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,460
- Lookit here, Lafe...
- Don't worry, scissorbill.

531
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:54,155
Like I said,
I get something out of this too.

532
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,300
I'll be back.

533
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,510
It will be a sorry day when me
and that feller's in the same army.

534
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,807
That's what we came here for, Pap.

535
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,507
Well, you'll sure never get me
to salute him.

536
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,482
Salute? You?

537
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,212
Who did you ever salute?

538
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,584
Jeb Stuart, once.

539
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,653
He must be quite an officer.

540
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,403
Sure, we can get us
through them mountains.

541
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,903
We can get us through any mountains.

542
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,531
The only hard part's
to come out someplace.

543
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,942
There's 50,000 square miles
of nothing but mountain range out there.

544
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:49,178
The only chance in the world of ever seeing
Cole Smith again is to wait for him here.

545
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,754
What happens when more blue-bellies come
looking for the ones we got?

546
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,619
If we can hold on here
till Cole Smith gets back...

547
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,192
...we'll get our job done.

548
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,625
If we can't, we're through.

549
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,466
It's as simple as that.

550
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,791
Where you going, Jimmy?

551
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,564
Thought the lady might like
her supper now.

552
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,728
Heh. What do you know about girls?

553
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,404
Nothing.
Excepting they must get hungry too.

554
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,139
Any more questions?

555
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,189
- Captain, can I see you for a minute?
- Sure.

556
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,655
I've been talking
to these Shoshone scouts.

557
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,293
- You speak their language?
- Some.

558
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,589
I had a Shoshone squaw one time
for a while.

559
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,095
- How was she?
- She didn't say.

560
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,463
But the thing is,
these ain't just common, ordinary Indians.

561
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,602
That old one's named Man Dog.

562
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,765
He just happens to be the biggest chief
of the Shoshones, west of the Escalante.

563
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,436
What's a chief doing
working for the Yanks?

564
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,012
Spying on them, probably.

565
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,343
Them other two is his sons.

566
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,451
I got an idea they figure on pulling out.

567
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,749
If they did,
they'd turn you in for a bale of blankets.

568
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,789
Well, why are you telling me this?

569
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,950
Well, like I told you...

570
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,995
...I ain't got no stake in this war
one way or the other.

571
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:11,931
Whatever happens to you fellows up here
is liable to happen to me too.

572
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,635
I only got one suggestion.

573
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,002
If you have to kill one of them,
kill them all.

574
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,543
Or we ain't gonna get much further.
No, sir. Not without open dispute.

575
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,304
Thanks.

576
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,586
It surely makes me feel bad, ma'am...

577
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,727
...to bring you just sowbelly
and black-eyed peas.

578
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,456
- Lf only we just had some greens.
- It doesn't make any difference.

579
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,591
This here's the second time I got humiliated
by sowbelly and black-eyed peas.

580
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,167
Just ain't lucky for me I guess.

581
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:52,036
- When was the other time?
- Well, it was when l...

582
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,270
- Oh, you wouldn't believe me.
- Yes, I will.

583
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,108
Well, it was the time
I put my dinner on a skillet lid...

584
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,546
...and taken it to General Lee
with my own hands.

585
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,944
- Where was this?
- Just before the battle of Gettysburg.

586
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,148
This bunch of officers
comes along and stops...

587
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,384
...and looks out across the valley.

588
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,153
And as the horses parted...

589
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:17,562
...there was General Robert E. Lee,
setting his gray horse, name of Traveller.

590
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,235
I don't remember how come
that skillet lid in my hand...

591
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:26,069
...but there was me at Lee's stirrup,
offering it up.

592
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,504
I says, "You gotta keep
your strength up, sir," I says.

593
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,172
Heh. Me saying that to General Lee.

594
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:37,075
And he taken that skillet lid
and he sat there looking at it.

595
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,779
Like he didn't know what it was.

596
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,823
I says,
"I'm surely sorry we ain't got no greens."

597
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,657
And Lee, he looked me square in the eye
and he says:

598
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,391
"It's elegant," he says.

599
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,530
Then he looks out across the valley again.

600
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:58,832
He looked so tired and so sad.

601
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:03,273
His hair was just as white
as cotton busting out of the boll.

602
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,982
I begun to bawl.

603
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,812
Then he moves on,
old Traveller walking slow.

604
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,892
And Lee looking out across the valley,
carrying a skillet lid in his hand.

605
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,319
And I'd never seen him again.

606
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,657
Nor the skillet lid.

607
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,390
There's just one thing
that keeps coming back to me...

608
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,627
...and it frets me often.

609
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,501
You know, I never give him no knife
to eat them black-eyed peas.

610
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,877
Well, anyway,
I hope you like your dinner, ma'am.

611
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,317
JIMMY:
Come on, Spot.

612
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,522
He likes you.
He don't generally take with Yankees.

613
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,698
- Jimmy taking care of you all right?
- He certainly is.

614
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,831
He's a nice boy.

615
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,632
- How old is he?
- You mean in years?

616
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,068
Oh, all of 16.

617
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,732
He's a veteran.
Joined up when he was 14.

618
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,638
He makes me feel very young,
and very old at the same time.

619
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,011
He just makes me feel old.
They grow up fast in a war.

620
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,880
Overnight, the kids are young men.

621
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,354
- And the young men?
- Heh. You got a point there.

622
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:26,185
Captain Barstow, what are you going to do
about Lieutenant Rickey?

623
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,593
That depends on a lot of things,
including him.

624
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,161
I'm afraid I don't understand
the fine points of war.

625
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,130
One minute you're ready
to shoot him down in cold blood.

626
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,173
The next minute you're willing
to take his word for something.

627
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,540
As if you were all back in your own homes
playing some pleasant game.

628
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,739
- It doesn't make much sense, does it?
- It doesn't make any sense.

629
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,043
I guess it's all we have to hang on to.

630
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,709
A few little customs from the past.

631
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,413
Just to remind us there was a past.

Well, I hope you enjoy your dinner,

- Dead to the world.

636
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:22,442
Then for dinner, first I have
two dozen oysters fresh from the shell.

637
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,514
- As big as my hand.
- Oysters.

638

You mean you'd put one of them
slimy things right in your mouth?

639
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,517
Oyster is a beautiful thing.

640
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:35,317
All that cool salt water
washes over him all his life.

641
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:39,087
And the sunlight, it comes down to him
all green and blue.

642
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,426
Not white, hot and dusty like it is here.

643
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,091
And all around him it is coral,
and sea flowers.

644
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,830
And different colored fish.

645
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,166
Such beautifulness
goes into making an oyster.

646
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,639
So you'd go right to work...

647
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,542
...and put one of the slimy things
right in your mouth, huh?

648
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,042
I think nobody has been
so far from home as me.

The Indians are gone.
They went over the rim.

One down here.

The moon went under a minute.

657
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,684
I should have built a fire
but I thought they was all asleep.

658
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:43,088
Then I heard a noise and they was gone.
I only had a chance for one good shot.

659
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,387
KIP:
I got one below, Plank just yelled up.

660
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,190
- That makes two.
- What about the other, any sign of him?

661
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,334
They took after him, but it's pretty dark.

662
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:56,268
If he ain't dead by this time,
they ain't never gonna get him.

663
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,506
- I'm awfully sorry, captain.
- You couldn't help it, Jim.

LAFE: Plank.
PLANK: Yes, sir.

Tell Lieutenant Rickey I'd like to see him.

00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,668
- Which was the first smoke?
- Over there.

667
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,401
Well, at least we know
where Man Dog is now.

668
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,171
If I know these Indians, and I ought to...

669
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,873
...we're gonna see a lot of them
before too long, captain.

670
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,980
That old devil
must have traveled 10 miles.

00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,677
More like 15.

You wanted to see me?

Yes. There's something I think
you have the right to know.

00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,796
- Yeah?
- Those Indian scouts of yours...

675
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,402
...turned out to be
just a little bit more than that.

676
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,869
The old one's called Man Dog,
a very powerful Shoshone chief.

677
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,602
- The two we shot were his sons.
- Look, there's more smoke over there.

This ain't gonna be no picayune affair.

Looks like he's rounded up
the whole tribe.

- And what are you gonna do about it?
- Nothing.

681

You're not gonna hold a woman here,
in an Indian attack?

682
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,415
- Miss Carter's safety is my responsibility.
- It's mine too.

683
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,618
- I got the idea you were our prisoners.
- This has nothing to do with the war.

RICKEY: A garrison, a day's ride from here.

A man who knows the country could
slip her through and be there by morning.

- Even if I could spare such a man-
- Let me do it.

I'll give you my word to return.

- With your regiment?
- Alone.

I offered you parole once,
you turned it down.

It was you against me then.
Things are different now.

691
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,649
She's safer here.
Smith's men will be here tomorrow.

692
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,217
You're willing to let her life
depend on that outlaw?

You'd better hope so.

- I can't travel with prisoners.

If I have to move before I'm ready...

696
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,155
...I'll be forced to stand you up
and shoot you.

697
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,355
You mean to say,
you'd shoot down unarmed prisoners?

- What, at the water hole?

Barnes was going for his gun.
But you wouldn't stand up helpless men?

...tell me, supposing Lafe decides
to pull out, could we make it?

and Cole Smith's men ain't...

709
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,685
...I'd say we're liable to stay.

710
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,658
Cole Smith had better be on time
or we'll have to light out anyway.

When they start to dry up, they go fast.

01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,940
Well, Lafe, which is it? Fight or run?

915
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,409
I don't see that it makes
much difference now.

916
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,380
If we stay here, they'll massacre us all.
The other way at least we got a chance.

01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,076
- Some chance.
- It's better than no chance at all.

- Lf we scatter, some of us might make it.
- The lady wouldn't.

01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,257
- There's one way she could.
- How?

920
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:27,327
If we stick together and lead them away
from The Rock, she might get away.

01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,987
And what happens to the rest of you?

922
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,834
- Nothing that wouldn't happen anyway.
- I won't let you do that.

- It's up to me too, and I say, no.

You can hold out up here
until help comes.

They know there's only eight of us.
We couldn't stop them.

928

Well, then let's do what he said.
Everybody take the same chance.

As far as I'm concerned,
you're still in charge.

932
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,820
- This isn't an order.
- It is with me.

- I'm with you.
- Count me in.

LAFE: Good.

01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,129
We'll swing north.
Be sure they're after us before you take off.

942
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:36,821
- Once you start, don't stop.
- Don't worry about that.

We'll draw them as far away as we can.

All set, Lafe.

01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:01,019
At least we won't go sneaking around.
Might as well let them know who we are.

01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,318

- They'll see one now.
