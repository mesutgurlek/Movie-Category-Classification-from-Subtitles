1
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,875
Is that some sort
of a letter, Marshal?

2
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,514
- Journal.
- Journal.

3
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,455
Good.

4
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:11,790
You know, I was goin'
to Deadwood, same as you.

5
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:14,955
- Is that so?
- I had my plans about set.

6
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,797
I only wish to Christ I could get
these past three days back.

7
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,561
I can imagine.

8
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:29,640
No law at all
in Deadwood,

9
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,271
is that true?

10
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:33,145
Being on Indian land.

11
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,484
So then you
won't be a marshal?

12
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,216
Taking goods there to open
a hardware business, me and my partner.

13
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,020
If I'd have got there,
I'd have been prospectin'.

14
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:46,551
Jesus Christ Almighty.
No law at all,

15
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:50,361
gold you can scoop from the streams
with your bare hands,

16
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,890
and I gotta go
and fuck myself up

17
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:56,063
by supposedly stealing
Byron Samson's horse.

18
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,164
It's poor damn timing
at the least.

19
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,776
Thank you very much.

20
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,078
You're welcome.

21
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,544
I'm sorry as hell
about your shoulder.

22
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:14,249
Flesh wound. Don't look like
it wants to infect.

23
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,124
Well, never mind
flesh wounds, sir,

24
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,288
when you are goin'
to meet your maker,

25
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,822
you don't feature telling him that you
shot a marshal in the shoulder

26
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,597
for only doing
his legally ordained job.

27
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,831
He may have heard
worse stories.

28
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:34,673
God? Well, if he ain't,
I'll tell him six or seven

29
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,611
just on people of my own
personal acquaintance.

30
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,612
I'd like to suggest
an idea to you, sir,

31
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,778
that I pray as
a Christian man

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,152
you will entertain
on its own fuckin' merits.

33
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,856
Does it involve
letting you go?

34
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:58,060
I know two scores,
Mr. Bullock,

35
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,897
that we could
make in transit

36
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,199
without moving
20 feet off our path.

37
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:04,729
People with cash on hand,

38
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,401
and if once we hit Deadwood

39
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,411
and you didn't want to have
anything to do with me,

40
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,743
we'd never speak again.

41
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:15,717
We would meet as strangers
the rest of our fuckin' lives.

42
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,719
Now...

43
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:20,620
you tell me what
you think of that, sir.

44
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,120
It don't appeal to me.

45
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,790
Get the fuck out of here
for a moment, would you, sir?

46
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,662
Byron Samson's
comin' for him.

47
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,428
Sir, would you please
get the fuck out

48
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,629
till we have finished
our previous conversation?

49
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,797
- How many backing his play?
- A dozen, shit-faced.

50
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,636
Samson caved in
Tommy Raymond's head at

51
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:41,802
- the No-Name Frog. He went against it.
- What are you conversing at?

52
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:44,743
Jesus Christ!

53
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,805
Come out and talk
to us, Bullock!

54
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,181
Now who is that?
That sounds like Byron Samson.

55
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:55,848
- Yeah.
- What would he want?

56
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,372
Now tell me what kind
of fuckin' luck I got.

57
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:18,507
All you're doing stalling,
Bullock, is pissin' me off!

58
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:22,210
'Cause I guarantee you ain't
making it through in there till sun-up!

59
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,345
So why don't you climb out
from behind your badge,

60
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:27,184
and your big
brick building,

61
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:29,350
and you bring
Clell Watson out here

62
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,985
so we can give him
what he fuckin' deserves!

63
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,289
What have we got here?

64
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:38,061
Whoa!

65
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,761
It's a Jew on a wagon!

66
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,793
Yeah, right out here
in the alley!

67
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:46,839
I'm executing sentence now
and he's hangin' under color of law.

68
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,344
You and your partner plan on making
Deadwood, Marshal,

69
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:50,845
do not try for this scaffold.

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,316
That's a deal,
you loud-mouthed cocksucker!

71
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,844
You hear this?
Oh! Wait, this ain't right.

72
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,856
My sister was comin'
in the morning.

73
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,519
- What would you have her told?
- That's not enough of a drop.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,551
I'll strangle
for 20 minutes.

75
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:08,392
I'll help you
with the drop.

76
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,660
Get up and say what you'd
have your sister told.

77
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,894
Do not tether that
rope off of that porch!

78
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,907
Any more gunplay
gets answered.

79
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,845
You called
the law in, Samson.

80
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,848
You don't get to call it off
just 'cause you're liquored up

81
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,406
and popular on payday.

82
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,350
You don't tell us what to do
and what not to do,

83
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,877
'cause you're leaving
Montana anyways!

84
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,447
Now do not jump off
of that stool, you cocksucker!

85
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,755
Or what?
You'll kill me?

86
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,292
You tell my sister

87
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,857
if my boy turns up,
raise him good.

88
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,198
What else?

89
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,568
Tell her
give him my boots.

90
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,232
What else?

91
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:53,867
Tell him his...

92
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,536
daddy loved him.

93
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,273
Tell him...

94
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,447
he has
God's forgiveness.

95
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,482
Anything else?

96
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:09,557
You help me
with my fuckin' fall!

97
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:11,321
Come ahead.

98
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,029
Fuck you!

99
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:57,269
Stay back!

100
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,309
Move the fuck back,
while my partner...

101
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:05,203
while my partner's taking
his sweet-ass time

102
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,681
writing whatever the fuck
he's writing over there!

103
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:10,875
Who'll give his last words
to the sister?

104
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,820
None of you
better fucking move!

105
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:19,350
Shit!
I'll do it.

106
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,532
Thank you.

107
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,882
- Let's go.
- Hee.

108
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,929
Move ahead!
Move out of the way!

109
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,632
- Move!
- Jesus Christ, come on!

110
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:10,039
- What's going on!
- Move it up there!

111
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,537
Same damn wagon that
broke down yesterday, Bill!

112
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,143
That's the hold up, huh?

113
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:21,846
Same wagon and no damn room
to maneuver.

114
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,222
Sounds like it's
tighter out there

115
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:27,626
than a bull's ass
in fly season.

116
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:31,131
- How's your headache?
- Not bad.

117
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,066
You want me
to canvass for whiskey?

118
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,195
That's all right, Jane.

119
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,728
Believe me, we're stuck here
a fucking while.

120
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:41,035
I know your
canvassing techniques.

121
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:45,638
I don't want any casualties
on my conscience.

122
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,613
It's only
Wild Bill Hickok

123
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:57,784
you got stalled here
in the muck!

124
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,022
You ignorant
fucking cunts!

125
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,229
We're out here
the whole goddamn day?

126
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,068
What a goddamn circus!

127
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,698
Shit.

128
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,778
- We've got no water!
- All right, friend.

129
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:23,641
Let's go!

130
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,896
Come on, now,
come on, now, come on.

131
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,726
Chickens for sale!
$3.00 a pair.

132
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,236
Get your chickens here.

133
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,978
This lot rents
at 20 a day, Seth.

134
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:32,976
- $20 a day.
- Tent only, no construction.

135
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,456
Corner location.

136
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,091
In advance, every morning,
to Mr. Swearengen at the Gem.

137
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,600
- Where's the Gem?
- You'll find it.

138
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:48,125
Everybody does.

139
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,644
Eight ounces of gold
at $20 an ounce is 160

140
00:11:56,678 --> 00:12:00,045
plus $10 for a half-ounce
makes 170 total.

141
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,983
Inform your dealers
and whores of my credit,

142
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,576
and pour me
a goddamn drink!

143
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,383
Honor and a pleasure,
my good man.

144
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,958
170 credit, Dan,
for Ellsworth.

145
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:14,554
Yes, sir,
170 for Ellsworth.

146
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,188
I'll let
everybody know.

147
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,258
Lot four,
some hardware guys.

148
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,936
First one today
with this hand.

149
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,333
And pour me another,
my good man.

150
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,276
Here comes another.

151
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:33,640
- Lot four a stayer?
- Wagon loaded with goods.

152
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,810
Now with that limey
damn accent of yours,

153
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,379
are these rumors true that you're
descended from the British nobility?

154
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:42,652
I'm descended from
all of them cocksuckers.

155
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:45,387
Well here's to you,
Your Majesty.

156
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,588
I'll tell you what,

157
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,360
I may have fucked my life up
flatter than hammered shit,

158
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,129
but I stand here
before you today

159
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:56,035
beholden to no
human cocksucker,

160
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:58,665
and working a paying
fucking gold claim.

161
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:02,438
And not the U.S. Government
saying I'm trespassing,

162
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:05,071
or the savage fucking
red man himself,

163
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,513
or any of these
limber dick cocksuckers

164
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,848
passing themselves off as prospectors
had better try and stop me.

165
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:14,022
They'd better not
try it in here.

166
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,082
God damn it, Swearengen, I don't trust
you as far as I can throw you,

167
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,459
but I enjoy
the way you lie.

168
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,624
- Thank you, my good man.
- You're welcome,

169
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,998
you conniving,
heavy-thumbed motherfucker!

170
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,026
Watch out!

171
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:30,698
That's her derringer.

172
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,867
I warned you about
that loopy cunt!

173
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,376
Keep your own tally!

174
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,901
Oh, have no fear
on that score.

175
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,381
I said not to beat on me!
I told him!

176
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:45,011
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...

177
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:48,022
- You got any other guns?
- No, I don't got any more.

178
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:50,650
Ticonderoga, New York,
Barnett Robinson...

179
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,855
Ticonderoga, New York...
did you find it?

180
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,222
Barnett Robinson.

181
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:00,826
That's who to noti
if this thing goes wrong.

182
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,632
Yeah, I've got it
right here.

183
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,836
- How you doing, Trixie?
- I told him, don't beat on me, Doc!

184
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,277
- No one asked for your version!
- Said I robbed him

185
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:14,510
and he started beating on me.
And I didn't rob you!

186
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:17,609
- I don't remember.
- I didn't, God damn it!

187
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:21,118
Aw, she shot me
right in the head.

188
00:14:21,156 --> 00:14:23,716
D-don't put
your fingers in it.

189
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,952
Oh yeah,
is it bad, Doc?

190
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,859
Shh, shh, shh.

191
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,187
Get the Chinaman!

192
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:57,419
Sure would like to know
how he lasted for 20 minutes.

193
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,586
Shot straight to the brain.

194
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,927
So prospect in him
till Dan brings the Chinaman.

195
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:04,693
Do you mind if I take him
to my place?

196
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,201
Sure. Help the doc with this guy, bring
the Chinaman to the Doc's.

197
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,169
I'll bring that
sled right in, Doc.

198
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,537
Doc,
you drink free today.

199
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,439
And I hope
any word of this

200
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,444
would keep the gun
out of the whore's hand.

201
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:21,514
- That wouldn't come from me.
- Bastard did himself in.

202
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,110
- Come here.
- I said to stop.

203
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,813
Tell me in my office.

204
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,015
Get the gimp
to clean this place up.

205
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:37,465
Ugh, Doc!

206
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,768
You know
there's something

207
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,796
peculiar about
this man's cerebral setup

208
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,900
or they can just
write off the forebrain

209
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:51,435
as being the center
of thought and speech.

210
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,539
Let's just get him
on the sled.

211
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,744
Of course it...

212
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,049
won't matter
to Mr. Wu's pigs.

213
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:11,729
Whiskey.

214
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:18,035
I've got an urge to see
that camp, Charlie.

215
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:21,369
All right...

216
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,934
- Can we leave you with the stock, Jane?
- Yeah.

217
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:26,038
Bill and me are gonna
ride ahead into camp.

218
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,606
I expect I'll be there
before sundown.

219
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,515
Well, we'll know
where to find you.

220
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,146
What in the hell
do you mean by that?

221
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,053
That I enjoy
a fucking drink?

222
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,717
I wasn't aware
that's outlawed.

223
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,090
Thanks for looking
to the stock, Jane.

224
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:43,689
Excuse my ill humor.

225
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:46,223
Certain people wear
on my fucking nerves.

226
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,118
She likes me better
than she likes you.

227
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:08,814
I wish to hell I knew
what I ever did

228
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,882
to get on that woman's
wrong side.

229
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,595
- You know a back way into the camp?
- Whoa.

230
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,102
We don't go
to the camp.

231
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:30,839
We go home...
back to Minnesota.

232
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,747
You probably
got the right idea.

233
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,857
Jesus Christ Almighty,
move it!

234
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:48,055
I can't get to my spot
until you finish!

235
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:51,122
You got me circling my wagon
like a fly around shit.

236
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,624
We're pretty near done.
We gotta long wait, same as you.

237
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,728
This the first wagon
you ever fucking unloaded?!

238
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:59,171
Hold on to my horse,
I'll show you how to do it!

239
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:02,802
We know what we're doing. Put your hat
back on and stick with your wagon.

240
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:07,372
- And what if I don't?
- Stand there mouthing off and find out.

241
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:08,882
Sir...

242
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,443
I have a commode
for your inconvenience.

243
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,978
- You think I'm gonna pay for that?
- No, that's free.

244
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:18,424
From Star & Bullock Hardware,
open in Deadwood soon as we locate.

245
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,092
Hurry up
and get finished!

246
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,467
My father's last words
there in Vienna,

247
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,502
before he passed away,

248
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,447
was "Sol, lose a can
to buy the goddamned fool.

249
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,610
You could slow it down
and sell 'em at retail."

250
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:46,746
I gotta put a book together
of your old man's deathbed sayings.

251
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:49,313
That was Wild Bill Hickok
just riding past us, Seth.

252
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,348
I seen him in photographs.

253
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,758
He lost his
stake gambling.

254
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:56,923
He told me before
he passed out.

255
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,627
He said he lost his stake
and he hadn't found no gold

256
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:02,398
and he was going back East
after one last piece of pussy.

257
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:03,927
None of that's
anything to me.

258
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,408
He wakes back up,
starts in beating on me.

259
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,410
Where's his stake,
where's all his money?

260
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,139
You call Danny,
you call Johnny.

261
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,079
Must've been me
who took it from him.

262
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,776
You don't shoot nobody 'cause
that's bad for my business

263
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:18,581
and it's bad for
the camp's reputation.

264
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,219
He beat the living shit
out of you, didn't he?

265
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:25,992
Do what you
gotta do to me.

266
00:19:26,027 --> 00:19:28,689
Don't tell me
what to do.

267
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:36,132
Either way this comes out,
we'll only have to do it once.

268
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,332
What's it to be,
Trixie?

269
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:43,867
I'll be good.

270
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:49,111
All right now.

271
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,300
We heard rumors
you might be coming,

272
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,325
but you can't believe
every rumor.

273
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,895
We heard you might be
coming from Cheyenne.

274
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,430
- Here I am.
- If every rumor was true

275
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:15,705
we'd all have been
scalped now by the Sioux,

276
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,872
or the government would've tossed us out
as treaty violators.

277
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:26,181
- E.B. Farnum, how do you do?
- Charlie Utter.

278
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,418
You got some mighty
clammy hands there, partner.

279
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,927
Damp palms run
in my family.

280
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:38,589
Here to prospect, Mr. Hickok,
or on other business?

281
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,794
I'm here
to get a room.

282
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:44,771
Could we get two?
We're worn out looking at each other.

283
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,569
Separate rooms.

284
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,805
I'll arrange that by tomorrow,
but today I can't fix it.

285
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,980
Unless you
kill a guest.

286
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,151
Wild Bill Hickok.

287
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:09,322
Nothing can
ever be simple.

288
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:11,992
He didn't speak of having
lawman ambitions, Al.

289
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:14,399
Starting with Custer
getting himself massacred,

290
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,165
it's been one thing
after another.

291
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:19,002
Leaves the godless savage cocksucker
Sioux on the warpath...

292
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,634
if that long-haired
loudmouth had held his end up,

293
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:23,405
we could be operating
here in peace.

294
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:25,470
The New York dude's
downstairs, Al.

295
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,573
- Did he order whiskey?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:31,676
Did he down it
or is he sipping at it?

297
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,414
He's sipping.

298
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:36,356
Why'd I even ask, huh?

299
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:38,291
Go get Tim Driscoll.

300
00:21:38,326 --> 00:21:40,157
Make sure the dude
sees you leave.

301
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:42,356
- What should I tell Tim?
- Tell him to get over here.

302
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:45,059
Tell him he's drunk,
sorry for himself, give me five minutes,

303
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,533
- then you come back, do your part.
- All right, Al.

304
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:52,395
As far as Hickok, Al,

305
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,806
if I'd have pushed him
any harder on his plans,

306
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:56,834
I was afraid
he'd shoot me.

307
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:03,879
- Go get Driscoll.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:06,183
Handmade!

309
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,587
It's all handmade,
guaranteed.

310
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:11,319
It ain't like something's
being foisted on 'em

311
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,350
they'll be sorry
they bought come sun-up.

312
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:17,488
- I know that.
- These are quality items.

313
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:19,295
They meet
these folk's needs...

314
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:22,735
offered at fair markup,
and we're announcing their availability.

315
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,295
Brought through Indian country
figures into the markup.

316
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,002
By us,
at personal peril.

317
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,040
Let's go.

318
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,947
Coming out with your fly down
might strike the wrong note.

319
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,737
Come have a look, boys.

320
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:04,040
Star & Bullock
Hardware and Mercantile

321
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,273
just opened for business.

322
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:07,872
We got boots
to sell you.

323
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,683
Knee-boots, $10!
Hip-boots, 15!

324
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:17,918
We got picks,
pans and shovels.

325
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:21,793
Picks at $12,
shovels at 10, and pans at 8!

326
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:24,923
We got plaster cradles,
prospector's best friend.

327
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,934
Perfected at
the Montana strikes!

328
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,526
We got chamber-pots
to sell you.

329
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,299
If you don't know
what one of those is,

330
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:32,966
the man living next to you
will appreciate your finding out.

331
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:35,976
I'll look at your
biggest size hip-boot.

332
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,979
- Got 'em right here.
- We stand by our stock.

333
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:41,174
Any item that don't do
what it's supposed to

334
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:43,012
will be exchanged
for one that does.

335
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,814
And we'll be here
for you to find us.

336
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:47,047
Son of a bitch!

337
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:49,556
The man said I might
get a prize.

338
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:52,253
I paid 50¢
for this bar of soap,

339
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:56,252
there's a $5 prize
in the wrapper.

340
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:59,562
- Where'd you buy that soap at?
- Man standing right over there.

341
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:03,367
Front your game
away from our tent.

342
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:10,843
Cash prizes,
every night's case of soap.

343
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:12,436
Hey, storekeep!

344
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,244
Hold me some of those
large hip-boots till I get over there

345
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,775
- and I'll pay you $2 extra.
- Set prices, boys,

346
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,015
and first come,
first to be served.

347
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,052
We'll get you
squared away.

348
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,835
No free feels
in this house.

349
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,868
Brom Garret
of Manhattan,

350
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:47,210
scourge of the Deadwood
faro tables.

351
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:49,273
Don't think I
confuse two nights

352
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:51,217
holding good cards
with being a faro shark.

353
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,583
Two here, Dan.

354
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,885
You... you see
a finish to that?

355
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:02,986
Did you hear
Bill Hickok's in town?

356
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:06,865
Oh yes, I did.
Does that give you the vapors?

357
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:10,862
Are you mad
about something, Al?

358
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:12,429
I'm not mad
about nothing.

359
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:16,808
All's I can tell you, things sort out
fast in Deadwood.

360
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:20,075
I vouched for you with Tim Driscoll
two hours in here last night

361
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:22,708
when I gather you must have
been home in bed, sleeping.

362
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,083
End result, Tim's just
about got his claim sold to E.B. Farnum.

363
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,521
What? Where's
Driscoll now?

364
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:32,287
He ain't here
so I'd assume at his hotel.

365
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:35,193
- You told me he's here by 6:00.
- He ain't yet.

366
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,392
Al, E.B. Farnum just saw me here
and headed for the door.

367
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,867
I wouldn't know how
to interpret that.

368
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:44,104
I was doing
the legwork, Al.

369
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:45,765
I was doing
the due diligence.

370
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,900
You tell me Driscoll's
got money troubles,

371
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:49,910
and he's a motivated
seller, fair enough.

372
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,878
But how did I know his
claim's not played out?

373
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:53,938
- I had to do the legwork.
- I see, fair enough.

374
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:57,041
- Oh that's what I had to ascertain.
- Did you do the legwork?

375
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:00,413
Al.

376
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,551
For God's sake,
close your fist.

377
00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:10,030
Cleaned up during the night
with five more just like it

378
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:12,430
from Claim No. 9
above Discovery,

379
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,094
panned
at the Driscoll claim.

380
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:18,900
All I can say, Brom,
while you were out winning the battle

381
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,067
I hope you didn't lose
the fucking war.

382
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,338
Al.

383
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:32,283
Who is that?

384
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:37,284
Tim Driscoll...

385
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,122
shit-faced.

386
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,355
Let me handle
the play.

387
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:43,829
Oh my God,
he is shit-faced.

388
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,560
- Boys?
- Whiskeys.

389
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:15,152
Two whiskeys.

390
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,925
I'm... I'm respecting
your privacy

391
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:22,834
not saying your name,
but I certainly recognize you

392
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,065
and I'd like
to buy the round.

393
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:28,906
- Charlie Utter.
- Tom Nuttall, Charlie.

394
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,467
Tom.

395
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:33,503
It's Bill Hickok.
I seen him kill Phil Coe in Abilene.

396
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:36,984
Ahem, A.W. Merrick,
Mr. Hickok,

397
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:39,248
of the...
"Deadwood Pioneer."

398
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:44,051
- We're drinking whiskey.
- Certainly.

399
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:47,026
Certainly.
Whiskeys here, Mr. Nuttall.

400
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:49,928
I'm gonna say one thing
before anybody opens their mouth,

401
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:51,864
and I won't say
no more on the subject,

402
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,129
and I'll be through
for the fucking evening...

403
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:57,327
I'm not impressed.

404
00:27:57,371 --> 00:28:01,899
So what brings you
to our camp, Mr. Hickok?

405
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:03,342
May I tell my readers?

406
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,709
Warrant out on me
in Cheyenne.

407
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:07,873
Aw, get off
of that now, Bill.

408
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:09,712
Well, I suppose
for a man like you,

409
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,684
warrants are
a vocational hazard.

410
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,187
Calling me
a professional vagrant.

411
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:17,555
- The warrant was for vagrancy?
- He's kidding!

412
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,334
Anyway, in this camp,
warrants don't count.

413
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:31,099
I'm telling you he's
not impressed, all right?

414
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:35,438
Now you may apply that
to whoever you feel may be my reference.

415
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:39,071
And I intend to gut that son of a bitch
at poker whenever I get the chance.

416
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:42,412
You run that game?
Can I buy 50 in chips?

417
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,281
I do and you can.

418
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,548
Just settle up
after you see how your luck runs.

419
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:49,613
Feel like playing now, Bill, or you
wanna take in the rest of the camp?

420
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,284
I feel like
playing now.

421
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,452
Draw and five stud.

422
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:56,463
Dealer calls the game.

423
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:59,398
Sounds fair.
See you later, Charlie.

424
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,697
All right, Bill.

425
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:08,404
- You boys mind if I sit in?
- Not at all, have a seat.

426
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:11,408
What a grand surprise.

427
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:14,107
I never thought he'd live
long enough for me to meet him.

428
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,863
I need another gun.

429
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,294
What, in case
they beat on you?

430
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:40,967
Never mind what for,
just take this and get me another gun.

431
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:44,171
Go on, you can touch
my nipples if you want to.

432
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:47,203
Now Mabel! Mabel!
Get your ass across that table!

433
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,273
This dollar
is not for drink.

434
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:52,844
- My name's Caroline.
- Well, you'll always be Mabel to me.

435
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:56,618
Claim No. 9 above Discovery,
$14,000, yes or no?

436
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:59,820
$14,000,
yes or no?

437
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,523
All right, we'll
make it 14,000.

438
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:04,997
Spit in your hand.

439
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,693
Spit in your hand.

440
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:12,331
- What's his fucking problem?
- Aw, nothing.

441
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:14,364
Done, witnessed.

442
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:17,811
- Am I too late?
- Mm.

443
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:20,541
No, no, no, but you're
too late Farnum.

444
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:23,982
I just sold to this goose-Iooking
fella for 14,000.

445
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:27,112
- Will you take 16?
- No, thank you, but no.

446
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:30,646
What a fucking
lying cunt you are.

447
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:32,386
"12 and a half
thousand...

448
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:34,917
that's every cent
I can get hold of, Mr. Driscoll.

449
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:37,157
And more than
the claim is worth" you said.

450
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:40,634
16,000, that's 2,000 profit,
standing over a drink.

451
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:43,569
I believe events will prove
that Claim No. 9 above Discovery

452
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:46,198
was worth far more
than 16,000, Mr. Farnum.

453
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,764
Unhand me, Al.

454
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,841
Though, you know, of course,
I haven't actually seen

455
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,839
- his fucking money yet.
- I'm discounting his banknote. Dan.

456
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,213
There's $10,000.

457
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,517
I'll weigh four
out of the other sack right now.

458
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:03,580
Al's holding
a full faith letter of credit

459
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,387
for $20,000 from
the Bank of New York.

460
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,485
Full faith is one thing,
but until the money

461
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:10,691
has actually passed hands between us,
the deal isn't done.

462
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:12,596
- The deal is done.
- The deal isn't done.

463
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,498
- The deal is done.
- We spat in our hands.

464
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,230
What the fuck
would you know?!

465
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,795
I'll knock you into
the middle of next week.

466
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,899
Now, would you offer me
the 16,000?

467
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:24,172
I suppose, if you're open
to further offers.

468
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:25,303
16,500.

469
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,940
- What the fuck did you just do?
- Will you close at 16.5?

470
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:30,450
- You just reopened the fucking bidding.
- 17,000.

471
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,645
17,500,
I'll go no farther.

472
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:34,210
- 18!
- 19!

473
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:38,191
19,800 and that's every cent
I can put together.

474
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,624
20,000.

475
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,719
Damn it!
Damn it!

476
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:44,162
20 once.

477
00:31:44,198 --> 00:31:45,825
- 20 twice.
- I can't.

478
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,527
It's over,
he's through.

479
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:51,728
- Is it over?
- All right.

480
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:55,799
20,000 sold to the goose-Iooking man
in the shiny suit.

481
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:58,107
- I got it, Al.
- Yes, you did.

482
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:11,115
Comes to look for
a business opportunity,

483
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:12,716
and sits there
losing at poker.

484
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,661
Is he having a bad run?
I can't see that far.

485
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:17,721
You'd have to see
back to Cheyenne.

486
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:19,756
He lost his patience,

487
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,325
stays in hands whether
he's holding cards or not.

488
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:26,331
How's your crowd in here
tonight, anyway?

489
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,570
Oh, it's all right.

490
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,238
It's better than all right,
you could see that much.

491
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,612
Bill Hickok's an asset to any saloon,
any joint he frequents.

492
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:39,449
- You agree with me on that or not?
- You got a say in that?

493
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:43,184
- As far as where he drinks and gambles?
- Suppose I did?

494
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,955
50 a night if he'll
frequent here exclusive.

495
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,692
50?

496
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,893
What a sport
you turned out to be.

497
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,602
- You quote a figure.
- Let's come to one understanding.

498
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,665
Any figure I would've come up with,
part of that you give to him

499
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:04,269
to gamble or piss away
however else he's gonna do it.

500
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,643
That'd be the only part
he'd know about.

501
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,113
I'd work with you.

502
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,744
The rest you'd give to me
to hold in trust for his future.

503
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,448
- Now that'd be your affair.
- Listen to me,

504
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,958
that man's
recently married.

505
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:20,984
He needs to put
a stake together.

506
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,326
That's all
I'd be in this for.

507
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:27,256
I'd work with you.

508
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,372
Banish all headaches.

509
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,113
Spit in your hand,
Alma!

510
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:48,144
- What?
- Spit.

511
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,054
I'm gonna
show you something.

512
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:54,589
Promise you'll tell
my mother about this.

513
00:33:54,628 --> 00:33:56,926
I bought it.

514
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:59,990
We own a gold claim.
This is how we sealed the deal.

515
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:02,161
And then did everyone
dry their hands?

516
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:04,694
Do you know who
I was bidding against?

517
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:07,764
Farnum, who owns
this hotel.

518
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:10,470
Oh and where was
your secret agent?

519
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:13,378
Dan Dority?
He was tending bar.

520
00:34:13,414 --> 00:34:17,544
No one realized how Dan had helped me
wreck and order the claim.

521
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:20,315
Now Swearengen...
runs the saloon...

522
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:24,154
he was intermediary,
he brokered the deal.

523
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:26,819
Driscoll, the seller,
legless with liquor.

524
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,953
You will have a vivid
entry for an article

525
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:30,725
and I've told you
all the details.

526
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:33,232
Yes, I've already
begun to imagine it.

527
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,760
It was a near thing
till the end.

528
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:39,739
I had to go all our 20,000
to turn Farnum away.

529
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:42,264
Oh well.

530
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,743
I'll have to write the bank
to renew my credit.

531
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:48,542
Of course
they'll contact Father.

532
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,842
Well...

533
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:55,046
I expect
that's inevitable.

534
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,450
Wild Bill Hickok
is here.

535
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:03,793
I'm sure he's going
to prospect too.

536
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:37,459
- How much do you want?
- Well, we agreed on 30%.

537
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:39,693
- 30% of 20 would be six.
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:41,098
So I want
the 6,000.

539
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:43,399
What's 30% of 14,000?

540
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:48,372
- What the fuck, Al?
- Who told you to take him to 20?

541
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:53,104
Well, I could feel that
he had more in him.

542
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:55,308
It was just a spontaneous
fucking feeling

543
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:57,180
and I knew that
there was more to get.

544
00:35:57,217 --> 00:36:01,153
And you thought six more would be
the jackpot, take him from 14 to 20.

545
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:03,918
Oh Jesus Christ, you know,
if you had further plans,

546
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:06,221
I wish you'd have just
said something to me.

547
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,785
Should I tell you
when I plan to take a shit tomorrow

548
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:11,059
or would that be none
of your fucking business?

549
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:20,968
So... 14,000.

550
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:24,705
30% of that's what...
what is that now... 4,200.

551
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:31,478
What the fuck arrangement
do you suggest now?

552
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:34,316
- What do you suggest?
- Oh Jesus Christ Almighty!

553
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:38,223
You get in a mood like this and I just
as soon as not even discuss it.

554
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,658
Look, let me just
have 500, you know,

555
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:43,390
and we'll discuss the rest of it
some other fucking time.

556
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,456
Cash or credit
at the tables?

557
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,402
Fucking time of trial, the fucking
English in you comes out. Fine.

558
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:53,964
I'll have the 500 at the fucking tables
then. Jesus Christ Almighty!

559
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,465
- Are we holding markers?
- You're holding markers, all right.

560
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:01,072
You've been holding markers against
my kind for the past several centuries,

561
00:37:01,115 --> 00:37:04,084
across both sides of the fucking water!
How the fuck do I know?!

562
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,484
Ask Dority,
he'll know better than me.

563
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:11,086
Credit it against
the fucking markers,

564
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,458
but just let me hold 20,
in fucking cash.

565
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:19,791
- Tell Dan to give you 20.
- And a piece of fucking pussy.

566
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,301
Tell Dan, then tell him
to come see me.

567
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:28,202
And thanks for stepping in on the side
of right and fucking justice,

568
00:37:28,242 --> 00:37:30,369
you deaf dumb bastard!

569
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:38,346
I tell you, Al, you could
have knocked me over with a feather

570
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:39,647
when he took him to 20.

571
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,950
Did you see me struggling
to stay on the path?

572
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:47,889
My wife and children
are in Louisville, Kentucky.

573
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:50,362
I'm saving
to bring them out.

574
00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:53,298
Days I dig on
the Foster's water ditch

575
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:57,394
and nights I watch folk's goods
like I'm going to do for yours.

576
00:37:57,438 --> 00:38:00,635
Schedule like that seems like you'll
have 'em here in no time.

577
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:06,108
Then sabbaths I preach Christ crucified
and raised from the dead.

578
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,142
I'm from Etobicoke,
Ontario.

579
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:16,748
- So you were born in Canada?
- I come to Montana when I was 17.

580
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,191
- That's when I met up with Mr. Star.
- Is that so?

581
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:22,354
I was born in Austria.

582
00:38:22,396 --> 00:38:26,628
Austria? Wonderful
where people come from.

583
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:30,501
I was born in Austria and then
I grew up in Chillicothe, Ohio.

584
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:33,734
And then you partnered
with Mr. Bullock in Montana?

585
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:36,436
That's where
we partnered up.

586
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:38,911
The Lord is
our final comfort,

587
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:42,677
but it's a solace
having friends.

588
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:45,981
I know that
from past experience.

589
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:51,547
You sure sold up a storm
here tonight, didn't you?

590
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:54,527
- We did all right.
- We'll be a few hours, Mr. Smith.

591
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:56,290
We want to look
around the camp.

592
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,060
I will watch your goods
as if they were my own.

593
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:04,935
- Thank you, Mr. Smith.
- Thank you.

594
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,301
Whoa.

595
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:17,645
I seen a terrible
thing tonight.

596
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,345
What'd you see?

597
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:22,651
I seen white people
dead and scalped and...

598
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,749
men, women, and children
with their arms and legs hacked off.

599
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,022
Where? How many dead?

600
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:31,030
Well, it was a whole family
on the road to Spearfish.

601
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:34,795
Oh my God, it's them heathen
bloodthirsty savages!

602
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:39,169
- How many was it died?
- It was the whole family, they was...

603
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:41,071
hacked and mutilated.

604
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,837
The parents,
two children.

605
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:45,674
The Metz family
took the Spearfish road

606
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:48,010
going home to Minnesota.

607
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,843
Then that was
probably them then.

608
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:55,912
They had three children.
Were there three?

609
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,024
There could've
been three 'cause...

610
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:02,119
they was all hacked...
and spread around.

611
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,927
Rest their souls.

612
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,526
- Rest their souls.
- Yeah.

613
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,570
You probably
need a drink.

614
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,313
You called my bluff, Hickok.

615
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:27,980
I was trying
to run one. Whoa!

616
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:32,287
Wait on Mary.
I got a third eight under there.

617
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,495
Three eights wins,
your pot.

618
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:39,260
- Oh I absolutely did not realize that.
- Your chips.

619
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:42,325
Here I am thinking I'm fucking
bluffing the third eight,

620
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:45,770
and I mistakenly outdraw
the greatest gunfighter in the world.

621
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:49,105
Meaning the third eight.

622
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:54,344
- What?
- Saying you outdrew me.

623
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,178
You meant
the third eight.

624
00:40:58,018 --> 00:40:59,781
Well, what else
would I have meant?

625
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,913
Say it.

626
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:04,788
Then we'll play cards.

627
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:09,053
Third eight's
what I meant.

628
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:13,764
- Deal.
- Ante's up, same again.

629
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:25,142
Jesus Christ, can we
shake hands or something?

630
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,339
Relieve the atmosphere?

631
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:30,706
I mean, how stupid
do you think I am?

632
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:34,653
I don't know.
I just met you.

633
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,816
The paradox is the massacre
at Little Big Horn

634
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:40,122
signaled the Indians'
death throes, Mr. Utter.

635
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,152
History has overtaken the treaty
which gave them this land.

636
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:46,165
Well, the gold we found
has overtaken it.

637
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,894
I believe within a year

638
00:41:47,934 --> 00:41:50,300
Congress will rescind
the Fort Laramie Treaty,

639
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:52,305
Deadwood and these hills
will be annexed

640
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:55,740
to the Dakota Territory,
and we who have pursued our destiny

641
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:57,539
outside law or statute

642
00:41:57,577 --> 00:42:00,205
will be restored
to the bosom of the nation.

643
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:03,410
And... that's
what I believe.

644
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:15,620
- Does bosom mean tit?
- Same thing.

645
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,955
Ain't nothing
against y'all fellas,

646
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,695
but I'd as soon do my drinking
and getting a piece of ass.

647
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:23,999
First you want people
to know about that family.

648
00:42:24,037 --> 00:42:27,200
Yeah, well, what harm is it
in me meeting my needs

649
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,265
before I circulate
the news?

650
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:31,743
What if the third
child is alive?

651
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:34,679
You listen, mister,
it was a massacre.

652
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:37,616
I'm the one who saw it.
And there ain't no one was alive.

653
00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:40,176
Did you see
the massacre or not?

654
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,211
I told you I got there
afterwards.

655
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,052
So by then, the child
could've got away

656
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:45,888
from where you saw
those other bodies?

657
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:47,723
Or the child
could've been hiding

658
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:50,389
and so afraid of
who you might be, it didn't call out.

659
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,490
You listen to me, I ain't going back
out there again tonight,

660
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,728
so you mind your own
goddamn business!

661
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,260
You're saying a family
is massacred by Indians

662
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:01,206
on the road to Spearfish
and one child may still be alive

663
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:04,142
- and it's no one's concern...
- What's this about a massacre?

664
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:06,145
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn it!

665
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,170
I ain't going out there
again tonight

666
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:12,117
after I just made camp with my scalp
by sheer dumb fucking luck!

667
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,911
Ride out and show us
the place.

668
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:26,991
I'll guarantee
your scalp.

669
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:33,996
- You riding?
- Yeah.

670
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:37,134
- We'll ride.
- May I ride?

671
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:39,771
I'd be honored to ride,
infirmities permitting.

672
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:42,480
Here we go.

673
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:57,455
Wild Bill
fucking Hickok.

674
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:00,565
You were a marshal
in Kansas?

675
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,500
Yeah.

676
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:05,164
- And you?
- Montana.

677
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:08,971
- Come to your senses now?
- Yes, sir.

678
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:13,408
The fella's story on this
don't hold water.

679
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:15,880
No, it don't.

680
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:24,456
- What'd you give Driscoll?
- 20 bucks.

681
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:26,186
Free poke with Wanda.

682
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:29,354
- Half-smart mick that he is.
- Yeah.

683
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:31,591
Tim really fucked up
with the dude, huh?

684
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:34,429
I guess the dude's case money.
Dude only out here three days.

685
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:36,731
How's the dude ask
his people back home for more?

686
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:39,864
- They're liable to send the Pinkertons.
- So shut the dude down?

687
00:44:39,906 --> 00:44:41,806
You being
his secret best friend,

688
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:44,606
he'll want you out prospecting
in the morning beside him.

689
00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:46,236
That claim needs
to pinch out.

690
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,839
Oughtn't take but a couple days,
he ain't got much sand.

691
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:51,214
Tim Driscoll
needs to be seen to.

692
00:44:52,752 --> 00:44:54,413
- No kidding now?
- No kidding.

693
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:58,022
Well, not that
anybody asked,

694
00:44:58,058 --> 00:45:00,822
but I'd look to Trixie
for danger before I'd look to Tim.

695
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:02,692
No kidding!

696
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:07,733
Jimmy says the Sioux massacred a family
on the Spearfish road.

697
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,735
A hand come into
Nuttall's No. 10

698
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:12,329
- telling the story, Mr. Swearengen.
- Who was he?

699
00:45:12,372 --> 00:45:14,169
- I never seen him before.
- Can you get him over here?

700
00:45:14,207 --> 00:45:15,936
Is he still at Nuttall's?

701
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:18,240
They're riding back out
to where it happened.

702
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:20,439
Hickok and some others
were riding with him.

703
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,347
Did the hand look happy
to be riding back out with Hickok?

704
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:25,317
He didn't look
too happy.

705
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:29,015
How many people downstairs
did you tell about this?

706
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:32,425
- A few.
- A few?

707
00:45:34,127 --> 00:45:37,722
You let him tell a few people downstairs
before you bring this to me?

708
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:39,595
Al, I brought him
as soon as I heard!

709
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:43,262
How many people do you think the people
he talked to have talked to by now?

710
00:45:43,303 --> 00:45:47,569
I guarantee at this minute my entire
fucking action downstairs is fucked up!

711
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:51,008
Nobody's drinking, nobody's gambling,
nobody's chasing tail.

712
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:53,308
I have to deal
with that!

713
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,380
You want $10
or a bottle of dope?

714
00:45:59,419 --> 00:46:02,252
Bottle of dope please,
Mr. Swearengen.

715
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:05,656
- Give him a bottle of dope.
- Come on, I'll take care of you.

716
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:11,387
He's got a lot
on his mind, Johnny.

717
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,112
Quiet! Al's got words!

718
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,422
I guess when it starts
pissing rain in here,

719
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:41,950
you know
who to blame, huh?

720
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:44,225
I know word's circulating,

721
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:46,994
Indians killed a family
on the Spearfish road.

722
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:50,298
Now it's not for me to tell anyone
in this camp what to do,

723
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:53,568
much as I don't want more people
getting their throats cut,

724
00:46:53,606 --> 00:46:56,541
their scalps lifted,
or any other godless thing

725
00:46:56,576 --> 00:46:59,704
that these godless
bloodthirsty heathens do...

726
00:46:59,746 --> 00:47:02,544
or even if someone wants
to ride out in darkest night,

727
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:05,415
but I will
tell you this:

728
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:08,546
I'd use tonight
to get myself organized,

729
00:47:08,588 --> 00:47:12,490
ride out in the morning,
clear-headed,

730
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,789
and starting
tomorrow morning,

731
00:47:14,828 --> 00:47:18,229
I will offer
a personal $50 bounty

732
00:47:18,264 --> 00:47:20,255
for every decapitated head

733
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,633
of as many of these
godless heathen cocksuckers

734
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,798
as anyone can bring in,
tomorrow, with no upper limit!

735
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:29,603
That's all I say
on that subject

736
00:47:29,642 --> 00:47:31,405
except next round's
on the house.

737
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:35,312
And God rest the souls
of that poor family.

738
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:36,781
Amen.

739
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:40,980
And pussy's half-price
next 15 minutes.

740
00:47:50,497 --> 00:47:52,624
Okay, ladies,
let's go.

741
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:56,601
She must have done some fancy fucking
to keep Al from killing her.

742
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:13,916
Where's Bill Hickok?

743
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:15,853
Where's Charlie Utter?

744
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:18,287
Give me a drink!

745
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:25,826
It's all right, Al, I know you got a lot
on your mind.

746
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,059
That was one hell
of a good talk.

747
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,730
Look, you got everybody
back at the tables,

748
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:33,932
- doing what they do.
- Tell you the truth,

749
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:37,602
for murdering people
on the road to Spearfish

750
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,977
my money'd be on
Persimmon Phil.

751
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,312
Make it look
like Indians.

752
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:45,317
That is
his speciality.

753
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:49,878
Is it true?

754
00:48:49,923 --> 00:48:52,050
Indians killing
white people?

755
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:54,617
That's the sewer mouth
that follows Hickok around.

756
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:55,992
Why are we
standing here?

757
00:48:56,029 --> 00:48:58,259
Riding out tomorrow,
daybreak.

758
00:48:58,298 --> 00:49:00,732
Oh, really?

759
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,257
Tomorrow?

760
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:04,395
What's your
fucking rush?!

761
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:07,062
I'm going now.

762
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:10,204
Even without Bill.

763
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:12,939
Even without Charlie.

764
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,377
I know the road
to Spearfish.

765
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,477
And I don't drink where
I'm the only fucking one with balls!

766
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:28,922
Let her go.

767
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:31,021
She ain't taking
any business with her.

768
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,157
And don't forget
to kill Tim.

769
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:57,253
Yah.

770
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,545
Wah! Yah!

771
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:19,316
Get to your room.

772
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,827
You should be sleeping
on a goddamn pew.

773
00:53:25,031 --> 00:53:26,760
You in love?

774
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:45,147
Wake up, friend.
Come on now.

775
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:48,153
You know I don't intrude
on the affairs of others.

776
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:52,550
Problem enough keeping
my own life straight.

777
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:57,029
When something's not my affair,
I don't pretend it is.

778
00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:02,057
Contrariwise,

779
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:05,264
if you feel like talking
about that headlight...

780
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:08,999
I'll pay a dollar
a minute to hear you.

781
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:13,068
Get anything off
your chest you feel like.

782
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,205
What I got on my chest

783
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,081
don't concern you,
Ellsworth.

784
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:30,725
And fuck us all anyway
for the limber-dick cocksuckers we are.

785
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:57,513
- What is it?
- Just hush, Tim.

786
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:30,021
Doc! Get up!

787
00:55:31,324 --> 00:55:33,189
Doc!

788
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:34,716
Doc!

789
00:55:37,497 --> 00:55:39,988
Doc! Wake up!

790
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,992
Doc!

791
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,998
Oh God...

792
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,180
Wait for me,
God damn it!

793
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:05,918
Just hold on
till I'm with you.

794
00:56:09,529 --> 00:56:13,056
She don't mean nothing, Doc,
she's just excitable.

795
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:38,916
What kinda hand is
your friend with a gun?

796
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,956
I don't feel
qualified to say.

797
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:50,234
I guess I done my duty

798
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,794
and I was glad enough
to help.

799
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:55,806
Stick around,

800
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:57,138
see if she lives.

801
00:56:57,176 --> 00:57:00,009
Nah, I was...

802
00:57:00,046 --> 00:57:03,015
glad enough to have done my duty
and that little one

803
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,641
will be in my prayers.

804
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:09,549
- Get down off your horse.
- Listen to me.

805
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:12,422
I'm an innocent man,
it...

806
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,585
it was them Indians,
God damn it!

807
00:57:14,627 --> 00:57:18,222
Too much ransacking,
and too many goods left behind.

808
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:20,164
Someone was after money.

809
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:22,793
God damn it, if I had something
to do with what happened,

810
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:24,302
why'd I come
to this camp, huh?

811
00:57:24,337 --> 00:57:27,170
Maybe when it got
thick out there you ran.

812
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:30,265
Maybe the others
was going to ground,

813
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:32,971
but you had
to have pussy.

814
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:34,570
And get
to a faro layout.

815
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:37,811
I felt that way
sometimes after a kill.

816
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,943
Get down off
your horse,

817
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:42,648
or face
the consequences.

818
00:57:59,205 --> 00:58:01,469
Was that you or me,
Montana?

819
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:05,809
My money'd
be on you.

820
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,058
Yeah?
