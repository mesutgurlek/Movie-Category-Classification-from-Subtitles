On <i>Hatfields & McCoys...</i>

00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>You two don't mend what's</i>

<i>consume both our families.</i>

00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,072
<i>I'm Johnse Hatfield.</i>

7
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,541
<i>I know who you are.</i>

8
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:17,775
<i>He wants to marry me.</i>

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,277
<i>You're not my daughter anymore.</i>

10
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,511
<i>You come home with a Hatfield</i>

11
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,712
<i>bastard in your belly?</i>

12
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,548
<i>Your boy stabbed my brother.</i>

13
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:25,783
<i>He stabbed him over and over</i>

14
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,184
<i>again and then shot him.</i>

15
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,353
<i>I'd like to see my sons.</i>

16
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:30,821
<i>I don't think so.</i>

17
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,823
<i>You boys understand
what's gonna happen here?</i>

18
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,091
<i>Harden your hearts.</i>

19
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:37,728
<i>Same family killed your
brothers killed my pap.</i>

20
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:39,564
<i>Randall McCoy done this.</i>

21
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,365
<i>I'd like you to marry us.</i>

22
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,834
<i>Sooner or later, we're
gonna get every damn one.</i>

23
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:45,803
<i>Not just get 'em;</i>

24
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,737
<i>Kill 'em.</i>

25
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,173
<i>We are not infidels
like the Hatfields.</i>

26
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:50,741
<i>We embody the law.</i>

27
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:51,742
<i>You are talking about</i>

28
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,177
<i>starting another civil war.</i>

29
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,812
<i>That's what we already got.</i>

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,281
<i>So you tell the governor,</i>

31
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,651
<i>he steps in, or I will.</i>

33
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,976
How old was little
Sarah Elizabeth?

34
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,779
Oh, she was just shy of a year.

35
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,285
Lined with blue velvet.

36
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:35,254
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,856
Yeah, she'd like that.

38
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,558
It'll do, Mr. Goodpasture.

39
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,228
I'll give you some time.

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,435
- She'll rest easy in that.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,904
Poor little girl.

42
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,506
You think me
and Sarah Elizabeth

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,775
will recognize each other
when I get to heaven?

44
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:59,979
Oh, I expect your brothers
will take care of her.

45
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:02,748
You'll recognize them.

46
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:06,252
They done murder.

47
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,688
They might not get there.

48
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,257
We need to go.

49
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:40,886
It's ransom.

50
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,521
You sent for me?

51
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:43,589
Saddle the horses.

52
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,459
I got me a tip about...

53
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:48,828
Three good Christian Hatfields

54
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,696
we gonna apprehend.

55
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,699
We go now
across the river quick...

56
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,936
They won't have time to hide.

57
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,538
I'll round up the men
posthaste.

58
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:01,440
You coming?

59
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,575
He will be.

60
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,644

That's Tom Chambers.

Get him.

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,289
There he is.
Him too.

70
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,324
You can't do this.

71
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,292
Who's the next one?

72
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:40,327
What is this?

73
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:43,063
This is the house of God!

Whoa.

81
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,294
What's all the ruckus?

82
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:17,231
Folks are celebrating
Mr. Phillips' success.

83
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,968
He hasn't caught
Devil Anse yet.

84
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,542
He's poorly.

85
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,514
He got pleurisy.

86
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,787
Jim.

87
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,590
Ain't you a sorry sight.

88
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,728
Want I should come back later?

89
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,697
Speak your mind.

90
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:59,440
Phillips' gang raided
services at the tug fork church,

91
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:05,112
seized Tom Chambers
and the Mahon brothers,

92
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,682
smacked preacher Garrett
for no apparent reason.

93
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,819
Anse, they are shoving it
in our face.

94
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,054
Yeah.

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,295
Any word from your man
John B. Floyd?

96
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:25,265
Governor Windy
ain't doing shit,

97
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,370
too busy letting
lawyers get in his ear

98
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,705
and getting his back up against
these New York muckrakers

99
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,775
calling us
a "Savage Mountain Tribe."

100
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,280
It's up to us, like always.

101
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,753
What do you propose?

102
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,158
Cut off the head of the snake.

103
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:06,407
Be awful treacherous
going after Frank Phillips.

104
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,275
He's got an army around him.

105
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,011
No, he's...
he's the fangs.

106
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,216
We ought to kill Randall McCoy.

107
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,325
I'm attorney Perry Cline,
esquire.

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,895
I'll represent you till
the court deems it necessary

109
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,363
to appoint a public defender.

110
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:30,864
You think we got
a better chance

111
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,499
if we keep you on
as our lawyer?

112
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,535
Well, it's up to you.

113
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:37,471
I do know the circumstances of
the case better than anyone.

114
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:44,411
Now, these stamped envelopes are
to contact your family members

115
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,748
to assure them
you're being well-treated

116
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,317
and to arrange payment
of my retainer.

117
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:53,921
That's $50 cash
receivable at my office.

118
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:57,257
You killed my sons.

119
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:00,294
Your murdering sons.

120
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:02,329
Not guilty
till proved innocent,

121
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:05,399
men like you
who deserved a fair trial.

122
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,868
I pray you hang.

123
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:11,205
I will supply the lumber
for the gallows,

124
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,706
and I will tie the knot
on your rope.

125
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,510
And when your neck snaps,
I will rejoice

126
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:20,247
as you are sent to boil
in eternal damnation's hellfire!

127
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,150
A Merry Christmas to you,
too, sir.

128
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,004
You all right, ma?

129
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,074
You hear that?

130
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:47,975
Hear what?

131
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,943
Shh.

132
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,983
They'll come from over there.

133
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,952
Who will?

134
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:01,355
Hatfields, they'll come
from over there.

135
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,423
Hatfields?

136
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,194
Ma, Hatfields are hiding out
from bad Frank.

137
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,163
They ain't gonna come across
this side of the river.

138
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,366
Let's go inside, huh?

139
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,869
No one's coming tonight.

140
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:18,238
It's not tonight I speak of.

141
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:59,479
We're hunted like animals
by hired trash.

142
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:04,117
Family and friends kidnapped
and murdered.

143
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:07,054
The law stood by.

144
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,024
The law has done nothing.

145
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,659
Even so, if there was anything...

146
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,898
anything I had that,
by giving it,

147
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,466
I could end
this bloody struggle,

148
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,068
I would give it gladly.

149
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,309
I'd give my life
if it would end this.

150
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:32,312
You would not.

151
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,949
What I will not give

152
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:39,486
is one more drop
of this family's blood.

153
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:46,660
So tonight,

154
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:50,063
this new year's Eve,

155
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,965
we end this forever.

156
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,472
I's with you, Mr. Hatfield.

157
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,841
You ain't coming, Billy.

158
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,277
You ain't ready.

159
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,017
Thank the stars
I ain't too late.

160
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:12,019
Lots of time, Johnse.

161
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,322
We all just waiting for your pa
to finish his coughing fit.

162
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:25,132
We can be there by dawn,

163
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,935
make our approach with the sun
at our backs.

164
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,904
The time of the morning,

165
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,873
the day it is,
they won't expect nothing.

166
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,477
We harm no one we don't have to.

167
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,547
Once Randall sees how it is,

168
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:44,151
he'll surrender himself
to protect the others from harm.

169
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:48,188
We take him alive.

170
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,590
Thought we was
getting rid of him.

171
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,393
Once Randall McCoy's
extradited,

172
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:56,396
as our prisoner of war, we...

173
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:00,400
we execute him here
in West Virginia,

174
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,769
the state where he committed
his crimes.

175
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,441
As is proper.

176
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:17,684
A mite dizzy.

177
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,419
Stepped on a stone
or something.

178
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,989
Yeah, I know.

179
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:24,791
We still got to get you
to the doc.

180
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,293
No, there's no time.

181
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,595
You're too sick, pa.

182
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,263
Well, we can do this.

183
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,168
Damn.

184
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,738
Anse.

185
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,441
Be a worthless trip
if you start coughing like that

186
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,410
and give us all away.

187
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:49,182
No one but Randall taken
and him not harmed.

188
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:53,420
Him not harmed,

189
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:56,323
or you answer to me.

190
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,960
All right, y'all.

191
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,362
Saddle up.

192
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:03,530
You're gonna beat it, Anse.

193
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,165
And we'll get Randall.

194
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,727
Randall, wake up.

195
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:09,062
They're here.

196
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:14,234
Shh.

197
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,779
What is it, poppy?

198
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:27,681
Get them children down.

199
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,149
Get down.

200
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,384
Go.

201
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:37,891
May hell be my heaven,

202
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:43,263
I will kill any man
who goes back on me

203
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,398
if powder will burn.

204
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,302
All right, as planned.
Go on now.

205
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:51,571
Go on.

206
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,645
You know, pa said just Randall.

207
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,047
We take him back over the tug
to West Virginia?

208
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,183
You think Randall McCoy's
gonna let himself

209
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,184
get took alive?

210
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,151
We got to try.

211
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,287
Randall McCoy!

212
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,891
Your final day has dawned.

213
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,894
Save your family.

214
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,863
Surrender yourself.

215
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,565
You hear me?

216
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,234
Your final day has dawned.

217
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,347
Uncle Jim!

218
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,782
Jim.

219
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:37,684
We got all sides covered now,

220
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,553
every door, window, and rathole.

221
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,588
Ain't nobody gonna get out
without us seeing them.

222
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:42,822
Who's got the back?

223
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:44,457
Cotton Top.

224
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:48,061
Johnse's with him.

225
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,896
I'll go check them out.

226
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,502
We got your whole farm
surrounded, McCoy.

227
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,671
Might as well come on out.

228
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,640
Do it now,
and we spare your family!

229
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,176
I seen that Jim Vance.

230
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,578
Cap Hatfield and the others

231
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,580
are out of sight taking cover.

232
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,714
How many?

233
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,549
15, probably more.

234
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,417
Come on.

235
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,484
Come on.

236
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,620
Get behind and sit.

237
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:14,988
You too.

238
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,326
Don't shoot unless they do

239
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,493
or someone charges.

240
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,729
I can't get a good shot
no ways.

241
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,310
Shh.

242
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,913
Shh.

243
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,915
Sorry.

244
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,950
I got this tune
stuck in my head.

245
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,285
Where's Johnse?

246
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,088
He said to watch the back
is all I know.

247
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,757
Don't let no one out.

248
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,356
Watch the back.

249
00:15:55,194 --> 00:16:01,032
Randall McCoy, come on out
and face the day,

250
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:04,168
or else I have to burn
your house down.

251
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:10,775
You want your little ones
consumed in fire?

252
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,710
We're all right.
Don't worry.

253
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:17,281
Their wee bodies a-hissing
and a-steaming?

254
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,351
Randall!

255
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,491
Go out the back,
and run for the woods.

256
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:27,825
I got to go out there.

257
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,293
If I can get a showdown
with Jim Vance,

258
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:30,928
maybe the others will
back down.

259
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:32,797
Randall, he'll shoot you down
like you was nothing.

260
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,398
I'm begging you, husband,

261
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,834
slip out the back while you can.

262
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:40,037
If they know you're gone,
they'll leave us be.

263
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:55,820
Cotton Top, what's that?

264
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:06,964
Hold your fire!

265
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:10,601
Get down!
Get down!

266
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:12,403
Hold on!

267
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:13,638
God damn it!

268
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:15,439
I didn't order yet!

269
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:16,841
Hold on!

270
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,944
I said, hold your fire!

271
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,147
What the hell?

272
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:24,549
Cotton started shooting.

273
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,317
Must have seen McCoy
stick his head out.

274
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:27,451
Go find out.

275
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:29,620
Hey, my pa's not here!

276
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:32,290
He stayed over in Pikeville
last night!

277
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:35,827
I said for him to come out!

278
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:37,261
He's not here!

279
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:39,197
Ain't nobody in here but me,

280
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:41,132
except women and childrens.

281
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,135
Randall!

282
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,737
We're all waiting for you.

283
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,773
He's not here!

284
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:58,082
Heavenly father,
spare my family,

285
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,817
and smite my enemy.

286
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:02,086
I beg of you, have mercy
in our hour of need.

287
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,155
Have mercy, lord Jesus.

288
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,792
He

289
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:11,028
cotton, we said,
"Let nobody out the back."

290
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:13,865
Nobody out the back!

291
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,566
Sorry.

292
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,702
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,707
Discourtesy is what it is.

294
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:37,920
You son of a bitch!

295
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:40,890
We got to get the fires out.
We need more water.

296
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:42,491
Use the buttermilk.

297
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:46,295
You're burning women
and children, you coward!

298
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,698
What kind of devil are you,
Jim Vance?

299
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:54,737
Alifair!

300
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,405
Now, you listen to me.

301
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,741
You get ma and the kids out
the back, all right?

302
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,343
Mama, come on.
Let's go.

303
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,012
Go on.
Get them out.

304
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,346
Mind the babies, Alifair.

305
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,282
I'll be along.

306
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,150
Ma.
Go, go, go!

307
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:11,020
Don't stop.

308
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:13,823
Go on.

309
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:14,757
Go on, Fanny.

310
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,258
You got to go back inside.

311
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,160
- Keep going.
- Get back inside!

312
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,099
It ain't allowed.

313
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:32,708
I let them...
I let them out the back.

314
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:34,810
You got one.

315
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,012
That's good enough.

316
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:50,359
They ain't allowed.

317
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,728
I want Randall McCoy!

318
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:56,632
Well, you got his son!

319
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:08,844
Poppy.

320
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,779
Poppy.

321
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,049
Hey.

322
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,586
Fanny.

323
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,881
Where's your mother?

324
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,683
Alifair got hurt.

325
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,762
Hold your fire.

326
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,243
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:58,520
Crazy stupid bitch.

328
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:44,805
I was having a dream,

329
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,644
and Sally said, "They're here."

330
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:52,947
I heard Jim Vance yelling,

331
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:55,850
"Randall McCoy, come out
and face the day!"

332
00:21:57,786 --> 00:22:00,883
And it was me they was after.

333
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,284
Can you lean your head back?

334
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,685
I need to look in your eye.

335
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,089
I told Sally,
"I got to go out there."

336
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:11,126
She said, "You do,
they'll kill you.

337
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,863
"Try and get out the back.

338
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:20,001
Me and the children,
we'll be safe when you're gone."

339
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,636
Safe.

340
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,938
It's gonna be all right.

341
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,773
- I want my Rosie.
- I know, sweetheart.

342
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:28,276
I lit out
and made for the woods.

343
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,848
Then I heard the shooting.

344
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:35,751
After a while, I seen the smoke.

345
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,656
Then I saw the children.

346
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:45,227
The children told me Alifair was
leading them away from the fire

347
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:48,230
when they shot her.

348
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:52,167
I took them deeper in the woods.

349
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:56,138
We knelt, and we prayed.

350
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,474
When I got back, they was gone.

351
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,156
Mr. Phillips.

352
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,992
You got to see this.

353
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:20,095
Sally was laying on
the ground next to Calvin.

354
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:23,965
I picked her up,
and I held her in my arms

355
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,702
for I don't know how long.

356
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:31,139
And when I next looked up,

357
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:34,509
you was here.

358
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:38,346
Your son Jim is on his way
to get the kids.

359
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,348
You and Miss McCoy will stay
at my house.

360
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:44,753
I prayed to a merciful God
who showed us no mercy.

361
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:46,721
His will, Randall, not ours
be done.

362
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:49,157
This is his will?

363
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:54,095
My children dead, my wife hurt,
and my house burned?

364
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,764
Where was God?

365
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,268
If this is his will,
what kind of God is that?

366
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:01,770
What kind of God is that?

367
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:06,875
It's the other McCoy girl.

368
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,579
Looks like she's seen the devil.

369
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:15,417
Whatever we want now.

370
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,788
Rules are done.

371
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,974
Hey, Charles.

372
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:42,043
Oh.

373
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:42,978
What?

374
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:55,390
You know, looking at this
family peacefully feeding

375
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:58,693
reminds a body
of why we kill McCoys.

376
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:07,802
Sit down.
Sit down.

377
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,344
It didn't turn out so well.

378
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,181
Tell me.

379
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:24,719
That goddamn half-wit
cotton turd.

380
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:27,322
Hey.

381
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:30,558
Oh, this probably ain't fit
for the ears of young 'uns.

382
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,361
Go wash.

383
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,563
Take your brothers.
Let's go.

384
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:36,998
Go.
Shut the door behind you.

385
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:42,737
Just say it.

386
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:53,581
Our foray against
old Randall was interfered with

387
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,083
by family members.

388
00:25:56,986 --> 00:26:00,288
While old Randall was running
scared like a jackrabbit,

389
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,257
his heir Calvin...

390
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,994
Come charging us,

391
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:07,662
shooting with deadly intent.

392
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:11,933
I had no choice but to kill him.

393
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,273
You said "family."

394
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,841
Ah.

395
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:27,215
One of old Randall's older
daughters, um...

396
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:34,656
She got in the way
and got killed accidental.

397
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,025
There may have been others.

398
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:42,063
We tried to burn them out.

399
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:45,200
And all unforeseen, Anse.

400
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,302
But you know your boy, Cap?

401
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:48,670
He done good now.

402
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:53,041
And Randall got away.

403
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,511
Yup.

404
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,648
And what of Randall's wife?

405
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:08,256
She run mad,
barreled straight at me

406
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,224
in her dishabille.

407
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:11,393
And?

408
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:16,131
And I...

409
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:17,665
I laid her in the back
of the ear

410
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,933
with my rifle butt.

411
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:25,340
I believe she's done.

412
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,947
What we do now, Jim?

413
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,249
Hmm?

414
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:38,953
Kill them all?

415
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,818
Reverend.

416
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:05,553
What is it?

417
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,922
Ma'am, I have
some terrible news.

418
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:18,065
Couldn't tell me what you
and your butchering family

419
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
did this time, could you?

420
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:20,434
Could you?

421
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,236
God damn it, stop it!

422
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,304
Horrible!

423
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,271
Horrible!

424
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:25,473
Just horrible!

425
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:29,028
How could any man
on God's green earth

426
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,663
do something so horrible?

427
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:32,531
It wasn't me!

428
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,700
How?

429
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,568
God damn it.

430
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:37,736
Uncle Jim and them

431
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,405
was trying to get rid
of Randall McCoy

432
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:43,375
so all this fighting
gets stopped.

433
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,743
Their intentions was right.

434
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,512
Oh, their intentions.

435
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:49,214
Like you wasn't a part of it?

436
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,549
Even if I was there

437
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,419
don't mean I participated
in any killing.

438
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,554
Hell, like people said I was
in that firing squad

439
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:56,422
that killed Tolbert and...

440
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,090
Oh, firing squad?

441
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:59,058
Everybody knows!

442
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:00,025
I raised my gun.

443
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,493
I missed on purpose.

444
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:03,462
Last night was no different.

445
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,165
You were there.

446
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:14,973
So you helped Jim Vance
murder my entire family?

447
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:17,076
Oh, hell no, I didn't.

448
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,744
You know, it made me sick.

449
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:23,715
Hell, if I knew
they was gonna do such,

450
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,184
I'd have never gone.

451
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,793
It was that weak-brained
Cotton Top shot Alifair.

452
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,968
That Jim Vance is
celebrating now.

453
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,003
Oh, hell no, he ain't.

454
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,141
Pa sent him and Cap over Thacker
mountain to lay low awhile.

455
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:51,510
They's a-hunting deer up
big Muncey Creek,

456
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:53,946
tryin' to put food
on the goddamn table,

457
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,448
'cause our family
can't even go to a store

458
00:29:56,483 --> 00:30:00,285
without some McCoy
bounty hunter ambushing us.

459
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:19,037
Come on.

460
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:20,539
Hey, hey.

461
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:23,175
You know what,
let's pack the hell up.

462
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,209
Let's pack the hell up.

463
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:25,310
Let's...

464
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:28,147
let's go west, just get...

465
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:33,685
get away from all this
grief and misery.

466
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,754
It's tearing us apart.

467
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,760
Go away with me, Nance.

468
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:44,096
Let's go.
Let's go.

469
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:55,874
I'll be in Pikeville
with a real man.

470
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,913
Me and Frank Phillips,

471
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:03,148
we're getting married.

472
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,711
T.C. Crawford
from<i>the New York world.</i>

473
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,781
I have a few questions about
the origin of this feud.

474
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:37,716
No feud,

475
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,351
not from how I see it.

476
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:42,087
Well, how would you
describe it, sir?

477
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:44,656
A many-year campaign of
swindling and murdering

478
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,258
against my family.

479
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:49,561
By Anse Hatfield and his clan?

480
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:51,230
Devil Anse Hatfield.

481
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,235
Well, governor Wilson
of West Virginia has said

482
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:58,870
the men arrested
for your sons' murders

483
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:00,839
were taken illegally.

484
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:02,841
There was an error
of paperwork.

485
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,209
Our courts will adjudicate it.

486
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:05,811
My house burnin'
was no paper error.

487
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:12,884
No court can resolve
my daughter, my son shot dead,

488
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,289
my wife so grievously injured,

489
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:21,593
atrocities that a just God
would not allow!

490
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:22,794
May we take a photograph, sir?

491
00:32:30,303 --> 00:32:32,404
Your weapon.

492
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,606
I want you to hold it, please.

493
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:37,476
Our readers will really
appreciate this.

494
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,077
Just hold the gun up
a little bit higher.

495
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:40,812
It's all right, Randall.

496
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:42,948
Shows we're serious
about justice.

497
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:44,883
You look righteous, sir.

498
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:47,452
There's going to be a flash.

499
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:56,528
Sally, you still getting them
headaches?

500
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,363
You all right?

501
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,704
Hey, mama.

502
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:08,106
Hey, it's Roseanna.

503
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:10,175
- Rosie?
- Yeah.

504
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:16,214
Anything you need?

505
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:17,649
She... she's all right.

506
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:23,288
Oh, mama.

507
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,834
I know where you can find
Jim Vance.

508
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,803
Yeah?

509
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,671
Tell me about it.

510
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,428
Uhhuh.

511
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,330
Don't alter your pace.

512
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:07,399
Don't look about.

513
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,202
There's men concealed
in them trees up ahead of us.

514
00:34:10,236 --> 00:34:11,269
Who is it?
Phillips?

515
00:34:11,304 --> 00:34:13,004
Most likely.

516
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,208
Should have killed that goddamn
fox years ago.

517
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:17,976
Look here, Cap.

518
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,778
When all this starts,
you not being dead,

519
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:22,247
you break downhill.

520
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,483
You understand, son?
Yes, sir.

521
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:27,252
Skedaddle.

522
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:47,205
Ah!

523
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,981
Stay down, Jim!

524
00:34:59,452 --> 00:35:01,019
Run, Cap!

525
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:02,587
Run!

526
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,323
No sense in both of us eatin'
these bastards' bullets!

527
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:11,863
Ah!

528
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,100
Jim!

529
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:18,703
God damn it, boy!

530
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:20,238
I said, get!

531
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:22,908
Or else I'll come back from hell
and tan your hide!

532
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:24,042
Jim!

533
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:34,686
Give me that damn rifle.

534
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,313
Ah, shit.

535
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:03,014
Son of a bitch.

536
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:09,254
Leave him be!

537
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,889
He's mine!

538
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:19,698
Oh.

539
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:21,333
I'm terrible sorry,

540
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:22,534
howls junior.

541
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,606
So sorry.

542
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,008
I do believe this is
the end of the line.

543
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,816
I'll be right behind you, boy.

544
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,817
Right behind you.

545
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,160
Don't shoot.

546
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:50,362
Not yet.

547
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:54,199
Time to meet your maker.

548
00:36:57,436 --> 00:36:59,471
Which way you gonna go,
uncle Jim?

549
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:06,678
Got my damn boots all dusty.

550
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:17,923
It's Cap!

551
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:20,759
He's hurt!

552
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:21,726
Mr. Hatfield.

553
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,727
Mr. Hatfield.

554
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,995
Mr. Hatfield.

555
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,096
Cap got shot.

556
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:26,231
Lord Jesus, what happened?

557
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:27,933
Get away from him.

558
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,568
- Posse got uncle Jim.
- All right.

559
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:32,938
Bad Frank shot him
in an ambush.

560
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:34,072
Killed his dog.

561
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:35,574
Guy shot me,

562
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:36,942
there ain't no lead in there,
mama.

563
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:37,776
All right.
All right.

564
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,911
I'm all right.

565
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:41,880
You said they got Jim?

566
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:44,783
Where is he?

567
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:46,751
Where is he, Cap?

568
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:51,423
They...
he's dead, pa.

570
00:37:51,457 --> 00:37:53,558
They took his body.

571
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:55,260
All right.
All right.

572
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:56,361
All right.

573
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:57,429
- I'm sorry.
- Uncle Jim.

574
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:59,497
I'm sorry.

575
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:00,632
Where's Johnse at?

576
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,067
He at his cabin?

577
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,836
Bad Frank is gonna probably
hit him next.

578
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,871
I'll get some boys
to ride by Johnse,

579
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:08,373
make sure he's all right.

580
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,175
Take him to the stream
to wash off that blood and dirt.

581
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:11,543
I'll get some tincture
and bandages.

582
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:15,747
How'd they know
where we was, pa?

583
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,782
Huh?

584
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:31,796
Your snoring used to
keep me awake.

585
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,768
Now it's the silence.

586
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,872
My mind won't rest.

587
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,344
You thinking about uncle Jim?

588
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:53,485
I always thought someday
I'd have to...

589
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,954
have to kill him myself.

590
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,226
Well...

591
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:05,597
It's a miracle
Cap wasn't killed too.

592
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:15,206
Only two people knew
where Jim and Cap had gone,

593
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:17,375
where they'd be that day.

594
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,044
Who?

595
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:21,813
Me...

596
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,950
And Johnse.

597
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:33,324
How do you know that?

598
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,793
Anybody could have
said something.

599
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:35,894
I know.

600
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:36,761
No, Cap or Jim...

601
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:37,729
I know.

602
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:42,100
I know, 'cause I made sure.

603
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:50,375
Johnse's no Judas.

604
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:56,014
No, he's not,
but people died, Levicy.

605
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,149
Well, you can't say you
didn't have a part in that?

606
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:03,021
And that
I'll have to live with,

607
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:06,958
but we both know our boy's
not a careful person,

608
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:09,094
especially around women.

609
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:16,901
What do you intend to do?

610
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,341
Get some sleep.

611
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,342
Anderson?

612
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:28,613
You should too.

613
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:39,958
Good boy.

614
00:40:58,577 --> 00:40:59,477
Hey, daddy.

615
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:04,048
How long you been
standing there?

616
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,484
A while.

617
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,254
Where were you the other day?

618
00:41:09,288 --> 00:41:15,360
Oh, I was up in
Boone county making a delivery,

619
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:16,461
you know.

620
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:21,566
You, uh...

621
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,934
You going to work this morning?

622
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,838
Thought you and me
might go fishing.

623
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:31,109
Today?

624
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,748
When you finish there,
saddle my horse.

625
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:44,656
All right.

626
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:01,706
What are you doing?

627
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,008
Me and Johnse
are gonna have a talk.

628
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,977
I have to know what that means.

629
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:11,349
You think I mean him harm?

630
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:13,484
I need to hear otherwise.

631
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:19,624
I will hear you say it.

632
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:25,230
I'm taking him fishing, Levicy.

633
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,521
So long, big brother.

634
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:20,818
You sure you don't
want to fish?

635
00:43:22,655 --> 00:43:24,756
I'm going to.

636
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:26,676
You remember the last time

637
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,111
you brought me out
to this old fishing hole?

638
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:32,682
I don't recall that.

639
00:43:32,716 --> 00:43:34,383
I do.

640
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:35,585
I know, 'cause I was in that

641
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,855
willow tree over there
up in that limb.

642
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,556
You recall what you said to me?

643
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:43,726
I do.

644
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,095
You said if I fell in,

645
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:48,297
I was gonna scare the fish.

646
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:51,587
And once I was in,
chances of you getting me out

647
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:53,856
weren't good on account
that you were not partial

648
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,592
to cold water.

649
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:58,661
You recall having said that?

650
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,837
Well, I believe I just coaxed
a laugh out of you, pa.

651
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:10,206
God damn, I don't remember
the last time I seen that.

652
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,612
It's too bad about
you and the McCoy girl.

653
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,148
Which one?

654
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:22,218
The one that ran off
with the man

655
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,387
that killed your uncle Jim.

656
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,759
You recall pretty good, Johnse.

657
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:33,429
Anything you want to say to me?

658
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:38,167
I know I shouldn't have trusted her.
I know that for damn sure.

659
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,072
You know, I hate all this.

660
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:45,741
I always have.

661
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:49,078
I think all I ever wanted to do
was play,

662
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:52,315
just laugh and play.

663
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:58,954
Yeah, it seems like nobody
around here ever laughs anymore,

664
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,624
except maybe when a McCoy
gets maimed or killed.

665
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:09,732
You know, that must be a trial
for you, daddy,

666
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:11,867
me not being like you.

667
00:45:11,902 --> 00:45:14,003
You are who you are, Johnse.

668
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:15,938
No, what I mean is,

669
00:45:15,972 --> 00:45:18,507
everybody looks up to you,

670
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:20,176
I mean,
even your older brothers.

671
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:25,114
No, there ain't...

672
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:27,249
there ain't nobody
looking up to me.

673
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:30,086
Hell, there are those that say

674
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,555
Cotton Top's of more use.

675
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:37,927
I don't know
how to be in this family.

676
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:39,695
I mean, I got...

677
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,197
I got all the memories,
you know?

678
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:42,298
I know all that's happened.

679
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:43,532
I just...

680
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:49,105
I don't have the hate that comes
with being a Hatfield.

681
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,776
You know, I look up
at that sky, pa,

682
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,244
and those clouds going by.

683
00:45:58,448 --> 00:45:59,915
I'm telling you,
I know they're headed

684
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,687
somewhere different
than what we got here.

685
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,857
I seen these pictures
and these stories about Oregon.

686
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,726
Man, they got these millions
of trees to be logged,

687
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,696
I mean, even more than here,

688
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:18,701
wild rivers with fish long
as your arm,

689
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,836
no McCoys to shoot at
or get shot by.

690
00:46:23,173 --> 00:46:26,208
That's heaven on earth.

691
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:27,476
That's what that is.

692
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:31,013
That's where I aim to go.

693
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:37,286
You won't outrun yourself
in Oregon, Johnse.

694
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:44,360
Can I ask you a question?

695
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:51,700
If I would have
fell in that day,

696
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,836
scared those fish...

697
00:46:57,407 --> 00:46:59,208
Would you have let me drown?

698
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,487
That's a big old bear.

699
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:23,626
Johnse bagged him
when he come up behind us.

700
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,960
I never seen him.

701
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:27,396
That boy always did have
quick reflexes.

702
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,134
He's just...

703
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:36,739
Too damn handsome
for his own good.

704
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:37,940
Though, he's a lot like
his daddy,

705
00:48:37,974 --> 00:48:39,808
except for the handsome part.

706
00:48:39,843 --> 00:48:43,612
Boy's nothing like me.

707
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:45,514
What brings you out
this frosty morn?

708
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,921
Well, I got news
about our appeal.

709
00:48:51,955 --> 00:48:53,289
Governor Windy's taking it
all the way

710
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:55,724
to the United States
supreme court.

711
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:58,460
Now we gonna be in the lawbooks,
maybe.

712
00:48:58,495 --> 00:48:59,762
Get our boys out of jail,

713
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:01,230
back in their homes
where they belong.

714
00:49:01,264 --> 00:49:03,499
Anybody who knows anything about
jurisprudence

715
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,234
says there ain't no doubt.

716
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:08,537
Only one thing gonna
resolve this, big brother.

717
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,940
And it ain't miss jurisprudence.

718
00:49:14,878 --> 00:49:16,412
I don't know what you're
planning here, Anse,

719
00:49:16,446 --> 00:49:18,247
but all this damn bloodshed

720
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:19,515
and killing's got to stop.

721
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,586
Uncle Jim was the last straw.

722
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:28,057
I'm turning myself in.

723
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,530
You insane?

724
00:49:34,564 --> 00:49:37,499
Them blaggard's will shoot
you down.

725
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:39,568
I already sent word
to Perry Cline.

726
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,072
Perry Cline.

727
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,541
You think that skunk
will keep his word?

728
00:49:45,575 --> 00:49:47,242
It's done, Anse.

729
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:48,978
I'm gonna fight this thing
the best way I know how.

730
00:49:49,012 --> 00:49:50,980
I'm gonna fight it
in the courtroom.

731
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:52,481
In a Kentucky courtroom.

732
00:49:55,418 --> 00:49:57,319
But not with a damn gun.

733
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:03,025
Well, guns never
failed me, wall,

734
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,228
not like judges and lawyers.

735
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:13,035
Well, it's gonna be the way
it's always been

736
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:14,236
between you and me,
little brother.

737
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,040
You gonna handle things your way,
and I'm gonna do them my way.

738
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:22,511
Wall, I never told you about
something I said to Ellison.

739
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:25,214
May be the last thing
he remembered, maybe not,

740
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:28,550
but it's haunted me ever since.

741
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:30,986
So right now, I don't want to...

742
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:32,621
Right now, I don't want to
say something to you

743
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:35,024
I'm gonna regret.

744
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,964
You ain't got no call
to worry about that, Anse.

745
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:00,582
Hey.

746
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:05,587
I'll be seeing you right after
I meet miss jurisprudence.

747
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:08,691
Ha!
Come on.

748
00:51:18,301 --> 00:51:19,668
Get over here.

749
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:32,948
My name is
justice wall Hatfield.

750
00:51:32,982 --> 00:51:35,818
I've surrendered myself
on a Kentucky warrant

751
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:37,653
for due process of the law.

752
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:42,458
Hatfield, you're under arrest.

753
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:43,826
I'm turning myself in,
Phillips.

754
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,961
You'll collect no bounty on me.

755
00:51:57,507 --> 00:52:00,209
Give me some of that,
pretty lady.

756
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,356
I ain't gonna do that.

757
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,192
No, not now.

758
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:22,097
Hey, hey, you mind if I borrow
my boss from you, ma'am?

759
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:27,136
<i>Logan banner.</i>

760
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,204
Says Hatfield's getting ready
for war again,

761
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:31,540
buying every hardware store
in three states

762
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:33,442
out of guns and ammo.

763
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:34,643
Hillbilly dirt rag.

764
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:35,744
Means nothing.

765
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:37,546
You need a drink.

766
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:42,718
Mr. Cline,
what's your pleasure?

767
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:44,486
Already got a fine libation.

768
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:48,357
I understand we're
celebrating more

769
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:51,160
than the capture
of wall Hatfield.

770
00:52:51,194 --> 00:52:53,929
Meet Miss Frank Phillips.

771
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,497
Congratulations.

772
00:52:55,532 --> 00:52:57,432
Mr. Phillips?

773
00:52:57,467 --> 00:52:59,134
Mr. Phillips?

774
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:01,670
A mob of Hatfields is forming
over at mate creek,

775
00:53:01,704 --> 00:53:03,772
Devil Anse himself at the lead.

776
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:06,642
Looks like they're a-fixing
to ride this way.

777
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:08,944
Hatfield's busting his
relatives out of jail.

778
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,012
We got to stop him, Frank.

779
00:53:10,046 --> 00:53:11,947
Round up the deputies.

780
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,683
Enlist every able-bodied man
you can.

781
00:53:14,717 --> 00:53:15,651
Yes, sir.

782
00:53:15,685 --> 00:53:17,686
Come on.
Come on.

783
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,589
About time I see Devil Anse.

784
00:53:20,623 --> 00:53:22,591
We got this, Mr. Cline.
We got this.

785
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,059
Kill them.

786
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:25,027
Yes, ma'am.

787
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:26,728
Every single one.

788
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:04,700
All right, let's go.

789
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,802
Come on.

790
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:18,380
The law be damned.

791
00:54:18,414 --> 00:54:20,415
Hatfield be damned!

792
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,084
God be damned!

793
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:24,186
Damn you all to perdition!

794
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,320
Hyah!

795
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:26,555
Hyah!

796
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:44,399
Hatfield!

797
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:46,735
McCoy!

798
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:48,737
Hatfield!

799
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:54,643
Fire!

800
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,551
Hatfield!

801
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:04,219
Get your old man back.

802
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:05,887
He's gonna be
the first one killed.

803
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:11,059
Yeah!

804
00:56:11,094 --> 00:56:12,194
You trying to
get yourself killed?

805
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:13,795
Leave me be!

806
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,732
Kill them all!

807
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,066
Kill them all!

808
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:32,714
Go.

809
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:36,985
Shoo!

810
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,286
Go!

811
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:52,868
You all right there, pop?

812
00:56:52,902 --> 00:56:54,569
Yeah, go on.

813
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,451
Damn it.

814
00:57:29,939 --> 00:57:31,473
God damn it!

815
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:33,175
Here!
He's here!

816
00:58:01,137 --> 00:58:02,704
Come back and fight!

817
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:11,012
Ah!

818
00:58:24,327 --> 00:58:26,328
Billy.

819
00:58:26,362 --> 00:58:27,629
Find cover, and stay put.

820
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:34,269
It's a trap!

821
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,070
It's a...

822
00:58:35,104 --> 00:58:36,738
Hey, get back!

823
00:58:36,772 --> 00:58:40,208
Get everybody back
to the horses!

824
00:59:28,224 --> 00:59:29,424
Anse.

825
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,092
We got to get out of here, Anse.

826
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,994
They're flanking us
on both sides.

827
00:59:53,182 --> 00:59:54,983
Mama.

828
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:58,353
Ah, son.

829
01:00:10,299 --> 01:00:11,433
Cap!

830
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:13,201
Cap!
What?

831
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:14,102
Pass the word.

832
01:00:14,136 --> 01:00:16,171
We're pulling out.

833
01:00:16,205 --> 01:00:17,305
Move!

834
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,974
Joe!

835
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:21,409
Help me here with Billy.

836
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:23,311
I'm taking him home to his mama.

837
01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:41,529
They're quitting the field.

838
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:49,037
Let's go.

839
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:58,413
Back!

840
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:10,425
Oh, call out to him.

841
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:13,995
When he stands up,
I'll blow his head off.

842
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,263
Hold off!

843
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,232
We got us a prisoner.

844
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:18,900
They don't.

845
01:01:18,934 --> 01:01:20,368
I give up!

846
01:01:20,403 --> 01:01:22,370
Means we won the day.

847
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:25,573
Go get him!

848
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:28,076
We won.

849
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,412
I won.

850
01:01:30,446 --> 01:01:34,215
Bless the baby Jesus.

851
01:01:35,551 --> 01:01:38,119
You all right?
Come on.

852
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:40,588
Move!

853
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:41,656
Stand up.

854
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,927
Come on, get!

855
01:01:52,784 --> 01:01:55,886
Just a few steps more.

856
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,289
Doctor said it was good for you
to walk.

857
01:01:59,324 --> 01:02:01,158
The room is not right.

858
01:02:01,192 --> 01:02:03,360
I know, mama.

859
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:04,495
It's Perry Cline's house.

860
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:05,729
That's why it looks different.

861
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:06,663
Here.

862
01:02:06,698 --> 01:02:08,465
I don't like Perry Cline.

863
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,733
I know, mama.

864
01:02:11,236 --> 01:02:14,204
After I die,

865
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,407
I would like my body
destroyed by electricity.

866
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,210
Can you remember that, Roseanna?

867
01:02:20,245 --> 01:02:21,545
Yes, mama.

868
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:26,350
I don't like Perry Cline.

869
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,821
I know, mama.

870
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:35,659
Uncle Randall?

871
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:39,530
Uncle Randall, we're here.

872
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:53,143
The hell are you doing here?

873
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:56,346
Frank Phillips asked me to
take you to Mr. Cline's house.

874
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:04,188
You disgust me.

875
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:25,375
How's your mother, Roseanna?

876
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,178
She's, uh...

877
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:30,113
She's better in some ways.

878
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:32,082
She's not right yet.

879
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:36,386
I hear tell
you're sick as well.

880
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:43,293
We was friends, Nancy.

881
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:48,198
Why'd you hurt me
the way you did?

882
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:54,471
You hurt yourself
taking up with Johnse.

883
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:58,108
Me marrying him just saved you
a whole lot of pain.

884
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:01,378
You love him?

885
01:04:06,084 --> 01:04:08,852
I never did.

886
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:12,990
I hate him, just like
all the demon Hatfields.

887
01:04:13,024 --> 01:04:17,427
Me and Johnse was never nothing
against you.

888
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:19,429
It's just plain old revenge.

889
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:23,333
I swore to killing Hatfields
when I was young.

890
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,007
Revenge is all I got
inside of me.

891
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,074
Yah.

892
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:48,992
Good news, judge.

893
01:04:49,027 --> 01:04:52,496
The supreme court has ruled,
incorrectly, I believe,

894
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,632
that taking you people
without West Virginia's consent

895
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:57,401
was illegal.

896
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,435
So we going free?

897
01:04:58,469 --> 01:04:59,436
Well, you hear that?

898
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,170
We're going free!

899
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:02,639
Selkirk.

900
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:05,442
A lawyer's smile
promises more to come.

901
01:05:05,476 --> 01:05:08,945
Court also ruled...
properly this time...

902
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,981
that since you're
already in Kentucky,

903
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:13,116
as long as you're
legally rearrested,

904
01:05:13,151 --> 01:05:14,985
you can be brought to trial.

905
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:18,355
Mr. Phillips?

906
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:21,792
Gentlemen,
y'all are under arrest.

907
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,918
It's your daughter Roseanna.

908
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:50,153
I'm coming up behind you.

909
01:05:50,188 --> 01:05:51,355
I'm standing next to you.

910
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:55,826
You see me, poppy?

911
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,794
You hear my voice?

912
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,764
I hear you.

913
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:06,503
Dead children,

914
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:08,338
a dead grandchild,

915
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:11,308
a mad wife.

916
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,811
Anybody'd think you'd embrace
a still-living daughter.

917
01:06:23,788 --> 01:06:26,323
When I was a little girl,

918
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,058
you once told me
I was your favorite.

919
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:32,629
I lived on that for years.

920
01:06:35,566 --> 01:06:40,771
Just that tiny bit of approval
made me believe

921
01:06:40,805 --> 01:06:43,440
I could do
anything in this world.

922
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,344
'Cause for all your preaching

923
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,513
and all your praying...

924
01:06:52,316 --> 01:06:54,584
In our house, you were God.

925
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,121
Here.
Let me take that for you.

926
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:36,426
You're looking
particularly pale today.

927
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:39,062
Are you well?

928
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,064
Yeah.

929
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,799
Thanks for asking.

930
01:07:45,069 --> 01:07:46,336
Roseanna.

931
01:07:49,807 --> 01:07:51,641
You know my...

932
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:53,977
my offer of years ago...

933
01:07:57,682 --> 01:07:59,416
It still stands.

934
01:08:01,352 --> 01:08:03,286
Oh, Perry.

935
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:04,287
You don't want me.

936
01:08:04,322 --> 01:08:05,822
I'm all used up.

937
01:08:05,857 --> 01:08:08,291
Don't say that.

938
01:08:08,326 --> 01:08:10,360
I do want you.

939
01:08:10,394 --> 01:08:11,461
I just want to make you happy...

940
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:12,496
Yeah.

941
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,964
And take care of you.

942
01:08:13,998 --> 01:08:17,400
I should probably just
do these dishes up.

943
01:08:17,435 --> 01:08:19,135
I've always loved you.

944
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:21,338
Roseanna.

945
01:08:21,372 --> 01:08:23,406
Roseanna!

946
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:25,442
Roseanna!

947
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,776
Randall!

948
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,144
Doc!

949
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:30,914
Roseanna, she's not...
she's not moving!

950
01:08:30,948 --> 01:08:31,882
She just fell!

951
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:33,116
I don't understand!

952
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,951
Randall, get in here!
Oh, my God!

953
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,553
Roseanna, can you hear me?

954
01:08:36,587 --> 01:08:37,787
Oh, my God.

955
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,955
She's bleeding!
She's bleeding!

956
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,690
What's wrong with her?

957
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,208
There, there, mother.

958
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:36,179
It'll be fine, just fine.

959
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,682
Doc rutherford says there's
a hospital in Lexington

960
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,550
that can help you.

961
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:44,921
You must let your heart break.

962
01:09:44,956 --> 01:09:47,991
Only when the most innocent
part of you suffers

963
01:09:48,025 --> 01:09:49,492
can there be change.

964
01:09:50,928 --> 01:09:53,730
Else nothing remains of you.

965
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,668
Is she able to talk today,
Randall?

966
01:09:58,703 --> 01:10:02,839
She speaks, but her words
carry no meaning.

967
01:10:02,873 --> 01:10:06,309
An improvement on all her
wailing and rabbit noises.

968
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:11,915
You're not sending me away
to get better.

969
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:15,218
You're sending me away so you
can go to hell with Perry Cline.

970
01:10:32,303 --> 01:10:34,037
Yah.

971
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,193
Is it true that I murdered
her in the first degree?

972
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,160
Alifair McCoy,

973
01:11:14,195 --> 01:11:16,196
you murdered her.

974
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,000
Did anyone tell you to say this?

975
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,970
You said to say
that no one did.

976
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:26,740
You mean no one told you
to say anything?

977
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,977
Only that I murdered her
in the first degree.

978
01:11:36,183 --> 01:11:38,985
I beg the court.

979
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,088
My client's nothing but
a poor, simpleminded fool.

980
01:11:43,824 --> 01:11:46,793
Born that way.

981
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:48,595
Now, he admits his guilt

982
01:11:48,629 --> 01:11:50,897
and throws himself
on the mercy of the court.

983
01:11:53,734 --> 01:11:55,435
Wall Hatfield,

984
01:11:55,469 --> 01:11:56,703
life in prison.

985
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,107
Selkirk McCoy,

986
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:03,076
life in prison.

987
01:12:05,179 --> 01:12:07,113
Alex Messer,

988
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:09,616
life in prison.

989
01:12:11,385 --> 01:12:13,720
"Cotton Top" Ellison Mounts,

990
01:12:13,754 --> 01:12:15,889
death by hanging.

991
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:21,895
That's fine.

992
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:24,297
'Cause Devil Anse, Cap,
and all of them

993
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:27,934
gonna come at midnight
all armed and terrible,

994
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:29,903
riding dark horses
with lightning hooves

995
01:12:29,937 --> 01:12:31,871
that don't never die.

996
01:12:31,906 --> 01:12:33,873
They won't let me hang.

997
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:44,284
I'm letting him out.

998
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,386
Give me the keys.

999
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,421
I'm letting him out.

1000
01:12:48,456 --> 01:12:49,856
The only Hatfield
they're hanging

1001
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,092
is the one
that don't deserve it.

1002
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:53,793
It's bad luck to hang a...

1003
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,129
it's bad luck to hang
a half-wit.

1004
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,231
No, that's an old wives'
tale, Randall.

1005
01:12:58,265 --> 01:13:00,266
Where is my justice?

1006
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:01,835
Where is it?

1007
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:05,972
You know, you need to go home
and sober up some.

1008
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:09,008
You

1009
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:10,176
you get to live...

1010
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:16,883
While my sons, my daughter
rot in their graves.

1011
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,192
I might as well
let you out too.

1012
01:13:26,227 --> 01:13:28,695
Give me the goddamn keys.

1013
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,171
Get him out of here.

1014
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,650
Was there a point
where one of us

1015
01:14:23,684 --> 01:14:26,553
could have gave way
to stop all this nonsense?

1016
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,222
I guess you can
contemplate that.

1017
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,424
You still got something left.

1018
01:14:32,493 --> 01:14:34,327
What do you want, Randall?

1019
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,895
Hmm?

1020
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,864
What do you want
out of this life?

1021
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:43,870
Just get through it.

1022
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:47,407
If ever two men misunderstood
each other,

1023
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,909
it was us.

1024
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,178
So when does it end?

1025
01:14:52,213 --> 01:14:54,747
When there's no blood left
to be spilled.

1026
01:14:58,986 --> 01:15:00,420
That way don't work, Randall.

1027
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:04,791
We tried that way.

1028
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:50,603
I figure we go
in the dead of night

1029
01:15:50,638 --> 01:15:52,705
when the fog is thickest.

1030
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,574
Get five men blazing away
in the north end

1031
01:15:54,608 --> 01:15:57,443
causing commotion
like Pikeville had never seen.

1032
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:59,779
And we charge that jail with
everybody else...

1033
01:15:59,813 --> 01:16:01,614
Nobody's busting anybody
out of jail.

1034
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:04,917
What?

1035
01:16:04,952 --> 01:16:07,153
Uncle wall, your big brother,

1036
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:08,454
got life for doing nothing.

1037
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:10,990
Wall wouldn't go anyways.

1038
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:12,458
He's fighting it with appeals.

1039
01:16:12,493 --> 01:16:16,796
Still thinks
he'll get out legal.

1040
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,432
What about Cotton Top?

1041
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:21,601
We're telling every goddamn
newspaper in the country

1042
01:16:21,635 --> 01:16:23,670
we're coming for him.

1043
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,140
When Cotton Top's hanged,

1044
01:16:27,174 --> 01:16:29,242
it'll take away
the McCoy bloodlust.

1045
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,779
When he's hanged?

1046
01:16:36,183 --> 01:16:37,784
So cotton's our Judas goat?

1047
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:43,890
Somebody's got to bend
to stop it.

1048
01:16:43,924 --> 01:16:45,692
Randall can't, so...

1049
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,128
It's got to be me.

1050
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:58,705
Pa, you... you done enough.

1051
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,273
It's time I take over.

1052
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:02,742
I don't want that for you.

1053
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:04,744
Weren't you listening to me?

1054
01:17:10,184 --> 01:17:14,520
Cap, you gonna... you gonna
have children one day,

1055
01:17:14,555 --> 01:17:16,556
and your children,

1056
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,725
they're not gonna care
about our old grudges

1057
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:22,628
and slights from long ago.

1058
01:17:22,663 --> 01:17:25,565
And their children...

1059
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:30,403
Hell, their children won't even
know about it.

1060
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,772
It's time for us
to move on, son.

1061
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:00,764
Oh.

1062
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:01,831
Damn.

1063
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:03,033
Damn it.

1064
01:18:04,702 --> 01:18:07,504
Levicy, you all right?

1065
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:14,411
I miss Johnse.

1066
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,615
I miss our son.

1067
01:18:22,153 --> 01:18:27,324
I sometimes wonder how different
things might have turned out

1068
01:18:27,358 --> 01:18:29,526
had I allowed him
to marry the first one.

1069
01:18:33,397 --> 01:18:37,500
Well, Roseanna was a McCoy.

1070
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:42,138
We had to do
what we thought was right.

1071
01:18:50,815 --> 01:18:52,048
Let me see.
Let me see.

1072
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,020
Ow!

1073
01:18:57,054 --> 01:18:57,954
Let's get out of here!

1074
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:02,459
Got to get this thing over with

1075
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:04,794
before we go to war again.

1076
01:19:28,786 --> 01:19:30,654
Tell me again,
what's so important

1077
01:19:30,688 --> 01:19:32,022
we had to dress up the girls

1078
01:19:32,056 --> 01:19:33,490
and bring them all the way here

1079
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:36,426
for something
you can hardly see?

1080
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,029
This is history.

1081
01:19:39,063 --> 01:19:42,032
Hatfields and McCoys are famous.

1082
01:19:42,066 --> 01:19:44,200
Famous for what?

1083
01:19:44,235 --> 01:19:45,268
Killing each other.

1084
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:15,932
Come here.

1085
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:20,970
Let's gather over here.

1086
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:41,257
Most of you
have done some trapping

1087
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,059
and, on occasion,
found a winter fox

1088
01:20:43,094 --> 01:20:45,295
that's left his leg
behind him in the trap.

1089
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:53,036
So it is with us
on this difficult day.

1090
01:20:54,538 --> 01:20:58,208
Leave our leg behind,

1091
01:20:58,242 --> 01:21:00,043
or die in the trap.

1092
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:05,982
Got a letter here that we're
gonna send to the newspapers.

1093
01:21:06,016 --> 01:21:09,385
I wanted you to all
hear it first.

1094
01:21:11,889 --> 01:21:15,358
"I do not...

1095
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:18,528
"I do not wish to keep
the old feud alive."

1096
01:21:36,046 --> 01:21:40,183
"I suppose everybody,
like myself,

1097
01:21:40,217 --> 01:21:44,387
"is tired of the names
'Hatfield' and 'McCoy'

1098
01:21:44,421 --> 01:21:46,623
"and border warfare in a time
of peace.

1099
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:02,772
"The war spirit in me
has abated.

1100
01:22:02,807 --> 01:22:07,010
"And I sincerely rejoice
at the prospect of peace.

1101
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:14,250
"I've devoted my life to arms,

1102
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:16,519
"and we have undergone
a fearful loss

1103
01:22:16,554 --> 01:22:20,056
"of Noble lives
and valuable property

1104
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:22,392
in this hateful struggle."

1105
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:24,027
The Hatfields made me do it.

1106
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:27,096
They hornswoggled me with love.

1107
01:22:44,048 --> 01:22:47,050
"We, being like Adam,

1108
01:22:47,084 --> 01:22:51,154
"are not
the first transgressors.

1109
01:22:51,188 --> 01:22:56,025
And I propose to rest
in the spirit of peace."

1110
01:23:07,905 --> 01:23:09,372
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Obliged.

1111
01:23:11,342 --> 01:23:14,777
Sheriff, my name is Alexander.

1112
01:23:14,812 --> 01:23:16,045
I'm a big fan of yours.

1113
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,313
Alexander?

1114
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:19,282
Well, thank you, son.

1115
01:23:19,316 --> 01:23:21,017
"Bad Frank" there, right there.

1116
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:25,555
Congratulations, Frank.

1117
01:23:25,589 --> 01:23:26,155
I read it.

1118
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,892
It's...

1119
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:30,827
Well, I, too,
am to be congratulated.

1120
01:23:30,861 --> 01:23:32,495
Meet Miss Carolyne Roes,

1121
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:34,330
of the Roes of Lexington.

1122
01:23:34,365 --> 01:23:35,698
She's my fiancee.

1123
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:37,634
They own half the county

1124
01:23:37,668 --> 01:23:40,169
and quite a stable
of fine racehorses.

1125
01:23:41,705 --> 01:23:44,974
You like them young,
don't you, Cline?

1126
01:23:45,009 --> 01:23:47,010
You cradle-robbing snake.

1127
01:23:50,014 --> 01:23:51,981
She ain't no drunkard,

1128
01:23:52,016 --> 01:23:53,783
and this laughable pack of lies
ain't nothing

1129
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:55,151
but a waste of cheap paper.

1130
01:23:55,185 --> 01:23:57,754
You son of a bitch!

1131
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,656
Come on!

1132
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,456
Any time!

1133
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,592
Boss, come on!

1134
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:04,160
Get out of here!

1135
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:07,497
Boss?
Boss?

1136
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,824
I shall miss him.

1137
01:24:37,761 --> 01:24:41,364
Bad Frank could kill Hatfields
like no one else!

1138
01:25:22,106 --> 01:25:23,606
I'm coming after you,

1139
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,674
Devil Anse!

1140
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,641
You hear me?

1141
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,643
You hear me?

1142
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:30,480
I'm coming to hell after you!
