1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,007
What are
y'all doing?

2
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,895
Get back in the field.

3
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,906
Slavery's over.
We can leave if we want.

4
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,909
Mr. Duke, you think them Union
soldiers come back

5
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,241
if they hear tell of
black folks gettin' stopped?

6
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,474
Well, maybe you can go,
but you sure as hell ain't

7
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,277
takin' one of my mules.

8
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,341
This here my mule,
Mr. Duke.

9
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,819
You, uh,
made my buy him.

10
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,651
Deducted from my pay.

11
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,783
Well, in that case,
your animal is looking at me funny,

12
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,259
like he wants to
bite me.

13
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,296
Bite?
He barely got no teeth.

14
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,991
That's why you made
Winton buy him.

15
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,899
There. Now you can carry
your own stuff to Kansas.

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,499
Oh no no no no.

17
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,408
We got rights!

18
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,607
Hold my horse.

19
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,674
- Take it!
- You ain't got no cause, Mr. Billy!

20
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,188
We been free
a dozen years now.

21
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,816
Ever heard of a little struggle
called the Civil War?

22
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,793
Emancipation Proclamation

23
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,488
ever go by your ear?

24
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,759
How about this?

25
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,734
Did it ever
pass your ears?

26
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,477
You're just opening
old wounds.

27
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,650
Now you turn 'em over

28
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,990
so it browns on
both sides, you see?

29
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,553
You remember what I told you
about the onions?

30
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,099
Mr. Reese?
Mr. Reese?

31
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,899
There.

32
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,045
Turn around.

33
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,296
Did he do this?

34
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,025
Junebug got
the worst of it.

35
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,431
Next time,
I don't know.

36
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,469
Ain't gonna be
a next time.

37
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,209
- Sir.
- 'Morning.

38
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,778
When I first invited you,
a Confederate war hero,

39
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,618
onto my plantation,

40
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,557
you didn't present yourself
as Negro-soft.

41
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,357
You hired me to
oversee the hands.

42
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,364
If Billy lays on
the whip again,

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
he's gonna have to
deal with me.

44
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,531
Reese,

45
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,696
he's my blood son.

46
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,262
Then you warn him.

47
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,003
Warn who?
About what?

48
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,870
Daddy,

49
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,346
look at that.

50
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,211
That is my idea.

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,618
Right, Daddy?

52
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,816
You know the hands want
to be paid in cash.

53
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,190
No, you're paid in cash
'cause you're a white man.

54
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,523
Here's your month's pay.

55
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,064
Go make sure to buy your wife
something pretty.

56
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,243
This means trouble.

57
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,803
I tell you one thing:

58
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,009
Once the crop's in,
we'll say "Fare thee well, Mr. Duke,"

59
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,815
and we'll set up housekeeping
wherever your pretty heart desires...

60
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,449
California, Timbuktu,
I don't care.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,385
I would just prefer

62
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,589
our cabin by the swamp.

63
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,331
Why'd you choose me
anyway?

64
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,633
I was old and poor
and beaten down

65
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,537
even before the war.

66
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,704
Mm-hmm.

67
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,941
I adore you.

68
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,782
Just adore you.

69
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,463
- 'Morning to you all.
- 'Morning.

70
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,471
- Good morning, sir.
- 'Morning.

71
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,983
Cash is kind of short
since the war, Winton.

72
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,883
Short for the Negro?

73
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,014
Still spends like money.

74
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,081
Not anymore.

75
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,759
They done raised all
the store prices.

76
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,596
Mm-hmm. How much?

77
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,170
So you pay them funny money
they can only spend here,

78
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,182
then you double and
triple the prices?

79
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,413
Uh, Reese, that's just
sound business practice.

80
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,683
Taking advantage of
a captive market.

81
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,724
Wanna hit me?
Hmm?

82
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,935
You're fired.

83
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,098
I knew guys like you
during the war.

84
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,574
When the battle started,
you'd hide.

85
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,634
When the fighting stopped,
you came out.

86
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,702
And you bayoneted
the wounded,

87
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,510
then you bragged about
how many Yankees you killed.

88
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,380
You coward.

89
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,948
Get up.

90
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,196
You want me to
arrest him?

91
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,300
No, just throw
his ungrateful ass

92
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,538
out of my overseer's
house.

93
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:38,016
See how his pride holds up
once he can't feed his family.

94
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,144
Y'all listen up!

95
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,849
From now on, I'll be
supervising y'all directly,

96
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,221
you lazy Negros!

97
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,954
I'll be working you
can to can't...

98
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,555
when you can see in the morning to
when you can't see at night.

99
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,929
You hear me?

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,264
No, sir.

101
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,095
I'm on strike.

102
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,038
We on strike.

103
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,648
What you mean,
you're on strike?

104
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,212
You don't even know
what a strike is!

105
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes, we do.

106
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,891
And you about to find out
what one is too, sir.

107
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,257
What do you coloreds
expect to achieve?

108
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,353
You already got freedom.

109
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,898
Freedom?

110
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,094
Well, it sure don't feel like
no freedom, Judge Duke,

111
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,070
not when your son can
beat us whenever he pleases,

112
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,006
then pay us in
worthless paper.

113
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,372
Right!

114
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,674
You don't work,
you don't eat.

115
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,408
You don't get no rations.
What are you gonna eat?

116
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,882
Mule meat make a fine stew.

117
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,385
Sure made a mess of things
this time, Billy.

118
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,132
Ho! Ho!

119
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,047
I want to go.

120
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,744
My wife at a planter's meeting?
You can't.

121
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,946
Then give me
some money then.

122
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,489
You never buy anything.

123
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,861
This time,
spend what I give you.

124
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,625
You can afford to
buy you a pretty thing.

125
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,757
Oh, you go see to
men's business

126
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,701
and leave it to your wife
how frivolous to be.

127
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,711
In the olden days, when the heathens
took over the Promised Land,

128
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,909
the Crusaders wore a big
cross on themselves...

129
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,214
Judge, please,
they were knights

130
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,844
on a war horse.

131
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,446
They scared the living shit
out of those infidels.

132
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,020
All right, shut your fans.
Let the judge talk now.

133
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,658
There is no way
we can negotiate

134
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,134
with the strikers.

135
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,637
They're demanding that we
work them no more

136
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,401
than 12 hours a day.

137
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,240
And no work at all
on Sunday.

138
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,839
Now what's next?
Christmas in July?

139
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,908
Is that all right
with you, Sheriff?

140
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,477
No, sir!
That all right with you?

141
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,523
- No! No!
- No!

142
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,889
Your Honor, uh, we could
just start busting some heads

143
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,121
and fix this real fast.

144
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,826
We all got some Negro-lovin'
white folks

145
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,426
could use
a head-whopping too.

146
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,705
This is not as big a cabin
as you're used to, my boy.

147
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,073
- What've you got there?
- Oh, this is heavy.

148
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,879
Oh, give me that.
Give it here.

149
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,183
- There we go.
- Thank you.

150
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,247
You want some water?
Here.

151
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,296
Darlin', heaven's
where you make it.

152
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,914
They ran us out.

153
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,648
Said if we won't chop cotton,
we can't stay in them quarters.

154
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,158
Them cabins weren't fit
for living in no-how.

155
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,694
Besides, back in
slavery days,

156
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,890
the runaway slaves used to hide
in these thickets and get fat.

157
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,899
- Ain't that right, y'all?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,332
We gonna be all right.

159
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,164
We gonna be
all right.

160
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,569
- Ain't that right, y'all?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,077
Whoa. Whoa.

162
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,591
This your wife and
boy here?

163
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,489
Just on patrol.

164
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,728
Don't want no trouble.

165
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,283
- Let's go.
- Junebug!

166
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,791
Come on.
Let's move.

167
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,495
You take 'em to the thicket. I'm gonna
stay here and give you some time.

168
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,895
I'll stay.
You go.

169
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,991
Junebug,
I'll stay.

170
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,002
You go.

171
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,305
Get on.
They comin'.

172
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,073
Y'all gonna quit
before my harvest?

173
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,576
We're striking.

174
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,113
Striking.

175
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,290
Listen, you stupid darky,

176
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,383
you still got to pay
room and board.

177
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,156
You gotta pay tool fees,
mule fees.

178
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,164
You gonna owe Duke Plantation
so deep,

179
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,996
I'm gonna work you a full year,
you're still gonna be in debt.

180
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,003
My hands're going
back to work.

181
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,939
What hands, master?

182
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,033
'Cause I don't see
nobody.

183
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,951
Wait! Please...

184
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,013
- Preacher!
- No. No worries...

185
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,286
Preacher, please please
please, don't let 'em do this.

186
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,850
Please don't let 'em
do this.

187
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,324
Preacher, Preacher,
don't let 'em do this.

188
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,866
Lord's work, boy.

189
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,131
You Negros got to learn to
render unto Caesar.

190
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,039
Please don't, please.

191
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,978
Please...
please don't do this!

192
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,510
Please don't do this.
Please please don't...

193
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,368
There you go.

194
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,035
What is...

195
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,583
Gabe,
come over here.

196
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,334
- Gabe, don't you look.
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,894
No, you let him look.

198
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,203
Let him see what evil men
do when good men let them.

199
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,476
- We might have lost Vicksburg...
- Hey, Reba.

200
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,144
...we might have lost
Gettysburg,

201
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,417
but praise God for
our victory today, huh?

202
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,723
I believe my daddy may even
say things were handled well today.

203
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,321
This is your day off!

204
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,890
Most days we're
working in the fields.

205
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,243
My friend, who's the biggest
toad in this puddle?

206
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,376
Harder!

207
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,989
That wasn't a fur-ball,
that was a whole cat, wasn't it?

208
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:57,126
Sir, allow me to
introduce myself.

209
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,261
My name is Ezra Tarwell.

210
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,898
I am an attorney.

211
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,468
Bumpy road back there.
I'm an attorney.

212
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:13,075
Your accent hardly
hangs with Spanish moss, Mr. Tarwell.

213
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,246
Yeah, I am a product of
Oswego, New York, sir.

214
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,518
But we mustn't let unfortunate
regional differences

215
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,320
stand in the way of civility.

216
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,588
Yeah, all that.

217
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,756
Let me speculate
on something.

218
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,959
When the war was over,

219
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,834
you and your carpet bag
decided to come down here

220
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,204
and make a profit out
of the tragedy

221
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,209
that they call
"Reconstruction."

222
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,735
Now the federal army's
moved on

223
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,941
and all of a sudden, you decide
to switch over to the white man's side.

224
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,848
Am... am I close?

225
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,284
Nearly.

226
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,186
Um, l... I am devoted

227
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,781
to justice
and prosperity.

228
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,953
Since justice is blind,
the only color I really care about

229
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,587
is green.

230
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,398
Damn your accent!

231
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,997
I love the way you talk.
Sit down, Mr. Tarwell.

232
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,010
- Sit down.
- That looks like someone was...

233
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,427
I want to report a murder.

234
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,471
Reese Paxton,

235
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,439
y'all know there ain't
no niggers allowed in here.

236
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,645
I know justice
for a black man

237
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,616
lies way below
what we expect for ourselves.

238
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,153
This was a human being.

239
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,553
What sanction
would you suggest

240
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,582
if our sheriff were to arrest
one of our fine citizens?

241
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,754
I ponder that question.

242
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,492
I know that pigs will fly before
this town will jail a white man

243
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,931
for killing a black,

244
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,630
but maybe you can fine them,
each according to what he can pay.

245
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,367
And him with
the deepest pockets

246
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,033
should give up
a piece of land

247
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,737
and give it to
this poor boy's family

248
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,178
so that they have
something of their own.

249
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,645
Reese?

250
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,379
Reese, maybe you
didn't notice,

251
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,684
but them Yankee soldiers,
they packed up; they gone home.

252
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,228
Maybe I get 'em
to come back.

253
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,424
Maybe I'll go
to Washington

254
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,127
with my Confederate medals,

255
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,863
of which you have none,

256
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,804
and maybe I'll tell them
that things down here have gone sour

257
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,501
way beyond what
I can swallow.

258
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,443
I have seen more killing...

259
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,482
than you can ever imagine.

260
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,678
You know, Reese,
you're right.

261
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,450
The man who's responsible for this,
he's got to be brought to justice.

262
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,787
Right!

263
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:50,966
I personally seen Reese Paxton
hang and shoot this here Negro.

264
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,936
You won't need
to arrest him.

265
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,900
Grab his arms.

266
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,910
Hold him! All right!
That's enough, that's enough.

267
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,416
Right now!

268
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,787
Our beloved federal government
promises a speedy trial.

269
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,622
Well, we'll give him one
right now.

270
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,391
We even got him
a lawyer.

271
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,601
Wait. What, me?

272
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,003
The right kind of
young attorney

273
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,271
could prosper mightily
in this town.

274
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,075
I want everything
done by the book.

275
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,551
I do not want this man getting out
on any kind of an appeal.

276
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,118
Hear ye, hear ye,

277
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,181
this court is now in
ad hoc session

278
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,920
in the saloon of
the Whore Palace

279
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,155
'cause the Yankees
burned down our courthouse;

280
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,129
Judge William Duke, Sr.
presiding;

281
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,666
Mr. William Duke, Jr.,
special prosecutor.

282
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,395
I'm doing my job here.

283
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,597
I'm out investigating
the strike labor activities.

284
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,334
I come upon Reese,
he's drawing a bead.

285
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,070
Ere he pulled back,
he plugged the nigger dead.

286
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,839
I said, "What'd you do?"

287
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,279
He says, "I just took
a damn fine shot."

288
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,578
What are you talking about?

289
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,585
- You swear to tell the truth?
- Yeah.

290
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,588
Hold on, I think
I'm supposed to interview the witness.

291
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,624
You were at Mr. Paxton's
cabin on the day in question?

292
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,852
Right. Right.
I remember it 'cause,

293
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,693
well, it ain't nothing to
see a nigger get whipped.

294
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,561
Ain't that often you get to
see one shot cold.

295
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,533
Reese Paxton shot that nigger
like a big old swamp rabbit.

296
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,933
This is bad.

297
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,339
Preacher, do you swear to
tell the truth?

298
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,399
I do.

299
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,072
Wait, now hold on...
Now hold on a minute.

300
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,115
- I did not cross-examine...
- Let me cut to the chase here.

301
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,480
Now you seen Reese Paxton
shoot that Negro?

302
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,782
- Well, actually it...
- Just answer the damn question.

303
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,688
- Yeah. Yeah, I saw it.
- That's good. Sit down.

304
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,059
No, excuse me.

305
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,395
Would you kindly ask him
about the Ninth Commandment?

306
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,799
What about
the Ninth Commandment?

307
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,496
Which is what?

308
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,233
"Thou shalt not bear
false witness."

309
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,741
"The servant will be
severely punished,

310
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,539
for though he knew his duty,

311
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,341
he refused to do it."...Luke 12.

312
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,142
How about the commandment,
"Thou shalt not kill"?

313
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,343
"As for these enemies of mine who do
not want me to be king of them

314
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,353
and slaughter them in my presence."
- Luke 19:27...

315
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,854
You're a preacher?

316
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,083
What about your wife?
Now you said that she saw...

317
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,685
- You keep my wife out of it.
- Fine.

318
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,665
Is there anyone who can
support your claim?

319
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,973
Him? Skinny one,
with the hat?

320
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,702
- Not exactly.
- Excuse me, sir, I'd like to

321
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,505
call you to the witness...
Ho!

322
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,512
Hey, there.
Hey, what goes on in there?

323
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,315
Billy Duke,
what are you doing?

324
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,087
Let Reese holler!
No one will listen.

325
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,991
You gonna refuse
to help mete out justice

326
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,757
for Reese Paxton,
are you, Caleb?

327
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,627
Well, you're gonna
find yourself refused.

328
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,133
Maybe you don't want my help
rebuilding that saw mill of yours

329
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,600
them federal boys
set on fire.

330
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,195
You hear me?

331
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,206
In there.

332
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,811
St... stand up, Caleb.

333
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,445
What do they want
you to do?

334
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,580
They want me to lie.

335
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,023
Daddy, Caleb is
feeling sickly.

336
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,027
I don't think his testimony's
gonna be missed.

337
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,689
I'd like to hear what
an appeals court has to say about that.

338
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,324
Oh, come on.

339
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,133
For a moment there, I thought
you managed to handle the situation.

340
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,292
Hey, Kate? Kate?

341
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,424
Kate, this is
a sporting house, you know?

342
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,489
Go on.

343
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,002
I understood it was
a courtroom.

344
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,740
Your Honor, I was at
the Paxton house that day.

345
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,478
And just as Caleb did,

346
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,917
I saw Reese Paxton
shoot that Negro.

347
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,304
Paxton...

348
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,041
your lawyer's here
to see you.

349
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,254
How you doing?

350
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,359
I was... was in prison
briefly.

351
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,800
Twice.

352
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,166
And a good attitude helps.

353
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,541
Preacher, I do not have
the time to listen

354
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,576
to the phantoms of
your guilty conscience.

355
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,408
A phantom...
that's just what Reese was.

356
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,744
During the war, he was
an assassin for the Confederacy,

357
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,545
going back and forth
between enemy lines.

358
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,482
Nobody knew how he did it...

359
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,316
just showing up
dealing death.

360
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,379
There's not a prison around that's
gonna hold a man like that.

361
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,152
Will you shut the hell up?

362
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,059
As long as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a lawyer.

363
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,292
I guess I should have
practiced, huh?

364
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,663
Get out.

365
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,694
Good luck.

366
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,113
The evildoer that repents

367
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,115
shall escape
everlasting fire.

368
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,983
Brother Reese, it says in
the Good Book, in Psalms

369
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:20,320
Chapter 34,
"Depart from evil, brother,

370
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,554
and do good. Seek ye peace
and pursue it."

371
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,391
"The face of the Lord is
against them that do evil.

372
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,160
...from this earth."

373
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,505
Hey!

374
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,565
Get back to work!

375
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,374
"...nurture your soul
and bring it out of you."

376
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,041
Old strike petered out,
did it?

377
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,949
Should give them a notion
of consequences.

378
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,782
Well, we owe you a debt, Amos.
No one's denying that.

379
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,823
Y'all should consider me
for being overseer here.

380
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,985
Let's take the long way
by Reese's cabin.

381
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,440
"...and I think I should
find it.

382
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,143
I think we can work together
and bring that out..."

383
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,052
Are you okay?
My God.

384
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,098
What is he doing in here?
Let him out of here!

385
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,096
You're just like
a one-eyed dog, Reese.

386
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,264
- I'm gonna get you out!
- I just want you to know,

387
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,968
while you're in prison
I'm gonna be taking care of your wife.

388
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,035
No! Ah, Billy!
Let go of me, Billy.

389
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,281
Gabe, get away.
Get away! Oh!

390
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,843
Someone find help!
Get some help, boy!

391
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,253
Your husband...
your husband...

392
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,521
is found guilty of hanging
and shooting a Negro.

393
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,086
Hang on, Angelique.

394
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,359
Your husband...

395
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,129
No no no!

396
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,660
Oh no no!

397
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,971
Get away from me!
Get!

398
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,682
Billy, his skull
is cracked.

399
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,812
He ain't gonna make it.

400
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,823
No, he's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be just fine!

401
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,155
Get away. Leave him alone.
Get away from him.

402
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,992
- Let me see.
- You get away from him.

403
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,396
- Get away from him!
- Let me see him now.

404
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,434
Get away!

405
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,587
Throw him in the well.

406
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,058
Throw him in the well!

407
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,498
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey.

408
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,061
Let's just ride out
of here.

409
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,879
- Amos, wait a minute!
- Whoa whoa.

410
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,119
Now he's gonna get
none of our ears.

411
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,353
She ain't.

412
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,918
Amos is right, Billy.
She's gonna talk.

413
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,861
I know that.

414
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,592
What did you do
to my son?

415
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,226
Where is he?
Please!

416
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,135
- Why we gotta rush it?
- My boy, where is he?

417
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,080
Hold her down, boy.

418
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,079
- I'm going second.
- No no no!

419
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,677
Preacher, looks like
you're going last.

420
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,820
You gonna ride this bitch
just like the rest of us.

421
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,924
Please, no!

422
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,995
Move on.

423
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,009
Oh, a fresh herd
of cattle.

424
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,308
Yeah!
Better face it, boy,

425
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,712
you ain't gonna live out
your sentence in there.

426
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,651
You done poked your last woman and
had your last sip of whiskey.

427
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,917
We got a system here:

428
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,859
Prisoners are not men...

429
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,060
they're livestock.

430
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,099
Moving in!

431
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,969
When a man does evil,

432
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,304
he ought to
pay for his crime.

433
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,736
Agree?

434
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,643
I wholeheartedly agree.

435
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,411
Then you and me will
get on fine.

436
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,679
I doubt it.

437
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,089
Oh, you doubt it?

438
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,094
Get back in line!

439
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,398
Let that
ease your doubt.

440
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,702
- Done?
- Done.

441
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,440
Next.

442
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,675
Chow line, single file.

443
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,215
They're coming in!
Open the gate.

444
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,396
Get on in there.
Hurry it up.

445
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,459
Ain't got all day.

446
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,171
Get on up!
Get up off him, boy!

447
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,181
I'm talking to you, newbie!
Get up!

448
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,342
Get up!

449
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,011
Hold it right there.

450
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,225
Get back to work!

451
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,521
All right, back to work.

452
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,458
All right, everybody,
back to work.

453
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,931
Come on, new meat, get up!

454
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,195
Get up!

455
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,269
Move it here!
Let's go!

456
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,265
Don't make trouble there.

457
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,374
You were right, Paxton.

458
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,383
We won't get along.

459
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,785
Get in there!

460
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,122
Hurry it up!

461
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,826
You thirsty in there?

462
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,658
How about some
liquid refreshments?

463
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,092
Whoo.

464
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,438
What the hell?

465
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,645
Oh!

466
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,786
Hey hey!
The prisoner's fled!

467
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,087
A tunnel break!

468
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,855
He tunneled out!

469
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,405
Doggone!

470
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,871
He's gone.

471
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,103
The hole's only three feet deep.
Where'd he go?

472
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,307
Through the door
you left open.

473
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,541
Idiot!

474
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,707
Find him!

475
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,639
Are you dumb and stupid?

476
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,897
You thought I was
gonna drown you?

477
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,897
I ain't that nice.

478
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,617
We got a system here.

479
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,653
Prisoners are not men...

480
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,693
Get your ass up.
Come on!

481
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,695
- they're livestock!

482
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:49,028
When you got a bull that's ornery,
you cut off his horns!

483
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,694
If he don't improve,

484
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,601
you cut off his balls!

485
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,108
It's a simple system.

486
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,178
Never give up.

487
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,751
No!

488
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,188
If I could have your attention?

489
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,257
We got a very
important announcement

490
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,361
from a man that really needs
no introduction.

491
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,601
He's part of this town;
been here for years... Judge Duke.

492
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,642
William?

493
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,510
This proud day

494
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,777
marks a return

495
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:44,844
to our treasured
Southern traditions.

496
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,549
Ladies and gentlemen,

497
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,458
I want to introduce you
to our new mayor...

498
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,827
my son, Billy Duke!

499
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,096
Thank you.

500
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,470
Thank you.
Thank you, Daddy.

501
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,707
Thank you, Judge Duke. Thank you all
for braving this gorgeous day

502
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,648
for coming out and welcoming
me as your new mayor.

503
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,685
You all know my daddy.
You all know me.

504
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:19,154
You know that this town's been very
good to us. We make a good living here.

505
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,488
There's no one with deeper
fortitude or greater incentive

506
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,289
to restore us to
our former glory

507
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,025
before them federal boys come down
and paint us that awful shade of blue.

508
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,426
My first item,

509
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,471
I'm gonna buy y'all a drink
at Shaman Brothers.

510
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,563
Come on over.
The first drink's on me.

511
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,524
Take him down.

512
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,360
Thought you was gonna leave him
hanging up there till you killed him?

513
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,935
I did.

514
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,284
What are you all
standing there for?

515
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,452
Get back to work.

516
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,872
Hey.

517
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,789
Came out of the woods.

518
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,519
Saw him at the end of
the street down here.

519
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,359
He was right
down there.

520
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,872
- What you all looking at?
- Nothing.

521
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,347
Preacher's imagination.

522
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,403
Come on in.

523
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,874
Thank you.

524
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,384
Thank you.

525
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,757
We'll give your house
back, of course.

526
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,227
This cabin is yours.

527
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,399
Thank you.

528
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:33,797
You know,

529
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,170
Amos Halpern's
living in your old house.

530
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:41,677
He's not the sheriff
anymore.

531
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:46,114
I guess with him
as overseer,

532
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:51,052
there's been no talk of
strikes and such.

533
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,493
Thank you.

534
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:12,034
Uh, we catch the runoff
in a rain barrel.

535
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,045
Dry spell, we send grandbabies
down to the creek.

536
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,316
Never at the well.

537
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,813
Amos?
It's...

538
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,322
Shh!

539
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,471
The house is burning, Amos!

540
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,778
I'm right here!

541
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:16,255
Come on out!
Show yourself!

542
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,419
Who was that?

543
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,395
Come on out!

544
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,130
Fire! Fire!

545
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,237
- Right here!
- Get it out!

546
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,006
- Come on!
- Put out the fire!

547
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:45,787
Then the Lord sent
the Spirit into me.

548
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,990
Then the Lord sent
the Spirit into me.

549
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,990
Then the Lord
sent the Spirit into me.

550
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,303
Hello?

551
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,671
Hello?

552
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,243
Is somebody out there?

553
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,920
You won't find
the fire here.

554
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,002
You gonna pay for that?

555
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,041
Everybody pays.

556
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,127
Fighting for the property

557
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,825
We earned by honest toil

558
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,266
And when our rights
were threatened

559
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,895
The cry rose
near and far

560
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:26,431
Hurrah for that bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star.

561
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:31,173
When I get his makeup on,
he's gonna look almost happy.

562
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,783
Lyle's the only
fellow I know

563
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,328
that can sleep through
his own murder.

564
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,693
It's pretty vile.

565
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,595
I better hear from that
goddamned penitentiary.

566
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,191
Hell's bells, Mayor, you gotta wait for
the telegram to be delivered.

567
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,929
Did you tell 'em
it was urgent?

568
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,733
Did you tell me to tell him
it was urgent?

569
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,308
Hurrah for that
bonnie blue flag

570
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,708
That bears
a single star

571
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,940
Hurrah hurrah...

572
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,520
I want two headstones...

573
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:17,151
reading "My faithful wife"
and "My beloved son."

574
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,464
You take 'em up
to Bone's Landing.

575
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:24,659
That's where you'll find
two fresh graves.

576
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,275
You order more coffins.

577
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,677
First a devil,
then a ghost.

578
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:41,205
Now before the Headless
Horseman arrives, can we all just...

579
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,218
- What?
- It's addressed to him.

580
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,685
Then you read it!

581
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,722
But you read it
for all.

582
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,257
"Paxton died
four days past..."

583
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,383
There, you see?

584
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,327
"...stop.
Guard assigned to burial

585
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,864
- never came back."
- You know he ain't in that box.

586
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:59,026
Reese Paxton's
in town.

587
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,161
Reese Paxton's in town!

588
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,569
He just left my parlor.

589
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,507
- He left alive?
- Certainly he was alive.

590
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,043
Are you absolutely
positive?

591
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,635
I'm an undertaker.

592
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,112
I ought to know
a dead man if I see one.

593
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,583
Come on, Sheriff!

594
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,817
Oh, damn it!
Oh oh oh ah ah!

595
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,523
You done?

596
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,863
Obviously.

597
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,007
So I'll see you
next week?

598
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,344
Yeah. 'Less'n Caleb
doesn't pay me again.

599
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,680
Ha! Which has been
known to happen.
