0
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,647
There you are. One dollar.

1
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:23,783
Big oil strike in California. Read all about it.
Read all about it for 2 bits.

2
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,860
Big oil strike in California.

3
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,587
There's a plenty big one here, bub.

4
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,561
Yeah, if I could only get me a string...

5
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,326
...of equipment, I got a piece
of ground that's a honey.

6
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,265
You got ground? You got ground.

7
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,701
Here, take a look at the core
from my lease.

8
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,307
Smell it. Down 800 feet
and run out of pipe.

9
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,535
Well, if it's pipe and tools you need,
there's Luther Aldrich now.

10
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:43,838
That tightwad.

11
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:46,208
Luther Aldrich? Where?
Where is he? Wh...?

12
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,183
Hey, 6 bits, please. Thanks.

13
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:56,348
Get around the side of me, fella, will you?

14
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,722
- Come on, I'm getting out here.
- Come on, mule.

15
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:13,932
Hello, Luther, old boy. Well, I haven't
seen you since the Kansas boom.

16
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,102
- I don't think I quite...
- We made a lot of money there, didn't we?

17
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,649
- Sand. John Sand? You remember me.
- Sand? I don't think l...

18
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:25,413
I'm spudding in my first well down here.
I'm going down about 1700 feet...

19
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:28,682
...so I'll need quite a lot of equipment.
- Oh, equipment?

20
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:33,192
Yes. Mr. Sand, of course.
Well, come right over here.

21
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,228
What section are you thinking of drilling?

22
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:38,492
Well, my lease is in a new section
about 30 miles south of here.

23
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:43,071
- Thirty miles. A wildcat, huh?
- Some fellas might call it that.

24
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,866
Casing tools and lumber...

25
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,204
...will cost you about $ 7000 in cash.
- That's fine.

26
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:52,144
That's fine, fine. We'll just carry that
in an open account against my name...

27
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,409
...and then when the well comes in...
- I thought so, another deadbeat.

28
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:59,112
- These boomtowns reek with larceny.
- I may be down to my last couple bucks...

29
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:02,383
...but do you think I'd do it
if I didn't think there was oil?

30
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:04,890
You're an oil man, aren't you?
All oil men are crazy.

31
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,859
I've been swindled and hijacked
and I'm practically naked.

32
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:11,194
Mr. Aldrich, there's a million dollars in this.
Now, you know me.

33
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,892
I don't know you.
I don't know why I said I did.

34
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,233
What do people think I am, a good fairy?

35
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,119
Hey, brother. Four bits if you want to cross.
Or take it the hard way.

36
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,519
That's the way I take everything else.

37
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,789
Shorty, do you mind backing up
and letting me by?

38
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up.
And don't call me Shorty.

39
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,899
Shorty or sonny,
what difference does it make?

40
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,733
You know, you're liable to get all muddy
if you don't put it in reverse.

41
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:54,172
- Move over, bud.
- I'm wearing Justin Boots with 4-inch heels.

42
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:57,677
They'll sure make big dents
in that little frame of yours.

43
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,678
Stop, or I'll shoot.

44
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,448
Put that six-shooter down.

45
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,428
I'm John McMasters.

46
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:22,795
I never heard of you.
And I got no time to start now.

47
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,741
Nice shooting, Harmony.
Right above the nose.

48
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,037
Sorry his nose was so close to you,
big feller.

49
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,908
What did he do to you? Talk back?

50
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,608
No, nothing personal. Just, he's been
around hijacking tools and equipment.

51
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,480
Hijacking? Yeah, that's bad business.

52
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,780
Ain't it awful?
I was just trying to arrest him.

53
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:41,947
Why can't folks be more law-abiding?

54
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,923
I'll go home and won't sleep good
again tonight.

55
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,891
I guess he will.

56
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,733
Hey, what do you...? John.

57
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,707
Hi, Evie. How's my
barrel of sweet Spanish crude?

58
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,312
Where you been hiding, honey?

59
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,345
Hey, what happened?
You jump out a window?

60
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,381
You know I wouldn't
turn my back on a lady.

61
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,984
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, John.

62
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,924
- You been holding out on me.
- You ain't been around.

63
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,856
She just come over from New Orleans.

64
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,656
Lots of laughs.
Never been away from home.

65
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,637
Hey, 50 bucks. You'll spoil the kid.

66
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,403
You can't spoil baby lamb.
Besides, I got 800 in my poke.

67
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,512
Just brought in a gusher
for old man Wilson.

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,978
I'm here for laughs
and checking out in the morning.

69
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,743
You darn prairie jack.
Where you hopping to now?

70
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,353
I hear they brought in a big wildcat
out in California.

71
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:49,617
Wildcats. Always looking for wildcats.
When you gonna settle down, darling?

72
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,283
What the heck, Evie?
Travel and brag, brag and travel.

73
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,657
Maybe I'll hit oil where there ain't.

74
00:06:56,132 --> 00:07:00,125
Throw a steak on the fire for me, will you,
with all the fixings. I'm gonna wash up.

75
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:25,785
Hey, Whitey.
I'll be back down like a spring breeze.

76
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,725
Don't let those apes
steal your peanuts.

77
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:30,092
They say that with diamonds
where I come from.

78
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,823
Yes, sir, Whitey.

79
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,759
A brass band in a bathtub.

80
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,471
Oh, excuse me.

81
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,381
Whip those mules, brother,
there's a run on the bank.

82
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,075
Say, listen, fella...

83
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:52,585
Well, well, it's Shorty again.

84
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,551
A man can get pretty sick
of running into a guy like you.

85
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,286
Yeah, you don't wanna get sick, though.
I might have to hold your head, Shorty.

86
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,397
I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
Don't call me Shorty.

87
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,998
Why not, Shorty?

88
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,701
Okay. Why should you and me
have an argument?

89
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:13,638
- One of us might get hurt.
- Yeah, that's right. One of us might.

90
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,142
You wanna use the bowl? I'm through.
Wait a minute, I'll fix it up for you.

91
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:20,908
- Well, thanks, Shorty.
- There you are. Put a little of that gin in it.

92
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,311
Cut right through that oil.

93
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,885
- Cheaper than water, anyway.
- Yeah.

94
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:28,917
- Yeah. Not bad.
- Quite a roll of scratch you got there.

95
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,286
Wouldn't be as much as 6 or 7 grand,
would there?

96
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,623
Supposing it is. You think you're gonna
pull a gun out of your rudder?

97
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,760
No, no, no. I just thought you
might be interested in spudding in a well...

98
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,167
...run it up to a million.
- Oh, no. Nothing doing, Shorty.

99
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,331
I'm heading west. California.
I like them wild.

100
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,534
I hear a guy might do all right out there.

101
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:50,611
You don't want them
any wilder than this.

102
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,216
Look at this. All unproven, virgin lease.
Thirty miles south of here.

103
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:58,251
- So you think there's oil there, huh?
- You put up for the rig and the tools...

104
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:02,152
...and you're in for half. There's oil there.
- How do you know, Shorty?

105
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,385
- You don't get them dealing cards.
- The old bunion, huh?

106
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,256
- You're a driller too, huh?
- That's it.

107
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,421
- Come on, what do you say, fifty-fifty?
- Nope.

108
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,727
I've been planted here too long anyway.
Me for over the Rockies.

109
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,700
Stick around, though,
and I'll buy you a drink, just for luck.

110
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,107
Okay, Whitey. Diamonds or doughnuts?

111
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:25,271
- Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?
- Let go. I pick my own posies, jughead.

112
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:28,347
- Sit down and eat your steak, John.
- Come on, Whitey, honey...

113
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,179
...throw your little derrick up right here.
And happy days.

114
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:34,152
- Who's your cheerful friend, John?
- Him? That's Shorty.

115
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,191
- Name is Sand. John Sand.
- Well, John. Two Johns.

116
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,761
We gotta do something about that.
Get all mixed up.

117
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,230
- First I'll find a nice girl for you to talk to.
- Lf you don't mind, I'll just stick to whiskey.

118
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,596
- I'll bet he's got a girl.
- Maybe he's married.

119
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,068
- Got an Oregon Boot back home, Shorty?
- Who, me? No.

120
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,867
- No, not exactly.
- You mean you got a girl, eh, Shorty?

121
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:57,069
Sure. And he's on the square and I like him.
That's your name. Square John.

122
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:59,510
Square John, Big John.
That fixes everything.

123
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,048
Well, blood on the moon.

124
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,220
Whitey, if I was to tell you
that I was the Mississippi River...

125
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,324
...at high tide,
what would you think, huh?

126
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,786
Hey. We thought this over.
You was with us first.

127
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,997
- She was?
- Yeah.

128
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,134
Well, I didn't...

129
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:26,473
- Looks like we got company, Shorty.
- You got company.

130
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,702
That's what I thought.

131
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,954
I beat you by four feet, Shorty.

132
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,459
Wait a minute. I got another chance.

133
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,933
- I give you a tie.
- Hey, lke. Ed. Break it up. Break it up.

134
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,632
Say, John, stop it. You're giving
the place a bad name.

135
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,406
Shorty, you sure can go.
Here I am thinking you're all gab.

136
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,276
Yeah, he pulled a cutting knife on me.

137
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,474
- Makes you mad.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,449
Hey, where'd you say
that lease of yours was?

139
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,111
- Thirty miles south of here.
- Well, okay, okay.

140
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,454
We'll drive out and take a look at her.
In the morning.

141
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,072
- So you think you got a field here, huh?
- I know it. Take a look.

142
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,291
The bigheaded geologists in town
say it's only surface gas, but I say it's oil.

143
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,331
- Shorty, I think we got something here.
- I know we have.

144
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:00,162
And we're plumb center, right here.

145
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,963
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

146
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:09,110
I think more over by that old skull
will hit the peak of the dome.

147
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,442
No, no. Don't be fooled by false jogs.
This pay structure, it's right under here.

148
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:16,084
You're gonna fool yourself
down to salt water if you...

149
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,983
I'm an oil man too, you know. I haven't
been drilling all my life for gophers.

150
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,717
Wait, I was pulling oil out of the ground
when your ma was giving it to you...

151
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:24,917
...for your health.

152
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,392
- Lf you think...
- All right, all right, take it easy.

153
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:31,431
Somebody's gotta be the boss.
You got a hard dollar on you?

154
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,065
- Kind of light, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's counterfeit.

155
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,970
- It's the only kind I can hold on to. Call it.
- Heads.

156
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:47,146
Okay, you're the boss.
We'll spud in by the skull.

157
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,874
Now, listen, Shorty.

158
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:52,248
My betting on you is just as good
as betting on that skull.

159
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,446
- We'll spud in here.
- Okay, boss.

160
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:58,582
Hey, now, how about that dough?
How much is in that bankroll of yours?

161
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:01,787
Well, let's see. I had 800
when I went in the joint last night...

162
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,627
- That Whitey, she's all right, isn't she?
- You told me you had 7 grand.

163
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:08,130
No. You told me, Shorty.

164
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,363
That'll only put up the derrick.

165
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,769
I'm the boss.
Getting the equipment is up to me.

166
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,240
Just put yourself in my hands.

167
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,980
Hey. Wait a minute, John.

168
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,641
You better keep them eyes peeled
for hijackers.

169
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,616
I lost two loads last week.

170
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,882
You hired me when I was broke,
Mr. Aldrich. I won't let you down.

171
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,959
I'll look after your merchandise
like it was my very own.

172
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,925
Yeah, well, I think we'd better not
take any chances. Come on.

173
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:38,089
Get down off there, Eddie.
Hey, Harmony.

174
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,462
Come away from that cookbook.
Come on.

175
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,764
- Coming a-running.
- Now, look, Mr. Aldrich, I don't need any...

176
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,807
No, no. If any hijackers start anything,
Harmony will take care of them.

177
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,407
Go ahead.

178
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:57,413
Well, it's the big feller.
I didn't recognize you at first.

179
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,781
Nice day for the race, ain't it?

180
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:02,150
- What race?
- The human race.

181
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:16,636
"You add a pinch of salt to taste
and serve piping hot...

182
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,796
...to the delight
of your family and friends."

183
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:22,034
- Don't that sound pretty?
- Lf you're so interested in cooking...

184
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,940
...why do you go around killing people?

185
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,049
I hate shooting folks. I had a fine job
cooking over at the Parsons' ranch.

186
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:31,118
A bunch of horse rustlers popped in,
and when the sheriff come...

187
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:36,088
...he kind of liked the way they was laid out
and he deputized me for this here business.

188
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:40,922
Say, here's a "reskipe"
for lemon "meringoo" pie.

189
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,896
I expect that's just plain old lemon pie
for foreigners, don't you...?

190
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:53,003
Danged if I like them big hawks.
All the time killing little turtledoves.

191
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,075
Put them up.
Come on, pull up there.

192
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:59,143
- No monkey business, now. Climb down.
- Climb down in front of me, son.

193
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,715
But don't worry,
I'll plug him right between the eyes.

194
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,250
No, no, I can't. I'm shaking all over.

195
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,182
- Come on, you guys. Quit stalling.
- Turn the gun loose.

196
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,655
No, don't shoot.
Maybe he'll shoot back.

197
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,625
All right, keep walking now
and keep reaching.

198
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,027
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:19,923
Get up there.

200
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,001
Please don't say anything
to anybody, will you?

201
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,664
I'm not used to guns.
My knees just turn to water.

202
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,241
I nearly passed out, I guess.

203
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,470
Now, just simmer down, big feller.
Think of something else.

204
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,973
Hey. We're getting close.
Try that last stuff.

205
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,236
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,436
Now who wanted to spud in
by that steer skull?

207
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,740
We'll be reaching for her tail
in a few feet.

208
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:10,146
We sure had a break with Aldrich.
I thought he'd have spotted us by now.

209
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,380
We'll pay Luther back double.
Come on, you wild kitty. Spit.

210
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,390
- Begins to get you about now, don't it?
- Yeah, like sparking around some dame.

211
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,361
I forgot about that gal of yours, Shorty.
Don't worry, she'll be in platinum garters...

212
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,365
Hey. Listen.
Get back. She's coming in now.

213
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,969
- Come on, honey. Come to us, baby.
- Let's cap her in.

214
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,572
No, let her flow.
Let her open up her mouth and holler.

215
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,173
Look out!

216
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,056
Salt water.

217
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:56,220
The Gulf of Mexico.

218
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:11,806
Well, at least we can smoke now.

219
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,813
Take it easy, Shorty.

220
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,050
They say you'll get rich
if you drill enough holes.

221
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:25,125
We'd have been all right
if we'd spudded in by that skull.

222
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:30,493
Must be the water from the side structure.
Well, I guess that's that.

223
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,726
You're thinking about that dame, huh?

224
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:38,472
Hey, what's her name? What's she like?
She's nuts about you, huh?

225
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,403
I wish I could be sure.
She likes me, I guess.

226
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:45,570
We've known each other quite a piece.
You know, it ain't exactly set yet...

227
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:49,582
...but I figured if this well came in,
why, she'd come out here and we could...

228
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,151
Forget it.

229
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,815
Pick up your chin. We'll spud in
over there someday. Somehow.

230
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,160
Who's that coming?

231
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:04,491
- That's Luther's car. We'd better travel.
- Travel or jail.

232
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,432
They're getting away.
They're getting away.

233
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,100
Hey, hold it.

234
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,269
Okay.

235
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,314
Take it easy,
I'm gonna get me a pigeon.

236
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:30,915
For heaven's sake, they're escaping.
Come on, you're the sheriff. Do something.

237
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,653
I wonder what they done
with my Barbara Fritchie cookbook.

238
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,888
Shut up, you blithering seagull.

239
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:40,467
Thousands of dollars' worth
of equipment lost, and in a dry hole.

240
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:44,299
If they ever come back here, I'll have
them boiled in oil. In their own oil.

241
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,565
They didn't strike any.

242
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,249
Once more won't hurt them. Seven, dice.
There she is.

243
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,157
Seven out of the field
and pay the line.

244
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,061
Six-one, babies. Right back at them.
That's it, babies.

245
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,361
- Eleven. Pay the line.
- Ten passes.

246
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,767
I can't lose. I'm knee-deep in clover.
Just for luck, Shorty.

247
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,874
Come on, babies, once more. Oh, yeah.

248
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,772
- Pay the line.
- There you are, sir.

249
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,606
Two thousand.
Watch me double it.

250
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,975
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's enough.

251
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,983
Those dice got snake eyes, you know.

252
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:06,620
Okay, Shorty.
Shorty here, he's the warden.

253
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,882
That's right, you tell him, Shorty.
Make him take...

254
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:13,391
- Don't call me Shorty.
- But, Holy Moses, he called you Shorty.

255
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,530
That's all right. That's him, not you.

256
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,723
Here, buy him seven or eight drinks.
Come on, Shorty, let's go.

257
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,359
Hey, where are we going with all
this fancy scratch, little man?

258
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:23,936
Right back to Burkburnett.

259
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,040
And we're gonna spud in that well
right by the old steer skull...

260
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,110
...where a fella tried to get me
to do it once before. Remember?

261
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,114
Hey, wait a minute, chump.

262
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,774
Do you think Luther is foolish enough
to take $2000 for all we owe him?

263
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,615
You just act like I said.
Do as the boss tells you.

264
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,686
Just check over that balance.
It was wrong again yesterday.

265
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,852
- Hi, Luther. Long time no see.
- Well, gentlemen, what can l...?

266
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,763
It's them. It's them.
Do something, quick. Get Harmony.

267
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,631
Wait a minute. Easy.
We're just here on a little business.

268
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:59,205
Don't stand there trembling
like a pen-wiper. What business?

269
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:02,207
We wanna pay our bill.
Course, if you don't want the money...

270
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:06,780
You wanna pay me? Well, why didn't
you say...? Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

271
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:10,612
I was only saying yesterday, I wonder
what happened to Mr. Sand and...

272
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,549
Let go of Mr. McMasters, you idiot.

273
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,712
- Well, it's the big feller.
- Hi, Harmony.

274
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,620
- It's all right, Harmony, there's no...
- Here you are, Luther.

275
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,420
- Well.
- Two thousand on account.

276
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:22,461
Two thousand?
But you owe me $ 7000.

277
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,655
That's for good faith.
We still got our lease.

278
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,824
We'll pay the rest
when our new well comes in.

279
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,128
- New well?
- Sure.

280
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,134
You're gonna give us
tools and equipment.

281
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:34,071
I give you what? Harmony, get the sheriff.
I'll give you jail sentences...

282
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:37,973
Wait a minute, now, take it easy.
All right, he's got us where it hurts.

283
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:42,014
- We gotta give him a sixteenth of the well.
- What? We'll do no such thing.

284
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,312
Certainly not. L... l... What's that?
A sixteenth?

285
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,979
Well, l... l... No, I run
a strictly cash business here.

286
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:51,557
All right, all right.
Then we'll give you an eighth.

287
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,128
- Give an eighth of a million dollars away?
- A million dollars? Are you...?

288
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:58,698
You mean 10 million dollars.
We can afford a measly eighth.

289
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,931
- Come on, Luther...
- No, no, no. Over my dead body.

290
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:05,562
Where do you get off mooching your way
in for an eighth, you old cow thief?

291
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,972
- I'm going over to the bank on my own.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

292
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:10,406
I don't know what to say.

293
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,605
You said enough, trying to let
this crook in on a sure thing.

294
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,647
I worked my hands raw
to earn that money.

295
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:19,344
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I might consider an eighth.

296
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:20,545
But an eighth of what?

297
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:23,623
What makes you two maniacs
think you're gonna find oil this time?

298
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,352
Say, do you think we'd be
sticking our necks in a noose...

299
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,496
...if we didn't know there was oil?
Come on.

300
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:33,259
- No, no, I still think an eighth is...
- Well, all right. All right. I'll do it.

301
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,701
But it's got to be an eighth.
And we'll sign the papers right now.

302
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,535
Harmony goes out with you
to see there's no monkey business.

303
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,177
And if you two fellas
don't bring in a well this time...

304
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,745
...you go to jail. Both of you.
I'm not gonna... I'm...

305
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:50,415
For heaven...
I'm stuck again.

306
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,293
Hot groceries.

307
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:09,062
- Hey, Big John, come and get it.
- Okay. I'm ready for it.

308
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,965
Here she is, boys.
Another Barbara Fritchie special.

309
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,698
Hey, what's that for?

310
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,844
We gotta have a name for the well.
You mind if we call it that?

311
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:20,743
"Beautiful darling Betsy."
Well, I'll be doggoned.

312
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:24,010
Okay, Shorty. Say, when are we
gonna get a load of this gal?

313
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,552
Maybe you'll see her one day,
if the well comes in.

314
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,122
We're due, all right. Take a look
at the sand from that last bailing.

315
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:32,219
What's that? Rabbit again?

316
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:35,795
Rabbit stew à la "modee."
Shot two nice fat ones this morning.

317
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,899
Couldn't go out and shoot a can of beans
for a change, could you?

318
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,557
Let's drive to Eva's for a steak.

319
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,795
- We got 13 or a dozen bucks left.
- No. Rabbit's okay by me.

320
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:47,840
We're due for a bust. Five weeks of this
ain't natural, fella. I got the jumps.

321
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,274
You and Harmony go in. I can make
a few more feet of hole before dark.

322
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,746
- Besides, I got some letters to write.
- Oh, okay, okay. Me for town.

323
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,511
You work out your nightlife
with water on the side.

324
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,351
But that gal may stand you up, so just
don't turn out to be Henry the Hermit.

325
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,728
I'll pick up the groceries
and meet you over at Eva's.

326
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,457
- Hey.
- Careful, my dear.

327
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,794
- Let the deacon help you.
- Thank you.

328
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,367
Looks like Aunt Molly's got
a new visitor.

329
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:21,237
Yeah. Kind of looks that way.
But I'm not sure.

330
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:25,139
You'll like the other place better, dear.
Not a hotel, more like a boarding house.

331
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:27,213
More homelike for a girl like you, dearie.

332
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,350
We have evening get-togethers,
and the nicest Southern cooking.

333
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,182
- You're very kind, but l...
- Ma'am, I'm about to speak a piece.

334
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:37,951
You're new here, so you don't know
Aunt Molly and the deacon.

335
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:40,617
Molly's done a little time.
And the deacon...

336
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:44,060
...well, he can squirm under a
water moccasin with a high hat on.

337
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,530
And you, Auntie,
keep that knife in your corset.

338
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:51,195
It might not look nice if I'd have to
kick you in the stomach. Now, get.

339
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:54,799
Well, thank you very much.

340
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,672
You see, where they wanted
to take you...

341
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,972
Well, a girl like you
might not have liked it.

342
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:04,008
You mean I'd wake up in a gilded palace
and be afraid to go home?

343
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,980
Oh, you were wise, huh?

344
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:09,157
Well, they were pretty obvious.
You know, the first time I voted...

345
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,384
...my mother broke down and told me
all about the big, bad world.

346
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,461
- Thanks anyway.
- You know...

347
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:17,256
...I still think you need
somebody to keep an eye on you.

348
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,333
- This is a pretty rough town.
- Oh, dear.

349
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,660
- What?
- I thought it was Galahad.

350
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:28,366
Galahad in boots and a Stetson, come to
rescue the fair Elaine from the dragons.

351
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:31,740
- But underneath you're just Modred.
- What do you mean, Modred?

352
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,438
Sir Modred. Of all the knights,
he was the wicked one.

353
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,312
I'm very sorry.

354
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,720
She kind of rustled her bustle at you,
didn't she?

355
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:45,326
Modred. Say, what do you know
about those guys Modred and Galahad?

356
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:49,257
Let me see. I know Pete Galahad.
Sheriff over in Whizbang.

357
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,093
No, no. Two different guys.

358
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,402
Could you tell me where I might find
Mr. Jonathan Sand?

359
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,538
He's drilling out in the south section.

360
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,833
About a 30-mile ride.
I could get you a jitney.

361
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,807
Oh, no, not tonight. Thank you.
I'll have supper and go in the morning.

362
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,968
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:09,345
- Well, I take your order now.
- Let's see. How's the chicken?

364
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:12,577
Don't order fried chicken,
it's three-year-old jackrabbit.

365
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,780
- Saved again from a fate worse than death.
- Come on, Lena...

366
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:18,391
...tell her John McMasters
is just a babe in the woods.

367
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,893
I bring your soup,
but don't go in no woods.

368
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,690
Lena's dizzy from dollar tips.

369
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:26,595
- Are you Big John McMasters?
- Yeah.

370
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,065
You've heard about me, huh?

371
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,568
Well, I certainly have.

372
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,901
Doesn't that surprise you?

373
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,666
I'm pretty well-known in these parts.

374
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,073
I heard about you
long before I arrived here.

375
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,974
On the bus, huh?

376
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,241
Yes. That's right. They were saying,
"Big John McMasters...

377
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:46,319
...there's a fellow to be heard from."
- Really?

378
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:49,946
Come on, now, stop kidding me
into a bear trap.

379
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,786
A lot's going on tonight.

380
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,657
What am I going to call you
for the rest of the evening?

381
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,661
The rest of the evening?

382
00:26:57,832 --> 00:27:00,096
Yeah. All I know now is Elaine.

383
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:03,328
What am I gonna call you when I
take you to that rodeo, for instance?

384
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,166
Well, maybe I just better be
the Lady Elaine for a while.

385
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,866
I don't wanna give you any surprises.
You look delicate.

386
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:11,841
Lady Elaine, nothing you could tell me
would surprise me.

387
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,570
Wait and see, Sir Modred.

388
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:16,979
- You want to order?
- Sure. What are you doing here, at that?

389
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:19,081
Are you one of those lady drummers?

390
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:23,279
No, I'm much more important than that.

391
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,427
If I like it here, I might open a shop.

392
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,788
- What kind of a shop?
- Lingerie.

393
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:32,194
- Come again?
- Underwear. Ladies' underwear.

394
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:35,995
Ladies' underwear?
Well, I don't know. Now, you see...

395
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:40,369
...the girls in this town... Well,
what I mean is there's not much call for...

396
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,635
- You'd better order.
- Yeah.

397
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:48,078
Now, Lena, my love,
I want a steak, 32 ounce, rare.

398
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,717
Same racket.
Hasn't changed since I was a kid.

399
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:53,479
Knock down the milk bottles
and they give you St. Vitus.

400
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,623
Stop it, you'll wear him out.

401
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:59,221
Mr. Summers, just a minute.
I want you to meet Lady Elaine.

402
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,259
- And Mrs. Summers.
- How do you do?

403
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,954
Mr. Summers runs the Emporium,
the biggest store in town.

404
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:07,863
Lady Elaine is selling women's underwear.
I want you to buy till it hurts.

405
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:11,061
Don't pay any attention to him,
Mr. Summers. He's crazy.

406
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,230
Yes, I'm Sir Modred, the wicked knight.

407
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:15,638
Wicked knight? You're drunk.

408
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:18,608
Oh, look, it's started.

409
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:26,980
Ride him, Henry.

410
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,852
Sit still and sing to him.

411
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,193
I guess Henry can't sing.

412
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:37,524
Why, that's just like sitting
in a rocking chair.

413
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,700
All right, folks. Who else will ride
the Missouri Angel?

414
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:44,168
That's a cinch. All you have to do
is wrap your legs around him.

415
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,068
All right, go ahead.

416
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:47,674
Who, me?

417
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:50,470
Here's your next rider,
Big John McMasters.

418
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,078
Wait a minute. I was just...

419
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,281
Big John McMasters is our next rider.

420
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,948
You see how happy you've made them?

421
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,485
Yes, yes. Sir Modred is stuck.

422
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,921
Here, take the colors of the fair Elaine and
wear them bravely in the joust, Sir Modred.

423
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,687
I don't know what she's talking about,
but look after her.

424
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,830
She's something pretty special.

425
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,999
- Whoa, mule.
- He's just looking you over.

426
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,568
Yeah.

427
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:18,529
Sir Modred is up.

428
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,708
Hey, what do you got the balloon for,
Big John? Going up in the air?

429
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:27,507
- Everybody likes Big John, don't they?
- Yeah. He's high-test, ma'am.

430
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:32,075
Hey, Big John!

431
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,779
Sir Modred is still up.

432
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,929
Modred is down.

433
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,068
You know, I've never had so much fun
in all my life.

434
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:58,234
What do we do now?

435
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:00,846
I guess there's not much more
you can do in this town.

436
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,415
- Hiya, Big John.
- Oh, hi, Tom. Hi, Ed.

437
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:07,748
- Well, we'll be seeing you next summer.
- Yeah? Hey, where are you headed?

438
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,390
- Off to Arizona for a little wildcatting.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,049
And when we come back,
we'll be driving a Rolls-Royce.

440
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,854
Attaboy. I hope you bring in a cat
that'll really howl.

441
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:17,325
Happy days.

442
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,864
Tom and Ed Murphy.
I hope they get lucky and strike it.

443
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,268
They've been knocking at the gate
a long time.

444
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,409
Say, this sounds very gay.
What's in here?

445
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,136
No, you don't wanna go in there.
That's just a dance hall.

446
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:32,301
A bad dance hall?

447
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,948
Well, no, but it's a place
where fellas go on payday...

448
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:36,947
- Have you been in there?
- Sure, but...

449
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,746
- Well, then, you can take me.
- No, no, it's liable to be kind of rough.

450
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,186
Now, look,
I'm not really Little Red Riding Hood.

451
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:48,455
I came down here because I wanted
to see if... Well, I want to see all the sights.

452
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,257
Now, please.

453
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,264
Well, I'm agin it.
So holler when you've had enough.

454
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:01,741
Hello, Big John. Whitey was just asking
me where... I beg your pardon.

455
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,003
Hi, Hank. Good old Hank.

456
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:08,046
Well, look at all the pretty girls.
Do you know them?

457
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:10,650
Yes... That is, I mean,
not all of them, but...

458
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:14,515
- There's the dance floor. Do you dance?
- Look, here's roulette over here.

459
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:17,089
- Well, I'd rather...
- Did you ever play roulette?

460
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,317
Say, which one is Spanish Eva?

461
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:21,792
She's home, taking care of the kids.

462
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,896
Hi, lke. Five bucks on 17.

463
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,898
Me too. A quarter. Two bits on 17.

464
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,593
- Sorry, ma'am, but the limit is...
- Just this once, lke.

465
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,035
Hey, where you been,
you big bag of sugar?

466
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:35,471
I've been cooling my lily-white heels
for three hours waiting for you.

467
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,476
- Seventeen odd.
- That means we won, doesn't it?

468
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,580
- Yeah.
- Who's that?

469
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:42,306
- Why...
- You new here?

470
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,110
Yes, I arrived this evening.

471
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,980
She with you?

472
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,419
- Whitey, this is the fair Elaine, Lady Elaine.
- How are you?

473
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:52,151
Oh, yeah? And I'm Lady Astorbilt.

474
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,352
She's just his sister, kid.

475
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,926
- Give it to her, blondie.
- Come on.

476
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,430
Holler when you've had enough.

477
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:01,967
Come on.

478
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:06,635
After that it was just bumming around...

479
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:09,276
...logging a bit up in Alberta...

480
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:12,504
...a few years mining here and there,
then France.

481
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,513
Now I'm in the oil game
for good, I guess.

482
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,846
A woman always gets a chump
to blow his own horn, doesn't she?

483
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,647
Not unless she wants to hear it.

484
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,813
I've never been very close-hitched
to people.

485
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,925
That is, until I met my partner.
Right down the street there...

486
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,585
Say, isn't that a wonderful moon?

487
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:33,059
Yeah. That's moon enough for everybody.

488
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,600
- Say, what's this?
- That?

489
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:40,138
That's just oil
being pulled up out of the ground.

490
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,572
Here? But it looks like a church.

491
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:45,110
Sure, used to be. Look.

492
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,543
When the boom came,
the congregation got excited...

493
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,377
...and spudded in a wildcat
right under the pulpit.

494
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:54,112
Now there are churches all over the state
spreading happy days and hallelujah...

495
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,256
...right out of these holes.

496
00:32:56,424 --> 00:33:00,724
- And ye shall rise out of the earth.
- Well, why, who's there?

497
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,262
- Why, glory be, it's Big John.
- Hello, Springtime.

498
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,957
You're out late.
I was just finishing my supper.

499
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:10,104
- How are they pumping?
- Deep and sure, John. Deep and sure.

500
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:14,367
They'll be pumping long after
I'm spudded in and part of the flow.

501
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,602
- Well, good night to you.
- Good night.

502
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,104
You know, funny guy, Springtime.

503
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,715
Two times a millionaire...

504
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,444
...once in the Pennsylvania field
and once in Louisiana.

505
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:28,378
Hired the top deck of an ocean liner
just to go to Paris.

506
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,992
Now he's here in Texas, broke.
But he might hit it again tomorrow.

507
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,095
- He seems happy, though.
- Yeah. It's a funny business.

508
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,629
You get away from it for a while,
go on a bust.

509
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,596
Then one night, you try to sleep...

510
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,668
...those darn pumps
start pounding in your ears.

511
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:44,634
I don't know.

512
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,934
Like a heartbeat.

513
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:50,806
Yeah. Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it?

514
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:52,707
Nothing is silly in church.

515
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,777
You sure can talk straight to a fella
and ball him up at the same time.

516
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,389
I'll have to sic you on my partner.
You'll like Shorty.

517
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:06,823
Everybody calls him Square John,
and he's as square as the Constitution.

518
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,827
But, you know, Elaine, he's been
mooning around about some dame.

519
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:13,364
Keeps writing her letters, won't talk
about her, like it was a 20-1 shot.

520
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,464
If I thought that much about a girl, I'd...

521
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,806
But it'd have to be a girl like you.

522
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,172
I'd want her right where
I could take ahold of her and tell her.

523
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,677
Right here, for instance.

524
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,409
I'd like to go back to the hotel.

525
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,919
What's the matter? What's wrong?

526
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,850
If you don't mind, please,
it's getting a little chilly.

527
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,019
Yes, it is a little, at that, I guess.

528
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,795
All right, come on.

529
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:58,377
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

530
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,247
Well, thank you. It's been awfully nice.

531
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:11,024
- I'll see you some more, won't I?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,752
I just realized I have to
take the bus in the morning.

533
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,725
Hey, wait a minute.

534
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:19,697
- Is there another guy?
- Yes.

535
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:23,768
- You love him, huh?
- No, not this...

536
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:27,567
- Not that way, but...
- Then what are you leaving for?

537
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,907
Because... Goodbye.

538
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,248
Hey.

539
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:43,490
Come down here.

540
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,734
I make up my mind quick.

541
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,741
I made it up
when I first saw you, I guess.

542
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,311
You aren't ever gonna leave.

543
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,332
She drilled herself in.

544
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,529
You're rich, mister.
There's yeast in the buckwheat.

545
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,001
Boy, ain't that a beautiful black cloud?

546
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:43,912
Let's cap her.
She'll run all over the state.

547
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,884
Boy, listen to her.
She's just a-puffing and a-blowing.

548
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,319
Hey, wait.

549
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:22,245
Go and dig up Big John
and then find Luther.

550
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:26,120
- Hey, Shorty. What's up? Did she...?
- She blew herself in.

551
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,159
Five thousand barrels is a cinch.

552
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,888
Come on up here.

553
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,533
I'll be right back.
I gotta go down and send a telegram.

554
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:36,293
Honey, did you hear that?
That was Shorty.

555
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,064
- You married a millionaire.
- John...

556
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,639
...please sit down.

557
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,400
What? What is it? What's the matter?

558
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,237
Please.

559
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,645
I was gonna tell you later,
before we went out to the well...

560
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:49,749
...but I can't put it off any longer.

561
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,350
What is it?

562
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,214
I'm the girl he's been writing to, John.

563
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,750
What?

564
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,583
Betsy.

565
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,493
The beautiful Betsy.
Elizabeth Bartlett, sure.

566
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,128
This is no good.

567
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,240
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,274
Oh, darling...

569
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:21,677
...when you came to that table last night,
you were so fresh and sure of yourself...

570
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:26,252
...I thought it would be a surprise
and a big joke when you found out.

571
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,251
You see, later, it wasn't a joke anymore.

572
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,016
I tried to leave, knowing what you two
meant to each other.

573
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:35,151
- I would have gone to him, explained.
- No, you wouldn't have, John.

574
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:37,354
Darling, I was so afraid.

575
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:38,998
I was afraid I'd lose you.

576
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,930
- But you told him you would marry him.
- No, I didn't.

577
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,571
Oh, no, I haven't been that unfair.

578
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,367
Listen, I've known Jonathan a long time.

579
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:52,501
I knew that he wanted to marry me but that
he felt that he should have more to offer.

580
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,942
Oh, John...

581
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:57,312
...you see, back home,
life was piling up on me.

582
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,454
Teaching poetry to a lot of
high school kids that didn't like it...

583
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:03,089
...and didn't like me
because I made them learn it.

584
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:08,251
Furnished rooms, cafeterias
and men you wouldn't shake a stick at.

585
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,420
Don't you see? Like any other girl...

586
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,294
...I wanted a new life
and a home of my own too...

587
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:17,335
...so when Jonathan wrote me about
the life out here and the excitement...

588
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:20,474
...I just packed up
and took the first train.

589
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,405
I like Jonathan. I admire him...

590
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:27,911
...and I came out to see if perhaps
we could find a life together.

591
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,984
It's still no good.

592
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:35,179
- Well, I've knifed him in the back.
- Oh, no, John. Please believe me.

593
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:38,484
If I had left you last night,
I never would have married Jonathan.

594
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,093
I'd have gone away
without seeing him...

595
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:44,060
...because I knew I'd love only one man
the rest of my life.

596
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,062
Hey, open up and buy me a drink.

597
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:49,134
It's Cornelius Vanderfeller.
Come on, open up.

598
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,271
I love you, John.

599
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,739
And I love you.

600
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,042
Come on, hurry up. Open up. Open up.

601
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,979
Boy, did you miss it.
We were pounding the old...

602
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,220
- Bet...?
- Jonathan.

603
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,556
We were married last night, Shorty.

604
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,591
Wait a minute. I don't get this.

605
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:16,923
He never knew about us. I just told him.

606
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:18,895
She wanted to go,
but I couldn't let her.

607
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,658
I couldn't let her go, see, Shorty?

608
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,168
It happened just that way,
so I dug up Judge Martin.

609
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,372
Well, say something, Shorty.
Take a sock at me or something.

610
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:33,376
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Yes, Jonathan.

611
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,607
You see,
when I came out here last night...

612
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,809
Okay, Betsy.

613
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,814
Thank you, Jonathan.

614
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,524
Well, I guess that's the way it is.

615
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,826
I gotta get to the well.
I got a lot of things to do.

616
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:52,693
No need in you coming out right away.
I'll see you both out there later.

617
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,128
Honey, that's a guy.

618
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,263
Ed.

619
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:32,564
Okay, everybody.

620
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,937
Come on and have a drink
with the Murphy boys from Arizona.

621
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,101
Ed, a Rolls-Royce.
You must be in the money.

622
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:39,746
- We are.
- Welcome home.

623
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,643
- Lucky Ed.
- Hey, Big John.

624
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,579
Big John! Pull over with that horse.

625
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,777
Come on over, we're setting them up.

626
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:50,117
Tom, Ed, you long-lost Comanches.
I heard you hit it.

627
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,260
- Yeah, we hit it, and we're spending it.
- Tom, Ed.

628
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,952
Oh, am I glad to see you.

629
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,065
- Well, I see you brought a stranger.
- Hi, honey.

630
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:02,600
Stay away from him, baby.
He's an old married man now.

631
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,466
I never hurt you, did I?
How's the fireplace and slippers?

632
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,630
- Everything's fine. How you been?
- Just dandy.

633
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,572
Swell. Hey, two wildcats,
they tell me. Give me an earful.

634
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:11,972
How deep did you have to go?

635
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,273
Wouldn't mean nothing
to a big producer like you.

636
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,417
- Is there any more good-looking...?
- A million acres of it.

637
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:19,985
- Let's all have a drink. Come on, baby.
- Say, I can't.

638
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:23,089
- My wife called and wants me home...
- We heard you got lassoed.

639
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,817
For life. And it's okay, pal.
But she wants me home early.

640
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:28,587
Something about the new house.
Don't go away, I'll be back.

641
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:31,094
- We'll be waiting for you.
- Not for long, brother.

642
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,701
Hey, honey.

643
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:42,806
Behold the bridegroom.

644
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,502
Here, congratulations, my boy.
Have a drink.

645
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,580
- One year married and he can't believe it.
- Used 14 eggs.

646
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,718
- Angel grub, they call it.
- Honey, I forgot.

647
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,420
Well, that proves
I've really got a husband.

648
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,522
But I ought
to have a present or something.

649
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,783
I've got my present right here,
all around me.

650
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,518
Darn it, we ain't got much time
for that sparking.

651
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:04,557
- We'll be ready, Harmony.
- Come on, everybody.

652
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:05,960
- To Betsy.
- Yes.

653
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,795
To beautiful darling Betsy number one.

654
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,870
Hey, who do you think's in town?
Tom and Ed Murphy.

655
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,098
Just brought in
two wildcats up in Arizona.

656
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:17,540
What do you say we all go down
and meet them after dinner at the hotel?

657
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,570
Sure, we can go...

658
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:24,006
...if you think they'll be interested
in a couple of old married people.

659
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,410
Honey, I'm sorry.

660
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,521
To heck with them.
Say, I gotta wash up.

661
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,215
That must've been something, though,
right out of nothing.

662
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,793
A new wildcat and the moose
goes right into high gear.

663
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,190
Doesn't he?

664
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,161
I'm all set to carry on
our cutthroat heart game after dinner.

665
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,268
- And, boy, will I give you the black queen.
- Oh, no, you won't.

666
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,199
There's gonna be no heart game tonight.

667
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,033
You two boys are eating
and then running, if you don't mind.

668
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,903
- But I haven't got anything to do...
- Well, Luther, you see...

669
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:52,272
...it's this way...

670
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:55,882
Why don't you just stop thinking
and go and pour me a drink.

671
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,245
I'm always mixing drinks or something.

672
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:01,252
Oh, they're such lovely flowers, Jonathan.
Thank you.

673
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,014
Place sure looks high-toned.

674
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:05,454
I guess that's the woman's hand
does that.

675
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:10,188
Well, it's not exactly the way I planned it,
but he took such an interest in it.

676
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:13,333
The horns from your well
over the mantel, and the guns.

677
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,936
Oh, and that armor over there,
he calls it his Sir Modred suit.

678
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:22,365
Well, that's the way it is,
and that's the way I want it to be.

679
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:26,411
It's where I want to live forever and ever
and never move away.

680
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,480
- That was a great dinner, Betsy.
- Thanks.

681
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,173
- See you in the morning.
- Shorty...

682
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:33,411
...why don't you see Tom and Ed
and get a line on that Arizona setup.

683
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:37,284
No, I better run out to the field. I wanna
take a look at number five. She's close.

684
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,516
- Good night.
- Good night.

685
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:41,286
- It's an invitation every year for you two.
- Thank you.

686
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:42,520
- Good night.
- Good night.

687
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,756
I still don't see why we couldn't
have had one hour's heart game.

688
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,265
Now I know you're over 60.

689
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:53,005
You do want to hear all about it,
don't you?

690
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:55,733
- What?
- Those Arizona wildcats.

691
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:57,604
- No, honey, really.
- "No."

692
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,339
You're about as convincing
as a little boy refusing a chocolate soda.

693
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:04,575
All right, come on. I've got some things
to do around here anyway.

694
00:45:04,752 --> 00:45:07,277
Only, it'll take about an hour,
for your information.

695
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,183
- Sure you don't mind?
- No.

696
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,883
You go see the Murphy boys and sit around
and lie a little bit to each other...

697
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,857
...and have a good time, see?

698
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:18,259
Only, just remember, you've got
another wildcat waiting for you at home.

699
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,400
Oh, will I.

700
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,425
- I won't be more than a hour, darling.
- Right.

701
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,071
- John. John. Betsy.
- What's happened?

702
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:34,806
- Number five caught fire. Where's John?
- Well, he went into town.

703
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,007
You wake Harmony, I'll get a coat.

704
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,911
Harmony, go over to the firehouse.

705
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:43,852
Get Wilson and his nitro truck.
Tell him to bring 100 quarts.

706
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:46,720
Swing that wildcat.

707
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,829
Everybody's a wildcat in Arizona,
huh, Ed?

708
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,765
Betsy, honey.

709
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:04,604
- Get out, Betsy. You don't belong in here.
- The Murphy boys.

710
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:06,973
- Do you hear me? You don't belong.
- Wait a minute.

711
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:10,310
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'm not spying on you to spoil your fun.

712
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:11,951
You're free to go on with it.

713
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,088
We just came to tell you
that number five is on fire.

714
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,382
- Number five on fire?
- Yeah, you coming?

715
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:24,329
Harmony, take the missus home,
then come right out.

716
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:29,800
- How did it start?
- Who cares? It started.

717
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:51,088
You get a hose on that tank.
If it goes, the whole field will go.

718
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:55,125
Everybody get back.

719
00:46:58,165 --> 00:46:59,632
Hurry up with that shield.

720
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:07,603
- Where's that nitro truck?
- Listen, boss.

721
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,435
This is too dangerous for you fellas.

722
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,204
Three cans of nitro will
blow her out like a birthday cake.

723
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,007
But that's wild oil and gas.
Let's wait for them fire dogs from Ranger.

724
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:19,277
We haven't got time to wait for them.
This baby's way ahead of us.

725
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,288
She's too hot. You can't get
the nitro in close enough to blow her out.

726
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:29,724
You just unload it.

727
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:32,832
We'll get her close enough.
We're taking a shield in first.

728
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,798
We'll take in the nitro on the next trip.

729
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,105
All right, hit the water.

730
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,687
The top casing's split.
You can't tell where she'll shoot now.

731
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,240
Put more pressure on those lines.

732
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:29,688
If it was my durned well,
I'd let her burn herself out.

733
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:32,552
Quit yapping. Tell Jim
to put another hose on that tank.

734
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:34,353
All right.

735
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:37,495
- Hot work, huh, Shorty?
- Lay off the Shorty.

736
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:40,132
Oh, behave. What did I do?

737
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,666
I just met Tom and Ed,
got a little high, that's all.

738
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,168
I saw enough and heard enough
I didn't like.

739
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:49,702
Okay. If you see anything or hear
anything you don't like from now on...

740
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:52,504
...don't go running to Betsy with it.
Just keep your nose...

741
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,644
What the dickens is the matter
with you two fellas?

742
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:59,081
Never mind about this.
Get that battery ready.

743
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:03,847
Boys. Who's responsible
for this catastrophe?

744
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,457
Watch where you're going, buddy.

745
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:08,288
You kick that can of nitro
and you'll blow us to Alaska.

746
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,191
We'll touch it off after this trip,
so get the truck away.

747
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,491
Hang that wire on me.

748
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,861
Somebody must have
fallen asleep on the job.

749
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,696
Get the water.

750
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,575
They're using too much nitro.
They'll blow up the whole field.

751
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:23,869
I'll lose a fortune.

752
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,259
Give me the wire!

753
00:49:55,342 --> 00:49:59,403
If that oil gets there first, the two Johns
will blow back on us like fried hamburger.

754
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:17,626
- Hug the ground back there.
- Get back.

755
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:26,935
She's out.

756
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,704
Wonderful, boys. Marvelous.

757
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:35,075
I knew we'd do it. Look at her.

758
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:37,443
Here, come on, fellas.
Do something, will you?

759
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:42,020
- We're wasting a lot of oil.
- It's the biggest gusher yet.

760
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:46,258
Isn't big enough.

761
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,555
Call it. For the works.

762
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:53,291
- Okay, the whole outfit.
- Call it.

763
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,128
Tails.

764
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,301
You're on my land.

765
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:06,806
- Now, listen, Big John...
- Come on, everyone.

766
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:20,822
Look, big feller.
I'll fix you some nice, fresh coffee.

767
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,087
Forget it. All I need is some sleep.

768
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:33,866
Did you put out the fire?

769
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:39,000
- So you're calling it quits, huh?
- No, I'm afraid you did that.

770
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,943
You've always been straightforward
and direct about things...

771
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:43,844
...and this like everything else.

772
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,508
Oh, don't worry.
There isn't going to be a scene.

773
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,718
I'm just no good at picking wildcats,
I guess.

774
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,951
As you'd say, the land was pretty
attractive, but the structure fooled me.

775
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:55,958
And now I'm down
to clay and salt water.

776
00:51:56,129 --> 00:52:00,293
Not that I blame the clay and salt water.
Some people might like it, but I don't.

777
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,526
You sure got in way over your head,
didn't you?

778
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,135
I'll be out of here in a minute.

779
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:07,000
Harmony can take me to the early train,
if you don't mind.

780
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:09,972
- Unless, of course, there's an explanation.
- No.

781
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:14,170
You got it all figured out.
You do it the way you want to.

782
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:35,432
Harmony, will you come
and get my bags, please?

783
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:42,308
My God. God, did old Square John
sure give him what he deserved.

784
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:45,672
He broke him flatter
than a can on a railroad track.

785
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:47,211
You mean they had a fight?

786
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,076
Fight? They flipped for the whole field,
Miss Betsy...

787
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,514
...and now that big, dumb
pit dog you're leaving...

788
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:56,554
...ain't worth much more than
that lead dollar that they tossed with.

789
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,714
Yes, sir.

790
00:52:58,892 --> 00:53:01,087
Long as you're gonna go, why...

791
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,059
...you sure picked a nice morning for it.

792
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,593
Oh, my darling. You and Jonathan
mustn't fight about this.

793
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:41,598
- You've been such good friends.
- He and I have our own fight.

794
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,429
That's my business.

795
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:48,097
You and me, well,
that's your business, and mine.

796
00:53:48,275 --> 00:53:50,072
So, what about it?

797
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,202
I don't want to leave you.

798
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:55,314
All the time I was in here
packing like an idiot...

799
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,315
...I was just wanting you
to come and put your arms around me...

800
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,453
...and tell me nothing happened.

801
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,451
Nothing did.

802
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,347
I'm such a fool.

803
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:09,555
Oh, you're my gal.

804
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:17,729
But we're broke.
Gotta start in all over again.

805
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:20,737
- We'll go wildcatting, huh?
- It means selling this house.

806
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,306
Oh, who cares about this house?

807
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:25,740
I was just thinking this afternoon,
well, here we are, tied down to it.

808
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:27,140
It's a millstone.

809
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:30,078
We're just buried under
a lot of plaster and 2-by-4s.

810
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,947
- Honest? Do you feel that way?
- Sure I do.

811
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,385
Oh, you are my gal.

812
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,286
Well, wildcatting it is.

813
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,984
Our house will be wherever we are.

814
00:54:42,162 --> 00:54:44,687
If there's oil at the North Pole,
we'll live in an igloo.

815
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,196
And you won't freeze to death either.

816
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:55,139
Harmony, Harmony. Come on.
There's a big ruckus over at Eva's.

817
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,108
All right. Come on, come on, come on.

818
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,273
Does anybody else wanna say anything
about McMasters?

819
00:55:07,954 --> 00:55:09,387
Disturbing the peace, huh?

820
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,081
Let's go to the calaboose.

821
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:15,790
Two agin one, it ain't manly.

822
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:19,090
Look, sonny boy. Two weeks of this bust
is about enough.

823
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:22,325
- You're getting to be Huckleberry Finn.
- You don't understand.

824
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:25,733
Big Moose is no good,
but I'm the only one's got a right to say so.

825
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,339
Well, why don't you start traveling
and hunt him up.

826
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,976
- He's no good.
- Oh, I thought so.

827
00:55:31,144 --> 00:55:32,839
Here again. Now, look here, my boy.

828
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:35,140
You've got to sober up
and get back to the field.

829
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:38,216
I've got my business.
I can't handle your work and mine too.

830
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:40,080
- I've got a...
- Do you wanna buy me out?

831
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,914
I couldn't. I'd...

832
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,181
- For what price?
- Wait a minute, honey.

833
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:45,551
Any price you say.

834
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:48,592
Well, now, that might be arranged, John.

835
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,254
That's a good idea. I'll have
the papers in my office in half an hour.

836
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,694
All right. I'll be there.

837
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:56,233
You can't go into a deal
with this vulture when...

838
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:57,893
I'm through. I'm gonna go away.

839
00:55:58,071 --> 00:56:01,268
I never wanna see another oil derrick
as long as I live.

840
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,001
Evie, you're a good kid,
but keep all your teeth.

841
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:06,168
Oh, Square John.

842
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,110
I'll see you on the slab, Evie.

843
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,478
Listen, Square John,
I've been trying to tell you all the...

844
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,314
Why, I...

845
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,488
It wasn't your fault, was it?
You were just doing your job.

846
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:25,222
You're probably stuck on him too.

847
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:39,333
All right, here's your percentage
for this month.

848
00:57:39,506 --> 00:57:42,373
Good American dollars.
Business is getting a little better, see?

849
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,804
But look... What is it?

850
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:46,544
That new batch of men off the boat
are signing up now.

851
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,544
All right, I'll be right out.

852
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,479
General, you tell your boss
I gotta have a little cooperation.

853
00:57:51,651 --> 00:57:54,085
These lollipop guards of yours
are drunk half the time.

854
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:57,417
What happens to my layout if that crowd
throws you boys out of office?

855
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,818
Cockroaches.

856
00:57:58,992 --> 00:58:01,620
Mr. Sand, everything is in the bag.

857
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:05,252
- Good day, my friend.
- What's good about it?

858
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,068
Sign there, Fadden.

859
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:26,148
Sign there, McMasters.
That's at 50 bucks a day.

860
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,078
Hello, big man. Long time no see.

861
00:58:36,462 --> 00:58:38,623
- He run this outfit?
- He's the owner, pal.

862
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:40,561
Mr. Sand.

863
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:44,865
Well, tell Mr. Sand
he can ram his 50 bucks a day up his nose.

864
00:58:45,038 --> 00:58:47,165
I don't need the work.

865
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,674
Hey, you...

866
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:53,369
- Why don't you let me bust him, boss.
- I'd rather have you keep your health.

867
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,074
Come here. Hello. Hello.

868
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,286
- Why, Jonathan.
- Hello, Betsy.

869
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:08,791
- I kind of thought you'd be here.
- Come on in, Jonathan.

870
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,123
I guess you heard about
me being here too, huh?

871
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,960
Yes. John's down at the wharf
seeing about...

872
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:19,127
He's getting the tickets,
you know, we're going on south.

873
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,966
- How's everything, Betsy?
- Oh, fine.

874
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,268
You'll have to excuse
the way we look, you know.

875
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,844
What with repacking and everything.

876
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,708
Oh, you look well, Jonathan.

877
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:32,373
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll last till the rains come, I guess.

878
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,053
- No.
- What?

879
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:39,020
You mean you didn't know?

880
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:41,922
Well, of course you didn't.
Come and look.

881
00:59:44,297 --> 00:59:46,162
- Look.
- Holy suffering water lilies.

882
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,823
- When did this happen?
- Ten months ago in Oklahoma.

883
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,096
We just made it to the hospital.
Little Jack.

884
00:59:55,399 --> 00:59:57,833
Don't you think he looks like his pop?

885
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,868
He does around here.

886
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:04,164
I don't know.

887
01:00:06,076 --> 01:00:08,203
We'd better leave him.
He wants to be picked up.

888
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:10,904
You know, he has to be asleep
when we start for the boat.

889
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:12,708
So long, partner.

890
01:00:14,618 --> 01:00:17,951
Well, I've got to get on
with my packing, Jonathan. Sit down.

891
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:21,489
- You must be doing big things down here.
- Oh, okay, I guess.

892
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,492
I could use somebody
to smoosh these candy politicians, though.

893
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,961
- You couldn't get that ornery, no-good...?
- I'd give anything if I could...

894
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:29,861
...but he won't even talk about it.

895
01:00:30,034 --> 01:00:32,559
You know, you're still up, and he's...

896
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:34,465
Well, it's pride, I guess.

897
01:00:34,638 --> 01:00:36,970
This place you're going to
is worse than this layout.

898
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:38,472
It's double wages, though.

899
01:00:38,642 --> 01:00:42,100
He's got his eye on a wildcat back
in Oklahoma, and we're saving every nickel.

900
01:00:42,279 --> 01:00:45,146
It's no good, dragging you around like this.
You having to...

901
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:48,513
But, Jonathan,
I'm the happiest woman there is.

902
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,551
Don't you see? He needs me.

903
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,916
But now, with Little Jackie and all...

904
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:56,287
...we really need each other
for the first time because it's a struggle.

905
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,623
Happiness comes out of a struggle,
Jonathan. I found that out.

906
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:01,731
Still no reason
why you and the kid should...

907
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:04,060
I never would've taken you
around like that...

908
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:06,100
You aren't taking her anywhere.

909
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,194
John.

910
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,870
John, we've got to stop this.
We aren't children.

911
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,565
Get out.

912
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,938
- Good luck, Betsy.
- Goodbye, Jonathan.

913
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:23,712
You haven't finished
your packing yet, have you?

914
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,448
I'll see what
the guy in the back room will have.

915
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,324
Here, here, here.

916
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,595
Hold it, pal, hold it.

917
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:36,790
Here, here, here. Take it easy.

918
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:40,562
Yes, yeah. There.

919
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:43,030
Everything's gonna be all right.

920
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:54,004
The Indian I leased the land from
gave a dance last night...

921
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:55,736
...and they all took a bath in it.

922
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:59,440
You know, McMasters, we've been talking
about you quite a lot in New York.

923
01:02:59,616 --> 01:03:04,747
With the other fields falling off fast, we can
give you quite a nice deal for next year.

924
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,617
Mr. Compton, I'm not ready
to sign for next year just yet.

925
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:09,019
- No?
- No.

926
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:12,754
The refining and distributing end
sounds like quite a game.

927
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:17,264
I was thinking maybe
that I might move into New York myself.

928
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:19,459
- What?
- Sure, why not?

929
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:22,298
But... But you have a perfect setup here.

930
01:03:22,473 --> 01:03:24,304
What do you want to
step into our end for?

931
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:25,942
Oh, I don't know.

932
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:30,046
From where I'm standing,
your end looks like the big leagues to me.

933
01:03:30,214 --> 01:03:31,943
- Daddy.
- Hi.

934
01:03:32,116 --> 01:03:35,279
- Daddy, I steered it all the way.
- You did, huh?

935
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:36,680
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

936
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,049
- I want you to meet the president.
- How do you do?

937
01:03:39,223 --> 01:03:41,487
How do you do, Mr. Compton.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

938
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:44,149
Mr. Smith and I want you
to look over the plans.

939
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:46,853
Our new house.
You know those last minute mix-ups.

940
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,363
When you've planned for so long,
you want to be sure.

941
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:50,966
A new house, Mrs. McMasters?

942
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:54,036
But your husband was just telling me
you were moving to New York.

943
01:03:54,204 --> 01:03:56,172
New York? What?

944
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,604
Oh, pipe dreams, honey.
Pay no attention.

945
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,242
- Now, let's see.
- It's this end of the living room.

946
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:04,745
Look, I want to stop off at the car first.
Expecting a long-distance call.

947
01:04:04,915 --> 01:04:07,076
- See you at the convention. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

948
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:09,344
Wait a minute. I'll be right with you.

949
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:13,649
All you've got to do is to bring the study
wall right out to here and you've got it.

950
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:15,382
Honey, I gotta beat it.

951
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:16,992
- See you tonight.
- Yes.

952
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:18,992
So long. So long, speedy.

953
01:04:19,563 --> 01:04:22,191
- No, no. No hurry.
- Well, here we are.

954
01:04:22,366 --> 01:04:24,664
Look. Your name
plastered over every other tank.

955
01:04:24,835 --> 01:04:27,599
- What more do you want?
- It'd look just as good on a pipeline.

956
01:04:27,771 --> 01:04:30,433
Well, well, well. So you'd build
your own pipeline. Come in.

957
01:04:36,613 --> 01:04:40,105
Well, where would your pipelines go?
To whose refineries?

958
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,275
I guess I'll have to
put up my own refineries.

959
01:04:42,453 --> 01:04:45,889
Your own refineries? Sit down.

960
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:47,956
But then how would you
sell your gasoline?

961
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,456
Where's your distribution?

962
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:52,060
Looks like I'll have to put up
my own filling stations.

963
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:55,687
All over the East, eh?
Right kitty-corner from mine, maybe?

964
01:04:56,266 --> 01:04:59,997
- Maybe.
- Why, that almost sounds like competition.

965
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,401
- Yeah, it does, if I did it.
- New York office calling, Mr. Compton.

966
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:05,269
I'll take it in there. Oh, Karen.

967
01:05:05,442 --> 01:05:06,739
Come here, old man.

968
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,775
I want you to meet McMasters.
Miss Vanmeer.

969
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,504
- How do you do.
- Big John McMasters.

970
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:13,741
You may have heard me speak of him.
Thinking of moving into New York.

971
01:05:14,017 --> 01:05:16,577
Get him a drink or something.
He's a big oil man out here.

972
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,980
Don't mind Harry.
He likes to insult people he respects.

973
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:22,557
- What kind of a drink will it be?
- Nothing, thanks.

974
01:05:22,726 --> 01:05:24,990
Little too early in the day for me.

975
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:28,291
You know, you're much younger
than I thought you'd be.

976
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:31,229
What'd you expect, stranger?
A bald head and a breadbasket?

977
01:05:31,401 --> 01:05:34,165
Well, stranger, they told me
you were an oil baron.

978
01:05:34,338 --> 01:05:36,135
Is that the way they grow them
back East?

979
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:39,002
In spite of all their steam baths.

980
01:05:39,843 --> 01:05:42,744
Say, this is quite a caboose
he's got here.

981
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:44,744
- This one of his nags?
- Yes.

982
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:48,783
- Interested in horses?
- Sure, everybody goes for a good horse.

983
01:05:48,952 --> 01:05:51,079
Harry's just bringing back a string
from Tijuana.

984
01:05:51,255 --> 01:05:53,553
They're in the next car.
Would you like to see them?

985
01:05:53,724 --> 01:05:56,022
- Sure, fine.
- All right.

986
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,656
And this is Green Devil by Blue Star.

987
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,025
You've heard of him, haven't you?

988
01:06:02,966 --> 01:06:04,194
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

989
01:06:04,368 --> 01:06:06,495
"Yeah, yeah." Where did you go
all of a sudden?

990
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,399
- Sorry.
- It wasn't New York, was it?

991
01:06:08,572 --> 01:06:10,130
Yeah, I'm afraid you got me.

992
01:06:10,307 --> 01:06:14,539
You look very happy right here. Why do
you really want to go to New York?

993
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:16,201
Oh, I don't know.

994
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,747
I remember when I was in short pants,
a big redheaded kid had two apples...

995
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:21,782
...and dared me to take one
away from him.

996
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:24,750
- Did you do it?
- Yeah. It was fun.

997
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:27,456
Harry's not a redheaded kid.

998
01:06:27,624 --> 01:06:31,321
He is grown up, and in New York,
you'd be running right into his backyard.

999
01:06:31,495 --> 01:06:32,860
Sounds good.

1000
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,090
I don't like to stay in one place
too long anyhow.

1001
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:37,927
Well, partner?

1002
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,501
New York's a rough town, partner.

1003
01:06:40,671 --> 01:06:44,107
I guess you've never been in
Burkburnett or Whizbang or Ranger.

1004
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:46,799
Oh, no, I mean quietly rough.
No shooting from the hip.

1005
01:06:46,977 --> 01:06:49,741
Just stab in the back
with white kid gloves.

1006
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:53,080
Take it from one who knows oil,
Big John.

1007
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,184
What does a girl like you
know about oil?

1008
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:57,286
I know the men that control it.

1009
01:06:57,454 --> 01:07:00,082
I hear things at dinner parties,
nightclubs...

1010
01:07:00,257 --> 01:07:03,693
...anywhere where men are off guard
and wives talk.

1011
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,454
You're sort of Harry's
private-detective agency, huh?

1012
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,962
- Sort of.
- Well, thanks for the tip.

1013
01:07:09,132 --> 01:07:11,760
But I still think that
Harry's my redheaded boy.

1014
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:15,336
All right, but don't start crying
when they put you against the wall...

1015
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:17,132
...without even a blindfold.

1016
01:07:17,307 --> 01:07:19,605
Well, at least they'd know
they'd been in a scrap.

1017
01:07:21,211 --> 01:07:23,236
I guess they would, at that.

1018
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:29,511
- What's the matter?
- You in New York.

1019
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:31,517
Did you buy that yourself?

1020
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:34,623
Sure, 5000 bucks' worth. Why?

1021
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,652
I thought it might have been
your mother's or something...

1022
01:07:37,828 --> 01:07:40,228
...and you were wearing it
for sentimental reasons.

1023
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:41,796
I don't get you.

1024
01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:43,489
That's all right.

1025
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:46,861
Well, Big John,
I may be a little crazy...

1026
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:49,870
...but if you move to New York,
I'll be cheering for you.

1027
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,632
Will you save me a ringside seat?

1028
01:07:51,808 --> 01:07:54,402
Well, come on, old man.
We'd better go up to the meeting.

1029
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:56,478
How did he like my gee-gees, Karen?

1030
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,171
I hope he thought they were nice.

1031
01:07:58,348 --> 01:07:59,975
- Goodbye.
- So long.

1032
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,175
Be back this afternoon, Karen.

1033
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:07,281
Clever girl, isn't she?

1034
01:08:07,924 --> 01:08:09,152
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1035
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:11,794
We met in the Dutch West Indies,
at the Maracaibo field.

1036
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,657
She was married to a young geologist.

1037
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:15,923
She didn't like it down there.

1038
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:58,136
Hey. Hey.

1039
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:02,935
- Going to town?
- Sure. Hop on in.

1040
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:07,841
Nice car you got here.

1041
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:12,819
You bet. Got three more, same kind,
red, yellow, green.

1042
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:15,651
Sometime one run out of gas.

1043
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:21,160
You know this fella John McMasters?

1044
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,697
Yeah. Him fine man.

1045
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:28,429
We shoot crap together.
Him like me very much.

1046
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:37,208
- Yes, sir?
- Corner room.

1047
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,848
Yes, sir.

1048
01:09:39,282 --> 01:09:41,250
So long, Mr. Compton.
Glad to have had you.

1049
01:09:41,418 --> 01:09:43,682
Fine. A very informative meeting,
gentlemen.

1050
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:46,118
Well, I have to pull out this afternoon.

1051
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:49,224
If I were you, I'd forget
that New York idea.

1052
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:50,826
Yeah? Well, who can tell?

1053
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:53,428
Well, so long, Big John.

1054
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:55,428
Yeah, so long.

1055
01:09:58,268 --> 01:10:00,133
Your... Your luggage, Mr. Sand?

1056
01:10:00,303 --> 01:10:02,794
Oh, no, no luggage.
I came in my private car.

1057
01:10:02,973 --> 01:10:06,409
I won't go up right now, but have
the chef fix dinner for six tonight.

1058
01:10:06,576 --> 01:10:08,407
- I'll leave everything to him.
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:10:08,578 --> 01:10:10,944
Hey, Shorty,
didn't you forget the wine?

1060
01:10:11,114 --> 01:10:14,311
Well, well, well. How are you?

1061
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:15,883
Fine, fine.

1062
01:10:16,052 --> 01:10:18,486
Sorry to hear they took you
to the cleaners down there.

1063
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:21,021
Well, the other side took over...

1064
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:23,682
...but you know me.
I came out with twice what I put in.

1065
01:10:24,728 --> 01:10:26,787
Well, that's fine. I might have known it.

1066
01:10:26,963 --> 01:10:29,363
Sure, sure.
I was way ahead of them all the time.

1067
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:31,524
If that's so,
I got a big proposition for you.

1068
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:33,692
A lot of dough in it for us.
What do you say?

1069
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,805
- Well, now, I don't know.
- You don't have to provide cash now.

1070
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:39,168
For a long time,
I've been looking for a guy who...

1071
01:10:39,342 --> 01:10:44,006
No, no, I don't think so. I got too
many things in the fire right now.

1072
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:47,116
How are things at the convention?
Anything interesting?

1073
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:50,845
Nothing much. Harry Compton and the
crowd just dropped in from the East.

1074
01:10:51,021 --> 01:10:52,283
- Is Harry in town?
- Yeah.

1075
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:55,289
Well, like to see the old boy.
Might have a big deal on.

1076
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,492
Well, there he is, right over there.

1077
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,954
The guy on the phone.

1078
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:04,590
Oh, yes, yes, I didn't see him.

1079
01:11:04,768 --> 01:11:07,032
- Well, I'll be seeing you.
- Yeah, so long.

1080
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:10,071
- Yes, that sounds all right to me.
- Only one Corona Perfecto.

1081
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,468
Darn that doctor.

1082
01:11:11,975 --> 01:11:14,944
- There you are. The 4 bits is yours.
- Hi, John Sand.

1083
01:11:15,111 --> 01:11:17,102
Well, if it ain't John Sand.
You old maverick.

1084
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,407
- Well, Tom and Ed.
- How are you, John?

1085
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:22,051
- Well, how goes it, boys?
- We're lucky we run into you.

1086
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:24,915
Real oil men in this town
are scarcer than poor Indians.

1087
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:27,556
Yeah. You and us have gotta
have a deal right off, John.

1088
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:30,522
Look. We got us a cinch
wildcat lease here.

1089
01:11:30,694 --> 01:11:33,891
It ain't near any proven stuff, but...
Sit down here a minute.

1090
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,895
The anticline runs right through here.

1091
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:40,900
We know there's oil five miles over here.

1092
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:43,198
We know there's oil
five miles in this direction.

1093
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:45,466
And that's the whole thing.
Now, look, John...

1094
01:11:45,642 --> 01:11:49,669
...if you'll just stake us to the tools
and equipment, you'll be in it for half.

1095
01:11:49,846 --> 01:11:52,110
- Now, don't that sound good?
- Sure does. Sure does.

1096
01:11:52,282 --> 01:11:54,409
All you need is some tools
and a string of pipe?

1097
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:56,279
We've been over to see Luther Aldrich.

1098
01:11:56,453 --> 01:11:58,387
- He sat there...
- Is Luther Aldrich in town?

1099
01:11:58,555 --> 01:12:00,352
Yeah. Moved his main office up here.

1100
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:04,722
He's got the money, but you couldn't
blast a cent out of him with nitro.

1101
01:12:04,895 --> 01:12:07,295
Well, I don't know.
I got so many things in the fire.

1102
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:10,627
But I'll tell you what I'll do.
Give me 24 hours to think it over.

1103
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,200
- Well, my boy, my boy.
- Luther, old boy...

1104
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,668
...good to see you again.
You haven't changed a bit.

1105
01:12:15,839 --> 01:12:17,864
Thanks. It's like old times.

1106
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:22,034
You know, I've been following your
sensational career with great interest.

1107
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,009
Luther, I came to get a string of tools.

1108
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,671
Oh, of course. Well, here it is.
Take your pick.

1109
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,444
You see, the trouble is,
it'd be a couple of months be...

1110
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,588
My money's tied up in the foreign
banks. You know, politics and...

1111
01:12:32,756 --> 01:12:36,590
Well, don't give it a thought.
All you want, and all the time to pay.

1112
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,126
Sky's the limit, up to 50,000,
if you want it.

1113
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:41,526
Here, wait a minute.
I'll get my order blank.

1114
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:44,326
Well, I take it all back, Luther.
You have changed.

1115
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:47,368
Well, you know,
a fella mellows with age.

1116
01:12:47,537 --> 01:12:51,098
Why, even back in Burkburnett,
I wasn't really sore, remember...

1117
01:12:51,274 --> 01:12:54,437
...when you two fellas stole that pipe?

1118
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:57,944
No. You and Harmony and the sheriff
were just out hunting quail that day.

1119
01:12:58,114 --> 01:13:00,275
Yeah, quail. Yes.

1120
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,918
Well, Big John's doing fine now.

1121
01:13:03,086 --> 01:13:05,350
- Yeah, yeah. I'm glad to hear it.
- Yeah, you are?

1122
01:13:05,522 --> 01:13:07,456
Why don't you two fellas
bury the hatchet.

1123
01:13:07,624 --> 01:13:09,683
We'll bump into one another
one of these days.

1124
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:12,828
No time like the present.
He's in my office right now.

1125
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:15,487
Why, we were just talking about you.
He isn't sore.

1126
01:13:15,665 --> 01:13:17,098
- He said that he...
- I get it. L...

1127
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,201
- No wonder I thought you'd gone nuts.
- Why?

1128
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:21,098
How would you like to eat that pipe?

1129
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,603
- You slaphappy windbag.
- What?

1130
01:13:23,773 --> 01:13:26,537
Okay, Shorty,
I was trying to stake you.

1131
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:29,873
But stop being like a mule ready to kick
himself when he's down and...

1132
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:31,809
I don't need any handouts from you.

1133
01:13:32,315 --> 01:13:34,545
Here, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, my boy.

1134
01:13:34,718 --> 01:13:37,687
To err is human, to forgive divine.

1135
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:40,556
- That's sharp.
- Now, just a minute, Shorty.

1136
01:13:40,757 --> 01:13:42,088
Simmer down, will you, Shorty.

1137
01:13:42,258 --> 01:13:45,056
- You know you always did better with me.
- Oh, so that's it.

1138
01:13:45,228 --> 01:13:47,423
Who was smart enough
to grab off that first lease?

1139
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,656
Yeah, who was smart enough
to get the tools?

1140
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:52,734
What happened when I left?
You turned up your toes and went loco.

1141
01:13:52,902 --> 01:13:56,133
Then you let those tin soldiers take you
for everything but your drawers.

1142
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:59,332
Oh, come on back in with me, Shorty.
Let's make it happy days again.

1143
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:02,307
I don't need you, never did.
Don't hold your breath until I do.

1144
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,606
- And don't call me Shorty.
- Okay, little man.

1145
01:14:04,781 --> 01:14:07,841
Play hard to get. Just don't change
your mind, I won't be here.

1146
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,919
I'm moving East. I'm walking in on
New York, on the real show.

1147
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:14,420
So when you whistle for me,
I'll whistle back with a blowpipe.

1148
01:14:36,713 --> 01:14:40,240
Boy, who said the big city
is no place in the spring?

1149
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,885
Isn't it great? Smell that fresh air.

1150
01:14:43,053 --> 01:14:44,645
Carbon monoxide.

1151
01:14:44,821 --> 01:14:46,254
I'd rather smell fresh oil.

1152
01:14:46,423 --> 01:14:49,290
Why? You're in the consumer's end
of the business now.

1153
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:51,120
Oh, jokes?

1154
01:14:51,294 --> 01:14:54,354
Feeling pretty chipper for a man who
got home at 3:00 in the morning.

1155
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:57,728
That's the way they do business
in this town, 24 hours a day.

1156
01:14:58,168 --> 01:15:00,136
Looks like you're
taking the town by storm.

1157
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:02,794
Compton and his gang know I'm here,
I guess.

1158
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:05,440
Honey. You're happy, aren't you?

1159
01:15:05,608 --> 01:15:07,075
Yes, if you are.

1160
01:15:07,243 --> 01:15:08,870
Hey, of course I am.

1161
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:10,740
Are you sure?

1162
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:13,106
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

1163
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:14,841
I'm just kidding.

1164
01:15:15,018 --> 01:15:19,785
Go on up and slave, only let's have
dinner together tonight for a change.

1165
01:15:19,956 --> 01:15:21,446
I'll try, honey.

1166
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,821
Look, I thought I'd have a few people in
Sunday night, and I need an extra girl.

1167
01:15:27,997 --> 01:15:30,056
- Whom do you suggest?
- Search me. I don't know.

1168
01:15:30,233 --> 01:15:33,259
Well, I thought, perhaps,
what about Karen Vanmeer?

1169
01:15:33,436 --> 01:15:34,869
We haven't seen her for ages...

1170
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:37,097
...and she was so nice
when we first came here.

1171
01:15:37,273 --> 01:15:39,366
- She still works for you, doesn't she?
- Sure...

1172
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:41,874
...but I don't know.
She changes crowds.

1173
01:15:42,045 --> 01:15:43,307
Get somebody else.

1174
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,004
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1175
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:50,215
- Good morning.
- Mr. McMasters.

1176
01:15:50,386 --> 01:15:51,614
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1177
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:53,016
- Mr. McMasters.
- Morning.

1178
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:55,987
- Girls, I want you to understand...
- Girls, the boss is here.

1179
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,888
- Good morning, Mr. McMasters.
- Morning.

1180
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,892
That will be all.

1181
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,460
- <i>Yes?</i>
- He's here, Mr. McCreery.

1182
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:05,294
- You can come in now.
- What's that?

1183
01:16:05,468 --> 01:16:08,631
Mr. Felton with Mr. McCreery and
Mr. Ward about the Lynbrook refinery.

1184
01:16:08,805 --> 01:16:10,397
Great day for the race, Miss Barnes.

1185
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:13,034
- What race?
- The human race.

1186
01:16:13,209 --> 01:16:14,767
- Yes, of course.
- Good morning, J.M.

1187
01:16:14,944 --> 01:16:16,172
- Morning.
- Hi, fellas.

1188
01:16:16,346 --> 01:16:19,144
We took the plans and
went through the plant yesterday...

1189
01:16:19,315 --> 01:16:21,044
...with Mr. Laughlin and the engineers.

1190
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:23,208
What did you find?
Is it up to specifications?

1191
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:25,650
Yes, we think it's a great buy, J.M.

1192
01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:29,656
- Get me Miss Vanmeer.
- Here are the final purchase contracts.

1193
01:16:29,826 --> 01:16:32,624
- What's the whole nut?
- Refinery and cracking plant together...

1194
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:34,286
...about 500,000.

1195
01:16:35,498 --> 01:16:38,058
Hello? Oh, hello, Miss Vanmeer.
How are you?

1196
01:16:38,234 --> 01:16:41,897
I'm fine and half asleep and wonderful.

1197
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:44,505
Just hoping you'd call.

1198
01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:47,267
So formal.

1199
01:16:47,443 --> 01:16:49,741
Why don't you call
when you're not in a crowd.

1200
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:54,282
I'll bet McCreery's peering at you
over his glasses like an owl.

1201
01:16:56,619 --> 01:16:58,314
Yes, you're very right about that.

1202
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:01,184
And I can see from here that
you have got your coat off...

1203
01:17:01,357 --> 01:17:03,689
...and your vest unbuttoned.
And shame on you.

1204
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,191
Okay, okay.

1205
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:08,023
Say, we've got a chance to buy
Henderson's Lynbrook plant...

1206
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:10,723
...for 500,000. I wanted to know
if you'd heard anything.

1207
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,199
Careful, now. I had Willie Henderson
at the Bromleys' the other night...

1208
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,270
...through about two quarts
of champagne.

1209
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:18,669
Halfway through the second,
he dropped a hint.

1210
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:21,868
Those Lynbrook gentlemen
are facing bankruptcy.

1211
01:17:22,045 --> 01:17:24,411
Thanks, Miss Vanmeer.
I thought as much.

1212
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:26,776
Say, on second thought...

1213
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:29,384
...you'd better meet that gentleman
for dinner tonight.

1214
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:34,288
Is this gentleman tall and dark,
and with a Texas accent?

1215
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:36,586
He is.

1216
01:17:36,759 --> 01:17:40,661
Well, then start all over again
and ask me nicer than that.

1217
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,661
I'm sorry, but that's an order.

1218
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:45,733
Darling, you give the nicest orders.

1219
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:47,802
Goodbye, Miss Vanmeer.

1220
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:49,632
Well, boys, l...

1221
01:17:54,978 --> 01:17:57,139
- Shorty's in town.
- Shorty?

1222
01:17:57,313 --> 01:17:58,974
Yeah, yeah. My old partner,
John Sand.

1223
01:17:59,148 --> 01:18:02,140
Oh, yes? He certainly struck it big
in Oklahoma, didn't he?

1224
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:04,445
What did Miss Vanmeer say, J. M?

1225
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:06,185
Oh, yes, yes.

1226
01:18:06,356 --> 01:18:09,223
We'll wait. I think we'll be able
to pick it up a lot cheaper.

1227
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:11,758
Now, wait a minute, J.M.
Miss Vanmeer may be right...

1228
01:18:11,928 --> 01:18:14,328
...but there's a possibility
of losing this. I think...

1229
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:17,591
Her tips are right from the barn, Mac.
She's never failed yet.

1230
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:20,361
All right. After all, it's your money.

1231
01:18:28,778 --> 01:18:31,076
You've quite a lot of mail to answer.

1232
01:18:31,247 --> 01:18:33,715
I haven't had a phone call this morning
from a Mr. Sand?

1233
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:35,407
You know, John Sand from Oklahoma?

1234
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,984
No, you haven't.

1235
01:18:37,153 --> 01:18:39,280
Get him for me, will you?
He's at the Waldorf.

1236
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:43,357
Well, Mr. Sand is registered here,
but he won't be back until this evening.

1237
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:45,050
What?

1238
01:18:45,228 --> 01:18:47,219
Why, he said he was going
to the races.

1239
01:18:55,405 --> 01:18:56,872
<i>A huge crowd is out here today...</i>

1240
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,838
<i>... for another running of this</i>
<i>classic under ideal conditions.</i>

1241
01:19:00,009 --> 01:19:02,978
<i>As I look over this line of</i>
<i>the nation's finest thoroughbreds...</i>

1242
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:05,341
- <i>... I can see number five.</i>
- I like number three.

1243
01:19:05,515 --> 01:19:06,846
- Three?
- Yes.

1244
01:19:07,016 --> 01:19:08,677
He's got a little age on him.

1245
01:19:09,152 --> 01:19:10,710
Nine years...

1246
01:19:13,256 --> 01:19:16,748
- Well, well. Hiya.
- Well, how are you?

1247
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:19,394
- Fine.
- John. What do you know about that.

1248
01:19:19,562 --> 01:19:20,790
Luther, old man.

1249
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,955
We were just saying
on the train yesterday...

1250
01:19:23,132 --> 01:19:25,464
...we'd probably run into
the big moose in New York.

1251
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:26,863
- Weren't we?
- Yeah.

1252
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:30,335
Hey, I heard about you stumbling onto
that big field out there.

1253
01:19:30,506 --> 01:19:32,269
Yeah, I was pretty lucky, I guess.

1254
01:19:32,442 --> 01:19:33,966
The biggest field in Oklahoma now.

1255
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,576
- I bought out the Murphys.
- Yeah?

1256
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:38,305
Yeah. I guess I was always
supposed to play the lone wolf.

1257
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,142
One head is better than two, I say.

1258
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:42,876
Yeah, sure, sure.
You know, I find it that way here.

1259
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:45,953
<i>Sun Helmet to the front.</i>
<i>Faraday, second. Blue Comet, third.</i>

1260
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:48,113
I made the bets.
Moonray to win, number nine.

1261
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,885
- Good.
- Lf it isn't my old friend McMasters.

1262
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:53,119
- Hi.
- <i>Moonray is moving up fast...</i>

1263
01:19:53,296 --> 01:19:56,060
<i>... between horses. It's Moonray</i>
<i>and Sun Helmet, neck and neck.</i>

1264
01:19:56,232 --> 01:19:58,359
<i>Moonray is going away.</i>
<i>It's gonna be Moonray.</i>

1265
01:19:59,936 --> 01:20:02,734
Well, gentlemen, that's us.
Come on, come on.

1266
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:05,198
So you're going in with Compton?

1267
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,070
He's liable to make you a big guy.

1268
01:20:07,243 --> 01:20:09,507
I been doing well on my own,
if anybody should ask.

1269
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,842
Jonathan, just because you and I
are going in with Harry against him...

1270
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,244
...is no reason to...
- What?

1271
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:16,078
Hey. Is he in with you?

1272
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:18,652
Well, I'm interested in a small way.

1273
01:20:18,821 --> 01:20:21,517
Luther broke down and staked me
to the first string of tools.

1274
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,750
I only had to give him
10 percent of the field.

1275
01:20:23,926 --> 01:20:26,121
What? He staked you?

1276
01:20:26,295 --> 01:20:28,229
- You dirty double-crosser.
- Wait a minute.

1277
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:31,424
- Don't fly off half-cocked. L...
- I'll fly a kite down your windpipe.

1278
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:33,728
- Well...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1279
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:36,269
Did you guarantee
that equipment for me?

1280
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:39,902
Well, he didn't have to put up
any money. Our oil well came in.

1281
01:20:40,076 --> 01:20:41,907
- Everything's perfectly...
- lf it hadn't...

1282
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:44,012
...you'd be in my checkbook
like a pressed pansy.

1283
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,512
Are you insinuating that
I'm an unethical character?

1284
01:20:46,682 --> 01:20:48,946
- No. You're just a crooked old jerk.
- Jerk?

1285
01:20:49,118 --> 01:20:53,578
Why, back in Burkburnett,
you two fellas stole half of my...

1286
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,589
- Scotch.
- Hey, Shorty...

1287
01:20:59,762 --> 01:21:02,230
...back in my office,
I got me two quarts of red liquor.

1288
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:04,628
Bourbon. What do you say?

1289
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:06,530
- Let's go.
- Well, that's fine.

1290
01:21:06,702 --> 01:21:08,499
- I'll wait for Harry and he'll...
- No, no.

1291
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:10,969
What? Why?
Here, now, wait a minute.

1292
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:14,234
What are you doing? You can't rustle
me around like one of the horses.

1293
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,004
I didn't come here to be insulted.

1294
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:20,115
Get back, or we'll have the warden
take away your candy allowance.

1295
01:21:20,283 --> 01:21:23,377
I'm gonna have this settled,
once and for all. When I first met...

1296
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:27,045
When I first met you two thugs,
you were over here...

1297
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,554
I'm sorry, Mr. McMasters...

1298
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:31,818
...but Mr. Compton is on the phone
again for Mr. Sand and Mr. Aldrich.

1299
01:21:31,994 --> 01:21:33,825
- Tell...
- Say Mr. Aldrich is having a baby.

1300
01:21:33,996 --> 01:21:35,896
- But this is outrageous.
- Look.

1301
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:39,228
I've got a big office next door
just waiting for your name on the door.

1302
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:41,563
I knew that when we left the racetrack.

1303
01:21:41,737 --> 01:21:43,671
But wait a minute.
We told Compton that...

1304
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,331
- Where's my office?
- Right underneath the warden's.

1305
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:48,841
Mr. McMasters, your tailor is here.

1306
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:51,912
Tell him to go away.
Come back next year when I...

1307
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:54,606
No, wait a minute. Bring him in.

1308
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:56,012
We got work to do.

1309
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,618
When you two fellas sober up...

1310
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,813
...you can call me at my hotel.

1311
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:04,721
- Mr. Luther.
- Better fit them both for straitjackets.

1312
01:22:05,995 --> 01:22:08,793
- <i>Bonjour</i>, Monsieur McMasters.
- Hi, Ferdie. Never mind my stuff.

1313
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,523
You got a new customer, Mr. Sand.

1314
01:22:11,434 --> 01:22:12,696
What goes on here?

1315
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:14,461
You're buying a couple dozen suits.

1316
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:15,968
- I got two suits.
- Two suits?

1317
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:18,573
It's New York. You look like
a Houston house detective.

1318
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:21,039
You got anything
that you think Mr. Sand might like?

1319
01:22:22,612 --> 01:22:25,274
That wonderful new, striking
Harris tweed you ordered.

1320
01:22:25,448 --> 01:22:26,847
Oh, yes, yes.

1321
01:22:27,016 --> 01:22:29,143
Say, that ought to look
all right on you, Shorty.

1322
01:22:29,318 --> 01:22:32,287
- Don't you think so, Ferdie?
- Let me see.

1323
01:22:32,455 --> 01:22:36,152
Yes. The buff brings out
the ruddiness in his complexion.

1324
01:22:36,325 --> 01:22:38,122
Wait a minute.
Is this guy on the level?

1325
01:22:38,294 --> 01:22:42,162
That's imported stuff. Old women
weave it in cottages over in Scotland.

1326
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,526
Let Mr. Sand smell it, Ferdie.

1327
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,430
Get that intriguing aroma
from the peat fires?

1328
01:22:47,603 --> 01:22:50,231
- Smells a little gamy.
- You fellows kill me.

1329
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:52,203
Get a load of those shoulders,
Ferdie.

1330
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:54,707
- Could you do something with them?
- Let me see.

1331
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:58,173
What a nice modeling.
We should get a perfect drape.

1332
01:22:58,347 --> 01:23:01,043
- Would you mind stepping over here?
- I'm gonna let this guy...

1333
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:02,812
Yes, yes.

1334
01:23:03,085 --> 01:23:05,713
All right, all right.
Just a moment.

1335
01:23:06,956 --> 01:23:08,617
Just a moment, please.

1336
01:23:09,592 --> 01:23:11,389
Tape.

1337
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:12,823
- Forty-four.
- Forty-four.

1338
01:23:12,995 --> 01:23:15,225
Am I interrupting?
Or are ladies allowed?

1339
01:23:15,398 --> 01:23:18,128
Hello. Hello, Karen.

1340
01:23:19,335 --> 01:23:22,498
Come in, come in.
Shorty, this is Karen Vanmeer.

1341
01:23:22,672 --> 01:23:24,105
John Sand, Karen.

1342
01:23:24,273 --> 01:23:26,935
- Pleased to know you, I'm sure.
- So you're Square John.

1343
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:28,599
I've heard a lot about you.

1344
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:30,245
Yeah? Running me down again, pal?

1345
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:34,281
I was just passing by and took
a chance my boss might be in.

1346
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,941
- Can you talk to me for a moment?
- Sure, sure.

1347
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:39,679
- Excuse us, will you, Shorty?
- Yeah.

1348
01:23:39,855 --> 01:23:42,415
Eighteen. Hold out your arm.
Bend it, please.

1349
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:44,492
- Thirty-one.
- Thirty-one.

1350
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,651
Turn around, please.

1351
01:23:47,163 --> 01:23:49,631
Looks as if I'm going to be
a very lonely girl tonight.

1352
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:52,791
Sorry. But Shorty and I have got
a lot of old times to talk over.

1353
01:23:52,969 --> 01:23:55,802
But you mustn't forget
there are new times too.

1354
01:23:55,972 --> 01:23:59,601
Look, you've got to learn to take no
for an answer once in a while.

1355
01:23:59,775 --> 01:24:02,471
I wouldn't let you give me that answer.

1356
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:05,739
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two.

1357
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,047
Turn around, please.
Now we take the trouser length.

1358
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:12,881
I'll be running along.
Nice to have met you, Square John.

1359
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:15,489
I'm happy to hear we're
going to see a lot more of you.

1360
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:17,216
- Sure. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

1361
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:19,122
- Goodbye.
- You like them snug?

1362
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:21,593
Yes, come on. Get on with it, buddy.
Get on with it.

1363
01:24:21,797 --> 01:24:23,389
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1364
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:30,538
Get me Mrs. McMasters.

1365
01:24:30,706 --> 01:24:35,006
Hey, who is this Vanmeer dame?
She'd stop a stampede, if you ask me.

1366
01:24:35,177 --> 01:24:36,735
Yeah, smart girl. She works for me.

1367
01:24:36,912 --> 01:24:38,470
- Where? Here in the office?
- No, no.

1368
01:24:38,648 --> 01:24:40,240
She knows everybody here
in New York.

1369
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,940
Gets around and hears everything.

1370
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,416
That's the way you work in this town.

1371
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:47,211
Betsy.

1372
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,688
Hello? Yeah, hello, honey.

1373
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:51,190
Yeah, I'll be home for dinner.

1374
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,056
Yeah, yeah, and I'm bringing
a guy with me.

1375
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:56,198
Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, business.

1376
01:24:56,866 --> 01:24:58,800
Yes, John. All right.

1377
01:25:00,236 --> 01:25:01,828
Goodbye, dear.

1378
01:25:04,273 --> 01:25:08,642
Now, Jack, play like this is an Apache
Indian and he's sneaking up on you.

1379
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,881
You broke one of your
pappy's thingamabobs.

1380
01:25:14,717 --> 01:25:15,945
Another vase.

1381
01:25:16,118 --> 01:25:17,710
Mr. McMasters will hear about this.

1382
01:25:17,887 --> 01:25:20,321
Mr. McMasters.
Mr. McMasters...

1383
01:25:20,489 --> 01:25:22,423
...this sort of thing goes on
all the time.

1384
01:25:22,591 --> 01:25:23,888
It'll toughen you up, Parker.

1385
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,119
Cans of catfish and dang my tired eyes.

1386
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:28,422
Harmony, Harmony, how are you?
How are?

1387
01:25:28,597 --> 01:25:30,189
Why is your pajama top on?

1388
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:31,924
I don't know. It's his idea.

1389
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:33,500
- Daddy.
- Jackie.

1390
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,967
- Pal, this is your uncle Square John.
- Hello, sport.

1391
01:25:36,138 --> 01:25:39,596
Hello, Uncle Square John. Do you
wanna play Shooting Indians with me?

1392
01:25:39,809 --> 01:25:42,744
Partner, you and your old uncle
are gonna play plenty from now on.

1393
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:45,912
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't expect you so...

1394
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:49,013
Well, well, well. Just as I knew her.

1395
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,119
Still much too pretty to walk and talk.

1396
01:25:52,488 --> 01:25:55,116
- Jonathan.
- Betsy.

1397
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,725
Oh, Jonathan.

1398
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:01,455
Well, if I cry now, don't blame me.

1399
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:04,258
You two idiots. All this time.

1400
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:06,799
Yeah, yeah, we buried it
in a bottle of bourbon.

1401
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:10,336
Pardon me, Mrs. McMasters.
It's time for Jackie's supper now.

1402
01:26:10,506 --> 01:26:12,167
- Mommy...
- No, no, now, darling.

1403
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:15,242
- You can come down later.
- Yeah, come on, son.

1404
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:17,003
You know, he looks exactly like you.

1405
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:18,544
I'll buy him a football helmet.

1406
01:26:18,714 --> 01:26:20,545
He's much too young
for a football helmet.

1407
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:23,480
Oh, I don't mean to play in,
I mean to sleep in.

1408
01:26:25,254 --> 01:26:27,722
Okay, okay.

1409
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,158
Jonathan... Come on in.

1410
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:37,731
Jackie's a great kid.
They're both great kids.

1411
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,664
And this is a swell layout.
It's you all over, Betsy.

1412
01:26:40,836 --> 01:26:42,167
Class.

1413
01:26:42,338 --> 01:26:44,898
You and the big moose
must really be happy here.

1414
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:47,907
Yes, of course we are, Jonathan.

1415
01:26:54,016 --> 01:26:55,313
Betsy...

1416
01:26:55,484 --> 01:26:58,146
...everything is going great guns,
isn't it?

1417
01:26:59,655 --> 01:27:01,623
Oh, Jonathan.

1418
01:27:02,892 --> 01:27:04,655
Betsy...

1419
01:27:04,827 --> 01:27:08,024
...something's the matter. What is it?

1420
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:09,822
Oh, nothing. It's...

1421
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:13,628
It's just now that I'm so happy
to see you two together again...

1422
01:27:13,803 --> 01:27:16,431
I'm so happy that you're here.

1423
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:21,465
Well, I'm sorry,
I warned you I might cry, though.

1424
01:27:21,644 --> 01:27:23,669
Please let me a little.

1425
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,617
See, honey, this bank of blowers
first heats the crude oil in those coils...

1426
01:27:31,787 --> 01:27:33,345
...to about 600 degrees Fahrenheit.

1427
01:27:33,522 --> 01:27:35,649
- Dante's <i>Inferno</i> has nothing on this.
- No.

1428
01:27:35,825 --> 01:27:39,784
It's carried up to that fractionating tower,
where it's heated to about 900 degrees.

1429
01:27:39,962 --> 01:27:43,193
That's what we mean by cracking.
That's where the crude is condensed...

1430
01:27:43,365 --> 01:27:45,356
...and evaporated into gasoline,
kerosene...

1431
01:27:45,534 --> 01:27:48,162
...naphtha and paving asphalt,
medicinal oils.

1432
01:27:48,337 --> 01:27:51,329
Oh, hundreds of byproducts,
and all points west.

1433
01:27:51,507 --> 01:27:53,270
All that? Hey, Jonathan...

1434
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:56,934
...l'll bet you're glad that I talked you
out of going with Compton.

1435
01:27:57,112 --> 01:27:59,706
If we buy a couple more of these,
we'll run Compton ragged.

1436
01:27:59,882 --> 01:28:03,215
You haven't signed that contract.
It's been on your desk since yesterday.

1437
01:28:03,385 --> 01:28:05,512
- I'll get around to it.
- Make it snappy.

1438
01:28:05,688 --> 01:28:08,452
Over there is our crude-oil
storage-tank farm.

1439
01:28:09,525 --> 01:28:14,462
These ball-shaped pressure tanks
are for butane and casing-head gas.

1440
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,599
- Well, if it isn't the man l...
- Hello, Karen.

1441
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:21,101
Hello there.

1442
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,362
How do you do?

1443
01:28:24,206 --> 01:28:26,640
- It's nice to see you again.
- Thanks. Hello, you two.

1444
01:28:26,809 --> 01:28:28,037
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1445
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,007
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

1446
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,080
- Here and there. You're looking well.
- I feel fine, thank you.

1447
01:28:33,249 --> 01:28:35,080
I heard something frightfully important.

1448
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:37,515
I couldn't get you at the office,
so I dropped by.

1449
01:28:37,686 --> 01:28:39,517
- What's up?
- The independent operators'...

1450
01:28:39,688 --> 01:28:41,622
...convention in Washington
begins tomorrow.

1451
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:44,759
I just heard there's something
in the air about price-cutting.

1452
01:28:44,927 --> 01:28:46,827
I thought you might want to be there.

1453
01:28:46,996 --> 01:28:49,464
Those independent operators
might come in handy, Shorty.

1454
01:28:49,632 --> 01:28:51,896
Shall we go and see
if we're getting kicked around?

1455
01:28:52,067 --> 01:28:54,900
You better go alone. You know
how to smoosh those get-togethers.

1456
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:57,538
I'm gonna stay here.
Maybe Luther and I can get Betsy...

1457
01:28:57,706 --> 01:28:59,640
...to show us some of the hot spots.
- Okay.

1458
01:28:59,808 --> 01:29:01,036
- You'd like that?
- You bet.

1459
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,768
- Fine.
- Well, I have to hurry back.

1460
01:29:02,945 --> 01:29:04,845
- So long, everybody.
- Goodbye, Karen.

1461
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:06,242
Don't be such a stranger.

1462
01:29:06,415 --> 01:29:08,212
- Thanks.
- Couple of things to talk about.

1463
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:10,011
I'll be right back.

1464
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:14,746
You know, it is interesting,
all that superstructure.

1465
01:29:14,924 --> 01:29:16,983
Yeah, yeah.
Say, I got an appointment downtown.

1466
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:19,821
I better grab a cab, I'll see you later.
Tell him, will you?

1467
01:29:20,629 --> 01:29:23,689
Yes. It is, it's interesting.

1468
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:26,960
I know a couple of bootleggers
in Oklahoma who'd like to have this.

1469
01:29:27,136 --> 01:29:29,627
You know, Betsy, bathtub gin?

1470
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:33,337
Children make a lot of difference,
don't they, Luther?

1471
01:29:34,143 --> 01:29:35,405
Listen, Betsy.

1472
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:36,909
Don't jump to conclusions.

1473
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:39,570
I wouldn't have stood for this
back in Burkburnett.

1474
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:43,514
Darling, I'm a kind of an old fool
now and then...

1475
01:29:43,686 --> 01:29:45,415
...but I love you and John so much...

1476
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:47,715
...and I've watched fellas like him
in my time.

1477
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:51,326
- Don't worry. They'll always...
- You're very sweet, Luther.

1478
01:29:51,493 --> 01:29:53,654
Come on, show me around some more.

1479
01:30:00,102 --> 01:30:01,831
- Is your boss in?
- Who will I say is...?

1480
01:30:02,004 --> 01:30:03,801
That's all right. She knows me.

1481
01:30:05,107 --> 01:30:07,575
- Hello, Karen.
- Well, for heaven's sake.

1482
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:09,108
I just left you on Long Island.

1483
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:12,338
You know you're the prettiest gal
east of Frisco in that little rig?

1484
01:30:12,514 --> 01:30:14,243
Get me a little drink of whiskey,
honey?

1485
01:30:14,416 --> 01:30:16,213
Why, of course.

1486
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:20,155
Scram, you. I'll buy you
a diamond day bed for Christmas.

1487
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:23,015
- Where's John?
- I ducked him.

1488
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:26,522
Yeah, sure. I didn't want him around
when I talked to you.

1489
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:28,963
Certainly is a nifty little joint you got.

1490
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:30,996
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

1491
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:34,365
- Bourbon, straight.
- Thank you.

1492
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:38,097
You know, I always wondered why John
never brought you up here before.

1493
01:30:38,273 --> 01:30:40,798
Karen, you're a pretty smart little gal.

1494
01:30:41,543 --> 01:30:43,841
Yes, sir, you're a smart little gal.

1495
01:30:44,546 --> 01:30:47,242
This income-tax thing
is getting to be a heck of a note.

1496
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:50,852
Would you believe that
I'll pay 220,000 this year?

1497
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:53,352
Well, I'd say you're very lucky.

1498
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:56,814
You know, Karen, I may not
look much like a lady's man...

1499
01:30:56,992 --> 01:30:59,586
...but many a gal has cried when I left.

1500
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:02,760
If I were a man, I'd consider that
a great compliment...

1501
01:31:02,931 --> 01:31:05,627
...but why tell me?
- Well, I'll get to the real point.

1502
01:31:05,801 --> 01:31:08,429
I'll skip my better ones,
like my not snoring...

1503
01:31:08,604 --> 01:31:10,663
...and knowing when
a dame needs a walloping...

1504
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,704
...to be sure that I'm in love with her.

1505
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,935
And that I've got all the money
in the world, outside of some change.

1506
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:18,841
I got an idea.
I'm asking you to marry me.

1507
01:31:20,182 --> 01:31:21,706
I don't get it.

1508
01:31:21,884 --> 01:31:23,579
I simply don't get it.

1509
01:31:23,752 --> 01:31:27,051
You don't want to marry me, of course,
but you meant what you said.

1510
01:31:27,222 --> 01:31:28,814
I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

1511
01:31:28,991 --> 01:31:31,755
I'll sign a paper stating
I'm in my right mind.

1512
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:35,621
So you're bound to get most of my
dough if the thing don't work out.

1513
01:31:37,266 --> 01:31:38,824
I see.

1514
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:43,767
Greater love hath no man
than to lay down his life for his...

1515
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,998
Why, it's even more than that.

1516
01:31:46,175 --> 01:31:50,373
It's Betsy. You're in love
with John McMasters' wife.

1517
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:53,515
What do you say? Let's go to
the Hall of Records and make it legal.

1518
01:31:53,682 --> 01:31:56,378
- You obviously dislike me.
- Ain't it the truth.

1519
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:59,214
I don't like poachers, male or female.

1520
01:31:59,655 --> 01:32:01,350
I rang a buzzer when I came in here...

1521
01:32:01,523 --> 01:32:04,424
...but as far as I'm concerned,
it's an old-fashioned brass bell.

1522
01:32:04,593 --> 01:32:08,393
And all these lovely flowered curtains
around here are red plush, for my money.

1523
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:10,361
Besides, you can't horn in on a setup...

1524
01:32:10,532 --> 01:32:12,727
...that the world thinks
is pretty good: A family.

1525
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:15,165
- My, all of that.
- All of that and a little more...

1526
01:32:15,337 --> 01:32:17,464
...but I think you get my drift.
What do you say?

1527
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:19,937
It would be intriguing,
trying to change your mind.

1528
01:32:20,109 --> 01:32:21,508
The offer still goes.

1529
01:32:21,677 --> 01:32:24,271
What's she got to deserve two such men?

1530
01:32:24,446 --> 01:32:26,607
What's she got that l...?

1531
01:32:27,483 --> 01:32:29,781
Square John, she'll be free
to marry you soon...

1532
01:32:29,952 --> 01:32:32,182
...because I'm going to marry
John McMasters.

1533
01:32:32,354 --> 01:32:34,345
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Has he told you so?

1534
01:32:34,523 --> 01:32:37,356
- Has he said he's in love with you?
- No, not in so many words...

1535
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:41,223
...but there are certain times, being
a woman, that I might believe he was.

1536
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:43,921
What's more, I'm going to get him,
because he needs me.

1537
01:32:47,903 --> 01:32:51,930
It must be awfully boring, listening to
a woman who knows what she wants.

1538
01:32:52,107 --> 01:32:54,405
Well, looks like I brought in a duster.

1539
01:32:54,576 --> 01:32:56,510
- Thanks for the drink, anyway.
- Not at all.

1540
01:32:56,678 --> 01:32:58,373
I'm going to Washington
this evening...

1541
01:32:58,547 --> 01:33:01,983
...and all this will make a very
amusing topic of conversation...

1542
01:33:02,151 --> 01:33:04,585
...in case I meet anybody on the train.

1543
01:33:04,753 --> 01:33:06,152
I wouldn't say anything to him.

1544
01:33:06,321 --> 01:33:09,848
- Well, I certainly...
- I wouldn't do that if I were you, Karen.

1545
01:33:10,926 --> 01:33:13,417
I wouldn't say a word.

1546
01:33:27,543 --> 01:33:31,445
Big John gets back to town
on Tuesday, doesn't he?

1547
01:33:31,613 --> 01:33:34,946
He should have left Washington
before that was taken.

1548
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:42,656
Hello. It's Harmony, for you.

1549
01:33:45,127 --> 01:33:46,924
Yes, Harmony?

1550
01:33:47,095 --> 01:33:48,392
What?

1551
01:33:48,564 --> 01:33:50,361
I'll be right over.

1552
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:54,067
- She gonna be all right?
- Yes, yes, I arrived in time.

1553
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:57,296
I can't imagine where she got
the prescription for a sleeping potion.

1554
01:33:57,472 --> 01:33:58,996
- Can l...?
- Certainly, Mr. Sand.

1555
01:33:59,174 --> 01:34:00,698
But not too long, please.

1556
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:10,074
Trying to get funny, huh?

1557
01:34:10,953 --> 01:34:13,581
I feel just like a Swiss tunnel.

1558
01:34:14,122 --> 01:34:17,250
Did you ever have to swallow
a stomach pump?

1559
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:21,725
Not like our Betsy.

1560
01:34:21,897 --> 01:34:24,661
You weren't thinking very much
of Little Jack, were you?

1561
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,630
Yes, the minute after I did it.

1562
01:34:26,802 --> 01:34:28,429
That's why I changed my mind.

1563
01:34:28,604 --> 01:34:31,732
It's a heck of a fuss to make
over a Dutch daffodil.

1564
01:34:33,175 --> 01:34:35,405
I've lost my pride, I guess.

1565
01:34:35,577 --> 01:34:38,273
Why not? I've lost everything else.

1566
01:34:38,447 --> 01:34:40,677
You don't know how it is
to love someone so much.

1567
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,844
When being in love like that
is stopped...

1568
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:46,954
...it's worse than your breathing
being stopped.

1569
01:34:47,122 --> 01:34:49,215
- Take it easy, honey.
- But it's true...

1570
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:50,949
...because if you stop breathing...

1571
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:54,095
...you're dead and you don't
have to feel anymore...

1572
01:34:54,263 --> 01:34:56,629
...but when they stop your love...

1573
01:34:56,798 --> 01:34:59,631
...you're alive and you keep on feeling.

1574
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:04,198
Oh, Jonathan, it's horrible
being in love like that.

1575
01:35:05,707 --> 01:35:07,732
Yeah, I guess it is.

1576
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,275
But as you say,
I wouldn't know about that.

1577
01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:16,442
Oh, I'm sorry.

1578
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:19,117
I've never been so sorry.

1579
01:35:21,957 --> 01:35:24,551
We gotta do something about
you and the moose, huh?

1580
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:28,829
No, I don't think he needs me
anymore, Jonathan.

1581
01:35:28,997 --> 01:35:31,465
You see, when we left Burkburnett...

1582
01:35:31,633 --> 01:35:35,763
...he needed me then, and all those years
working and planning.

1583
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,907
Here in New York,
he's doing it all by himself.

1584
01:35:39,074 --> 01:35:41,941
It's his world and I'm no part of it.

1585
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:45,443
But I wanna be.

1586
01:35:46,715 --> 01:35:50,412
You and him and Little Jackie,
you're all part of each other.

1587
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:53,554
I don't care if he owns
all the oil in Hades.

1588
01:35:55,223 --> 01:35:56,952
I got an idea.

1589
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,649
May be a little rough...

1590
01:35:58,827 --> 01:36:02,024
...but you just leave everything to me
and things will be all right.

1591
01:36:02,864 --> 01:36:04,297
I'll leave everything to you.

1592
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,195
But don't you peep.

1593
01:36:06,368 --> 01:36:09,166
You just go on like
nothing had happened, will you?

1594
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:12,764
Whatever you say, Jonathan.

1595
01:36:27,255 --> 01:36:29,587
- She'll be all right by tomorrow?
- Yes, I think so.

1596
01:36:29,758 --> 01:36:31,487
I don't want anybody
to know about this.

1597
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,924
No, no, Mr. Sand.
Mr. McMasters will pay my bill...

1598
01:36:34,096 --> 01:36:35,586
...and there will be no gossip.

1599
01:36:35,764 --> 01:36:39,222
Mr. McMasters won't pay your bill,
and there won't be no gossip.

1600
01:36:39,401 --> 01:36:42,700
And that 2 grand gives me the right
to break your neck if there is.

1601
01:36:42,871 --> 01:36:45,601
But... l...

1602
01:36:45,774 --> 01:36:48,072
Listen, Square John,
this ain't no good for us here.

1603
01:36:48,243 --> 01:36:50,768
We ought to go back down
to Oklahoma or Texas.

1604
01:36:50,946 --> 01:36:53,710
You're going back.
You and him and her and Little Jackie.

1605
01:36:53,882 --> 01:36:56,476
- How we gonna pry him loose?
- I'll pry him.

1606
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:59,814
I'll bring him back where she can
love him without any complications.

1607
01:36:59,988 --> 01:37:01,979
He'll suffer like a bull with his legs broke.

1608
01:37:02,157 --> 01:37:05,217
He won't have any dough left,
but he'll be back where he belongs.

1609
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,460
I called the Compton offices.
Mr. Sand's secretary says...

1610
01:37:14,636 --> 01:37:16,160
...he's in conference.
- Try again.

1611
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,171
Have a little pride, friend.
It's obvious you're being snubbed.

1612
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:22,003
- That double-crossing sump rat.
- I don't quite get it all...

1613
01:37:22,177 --> 01:37:24,771
...but there is one thing certain.
He's out to break you.

1614
01:37:24,946 --> 01:37:28,404
So he and Compton think
they can stretch me over a barrel, huh?

1615
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:31,108
Get my car hooked onto
the first train leaving for Tulsa.

1616
01:37:31,286 --> 01:37:33,083
They're hanging the wrong boy
up to dry.

1617
01:37:33,288 --> 01:37:35,654
You probably know what you're doing,
but be careful.

1618
01:37:35,824 --> 01:37:38,588
- They must have been planning this...
- This is a barroom fight.

1619
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,955
The man that hits first wins,
and that's me.

1620
01:37:41,129 --> 01:37:44,223
I'm gonna beat them to every
independent operator left in the West.

1621
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:45,798
I got a brand-new idea.

1622
01:37:45,967 --> 01:37:48,026
When I get though
telling it to those babies...

1623
01:37:48,203 --> 01:37:51,331
...they won't be able to buy
enough oil to lubricate a kiddy car.

1624
01:37:51,506 --> 01:37:52,871
Frank, it's the only thing.

1625
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:55,874
I'll maintain the price, your well
will produce twice as long...

1626
01:37:56,044 --> 01:37:57,978
...and in the end,
you'll make more dough.

1627
01:37:58,146 --> 01:38:00,444
- Sounds kind of good, all right.
- It is good.

1628
01:38:00,615 --> 01:38:01,843
Here's another reason why.

1629
01:38:02,017 --> 01:38:04,485
The joker in their setup is this:
You sign with them...

1630
01:38:04,653 --> 01:38:07,451
...they'll make you overproduce
and then drop the price on you.

1631
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:10,785
- Never thought of it that way.
- It's time you got to thinking about it.

1632
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:13,120
I tell you, if you sell
to Compton and Sand...

1633
01:38:13,295 --> 01:38:14,853
...or anyone under the old setup...

1634
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,726
...they'll have you behind the eight ball.
I'll tell you why.

1635
01:38:17,899 --> 01:38:20,424
They'll have you force-pump
your wells for quick money...

1636
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:23,571
...then you'll lose your gas pressure,
and then suddenly one day...

1637
01:38:23,738 --> 01:38:27,299
...you'll find half your oil still
underground, right down there...

1638
01:38:27,476 --> 01:38:29,774
...and no way on this man's Earth
to get it out.

1639
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:32,539
Look what happened to Burkburnett.
Whizbang. Desdemona.

1640
01:38:32,714 --> 01:38:34,011
Dead holes before their time.

1641
01:38:34,182 --> 01:38:36,582
Gentlemen, as a geologist,
I agree with Mr. McMasters.

1642
01:38:36,751 --> 01:38:39,845
- The compound ratio of substrat...
- That's high-forehead stuff.

1643
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:42,148
The main thing is, boys,
if you stick with me...

1644
01:38:42,324 --> 01:38:44,758
...l'll contract and guarantee you
the present price...

1645
01:38:44,926 --> 01:38:47,861
...and you'll make more money.
- Boys, Big John is right.

1646
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:49,519
Oh, you did?

1647
01:38:49,698 --> 01:38:51,893
But I understood you were
all set to sign with us.

1648
01:38:54,736 --> 01:38:56,897
McMasters, huh?

1649
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:03,106
Evans has signed with him.

1650
01:39:03,278 --> 01:39:06,111
That means the entire
Elk Creek crowd will follow.

1651
01:39:06,281 --> 01:39:08,146
- What's the matter with us?
- Him.

1652
01:39:08,316 --> 01:39:11,114
He's got a great line of smoosh
and he knows the oil business.

1653
01:39:11,286 --> 01:39:12,514
I'm heading for a drink.

1654
01:39:12,687 --> 01:39:15,315
I don't know why you got us into this.
I'll be ruined.

1655
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:17,424
You can always say you were
a big man once.

1656
01:39:17,592 --> 01:39:19,219
Big once? That's a bit...

1657
01:39:19,528 --> 01:39:22,463
McMasters is likely to sink us, at that,
at the rate he's going.

1658
01:39:23,598 --> 01:39:25,725
Say, he doesn't know it...

1659
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:29,268
...but maybe Uncle Sam will be
interested in what he's doing.

1660
01:39:31,106 --> 01:39:33,040
Get me Senator Grayson in Washington.

1661
01:39:35,143 --> 01:39:37,873
What? That's terrible.

1662
01:39:38,046 --> 01:39:42,005
Well, unload all my Compton-United.
I'm closing out.

1663
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:03,234
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Aldrich calling.</i>

1664
01:40:03,405 --> 01:40:05,168
Tell him I'm out of town.

1665
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,035
Tried to put me against the wall, huh?

1666
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,234
Now who's asking for a blindfold?

1667
01:40:09,411 --> 01:40:11,777
It's nice to see you so happy about it.

1668
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:14,312
Sure I'm happy. On top of the world.

1669
01:40:14,482 --> 01:40:18,179
See what happens when a simple-minded
guy falls in with a man like Compton?

1670
01:40:18,353 --> 01:40:21,618
- Turn him into a crook.
- Everything considered, it's a little odd...

1671
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:24,759
...making excuses for Mr. Sand.
- What do you mean, excuses?

1672
01:40:24,926 --> 01:40:27,224
He was a burglar,
and I licked him down to his size.

1673
01:40:27,462 --> 01:40:30,954
Pretty expensive victory, J.M.
Selling oil for half what you paid for it.

1674
01:40:31,132 --> 01:40:34,124
- Cost you about $5 million.
- We'll make that in two months.

1675
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:37,430
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Mr. John Sand to see you.

1676
01:40:37,606 --> 01:40:41,098
Sand, here? You fellas clear out.

1677
01:40:41,843 --> 01:40:44,835
- Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

1678
01:40:45,013 --> 01:40:47,504
You think this is wise?

1679
01:40:47,682 --> 01:40:49,343
I'd like to see him alone, Karen.

1680
01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:50,848
Of course.

1681
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,698
- Hi.
- Hi.

1682
01:41:08,503 --> 01:41:11,631
Well, I see you took a bath.
Anything more I can do for you?

1683
01:41:14,242 --> 01:41:15,539
Yeah.

1684
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,473
You can give your wife a divorce.

1685
01:41:18,346 --> 01:41:21,406
- What?
- You can give Betsy a divorce.

1686
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:25,519
You almost cleaned me out, but I saved
enough so we can start over again.

1687
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:27,918
Oh, yeah, and she wants the boy too.

1688
01:41:29,391 --> 01:41:30,653
Have you gone daffy?

1689
01:41:30,825 --> 01:41:34,022
That's the best way all around.
That'll leave you free to marry Karen.

1690
01:41:34,195 --> 01:41:36,720
Still poking your nose into
other people's business?

1691
01:41:36,898 --> 01:41:39,833
- Why not? She's a smart, good-looking...
- Wait a minute.

1692
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:42,128
Do you mean to say that...

1693
01:41:42,437 --> 01:41:43,927
That Betsy's in love with you?

1694
01:41:44,105 --> 01:41:46,767
Well, what do you think?
What do you think I'm doing here?

1695
01:41:46,941 --> 01:41:49,705
What do you think happens
to a woman, anyway?

1696
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:52,743
She's a little human too, you know.

1697
01:41:59,621 --> 01:42:04,251
And prettier than the day you married her.
I've noticed that even if you haven't.

1698
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:09,496
And you don't have to worry about
Little Jack, you know.

1699
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:13,395
You can drop around and see him
once in a while, if you get time.

1700
01:42:17,572 --> 01:42:20,040
- You got it all fixed, haven't you?
- Sure I have.

1701
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:23,473
Back-dooring me, that's what you're doing.
Sneaking in my back door.

1702
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:27,081
- So what?
- You're not gonna get away with it.

1703
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:30,344
You and I started a fight once
and never finished.

1704
01:42:30,518 --> 01:42:32,349
Now I'm gonna beat your brains out.

1705
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,420
Boy, am I gonna enjoy this.

1706
01:42:49,104 --> 01:42:51,129
What are you backing away for?

1707
01:42:56,611 --> 01:42:58,875
Oh, my goodness.
There must be something we can do.

1708
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:01,481
- Can't we do anything?
- Call the police.

1709
01:43:01,649 --> 01:43:03,139
Don't do that.
They might get mad.

1710
01:43:11,693 --> 01:43:14,093
Get your hand out of that birdcage.

1711
01:43:15,764 --> 01:43:20,167
What is all this? What's going on here?
Are they in conference?

1712
01:43:20,335 --> 01:43:22,496
Well, we'd better... They'll...

1713
01:43:28,943 --> 01:43:31,309
Kind of soft, ain't you, big boy?

1714
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:37,782
I'll talk to them.
I started them in business.

1715
01:43:37,952 --> 01:43:41,149
- I thought you looked like a fight promoter.
- That door's locked too.

1716
01:43:41,923 --> 01:43:44,016
Come on, come on.

1717
01:44:08,316 --> 01:44:10,045
- Take it easy.
- What are you doing?

1718
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:13,148
Come on, get out.

1719
01:44:15,223 --> 01:44:18,283
Boys, this is disgraceful.

1720
01:44:21,129 --> 01:44:23,427
Come on, get out. The bunch of you.

1721
01:44:35,677 --> 01:44:39,477
Honey, buy me a ticket for Europe
on the first boat and keep the change.

1722
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:40,909
Yes, Mr. Sand.

1723
01:44:41,082 --> 01:44:43,414
What are you laughing at?
We've lost a fortune.

1724
01:44:43,585 --> 01:44:46,349
Luther, I've just done the best
afternoon's work of my life.

1725
01:44:46,521 --> 01:44:49,684
If you hadn't pulled this, we might've
talked ourselves back with him.

1726
01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:53,294
I wouldn't go back with him if he was
the last thing in the world to eat.

1727
01:44:53,461 --> 01:44:55,622
Send the tickets over to the hotel,
will you?

1728
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,490
- I want to see Mr. McMasters.
- He's busy right now.

1729
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:02,625
So are we. I'm Stebbins, U.S. Marshal,
Federal District Attorney's office.

1730
01:45:07,408 --> 01:45:09,376
Feeling clean again?

1731
01:45:10,778 --> 01:45:14,179
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'll live.

1732
01:45:26,394 --> 01:45:31,263
A man always worries about his tie
when he's in love, doesn't he?

1733
01:45:32,534 --> 01:45:34,559
Karen, there's something
I want to tell you.

1734
01:45:34,736 --> 01:45:38,194
You don't have to. I'm a high-class
eavesdropper, partner.

1735
01:45:38,373 --> 01:45:40,773
Don't you know that's my business?

1736
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,310
You never got much out of this, did you?

1737
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:47,175
I got plenty. All I asked for...

1738
01:45:47,348 --> 01:45:48,781
...except the frosting.

1739
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,248
And I knew in my heart
I'll never get that.

1740
01:45:51,419 --> 01:45:53,751
A man told me so once.

1741
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:58,390
Yeah, you said it. You're high-class.

1742
01:45:58,793 --> 01:46:03,787
This may not be, but I'm going to do it
because I want to.

1743
01:46:08,703 --> 01:46:12,332
High-class or not,
I'm going out the back way.

1744
01:46:12,507 --> 01:46:15,101
Just to begin to see how it feels.

1745
01:46:22,183 --> 01:46:23,946
Goodbye, stranger.

1746
01:46:24,752 --> 01:46:26,117
Okay, stranger.

1747
01:46:32,827 --> 01:46:34,089
Are you John McMasters?

1748
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:37,254
- Yes, but I'm sorry, I got...
- I've got a warrant for your arrest.

1749
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:39,662
- Arrest? I don't get you.
- Federal indictment.

1750
01:46:39,834 --> 01:46:42,530
Heard of the Sherman Antitrust Law,
haven't you?

1751
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,275
I don't know what this is about,
but first I have to see my wife.

1752
01:46:48,443 --> 01:46:51,139
I don't know why not.
A wife's swell when you're in a jam.

1753
01:46:51,312 --> 01:46:53,075
That's not the idea.

1754
01:46:55,383 --> 01:46:57,317
- Daddy.
- Hiya, son.

1755
01:46:57,485 --> 01:46:58,975
How's my boy?

1756
01:46:59,153 --> 01:47:01,144
Hey, you got hurt.

1757
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:04,458
Hello, dear...

1758
01:47:05,727 --> 01:47:08,525
Look, son, you go upstairs and play,
will you?

1759
01:47:08,696 --> 01:47:11,722
- I want to talk to Mother.
- Okay.

1760
01:47:11,899 --> 01:47:14,367
- He's a great kid.
- Yeah.

1761
01:47:14,535 --> 01:47:16,264
Come in here.

1762
01:47:17,972 --> 01:47:20,702
- You're hurt. Who's that man?
- Never mind that.

1763
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,934
You're not getting away from me.
You know that?

1764
01:47:23,111 --> 01:47:25,011
- What?
- I'm not blaming you, maybe...

1765
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:28,012
...but you aren't walking
with him or anybody else. Understand?

1766
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:30,309
- Him? What do you...?
- Sand.

1767
01:47:30,485 --> 01:47:32,077
He told me all about it.

1768
01:47:32,253 --> 01:47:35,086
I had to give him a licking
to show him that's out.

1769
01:47:35,256 --> 01:47:37,315
You're my girl, see?
And you always will be.

1770
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:40,119
Even if I have to lick you to prove it.

1771
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:44,324
I'm your girl.

1772
01:47:44,499 --> 01:47:47,059
You can lick me if it'll help.

1773
01:47:47,802 --> 01:47:50,293
I'll save it for when you need it.

1774
01:48:08,022 --> 01:48:10,820
You did say that you got the money
to drill your second well...

1775
01:48:10,992 --> 01:48:12,653
...by shooting craps in a honky-tonk.

1776
01:48:12,827 --> 01:48:14,294
- Right?
- I said part of the money.

1777
01:48:14,462 --> 01:48:16,327
- How did you get the rest?
- It was a deal...

1778
01:48:16,497 --> 01:48:19,557
How did you get the money
to drill your first well? Wasn't it by...?

1779
01:48:19,734 --> 01:48:21,201
- I object...
- Naturally he objects.

1780
01:48:21,369 --> 01:48:24,065
What is the government's object
in this questioning?

1781
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:26,832
Your Honor, we are trying to prove,
and I believe we have...

1782
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,374
...that this man was a lawbreaker
from the start.

1783
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,478
That Big John McMasters,
in full knowledge...

1784
01:48:31,646 --> 01:48:34,444
...willfully conspired to break the laws
of the United States.

1785
01:48:34,615 --> 01:48:36,674
That he is typical
of the economic royalists...

1786
01:48:36,851 --> 01:48:39,411
...and bourbon industrialists who,
for self-indulgence...

1787
01:48:39,587 --> 01:48:42,488
...seek to ride over the laws
and commonplace securities...

1788
01:48:42,657 --> 01:48:44,921
...of the citizens of this country.
And for that...

1789
01:48:45,093 --> 01:48:47,687
...the people of the U.S.
Will demand for John McMasters...

1790
01:48:47,862 --> 01:48:52,299
...the maximum penalty
of 10 years in a federal penitentiary.

1791
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:56,632
For the last time,
the spectators will preserve order.

1792
01:48:56,804 --> 01:48:59,967
The statement of the government's attorney
is stricken from the record.

1793
01:49:00,141 --> 01:49:01,403
Now, Mr. McMasters...

1794
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:06,513
...is it true that for the first well, you stole
$ 7000 of tools from a Mr. Luther Aldrich?

1795
01:49:06,714 --> 01:49:10,343
- I took the tools, but he was paid for them.
- Then you did steal the tools.

1796
01:49:10,952 --> 01:49:12,817
You can call it that in your language...

1797
01:49:12,987 --> 01:49:16,218
...but I borrowed them in mine.
Borrowed like people did in those days.

1798
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:18,984
- We wanted to find oil.
- Now, Mr. McMasters...

1799
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,324
...you have admitted that you deliberately
set out to break Compton and Sand.

1800
01:49:23,498 --> 01:49:24,795
- I did.
- What was your reason?

1801
01:49:24,966 --> 01:49:27,127
They were trying to break me.

1802
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:29,394
I see. Self-protection.

1803
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:32,300
- But wasn't Mr. Compton a friend of yours?
- Not exactly.

1804
01:49:32,473 --> 01:49:36,273
- But John Sand was your very best friend.
- He was.

1805
01:49:36,477 --> 01:49:39,241
Isn't it true that Mr. Sand
started you in the oil business?

1806
01:49:39,413 --> 01:49:42,348
That it was his lease that started you
on the way to your fortune?

1807
01:49:42,517 --> 01:49:43,779
That's right.

1808
01:49:43,951 --> 01:49:47,648
Yet you expect the jury to believe that
a friend and benefactor tried to break you.

1809
01:49:47,822 --> 01:49:50,222
- He did.
- Why?

1810
01:49:51,025 --> 01:49:53,550
Why did he try to break you?

1811
01:49:54,562 --> 01:49:56,792
- I can't answer that.
- You mean can't or won't?

1812
01:49:56,964 --> 01:49:58,226
Take your pick.

1813
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:00,333
You don't understand my language?

1814
01:50:00,568 --> 01:50:04,060
That's right. Your Honor, I don't
understand this man's language at all.

1815
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:06,103
He calls me a bourbon. What's that?

1816
01:50:06,274 --> 01:50:07,866
I always thought it was whiskey.

1817
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:11,068
- Then you refuse to answer?
- That's right.

1818
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,273
- And I'm getting tired of your face, sonny.
- Sit down.

1819
01:50:14,448 --> 01:50:17,440
And if you refuse to answer,
I'll hold you in contempt of court.

1820
01:50:17,618 --> 01:50:19,950
I wouldn't want that to happen,
Your Honor.

1821
01:50:20,121 --> 01:50:23,420
I withdraw my question. That is all.

1822
01:50:24,192 --> 01:50:27,525
- I have witnesses in rebuttal, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1823
01:50:27,695 --> 01:50:30,926
- Mrs. McMasters, take the stand, please.
- Any objections?

1824
01:50:31,098 --> 01:50:33,362
We waive any objections, Your Honor.

1825
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,469
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but...

1826
01:50:36,637 --> 01:50:37,968
...so help you God?
- I do.

1827
01:50:38,139 --> 01:50:40,607
Now, Mrs. McMasters,
I won't keep you long.

1828
01:50:40,775 --> 01:50:42,504
I only want to ask you a few questions.

1829
01:50:42,677 --> 01:50:44,804
How long have you been married
to Mr. McMasters?

1830
01:50:44,979 --> 01:50:46,105
Seven and a half years.

1831
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,147
Are you acquainted with a woman
named Karen Vanmeer?

1832
01:50:49,317 --> 01:50:51,512
- Yes, I am.
- Does she work for your husband?

1833
01:50:51,686 --> 01:50:53,654
- She did.
- In what capacity?

1834
01:50:53,821 --> 01:50:57,257
- Just a minute. I'm on trial, not her.
- I object to this line of questioning.

1835
01:50:57,425 --> 01:50:58,756
- What connection...?
- I'm only...

1836
01:50:58,926 --> 01:51:00,223
Objection sustained.

1837
01:51:00,394 --> 01:51:04,728
Mr. McMasters and Miss Vanmeer went
to Washington, D.C., on May 14th last.

1838
01:51:04,899 --> 01:51:07,561
Do you know whom they visited,
and what the purpose was?

1839
01:51:07,735 --> 01:51:10,203
Whether I do or I don't,
that doesn't matter.

1840
01:51:10,371 --> 01:51:13,704
I do know that you're trying to blacken
his character by trying to prove...

1841
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:15,706
...something between
him and Miss Vanmeer.

1842
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:18,437
What I know about that
doesn't matter either.

1843
01:51:18,613 --> 01:51:21,980
I know I am, and I always will be,
in love with my husband.

1844
01:51:22,183 --> 01:51:23,980
That is all, Mrs. McMasters. Thank you.

1845
01:51:24,151 --> 01:51:27,245
Court will adjourn until 10:00
tomorrow morning.

1846
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,858
- Yeah, Mac?
- Stock's down to seven.

1847
01:51:31,025 --> 01:51:33,721
We don't have to worry about that now.
What about the notes?

1848
01:51:33,895 --> 01:51:36,193
I just left the bank.
The board took the collateral.

1849
01:51:36,364 --> 01:51:38,628
- I'm terribly sorry, J.M.
- That's okay, Mac.

1850
01:51:38,799 --> 01:51:41,893
Put a want ad in the paper.
A guy with your brains will be all right.

1851
01:51:42,069 --> 01:51:44,503
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks, J.M.

1852
01:51:45,606 --> 01:51:47,665
Well, honey, we're broke again.

1853
01:51:47,842 --> 01:51:51,676
What do we care?
We can always go back to...

1854
01:51:52,413 --> 01:51:54,847
Forget it, honey. We're not down yet.

1855
01:51:55,016 --> 01:51:57,382
- That's a lie.
- Order, order. Proceed.

1856
01:51:57,551 --> 01:51:59,212
No cross-examination, Your Honor.

1857
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:03,187
- I have one more witness, Your Honor.
- Very well. Call your witness.

1858
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,093
John Sand.

1859
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,297
Raise your right hand.

1860
01:52:14,468 --> 01:52:18,131
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but, so help you God?

1861
01:52:21,175 --> 01:52:24,611
Mr. Sand, you used to be bosom friends
with Mr. McMasters, didn't you?

1862
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:27,873
- We were pals, if that's what you mean.
- Are you pals now?

1863
01:52:28,049 --> 01:52:30,916
- No, we don't get on at all.
- Why?

1864
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:33,143
I don't know.
I just don't like him, I guess.

1865
01:52:33,321 --> 01:52:36,757
Mr. Sand, you and Mr. Compton were
competitors of Mr. McMasters, right?

1866
01:52:36,924 --> 01:52:38,186
Not for very long.

1867
01:52:38,359 --> 01:52:42,762
You were wiped out because this man,
who suddenly turned into an octopus...

1868
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:44,727
- I object.
- Sustained.

1869
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:47,129
Prosecution will confine itself
to the issues.

1870
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:50,930
You failed in your business because
Mr. McMasters formed a monopoly...

1871
01:52:51,105 --> 01:52:53,733
...in defiance of the antitrust laws.
- Your Honor, please.

1872
01:52:53,908 --> 01:52:55,773
Now, you haven't got that
straight either...

1873
01:52:55,943 --> 01:52:58,377
- Answer yes or no.
- Wait a minute, buddy. Take it easy.

1874
01:52:58,546 --> 01:53:01,777
You subpoenaed me, but after all,
I'm just here to try to straighten out...

1875
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:03,917
Mr. Witness, you're here
to answer questions.

1876
01:53:04,085 --> 01:53:07,054
Judge, I'm getting as mixed up
as anybody in this hot seat.

1877
01:53:07,221 --> 01:53:09,621
And he's all balled up,
asking a lot of questions.

1878
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:12,850
Would it be all right if I stood up
and relaxed to spiel my piece?

1879
01:53:13,027 --> 01:53:15,188
Maybe I can straighten things out
around here.

1880
01:53:15,363 --> 01:53:19,732
- I object to allowing this witness...
- The court is always interested in truth.

1881
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:22,061
I'll admit it, subject to a motion to strike.

1882
01:53:22,236 --> 01:53:24,363
Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1883
01:53:25,339 --> 01:53:28,137
Well, as I get it...

1884
01:53:28,309 --> 01:53:31,870
...McMasters is on the hook
because he broke the antitrust laws.

1885
01:53:32,046 --> 01:53:37,279
He signed up a bunch of oil operators and
formed a monopoly in restraint of trade.

1886
01:53:37,451 --> 01:53:39,681
I know that he signed them
to make more money...

1887
01:53:39,854 --> 01:53:43,756
...but he's not exactly original with that.
A lot of us have got those ideas.

1888
01:53:43,924 --> 01:53:47,826
But what he was doing,
although he didn't know it...

1889
01:53:47,995 --> 01:53:51,431
...in a way, he was working
for these here United States too.

1890
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,260
Am I out of line yet, judge?

1891
01:53:53,434 --> 01:53:54,731
Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1892
01:53:54,935 --> 01:53:57,096
He wanted these guys
to produce less oil...

1893
01:53:57,271 --> 01:54:00,707
...so that their wells would flow
years longer and not ruin the fields.

1894
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:03,173
That way they'd get all the oil
there was to get.

1895
01:54:03,344 --> 01:54:06,575
Don't you get the idea?
He was for conservation.

1896
01:54:06,747 --> 01:54:11,241
How can he be breaking laws when he's
trying to save the resources of the country?

1897
01:54:11,419 --> 01:54:14,752
He didn't know that he was doing
anything that you might call noble...

1898
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:18,949
...but being one of the best oil men there is,
he's got the right hunch about oil.

1899
01:54:19,126 --> 01:54:21,686
He knows that it took billions of years
to put it here...

1900
01:54:21,896 --> 01:54:23,830
...and if we keep taking it at this rate...

1901
01:54:23,998 --> 01:54:27,490
...before long, there won't be any oil left
in the good old U.S.A.

1902
01:54:27,668 --> 01:54:29,659
Won't be any left for him
or men like him...

1903
01:54:29,837 --> 01:54:32,397
...to break up into lube
and fuel and gasoline...

1904
01:54:32,573 --> 01:54:35,633
...so that people can get their stuff
moved around in trucks...

1905
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:39,507
...and so that you can light furnaces
and homes and schoolhouses.

1906
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:43,013
If that time comes, what'll be the good
of American schoolhouses, anyway?

1907
01:54:43,184 --> 01:54:45,015
What'll be the good
of your two oceans?

1908
01:54:45,186 --> 01:54:48,519
What are you gonna run airplanes
and battleships on? Tomato soup?

1909
01:54:48,689 --> 01:54:51,715
- I only got a couple more words, okay?
- Proceed, Mr. Sand.

1910
01:54:51,892 --> 01:54:53,826
He's got a lot of ham in him,
hasn't he?

1911
01:54:53,994 --> 01:54:55,461
Well, just this:

1912
01:54:55,629 --> 01:54:57,790
McMasters is a wildcatter.

1913
01:54:57,965 --> 01:55:01,366
If it wasn't for automobiles,
he'd be driving a covered wagon.

1914
01:55:01,669 --> 01:55:05,264
It's always been his breed
that has opened up the country...

1915
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:06,906
...and made it what it is.

1916
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:09,099
So now I'm wondering...

1917
01:55:09,276 --> 01:55:13,076
...is it out of line, in these United States,
for a man like him to make a million...

1918
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:14,646
...with his brains and hands?

1919
01:55:14,815 --> 01:55:17,978
If that's true, we'd better rewrite this
land-of-opportunity stuff.

1920
01:55:18,152 --> 01:55:20,746
I admit that he's ornery
and he's mean...

1921
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:24,413
...but he's an oil man with the right idea
of what to do with our oil.

1922
01:55:24,592 --> 01:55:28,289
And he's always met the payroll,
and you can put his word in the bank.

1923
01:55:28,796 --> 01:55:31,390
Now, that's all I got to say.
Now you talk.

1924
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,397
- I move to strike this entire answer.
- Motion denied.

1925
01:55:34,568 --> 01:55:36,695
Court adjourned until tomorrow.

1926
01:55:37,872 --> 01:55:39,840
We may beat this yet.

1927
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:44,534
Hey.

1928
01:55:45,613 --> 01:55:48,275
- Hi.
- Hi.

1929
01:55:48,782 --> 01:55:50,079
That was quite a speech.

1930
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:53,220
Well, I got kind of wound up, I guess.

1931
01:55:53,387 --> 01:55:55,981
Say, I was thinking, if I beat this...

1932
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:58,819
...I got a section of wildcat stuff
left out in California.

1933
01:55:58,993 --> 01:56:00,756
I don't know much about it...

1934
01:56:00,928 --> 01:56:03,396
...but how'd you like
to take a whirl at it with me?

1935
01:56:03,764 --> 01:56:07,063
No, no, I guess not.
I'm through with the oil game for good.

1936
01:56:07,234 --> 01:56:09,327
It's too tough.
Well, I'll be seeing you.

1937
01:56:09,503 --> 01:56:10,993
Yeah.

1938
01:56:28,923 --> 01:56:31,391
Welcome to McMasters' camp.
Come in here.

1939
01:56:31,559 --> 01:56:34,426
I'm sure glad to see you, Miss Betsy.
Yes, sir.

1940
01:56:34,595 --> 01:56:37,155
- Hi, old boy.
- Hi, big feller.

1941
01:56:37,331 --> 01:56:40,494
Well, here it is, honey.
This'll be where we're gonna live for...

1942
01:56:40,668 --> 01:56:44,434
- Well, for a while, anyway.
- It's beautiful here, darling. I love it.

1943
01:56:44,605 --> 01:56:47,335
Luther, you're crazy to sell this.
This is great stuff.

1944
01:56:47,508 --> 01:56:49,373
There's Jonathan.

1945
01:56:50,277 --> 01:56:52,142
I'm gonna spud in right...

1946
01:56:52,313 --> 01:56:53,905
Jonathan.

1947
01:56:54,081 --> 01:56:56,049
- Well, my goodness.
- Hello.

1948
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,274
Fancy meeting you here.

1949
01:56:57,451 --> 01:57:00,420
- Hello, Uncle Square John.
- Hello, sport. How are you?

1950
01:57:00,588 --> 01:57:02,146
- Shorty.
- What are you doing here?

1951
01:57:02,323 --> 01:57:04,621
This is the half-section
I talked about in New York.

1952
01:57:04,792 --> 01:57:06,419
You told me you had a whole sec...

1953
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:11,965
Now I see why you sold me
this half for $ 100. It's a handout, huh?

1954
01:57:12,132 --> 01:57:16,466
Listen, Shorty, I though we could put down
one test well and prove both properties.

1955
01:57:16,637 --> 01:57:18,366
What do you say?

1956
01:57:20,107 --> 01:57:22,166
Where do you figure on drilling?

1957
01:57:22,643 --> 01:57:25,203
Well, I figure the main structure
is up here.

1958
01:57:25,379 --> 01:57:27,643
Oh, no, down by the hollow
is the main structure.

1959
01:57:27,815 --> 01:57:30,340
- I've been all over this...
- So what? If you don't know...

1960
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:33,179
Come and get it. Rabbit à la modee.

1961
01:57:33,787 --> 01:57:36,187
Rabbit à la modee, Shorty.

1962
01:57:37,157 --> 01:57:40,456
We might as well get this straight.
I'll give the pipe and equipment...

1963
01:57:40,628 --> 01:57:42,061
...but I want cash in 90 days.

1964
01:57:42,229 --> 01:57:45,062
Shorty, how about giving Luther
an eighth interest instead?

1965
01:57:45,232 --> 01:57:48,895
Oh, no, you fellas go broke
on your own this time.

1966
01:57:49,069 --> 01:57:51,299
There's a dry hole
in every foot of this stuff.

1967
01:57:51,472 --> 01:57:53,440
What's the name
of this sucker's paradise?

1968
01:57:53,607 --> 01:57:56,701
- Came from some guy named Kettleman.
- They call it Kettleman Hills.

1969
01:57:56,877 --> 01:58:00,074
Kettleman Hills?
Doesn't even sound like oil.

1970
01:58:39,853 --> 01:58:41,844
