15
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,930

24
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:57,391
Fifteen lynx, eight wolves, one ...

27
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:22,847

Go ahead.

30
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,523
Jail bait Evie, from the east.

31
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,712
Their husbands tbe have bailed them out,

32
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:47,433
they payed their fines and their passages
with a guarantee of marriage.

33
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,632
They are waiting for the preacher now.
Be glad you're not one of them.

34
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,120
- So this is it.
- Yes, and none the worse for wear.

35
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,098
The end of my peace and quiet
at home.

36
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,178
Come, and have a drink.

37
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,708
It's for the traders daughter.

38
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:41,040
The darn things costs a fortune.

39
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,335
- And my daughter can't play a note.
- Drink up, friend, forget your worries.

40
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,897
Well, Eve.

41
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,686
Evie, and how's is my little
silent beauty, eh?

42
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,016
Ah, you've grown a
women over the winter.

43
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,399
A fine young woman.

44
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,578
- I expect my wife sent sent her down for the mail.
- Aye, and mail she shall have.

45
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,619
Well, there you are.

46
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,983
Oh, there's nothing for you my child.

47
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:17,516
Maybe one next year.

48
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,029
You thing she'll ever speak?

49
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:25,565
Guess not.

50
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:29,596
- Damn murdering Blackfoots.
- Across the border, wasn't it?

51
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:33,243
Montana, ten years ago this coming Christmas eve,

52
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:37,662
The whole lot were trussed-up and
burning like roast pigs.

53
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,031
Children as well.

54
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,887
and her mother..nailed to a wall..dying

55
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,541
Ane Evie, hidden under a bench
saw everything

56
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,584
No wonder she was struck dumb.

57
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:54,350
Gather round friends,
come along, come along.

58
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,175
All right now, gather round.

59
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,947
Brides are ready to be claimed
by their prospective husbands.

60
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:10,300
Then we proceed
directly to the church.

61
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,030
Now this is ...

62
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:16,017
Abigail Sonders, widow,

63
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,450

65
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,608
Found guilty of immoral earnings

66
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:28,740
in  City of Baltimore, on the
10th May,, last year.

67
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:31,789
Bound over in March to Joshua Turnbull,

68
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,040

69
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,451
and subsequent marriage,

70
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,094
You mark here, ..Mr. Turnbull.

71
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,116
La Bete..he come!

72
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:18,536
Jean La Bete!

73
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,334
Jean!

74
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:24,335
Hey, Jean La Bete!

75
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:28,294
Hey Jean! Jean La Bete!

76
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,039
I must go.

77
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:39,284
What's the matter?

78
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,939
There are more furs to come in, and
the clerk's alone.

79
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:43,410
Hey, wait, wait!

80
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,443
Hey, there's half bottle left!

81
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:04,953
Jean?

82
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,336
Hey, you old devil you!

83
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,048
- Baptiste.
- Where you been?

84
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,947
Some indians told me you were dead

85
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,014
they said that old Adam had got you.

86
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:21,446
two winters now.

87
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:22,867
Old Adam bear?

88
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:28,224
It take more than some old grizzly bear
to finish Jean La Bete.

89
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,115
But he's smart, my friend

90
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:32,588
smart like a fox.

91
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,640
But it take a fox
to catch a fox. Hey!

92
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,208
Arctic foxes.

93
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,426
Some whites, by gosh ...

94
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:46,039
white ... like snow.

95
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,929
... one guarantee shipment to Vancouver
and subsequent marriage

96
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,176
La Bete,

97
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,716
you told me he was dead,

98
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,185
last year and the year before.
I paid you gold to tell me.

99
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:05,879
"Yellow Dog" and "No Name"
never say him dead..

100
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,935
only say him gone
...from old camp.

101
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,435
You damn liar!

102
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,628
Come on, the thread's over there.

103
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:24,285
What color?

104
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,159
Blue.

105
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:28,855
It's on the top shelf.

106
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:46,103
What's it worth?

107
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,164
Haven't you got any work to do?

108
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:19,162
Quiet, quiet everybody, quiet, please
quiet now listen attentively.

109
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:22,793
The man who bought this woman
died before she got here,

110
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:27,106
She is already paid for, so
highest bidder takes her.

111
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:30,963
Now she's not young, but she's sound of limb
and can do a hard days work.

112
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,121
She's got a child with her..
..who wants that?

113
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:36,200
Makes her even more desirable
shows she ain't barren.

114
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:42,121
Now I'll need an opening bid to get things started,
will someone make me an opening bid?

115
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,928

126
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:22,657
Will anybody pay $100
for this good woman?

127
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:27,561
One hundred.. will somebody pay $100
for this fine, mature woman?

128
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:30,875
75 it is then, to this good man

129
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,216
Going, going, gone.

130
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:37,531
- One hundred dollars.
- Oh, you're too late.

131
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:40,110
For $100 she's mine.

132
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,832
The bidding's closed
she's sold to this man.

133
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:46,580
My money is as good
as his....better

134
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:51,161
Eh, eh, eh, Get your hands off!

135
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:56,085
Hold it, hold it.

136
00:13:56,674 --> 00:14:01,193
That's enough trapper!
The bidding is over!

137
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:05,332
- Then bring me another one captain.
- You'll have to wait till next year...

138
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,847
...if you have the money.

139
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,804
Seven hundred and fifty american dollars
in advance.

140
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,375
Seven hundred?

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,593
Two hundred and fifty to release her from
prison, five hundred for her passage.

Then make her a young one Captain,a young
strong one who can work hard...

143
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,260
And make plenty of good children.

I will pay you tomorrow.

145

All right now, calm down everyone, calm down ...!

146
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,841
Run on home child, this is no place for you.

147
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,440
The trader, where is it?

148
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:43,835
It's in his office, but he's busy.

161
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:36,896
..it is cold,like the end of the earth, huh, Baptiste?
- Ah, oui.

162
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:38,666
Yes.

163
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,022
These should sell high in San Francisco.
- Aha, with the rest of the money you've saved for me.

164
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,109
I'll be rich man, ah,

165
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,629
rich, almost like you.

166
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,875
I'll have money to buy new rifle.

167
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,331
enough money to buy myself a woman too...

168
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:51,822
..eh, Baptiste?

169
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,390
Rifle good.

170
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,281
Rifle..

171
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:29,820
..rifle good.

172
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:33,749
She's a man's best friend,
better than a woman almost.

173
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:35,210
Next year ...

174
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,490
..maybe I have a woman too, aahh!

175
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:42,085
The captain's ...woman...cost a lot of money.

176
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:44,937
I ..have.. money ...

177
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,365
-  you goy money..yes?
- Yes, me.

178
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,933
Jean La Bete ..I got money.

179
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,257
After paying for the trap..

180
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:56,056
and for the rifle, maybe money for...
....two women!

181
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,936
or maybe one woman ...

182
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:05,259
You don't believe me?

183
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:07,886
No!

184
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,247
Listen to me...

185
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:20,178
when Jean La Bete
say he has money..

186
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,287
..he has money.

187
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,457
I'll never be able to
play this thing, never.

188
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,586
All right Sarah, you may read
for us now.

189
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:30,849
Yes, mother.

190
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,564
We must find someone to
give you lessons.

191
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:37,471
Perhaps the Captain can bring a teacher back
with him on his next trip.

192
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:48,021
Though I speak with the tongues of
men and of angels..

193
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,442
and have not charity

194
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:52,168
I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

195
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,264
And though I have the gift of prophecy ...

196
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:56,838
Who is there?

197
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:04,606
Hey my friend, I was looking for you.

198
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:06,824
I want my money.

199
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:11,342
How dare you come bursting
in here like this?

200
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:13,733
My God ...

201
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:17,566
I wished I had a woman like you.

202
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:44,869
Next year ...

203
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,855
next year, whenI have
a woman like you ...

204
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:49,623
..maybe I buy one of
these too,um?

205
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,364
Sarah, go upstairs at once.

206
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,530
Maybe I buy you, um?

207
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:01,771
and you bring it with you.

208
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,409
Now who are you? What do you want?

209
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,127
My money.

210
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:16,383
- I come to get it.
- But you don't need it tonight.

211
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:17,876
That kanuk Baptiste ....

212
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:19,267
..he call me a liar.

213
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,509
We will see, huh?

214
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:23,510
What money? What does he mean?

215
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:26,008
- I can tell him that you have it, it's the same thing.
- No.

216
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:29,344
Oh no, kanuk like Baptiste
beleive only with their eyes.

217
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:32,826
Oh, is drunk, give him what
he wants and get rid of him.

218
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:48,071
- What are you doing? That's ours.
- I know what I'm doing.

219
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,359
- But that's for our passage to San Francisco.
- That's next year.

220
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:54,917
- $ 1000, and that includes today's furs.
- But you can't do this!

221
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,850
Now that kanuk can
eat his words, no?

222
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,069
Hum?

223
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,700
He will see that I have enough money
to buy a woman.

224
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,137
You're a good friend.

225
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:22,686
Eh.

226
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:35,698
No!

227
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:44,997
Little rabbit!

228
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:01,283
Get back to the kitchen!

229
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,979
You must have something to say for yourself.

230
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,389
The money was his, I had to
give it back to him.

231
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,744
He left it with me for safe keeping.

232
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,568
I was told that he was dead.

233
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,306
But you've given him gold
from our own savings!

234
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:24,402
- You have to make it up first thing tomorrow morning!
- I can't make it up!

235
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,831
What do you mean...you can't make it up?

236
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,104
I mean all the money
we have is there!

237
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:31,700
What are you talking about? There is money
at the trading post.

238
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,579
- The safe is empty!
- Empty!

239
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:37,925
- But you'll be paid for your furs tomorrow!
- Yes, with money I owe already!

240
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,145
But you can borrow, you can get credit!

241
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,314
Credit, I have no more
credit, understand, none!

242
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,457
Our only chance to get out of here
and you've given it away.

243
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:49,062
To a filthy trapper
- The money was his!

244
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,250
To an animal!

245
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:52,250
A wild animal!

246
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:55,352
I may be many things,
But I am not a thief!

247
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:59,381
And what about Sarah? How is she
ever goint to find a decent husband now?

248
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,636
There are men here as good
as any of the men in San Francisco!

249
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:05,185
Here ... Go!

250
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:08,019
- Well, sell that damn thing!
- Never!

251
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,708
We have the right to nice things!

252
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,859
We have a right to something.

253
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:53,792
Wait here.

254
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:26,528
The water is cold.

255
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,728
Last night you said you wanted a woman.

256
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:34,831
If you wait for the Captain to bring you one
it'll take a year, you know that, don't you?

257
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,736
I can get one today ...

258
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,928
- A thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars?

259
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,475
She's never been to prison.

260
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,917
She is not the kind of trash
the Captain brings up here.

261
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:55,215
And she's never known another maaan ...

262
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:58,383
You can have her if you take her away now.

263
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,259
Alright, child.

264
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,457
Her parents were killed
in an indian raid ten years ago.

265
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:28,094
My husband found her and brought
her home to live with us.

266
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:30,565
What's your name, little rabbit?

267
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:35,448
Speak to me ...

268
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,294
- I'm talking to you!
- She can't speak,

269
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:40,008
shock,

270
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:44,084
but she's a good strong girl,
she cooks well and she sews too.

271
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:45,652
Her name is Eve.

272
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:49,064
A thousand dollars for a woman
who can't talk?

273
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:51,028
That's a lotta money.

274
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,962
- Better than a woman who talks too much.
- Huh?

275
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:01,773
Here, take.

276
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,872
Stay!

277
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:06,114
"When I'm a man
I'll take me a wife;

278
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:11,392
"We will live in a house
on the hill, the hill; "

279
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:14,006
Hey woman

280
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,338
My mother taught me that song.

281
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,251
My mother ...

282
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:25,837
"With carriage and horses, all
white, all white;

283
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,355
"And she will have diamond
and pearls, and pearls;

284
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:35,355
"And she will have diamond and pearls."

285
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:55,820
Go get wood,

286
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:57,705
build fire over there.

287
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:12,972
Hey, rabbit!

288
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,250
Where are you going little rabbit, huh?

289
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,807
In the forest at night ...

290
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,522
keep close to fire ...

291
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,707
saver from wolf, bear ...

292
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:28,484
..wildcat.

293
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,736
woman ...

294
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,622
Why you not eat?

295
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,749
Indians say bear meat
good for women,

296
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,842
help make good children.

297
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,206
Here,

298
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:28,492
Eat!

299
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,254
Tomorrow ...

300
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,881
tomorrow you pay  ...

301
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,637
You'll pay!

302
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,752
Pull it up!!

303
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:53,852
Pull !

304
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,040
Here, work make you warm.

305
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:05,155
Move woman!

306
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:07,472
Faster!

307
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:17,580
Go!

308
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,390
Stand still.

309
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:51,373
Don't worry;..

310
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,324
.. black bear not dangerous,

311
00:33:58,153 --> 00:33:59,732
unless with cub.

312
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:12,434
Take these inside, make fire.

313
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,241
Woman,

314
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:23,597
here, chop wood,

315
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,309
I get some meat.

316
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,562
Put the roof on here, to
keep the snow out

317
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,732
the bait here

318
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,139
on a nail in the hole in the tree.

319
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,757
The martin run up the pole across the trap
to get the meat ...

320
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:05,629
...he's caught.

321
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:22,277
This got poor smell

322
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:24,371
but eyes like a hawk.

323
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,814
here,

324
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:29,696
when he sees the wing flapping, he's wondering
what's happend, so he come across..

325
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:33,208
..he sees fat old bird and
smell here the old perfume..

326
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,040
..made from rotten dead fish,

327
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:38,263
then, wanting dinner..

328
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,925
..step over these sticks here..
You see that cross?

329
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:44,352
..he's put his foot actoss the top.

330
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,598
Little rabbit.

331
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:53,340
You come here every day,

332
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,307
always uses the same path,
like sheep...

333
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,096
..so wolf come here too..

334
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,419
..looking for sheep who is
sick or hurt maybe...

335
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:05,478
Fat here..

336
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,168
..then the blade..

337
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:09,442
..put the blade in the fat.

338
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,484
When the wolf bite the fat
he cut his tongue so he howl ...

339
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:16,472
loud, then the other wolfs
hear him so they come quick,

340
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:19,534
then they smell the blood,
tear him to pieces..

341
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,923
..then  each other.

342
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:25,388
Sometime maybe one lump of fat
will kill five wolf,that's good for me.

343
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,793
don't have to kill so many.

344
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,978
Damn bear Adam, see, trap sprung.

345
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,433
Bait half gone.

346
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:52,681
Now he is in some cave somewhere
laughing at us.

347
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,990
Jean La Bete still smarter than him though.

348
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:04,438
First, more bait

349
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,996
Up there in the tree, not on the ground
where fox and wolf can steal 'em first.

350
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:09,749
Here.

351
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:11,411
Here!

352
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,186
Tie 'em on tight.

353
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,694
Come on women, by the time you finish

354
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:29,008
old Adam be down here eat the bait,
trap, fox, you and me.

355
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,435
Soon I teach you everything
about trapping,

356
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:39,782
then you won't need
Jean Le Bete no more, umm.

357
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:44,371
I will make surprise
for old Adam bear.

358
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:46,721
Put all these small trap,

359
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,627
..around the big one here, see?

360
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:50,925
then the old bear come down the path,

361
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:53,950
put his foot in the  small trap..
bang..he's caught.

362
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:56,801
so he does a dance, around here
to get his toe loose..

363
00:41:57,027 --> 00:42:00,024
..but he forget the big one
take a step back ....boom.

364
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,129
This winter that damn old bear will
find out who run the forest.

365
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,030
Woman.

366
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:18,382
Woman come here!

367
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:23,429
What's the matter?

368
00:42:28,604 --> 00:42:31,969
Well then, damn you woman, stay here
for cougar, bear or wolf to eat.

369
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:46,746
Here take this.

370
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,897
Go home now.

371
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:50,988
Follow mark on trees.

372
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:53,588
If wolf follow, fire gun.

373
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,947
Hurry now, before the
dark come..

374
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:58,490
Soon we have big snow!

375
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:14,316
Women make good home.

376
00:45:14,568 --> 00:45:16,019
trapper no good.

377
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:18,116
You come with "Yellow Dog."

378
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:25,120
Indian better, make more children
than white man.

379
00:46:58,624 --> 00:46:59,629
Indian !

380
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:08,360
I seen big house once, in San
Francisco, with a thousand lights, hanging like ...

381
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:12,450
one big bunch of grapes
in a branch on the ceiling.

382
00:49:13,044 --> 00:49:16,216
The man who ... owned
this house smoked cigars.

383
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:21,286
Had..diamond here in shirt front
like button.

384
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:23,601
What do you think a that, huh?
Diamond here!

385
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:25,299
This man was ...

386
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,563
was a friend of my father.

387
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:28,160
Well ...

388
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:30,512
My father knew him once back in Québec

389
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:32,382
The man who wore that diamond.

390
00:49:33,435 --> 00:49:34,712
That's where we come from..

391
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:36,786
..Québec.

392
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:38,756
After my mother died,

393
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:42,798
I was ... I was this big.

394
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:46,581
There was no work so my
father went trapping.

395
00:49:47,523 --> 00:49:48,693
One day ...

396
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:50,961
He went out to trap line..

397
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:54,717
..and don't come back.

398
00:49:56,528 --> 00:49:59,036
I got cold and  hungry waiting for him.

399
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,092
After a week..

400
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:03,917
...some Indian come by..

401
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:05,348
..take me away.

402
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,510
They taught me everything I teach you.

403
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,897
One old squaw used to take
me in her bed each night.

404
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:18,647
She smelled bad here from bear grease
that ole squaw.

405
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,167
..but she keep me warm.

406
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:02,470
Here,

407
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:04,876
one little sip make you feel happy.

408
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:19,833
see,

409
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:21,333
from Quebec

410
00:51:23,087 --> 00:51:24,499
Every year my mother ...

411
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:26,625
used to make Christmas tree.

412
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,843
One year I found this hanging from branch.

413
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,471
After  Christmas dinner ...

414
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:50,519
everyone would dance,

415
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,504
my father ...

416
00:51:53,262 --> 00:51:54,988
my mother ...me ...

417
00:51:56,506 --> 00:51:59,535
..everyone ... like this..

418
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:31,476
Now. .. you dance?

419
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,635
Now what?

420
00:53:17,546 --> 00:53:20,246
You don't like to laugh and dance?

421
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:29,658
Damn you...put that down,
What sort of a woman are you?

422
00:53:31,102 --> 00:53:33,194
Or maybe you're not a woman!

423
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:35,997
Maybe Jean La Bete paid
thousand dollars for nothing.

424
00:53:37,932 --> 00:53:38,939
Maybe ...

425
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,930
Maybe he bought a
cold stick of wood, huh?

426
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,001
This!

427
00:53:45,445 --> 00:53:48,415
What is this, if a woman is
a cold stick of wood? Huh?

428
00:53:49,955 --> 00:53:51,065
Tell me that.

429
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,212
And this?

430
00:53:56,841 --> 00:53:58,272
What is this table ...?

431
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:00,462
for only two people..Huh?

432
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,393
What use is woman ...!?

433
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:07,072
When she is not a woman! Huh?

434
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:09,815
When she don't keep man's bed
warm at night!

435
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:12,088
When she don't laugh with him at night,

436
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,294
And make children !

437
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:14,458
Tell me that !

438
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:18,189
Why you looking at me like that ...?

439
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,466
With eyes like trapped rabbit .

440
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,276
Every night the same thing

441
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,513
Why do you stare ...?

442
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,773
I should let breed have you.

443
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:41,613
They don't take no
from a woman!

444
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,998
Stubborn bear Adam.

445
00:57:22,986 --> 00:57:23,999
The snow stop.

446
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:27,224
Why don't you come out for food, eh?

447
00:57:28,203 --> 00:57:30,512
Pheasant, crow, blue jay ...

448
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,956
have full bellies, not you.

449
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:56,129
Get out!

450
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:43,536
Load it !!

451
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,176
Rum!

452
01:06:57,688 --> 01:06:58,920
The leg is broken.

453
01:08:08,444 --> 01:08:09,514
Get skin ...

454
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,404
rabbit.

455
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:26,448
Here, here.

456
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:37,756
Wrap em round.

457
01:08:53,773 --> 01:08:56,235
Tomorrow ... you must get help.

458
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,203
There are indian two day away.

459
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:04,873
Their medicine man ...
..he know how to mend ...

460
01:09:05,798 --> 01:09:08,374
.... mend bone

461
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:15,204
Woman!

462
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:32,487
Where ...

463
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:11,173
Who cares ...?

464
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,518
The muj ... ...

465
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:15,077
The woman ...

466
01:15:17,028 --> 01:15:18,134
Who ... who cares ...

467
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,392
You ...

468
01:15:21,547 --> 01:15:22,548
You ...

469
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,609

470
01:15:26,494 --> 01:15:28,491
Ponme ... here ...

471
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:47,603
Where are the Indians?

472
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:53,823
Did you find their village?

473
01:15:58,315 --> 01:16:00,321
And no one was there.

474
01:16:03,737 --> 01:16:06,038
The leg ...is poisoned.

475
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,907
When the poison reaches here ...

476
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,349
We must chop the leg off.

477
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:29,214
You are afraid.

478
01:16:32,582 --> 01:16:34,586
I also am afraid.

479
01:16:36,228 --> 01:16:38,948
But I would rather live than die, little woman.

480
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:43,186
Now, get more rabbit skin..

481
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:45,166
and some ...

482
01:16:48,273 --> 01:16:50,714
Hurry up woman!...you want me to die?

483
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,822
Go ..

484
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,850
Go ..

485
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:02,103
Bring rum.

486
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:29,058
That is all..

487
01:17:33,688 --> 01:17:34,784
No matter,

488
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,842
it is enough.

489
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,388
Anyway ...

490
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:44,494
After this you won't have to worry
bout Jean LaBete gettin drunk no more

491
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:58,779
You must cut here

492
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:00,756
below the knee.

493
01:18:03,491 --> 01:18:04,781
When you finish..

494
01:18:06,483 --> 01:18:09,234
get hot coal from
fire and burn wound,

495
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:13,448
then wrap 'em tied
in rabbit skin.

496
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:17,117
You must do this alone.

497
01:18:20,064 --> 01:18:21,202
Get ax.

498
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,822
Hurry women,

499
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:27,648
You want me chop leg by myself?

500
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,704
Go ..

501
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,735
go ... Go!

502
01:19:02,711 --> 01:19:03,862
bring me the stool,

503
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:06,559
put it there.

504
01:19:14,676 --> 01:19:18,584
A man with one leg
should look good in San Francisco.

505
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:23,718
Eve,

506
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:26,158
help me.

507
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:40,338
Here,

508
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:43,614
here.

509
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:52,871
Now ...

510
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,420
Eve, now.

511
01:19:58,676 --> 01:19:59,676
Now.

512
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:03,062
Yes ..

513
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:06,817
For the love of God ... Now!

514
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:30,189
Woman!

515
01:22:44,921 --> 01:22:46,181
Have you wrap...

516
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,161
.. wrapped the leg yet?

517
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:53,779
There ...

518
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:56,173
food there

519
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:59,239
meat.

520
01:23:02,513 --> 01:23:04,672
Damn you woman ...

521
01:23:05,703 --> 01:23:07,500
You let the fire go out ...

522
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,685
Tomorrow ...

523
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:15,566
I teach you to. ..

524
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,671
to hunt ...

525
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:20,268
for ...

526
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,052
for..f..food.

527
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:08,426
"When I'm a man
I'll take me a wife;

528
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,694
"We will live in a house
on the hill, the hill; "

529
01:24:14,707 --> 01:24:19,021
"With a carriage and horses, all
white, all white;

530
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,328
"And she will have diamond ..."

531
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:24,017
..and pearls, "

532
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:28,929
"And she will have diamond and pearls."

533
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:49,866
Seven?

534
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,047
Good.

535
01:24:51,397 --> 01:24:53,320
Tomorrow you can get the ones
from the other valley.

536
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,115
These geese are smart.

537
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:01,554
Smarter than us I think.

538
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:04,844
They only come here when
the snow is gone.

539
01:25:06,471 --> 01:25:07,497
And last winter ...

540
01:25:09,297 --> 01:25:10,799
last winter was very long.

541
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:36,391
Eve.

542
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:39,872
Come here.

543
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:45,773
Please.

544
01:25:54,064 --> 01:25:55,065
Eve.

545
01:25:58,578 --> 01:25:59,816
You never talk ...

546
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,697
Jean La Bete sometimes forgets
that you have a name.

547
01:26:11,217 --> 01:26:12,219
Eve,

548
01:26:14,576 --> 01:26:16,015
is a good name too.

549
01:26:19,589 --> 01:26:21,231
If it were not for Eve ...

550
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,638
Then Jean La Bete would be dead.

551
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:31,018
When there was nothing but pain..

552
01:26:32,838 --> 01:26:34,477
..she was there to comfort him.

553
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:38,319
And when ...

554
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:40,585
when the cold snow come and ..

555
01:26:41,546 --> 01:26:42,959
and the cabin froze,

556
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,427
...then she was there
to keep him warm.

557
01:26:50,263 --> 01:26:51,500
and to feed him.

558
01:26:54,964 --> 01:26:55,966
Eve ...

559
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:03,518
Eve ...

560
01:27:06,057 --> 01:27:08,907
Jean La Bete and could not live without you.

561
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:13,431
Eve ...

562
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:08,705
Eve ...

563
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:13,434
Eve, What's wrong?

564
01:28:16,113 --> 01:28:17,113
¡Eve!

565
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:20,103
Eve ...

566
01:28:20,721 --> 01:28:21,803
What's the matter?

567
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,720
Woman!

568
01:28:27,461 --> 01:28:28,543
Woman, listen!

569
01:28:29,915 --> 01:28:32,671
I am not some Indian who
tried to take your mother!

570
01:28:34,756 --> 01:28:35,758
Eve ...

571
01:28:40,813 --> 01:28:41,815
¡Eve!

572
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:51,112
Please ...

573
01:28:52,212 --> 01:28:53,211
Eve.

574
01:28:55,133 --> 01:28:56,135
No, Eve!

575
01:28:56,386 --> 01:28:57,384
¡Eve!

576
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:01,454
¡Eve! Where are you going?

577
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:03,848
¡Eve, come back!

578
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:06,442
¡Eve!

579
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:08,539
Alright then!

580
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:11,004
Jean La Bete will find another woman!

581
01:29:11,005 --> 01:29:15,265
Someone who won't make him feel
ashamed beacuse he wants to be married!

582
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:18,290
Eve.

583
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:22,212
Eve ... ¡!

584
01:32:18,543 --> 01:32:21,533
When we got her home she lay abed
other two months,

585
01:32:21,558 --> 01:32:22,790
still as death.

586
01:32:23,178 --> 01:32:23,990
It was like ...

587
01:32:23,992 --> 01:32:25,675
something in her heart had gone dead.

588
01:32:26,685 --> 01:32:28,360
Something we couldn't touch.

589
01:32:29,235 --> 01:32:31,414
And she lost the child she was carrying.

590
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:33,569
We nearly lost her
her, too.

591
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,158
I never thought we'd see her wed.

592
01:32:36,269 --> 01:32:37,721
Ah, poor child.

593
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:40,487
The wife's making
her wedding dress.

594
01:32:41,003 --> 01:32:42,560
The least she can do, I guess.

595
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:05,010
Eve.

596
01:33:07,811 --> 01:33:09,044
Still can't believe it.

597
01:33:09,822 --> 01:33:10,871
this time tomorrow..

598
01:33:10,936 --> 01:33:13,192
we will be starting a
whole new life together,

599
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:14,386
you and me,

600
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:15,660
and one day,

601
01:33:15,994 --> 01:33:17,260
one day you just watch,

602
01:33:17,465 --> 01:33:19,896
we'll have a big white house on Knob Hill,

603
01:33:20,249 --> 01:33:22,421
with a chandelier to hang in every
room.

604
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:24,863
We will,

605
01:33:25,551 --> 01:33:26,549
you'll see.

606
01:33:34,172 --> 01:33:35,400
I love you Evie.

607
01:34:25,373 --> 01:34:26,373
Evie.

608
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:29,208
Have you ever really shot it, ?

609
01:34:29,311 --> 01:34:32,267
I mean really at bear or
something like that ?

610
01:34:32,853 --> 01:34:34,368
I bet you have.

611
01:34:34,425 --> 01:34:37,671
And I bet you lived in a
real log cabin too, didn't you?

612
01:34:37,676 --> 01:34:41,507
Just you and him, all alone
in the middle of the forest.

613
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,170
That must be how you lived.

614
01:34:43,187 --> 01:34:46,847
And it must have been terribly cold too.
I bet it was, wasn't it?

615
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:50,161
What on earth did you eat?
I mean you can't eat raw meat all the time.

616
01:34:50,162 --> 01:34:50,836
That's enough.

617
01:34:50,837 --> 01:34:53,919
But suppose he comes right in
the middle of the preacher marring them.

618
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,860
He won't be comming.

619
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:57,378
- Is he really dead, Evie, is he?
- I said that's enough.

620
01:34:57,379 --> 01:34:59,758
Perhaps she killed him herself
You did Evie?

621
01:34:59,759 --> 01:35:03,250
Please let us know, I mean nobody
would blame you, not for killing him.

622
01:35:03,251 --> 01:35:04,285
Sarah, enough!

623
01:35:04,286 --> 01:35:05,493
But I want to know!

624
01:35:05,494 --> 01:35:07,650
Did you kill him, Evie?
Please let us know!

625
01:35:07,651 --> 01:35:09,490
Did you, did you,
did you, did you?

626
01:35:09,491 --> 01:35:10,594
Will you be quiet?

627
01:35:16,092 --> 01:35:17,094
All right.

628
01:35:24,033 --> 01:35:26,292
My husband will come and fetch you
in a few minutes.

629
01:35:48,428 --> 01:35:49,638
Is she allright?

630
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,706
All right?

631
01:35:50,707 --> 01:35:52,997
Well, you know how women are
getting married and all ..they..

632
01:35:52,998 --> 01:35:54,616
She didn't tell me.

633
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:02,804
- Is she ready?
- Yes

634
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:06,431
Good, well, come along then..ladies

635
01:36:17,878 --> 01:36:19,854
Eve, they'er waiting for us.

636
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Evie.

637
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:35,584
Eve!

638
01:36:36,998 --> 01:36:37,997
Eve!

639
01:36:44,982 --> 01:36:46,951
Eve, come back!

640
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,416
Eve!

641
01:38:30,675 --> 01:38:33,195
These sell well in San Francisco.

642
01:38:35,381 --> 01:38:37,817
Go clean the house.
