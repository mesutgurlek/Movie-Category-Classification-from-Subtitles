Why does it always have to be
the brothers together?

949

Why can't it just be you and me, James?

. . .and you want me. . .

1681
03:03:44,263 --> 03:03:47,098
. . .come up front with these brave men.

1682
03:03:47,266 --> 03:03:49,600
We'll all go together.

1683
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:27,180
Anyway, that's what my father told us.

1684
03:04:29,391 --> 03:04:31,434
What happened to your Uncle Tommy?

1685
03:04:32,728 --> 03:04:35,313
He was shot dead up at Omaha in '87.

1686
03:04:37,775 --> 03:04:40,234
Guess he wasn't worth saving.

1687
03:04:41,904 --> 03:04:44,447
Anyway, it's an honor. . .

1688
03:04:44,615 --> 03:04:46,908
. . . Mr. Earp, sir.

1689
03:04:47,326 --> 03:04:48,993
Ma'am.

1690
03:05:02,174 --> 03:05:05,176
Some people say
it didn't happen that way.

1691
03:05:06,595 --> 03:05:08,846
JOSIE:
Never mind them, Wyatt.

1692
03:05:09,014 --> 03:05:11,516
It happened that way.
