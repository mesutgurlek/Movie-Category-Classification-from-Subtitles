1
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,399
<i> After the epidemic, </i>

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,272
<i> the world has fallen,
While the dead rose. </i>

3
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:21,672
<i> There was no power,
nor food, nor water. </i>

4
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:25,145
<i> Humankind turned to 
a simple way of life. </i>

5
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:29,458
<i> At that moment,
Kept the dead obeying. </i>

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,740
<i> But after the Apocalypse,
A new threat arose. </i>

7
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,097
<i> Apocalypta. </i>

8
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:42,077
<i> She gave people a choice,
Whether they want it or not. </i>

9
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,182
<i> Becoming cattle
For the horde of the dead, </i>

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,587
<i> Or become a warriors, </i>

11
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:51,198
<i> and fight against
The growing darkness. </i>

12
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:50,406
<i> It will cost the little spirit
Of struggle that we have </i>

13
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,217
<i> If it's like this
What do you want to call it. </i>

14
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:17,930
The time is now!

15
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,735
These people

16
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,135
They died

17
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:25,538
and revived.

18
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,798
Heaps of junks.

19
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:30,951
Desert Springs ...

20
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:34,964
They will be mine!

21
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,057
Johnny and Stamper
Are preparing the army.

22
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,404
They got them
in a hunger frenzy.

23
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:01,615
<i> Don't be afraid. </i>

24
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,793
Do you want to go home?

25
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,503
I'll send you home.

26
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:47,537
<i> Look at me! </i>

27
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,973
<i> Now you are
My loyal undead. </i>

28
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,354
<i> Your flesh </i>

29
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:05,156
<i> now belongs to me. </i>

30
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,171
CHAPTER I
THE ATTACK A HARPER'S JUNCTION

31
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:41,775
<i> They say that there is rest
In death. </i>

32
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:56,613
<i> But in our world,
This is no longer true. </i>

33
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,644
<i> Keep walking, Stamper. </i>

34
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,794
Move your slaves!

35
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:10,078
You have places to go,
People to eat.

36
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:33,377
HARPER'S JUNCTION
16KM EAST

37
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,188
How are you?

38
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,180
How are you, Gregory?

39
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,750
Good morning, Sheriff!

40
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,398
Excuse me, girls.

41
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,045
Copper Heads
They're destroying the gate!

42
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,654
Run! Apocalypta dropped
The copper heads!

43
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,487
- Copper heads coming!
- My God!

44
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,943
They are coming!

45
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:11,655
Jared!

46
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,285
Dad!

47
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,870
Come on, son!

48
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,665
Come on! Come and get it,
Copper heads!

49
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,765
Apocalypta thanks
For joining the team.

50
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,756
Go, go!
Get out of here!

51
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,640
Go, go, go!

52
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,053
That's right, this way.

53
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,474
I think not.
Not today.

54
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,309
Fuck, where's my gun?

55
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:52,002
Shoot, shit!
Gun motherfucker!

56
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,139
Need some help, my love?

57
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,649
Hey, baby

58
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,235
What the fuck?
I'm right behind you.

59
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,338
A..a-a, Blondie!

60
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:49,378
Take it easy.
What do you want, freak?

61
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,009
Apocalypta will conquer
Any city you want.

62
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,833
You and your boyfriend can
Join us, or stay away.

63
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,918
I'll take you
to the Sheriff.

64
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,194
I think we eat him.

65
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:19,507
<i> Gag it.
It's going to be a long ride. </i>

66
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:27,305
DESERT SPRINGS
35KM TO NORTH

67
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:40,029
POLICE STATION
OF DESERT SPRINGS

68
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:49,435
Good evening, Mayor Shelby,
Apocalypta sends his regards.

69
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:57,125
Will never conquer
my city.

70
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:07,827
She took my eye,
but she's got your balls.

71
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,460
And think, you needed a face.
From Harper's Junction

72
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,209
To finally bring in
Apocalypta the best man.

73
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,751
Johnny Vermillion,
It's been a long time.

74
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,628
Harper's Junction
Was just the beginning,

75
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,829
Desert Springs is next.

76
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,579
In fact, what you were looking for
In Harper's Junction?

77
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,138
We wanted their food,
Its water,

78
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,373
Your livelihood,
And your bodies.

79
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:35,821
It has never been so easy.
To gather an army.

80
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,394
You disgusting bastard.

81
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,993
In fact,

82
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:41,624
I prefer...

83
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,687
Sociopath with complications.

84
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,078
"We have plans for your city."
- What plans?

85
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,310
The fences will fall,
The electricity will fail.

86
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:57,264
They can not overtake the dead,
Nor escape from destiny.

87
00:11:57,265 --> 00:12:00,191
Good luck in trying to keep
Your people alive, Mr. Mayor.

88
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,803
They will not last long.

89
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,176
Cowardly, people
Will not tolerate this.

90
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:14,317
I can stay,
Or is it asking too much?

91
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:20,533
Make sure he
hanged at sunrise.

92
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,402
Sunrise?
I do prefer the mornings.

93
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,183
Stamper said
That they got him.

94
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,544
They got Johnny.

95
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,725
At where?

96
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,548
Desert Springs,

97
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,965
With the good old
Mayor Shelby and Sheriff Cooper.

98
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,248
Stamper,
Bring Johnny back!

99
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,644
They take from me,

100
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,365
I take from them!

101
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:23,487
Go!

102
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:49,107
You definitely got some
Heads-copper, Stamper.

103
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,415
But we have one more job
Before leaving the city.

104
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:04,598
There he is.

105
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,862
Wait a second.

106
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:18,792
Hello boy.
What is your name?

107
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,950
Georgie.

108
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,772
Your mother or father.
Are they around?

109
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:28,631
Sheriff Cooper
Take care of you, right?

110
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:38,213
I was an orphan myself.

111
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:41,393
Before my father was
A copper head,

112
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,511
Do you know what he was?

113
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,725
He was a doctor.

114
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,329
Trying to find the cure.

115
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,963
Even if they are
scary,

116
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,697
they are equal
To you and me.

117
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,949
I can help you
To see their parents again.

118
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:22,517
Apocalypta will attack soon,
And I'm afraid we're not ready.

119
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:24,718
Look at them, we can not
Accept more refugees,

120
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,365
We barely survive like this!

121
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,041
How did that clown escape?

122
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:29,645
Damn it!

123
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,190
How did you let that happen?

124
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,256
You find him
And you eviscerate him!

125
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,627
It should already be halfway
From the mountain now.

126
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:44,329
Then go there,
Do what you need

127
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,018
Find our best
And crazier men,

128
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,167
Take them there and kill him.

129
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:53,148
Kill the Vermillion
And kill Apocalypta.

130
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,465
Kill until everyone there
Are dead.

131
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:58,542
And I mean the type of death
Of which there is no turning back.

132
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:15,949
CHAPTER II
THE MAGNIFICENT DEAD 7

133
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,446
What do you got?

134
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,700
Shit!

135
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:41,546
You know what I was thinking.
Right now?

136
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:47,023
I thought the drunker you get,
the better you get.

137
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,357
- I think he cheated.
- Really?

138
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,768
Cheating? Me?
Cheating?

139
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,564
I'll break your heart,
Walsh.

140
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,316
Look at this.

141
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,828
Look at these beautiful
White teeth.

142
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,637
They are not teeth
Of copper head.

143
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,742
I will not be able to sell them.

144
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,689
Never.

145
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,722
There's a game I want to see.
If you're good too.

146
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,844
It's to know
If you're going to leave here alive.

147
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,704
Come on, hickey!

148
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,863
I have to go.

149
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,972
I'm drunk.

150
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,467
I saw what you did in there.
Impressive.

151
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,017
You're Whiskey Joe, right?

152
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,324
Yup.

153
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,691
The one and only.

154
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,893
Are you interested in a job,
Whiskey Joe?

155
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,882
I am putting together
A group of men.

156
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,442
Let's go up the mountain

157
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:49,660
And defeat Apocalypta
once and for all.

158
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,970
It seems like a suicide mission.
for me.

159
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:55,557
Of course.

160
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,511
It can be true,
But the attacks will not stop.

161
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,322
They will continue,
Like it or not.

162
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:05,213
The humanity.
We are an endangered race.

163
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:08,475
But we can choose
How it will end.

164
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,898
Or it's our way.
Or her way.

165
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:15,652
What will be your choice,
Whiskey Joe?

166
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,613
"How many men do you need?"
"How many, I suppose."

167
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,954
I have a friend.
If it were legal

168
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,384
Sign marriage certificate
With an rifle,

169
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,150
He would have signed.

170
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,538
Let's get him.

171
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:38,861
Good...

172
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,500
You are so good
As I remembered.

173
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,140
We got a mission.

174
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,468
Got a job?

175
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,458
On the top of the mountain.

176
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,328
No one comes back from there.

177
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,200
<i>Nobody shoots like the Vacaro .</i>

178
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,874
<i> Cowboy. </i>

179
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,399
Apocalypta.

180
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,550
She is here.
It is everywhere.

181
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:15,045
It's time to end it.

182
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,588
<i> I know of someone else
That we need to recruit. </i>

183
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,709
We call this guy
Of "The Komodo".

184
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,571
- Because?
- You will see.

185
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,684
Just relax, Doctor.
Do not do anything and everything is fine.

186
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:43,889
He's like a vigilante ninja.
Swords, flying stars ...

187
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,962
Help who can not
If it helps.

188
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,204
Shoot him!

189
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:15,667
- Komodo.
- Cowboy.

190
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:17,268
Whiskey.

191
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,118
Oops.

192
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,534
I have a question.

193
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:23,215
Why waste time
With those boring idiots?

194
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,208
I pay for my anguish
With medication.

195
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,587
We need your help.

196
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,485
Suarez!

197
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:38,150
It is!
This is my boy!

198
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,893
How much to send someone?

199
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:43,309
There are 3 teeth to send a letter
To one of the city-ships.

200
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,262
Anywhere else ...

201
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:47,462
There is no other place.

202
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,554
No, I want to find someone.

203
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,043
Out there.

204
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,484
How much
To send a hunter?

205
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,490
There are 50 teeth.
Advanced.

206
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,650
I do not have 50 teeth.

207
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,611
<i> How rich! </i>

208
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,654
I have a wife who would like
Of this brilliant little thing.

209
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:12,235
Who are you looking for?

210
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,077
An old friend.

211
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,204
<i> Thank you very much. </i>

212
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,648
What's the problem?

213
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,007
Why do you want to find
my brother?

214
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,078
He knows that Jack
Only thinks of itself.

215
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,047
He is the best.
Well, second best.

216
00:22:55,363 --> 00:22:57,489
My love, go back to bed.

217
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:11,967
Where's your ring?

218
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:39,941
<i> I have a letter to Jack. </i>

219
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,211
Who are you?

220
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,917
I'm just the postman, sir!

221
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:53,239
What you want?

222
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,103
I have a message,
If you want to receive.

223
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,813
She said she'd be here.

224
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,256
Put it on the floor!

225
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:04,567
Now, send it.

226
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,362
Have a good day, sir!

227
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,740
I'm going.

228
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:19,082
<i> Jack, I'm writing
Because I know Billy will not. </i>

229
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,533
<i> Apocalypta destroyed
Harbor's Junction fully </i>

230
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:25,003
<i> and soon will come
To Desert Springs. </i>

231
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:27,115
<i> If we are going to stop it,
We need you. </i>

232
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,431
<i> Please, let's leave
The past aside. </i>

233
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:30,923
<i> Daisy Jane. </i>

234
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:39,100
CHAPTER III
ATTACK PLAN

235
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:42,107
POST OF QUARANTINE

236
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,498
Big door of the club.

237
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,104
- We're the whole team?
- I do not know!

238
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:02,091
Pardon me, Mam.
Sorry, how yo doing?

239
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,590
These are lovely ...

240
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,160
All right, it was bad.

241
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:08,997
I deserved it.

242
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,132
Go shower.

243
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,452
She likes me.

244
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,071
If you are here to meet
Cooper, come on then.

245
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,853
<i> I brought you
Because they are the best. </i>

246
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,510
Only this can defeat Apocalypta
And Vermillion,

247
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,149
the bizarre
Her right arm.

248
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,440
As you know, he ran away.
From prison a few days ago

249
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,263
And now he has returned to the mountains.

250
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:31,988
Now,
let's get down to business.

251
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,208
We're tracking Vermillion
for a while.

252
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:37,311
There is a complex in the mountains
Where it is likely to be.

253
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:39,945
The problem is getting there.

254
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:42,526
However, there is a blind spot.

255
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:47,394
few know
Get out of the valley alive.

256
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:50,769
So, any of you
Have you ever been there?

257
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,387
I know somebody.

258
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,544
It's ok.

259
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:58,047
I had him picked up.
He can help.

260
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,914
Very well,
You fucking cowards.

261
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:18,129
Too much looseness
To join us.

262
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:20,090
Get out of my way.

263
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,087
This bar is now
Government property.

264
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,862
Let's go then.

265
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,914
No love.
Sit down.

266
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:31,245
Okay, okay.

267
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,733
You are part of the team.

268
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,485
This is a public place,
Coop.

269
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:41,185
I do not have to do
what's up.

270
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:44,570
It should protect us,
Sheriff.

271
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:47,199
I'll protect you, Jay.
And if you're staying ...

272
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,607
Will have to fight
Like the rest of us.

273
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,945
I will not become
A copper head.

274
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,833
Chupões.

275
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:04,388
All right, everybody.
Looks like your friend is not coming.

276
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,366
So you are
the last hope

277
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,927
To protect Desert Springs.

278
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:09,755
We'll leave at dawn.

279
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:12,551
I have to check
My foster son, Georgie.

280
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:14,295
Have fun.

281
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,097
Hello!

282
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,261
He left the door open.

283
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:38,175
You have to be more careful.

284
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,677
I have to clear my mind.

285
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,554
What's your best?
Other than water!

286
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:48,223
This bottle of Whiskey here
Is over 50 years old.

287
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:49,584
I've saved it.

288
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,293
I imagine it has the taste
Of the best times.

289
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:55,905
Like, before the epidemic.

290
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:59,775
It can do.
How much?

291
00:27:59,776 --> 00:28:01,444
More than you can afford.

292
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,376
That's nice.

293
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,081
Because I will not pay.

294
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:08,237
Ms.

295
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:11,574
We still need a way
To walk the mountain.

296
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:13,673
We need a guide.

297
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:16,044
The only one worthwhile
that I know

298
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,445
It's the Siren.

299
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:21,644
- Who?
"A warrior priestess."

300
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:24,096
She knows the terrain.
Better than anyone.

301
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:26,955
Known for killing
More copper heads than I do.

302
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,460
You look like my kind of woman.

303
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:32,501
Either way, it does not matter.
For you can not find it.

304
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:34,482
She finds you.

305
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:39,554
I said Jack would not come.

306
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:50,687
Do not shot.

307
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,450
Do not be like this, my love.

308
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,589
Should know
That he would disappoint you.

309
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:59,104
Should not even have
If bothered.

310
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,678
Do you really carry
All this hate?

311
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,350
I hate that he never
was present.

312
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:06,907
I hate
That he is suffering.

313
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:10,860
And I hate giving up on him.

314
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,524
Cooper?

315
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:29,975
Back!

316
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:37,436
Come on, Billy, we gotta get in.
Now!

317
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,219
- Folks...
- He is dead!

318
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,654
- Who?
- Cooper.

319
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:45,465
He's a copperhead.

320
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,899
There's a lot of them out there.

321
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:52,874
Here we go!

322
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:01,559
<i>Who is it?
 What happens? </i>

323
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,066
Come on.

324
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,792
I'm coming.

325
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,659
Look after the rear!

326
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,443
Right, right.
I'm ready!

327
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,685
Just a little more.

328
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:31,482
I think he really wanted to
Back to the bar, right?

329
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:16,246
They are still coming in!

330
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,081
Billy! I can not
Get him off me!

331
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:32,846
Jack!

332
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:36,392
I got the message.

333
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,268
I did not think it would come.

334
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:43,771
I'm happy to help.

335
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,423
Sorry to do that.
With you, my love.

336
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:52,922
Jack?

337
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:55,510
It took a lot.

338
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,500
Hey guys!
Look at this!

339
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:18,377
Well, that was fun.

340
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:29,211
Then Cooper died,
So what's the rest of the deal?

341
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:31,039
If you finish this mission,

342
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,672
I'll give you any crap
That you want.

343
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,239
Cooper had a plan.

344
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,831
I think we should
Continue with it.

345
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,666
Wait a minute.
What about him?

346
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,830
He should know
How to survive outside.

347
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:44,206
Hey, Jack.

348
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,177
What do you think?

349
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:51,118
Everybody needs to die
someday.

350
00:32:57,732 --> 00:33:01,337
I may not come back alive.

351
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,461
I do not believe that.

352
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,163
Great. Because I was
Wanting a kiss of sorrow.

353
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:20,759
I think I have to go.

354
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,692
I have to save the day.
Nothing important.

355
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:25,012
All right, hero.

356
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:28,229
When you're done saving us,
find me.

357
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,689
Just tell me where.

358
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,251
I have a friend
On the outskirts of the city,

359
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,802
Told me to look for her
If he needed work.

360
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,225
What kind of job?

361
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:38,718
I do not know.
And work.

362
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,697
They must have food
And groceries there,

363
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,872
So if you are
On those sides,

364
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:45,821
show up.

365
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,667
- Let's get his teeth.
- Disgusting!

366
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:03,342
I prefer the good old gold.

367
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,907
The more teeth they have,
The more valuable you are.

368
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:09,408
Those willing to face them
And not running, are rare.

369
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,214
I should make a necklace.
Of copper-headed teeth.

370
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:13,515
You should.

371
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:20,498
"You're fucking good."
- Do not forget it.

372
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:29,157
- See you soon.
- Certainly.

373
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:43,114
CHAPTER IV
A FULL MINE OF ZUMBIS

374
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,923
Where are we going?

375
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:51,150
For the mines,
Has supplies there.

376
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:54,174
- How did you get into this?
- We volunteered.

377
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,299
Someone needs
An end to it.

378
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,370
"What's going on between you and Billy?"
- It's a long story.

379
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,702
And Jack?

380
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:03,366
Longer still.

381
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,510
Sorry, buddy.

382
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,637
Let's go.
Vacaro, show the route.

383
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:10,976
There will be much more,
Just continue

384
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:12,888
Do not.
Let's go around.

385
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,421
We spend a lot of ammunition
last night.

386
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:18,138
There's a small area here.

387
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,844
Are you sure?

388
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,477
By the way, it looks like here
He's been dead for a long time.

389
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:24,843
A friend said that he had
A stock here.

390
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,548
Is that right, Jack?

391
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,104
Who is your friend?

392
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:37,054
We entered, we separated
To cover the terrain

393
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:39,043
And we were within reach
Of the walkie-talkie.

394
00:36:39,044 --> 00:36:40,841
Not so well.
So hidden.

395
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:42,532
Not the copperheads.

396
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,541
Split up?

397
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:56,212
You are all
Crescidinhos.

398
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,346
Listen.

399
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,377
If it gets ugly inside,
It's yours on the straight.

400
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,516
<i> Give me your ... </i>

401
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,574
- My bad.
- Face!

402
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:03,606
What the fuck, man.

403
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:09,587
<i> Hey, how are things there? </i>

404
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,202
<i> This is dead! </i>

405
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:13,951
I do not know,
I plan to follow the leader.

406
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,242
There's nothing here, Jack.

407
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:20,113
Keep looking.

408
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,876
Right,
So there are no guns here.

409
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:39,983
But there's a lot
Of dead copper heads.

410
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:47,392
<i> Staff, there are several
Copper heads cut here. </i>

411
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,315
<i> Very dead! </i>

412
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,558
<i> Keep your eyes open. </i>

413
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:55,773
Watch out!

414
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,482
Did you hear that noise?

415
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:04,683
<i> Fuck,
Son of your mother! </i>

416
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:12,255
- Out?
- Yes.

417
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:22,644
That was a great idea, Jack!

418
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,097
Jack!

419
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:41,179
Not here.
Go!

420
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,857
Damn it!

421
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:56,832
You like this, huh?
Want more?

422
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,800
Want more?
No head-covers here!

423
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:01,870
<i> How beautiful!
It works very well! </i>

424
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,487
Thanks, honey.

425
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:02,295
Have you been bitten?

426
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:04,570
What the hell?

427
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:07,456
Would be welcome
A little help here, guys!

428
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:09,353
No, you can,
Vacaro.

429
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:16,511
Damn it!

430
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,844
- Thanks!
- He is good.

431
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:28,898
"What happened to you?"
- I made a new friend, come on.

432
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:47,475
Where are the others?

433
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,074
- Let's get together.
"Shall we abandon them?"

434
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:52,062
we will send
Our location.

435
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,527
Stamper called,
Said they broke up.

436
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,495
It's going to be easy
Get them now.

437
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:17,598
Anyway, we are on our way
Of Desert Springs.

438
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,409
Stamper finished
To map the mines.

439
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,467
We can use it
To come back from the attack

440
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:25,838
And the heroes will be trapped
On the mountain or die.

441
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:28,323
Who is he?

442
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,278
This is a volunteer.

443
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:34,973
He thinks he has
What it takes.

444
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,722
I heard you are looking for
good guys.

445
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:55,502
Do not let them come
In living Desert Springs.

446
00:42:58,396 --> 00:43:00,077
Weak!

447
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:08,384
"I'll put it with the others."
- Do it.

448
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,077
Now go.

449
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:33,313
CHAPTER V
TRAVEL TO APOCALYPTA

450
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,172
I will try again.

451
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:39,033
Billy, Daisy,
Are you listening?

452
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:43,068
Joe, Komodo,
Are you listening?

453
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:46,866
Nothing yet.

454
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:54,055
They are not listening,
I can not get anything.

455
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:55,853
We have to continue.

456
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:05,354
What the fuck is that?

457
00:44:05,355 --> 00:44:06,772
An old trap.

458
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,635
Keep going.

459
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:12,981
Let's go.

460
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,803
It does not look like we're going
Meet them so soon.

461
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:30,968
We need to evaluate
the situation.

462
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,464
All right, hold on.
I will try again.

463
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,293
Guys, are you there?

464
00:44:36,294 --> 00:44:38,268
Billy? Daisy?

465
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:40,766
Folks,
I think we should go back.

466
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:42,579
We should go look for them,
do not you think?

467
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,003
No, let's move on.
It's easier.

468
00:44:45,004 --> 00:44:46,623
You will find us,
Do not worry.

469
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:47,977
<i> - Stupid. 
- Hey, guys?</i>

470
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,754
What did you say?
Listen, we're Americans,

471
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,677
We speak English, right?

472
00:44:52,978 --> 00:44:55,512
<i> - Stupid. 
"Why do you need to talk like that?"</i>

473
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:58,664
<i> - I do not know, I do not know why.
- "Put what?" </i>

474
00:44:58,665 --> 00:45:00,697
- Why you?
- I know why, I know.

475
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,356
<i>-  You're crazy .
- I'm not crazy.</i>

476
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:05,307
<i> Do you speak Spanish now? </i>

477
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,524
Beauty!

478
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,902
I loved this.
What a beauty!

479
00:45:10,903 --> 00:45:13,267
Strange drink.
Did you like it?

480
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:15,383
The lady of the mountain.

481
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:18,115
The signs tell us
To go that way.

482
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:21,953
Come on, Koporo.

483
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:23,348
Or whatever!

484
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:46,498
Hey, where are you going?

485
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,126
BAIT

486
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:23,207
Hey, boy.

487
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:25,773
What the fuck?

488
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,255
Thank you.

489
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:40,197
You should be more careful.

490
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:47,138
They will smell it.

491
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:49,543
We must continue.

492
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:11,184
So what we do here,
after all?

493
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,776
Is called
Of Heavenly Burial.

494
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:21,288
I'll leave it here for the crows.
And vultures feed themselves.

495
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,494
Then he will come back
To the circle.

496
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:35,078
The copper heads
They are just hungry creatures.

497
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,022
Wolves, lions, humans,

498
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:40,536
Everyone wants food.

499
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,622
They can be
Understood.

500
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:48,074
That thing up there on the mountain,

501
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,455
She understands.

502
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,651
If you have any chance
To defeat her,

503
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:55,536
Will need help.

504
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:57,406
What is it?

505
00:48:58,088 --> 00:49:02,306
See this? The meat was food
Usually, but look at the bone.

506
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:05,029
It was cut
To pieces first.

507
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,550
Pets
Are different from the wild.

508
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:09,840
This one was fed.

509
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:11,468
What does that mean?

510
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:14,762
It means that we are
getting closer.

511
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:20,209
<i> Look at me! </i>

512
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,439
<i> Look at me! </i>

513
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,324
Calm ... 

514
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,239
Eat, copperhead.

515
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:41,270
You tried to kill me!

516
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:44,478
No...

517
00:49:44,479 --> 00:49:46,617
I arrested him!

518
00:49:47,473 --> 00:49:50,011
And I killed him!

519
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,574
Eat, copperhead!

520
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,944
Great, now what?

521
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,473
Is here.
It's a difficult climb from here.

522
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:18,427
I suggest you rest.

523
00:50:18,978 --> 00:50:20,711
We leave at dawn.

524
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:39,664
You should drink this.

525
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,128
It will make you strong.

526
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:56,423
These celestial burials,
Did someone teach you this?

527
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:58,079
My grandmother.

528
00:50:58,594 --> 00:51:00,827
She survived the war.

529
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:04,367
She teached me
Such as tracking,

530
00:51:04,368 --> 00:51:06,026
how to survive.

531
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:08,621
She taught you
To do it alone?

532
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:12,032
She met my grandfather.
Before the epidemic.

533
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:13,604
He was a miner.

534
00:51:14,702 --> 00:51:17,868
So, it all started here?
In these mines?

535
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:20,151
She said that men
They went home,

536
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:22,589
With copper dust
In helmets.

537
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,089
Copper heads.

538
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,287
They called themselves that way.
Well before.

539
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:29,809
He turned first.

540
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,832
Then his team.

541
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:36,013
She had to kill him herself.

542
00:51:40,207 --> 00:51:43,684
Yes, she taught me.
To do it alone.

543
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:20,365
Chord.
Time to go.

544
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:57,266
Obey to me,
Copperhead!

545
00:52:57,267 --> 00:53:01,277
Obey me,
Copper head.

546
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,484
<i> Obey me, </i>

547
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:06,666
<i> copper head. </i>

548
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:22,416
Calm down!

549
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:25,519
They must be fed
To fight!

550
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:49,795
<i> Do not fear. </i>

551
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:54,500
Do not be afraid.

552
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:57,196
<i> Do not fear. </i>

553
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:06,877
<i> They prefer raw meat. </i>

554
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:12,836
Fix the fence!

555
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:16,628
Unless you want to
Be next.

556
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,904
Trixie.

557
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:47,931
Guys, Trixie said
Who would come this way.

558
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:50,245
I promised that if I came here,
Would pass by there.

559
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:53,888
There is food, water,
Supplies. Even ammunition.

560
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:55,189
Come on.

561
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:10,879
Look at those socks.

562
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,291
Do we die?

563
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:15,666
We must have died.

564
00:55:20,975 --> 00:55:22,536
I smell it.
It's a brothel!

565
00:55:22,537 --> 00:55:25,127
"It must be where she is.
- What does that mean?

566
00:55:25,128 --> 00:55:28,690
"It's no secret."
"Come on, shall we?"

567
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,155
This should be
The army of Apocalypta.

568
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,091
It seems so.

569
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,687
Let's eliminate them.
What are we waiting for?

570
00:56:04,688 --> 00:56:06,707
We have no ammunition.
Sufficient for all.

571
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,980
Do not kill a dragon
Cutting their claws.

572
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:15,477
You cut off the head.

573
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:19,397
The way to the top
It is just after these rocks.

574
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:23,211
Let's go up the mountain
And get rid of the psychopath witch.

575
00:57:03,623 --> 00:57:05,166
Step where I step.

576
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,947
There are many pitfalls here.

577
00:57:10,196 --> 00:57:13,298
Copper heads.
There will be copper heads.

578
00:57:17,428 --> 00:57:19,922
- What's your business?
- We ...

579
00:57:19,923 --> 00:57:23,421
Sales, ma'am. Panties!
We sell panties!

580
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:26,277
They want to enter,
Right, boys?

581
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,735
How much will it cost?

582
00:57:30,872 --> 00:57:32,420
We have a lot here.

583
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:33,990
- That's mine!
- Do not worry.

584
00:57:33,991 --> 00:57:35,840
So?
Can we come in now?

585
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:04,276
"I still do not trust her.
"But Jack does.

586
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:07,760
As far as I know, she may want
Deliver us to Apocalypta.

587
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:10,004
This is a great plan.

588
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:13,672
It will transform some gunmen
In copper heads?

589
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:16,924
They'll never get us.

590
00:58:17,832 --> 00:58:19,176
Let's go.

591
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:22,998
Let's go.

592
00:58:41,478 --> 00:58:42,986
Go to sleep.

593
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:51,721
CHAPTER VI
THE TRAP

594
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:00,069
We will see
If Trixie is here,

595
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,166
pick up supplies
And get out of here fast.

596
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,628
I think we should
Go after the others.

597
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:07,265
Dude, relax.

598
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:09,000
Let's meet
with them.

599
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:12,236
But let's do
A short pause.

600
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:15,302
Which is!
Listen, you know what?

601
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:18,014
Let's vote, right?
When you count to three.

602
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:20,822
1, 2 ...

603
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,252
3!

604
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:25,887
<i>- Gentlemen.
-  Let's go. </i>

605
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:31,881
Whiskey Joe, why do not you come up?
I want you to meet somebody.

606
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:34,285
I'll see if Trixie is here.

607
00:59:36,419 --> 00:59:38,738
Hello sir

608
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,250
Hello Miss!

609
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,353
Mamma has
What you need, my love.

610
00:59:44,354 --> 00:59:48,502
Ammunition, Water, Food ...
And, of course, girls.

611
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:55,941
Do you like her.
I can make it happen.

612
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:59,430
But first, if the gentlemen
Want supplies, then ...

613
00:59:59,431 --> 01:00:01,463
Go down the stairs with me,
love.

614
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:10,529
Why would you have two?

615
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,621
Two?
Ah, two!

616
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:14,391
I'm ambidextrous.

617
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:17,105
In fact,
This is my whiskey

618
01:00:17,106 --> 01:00:19,296
And this one here has blood.

619
01:00:19,297 --> 01:00:21,401
That's naughty.

620
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,545
- I like shit.
- I can catch?

621
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:26,423
Wait there, lass!
Do not pull this here.

622
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:28,918
Simple to turn around
A copper head,

623
01:00:28,919 --> 01:00:32,018
I'll smell blood,
I'll open and drink.

624
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:33,461
And when to pull this here ...

625
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:34,778
CABUM!

626
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,368
Whiskey Joe Pieces
Everywhere, you know?

627
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,172
I know where I want
A piece of Whiskey Joe.

628
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:44,054
You know, do not you?
So, let's go inside.

629
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,190
Just a few more minutes.

630
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:50,767
A few more minutes ...
She's fast!

631
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:56,334
Door number two,
It's our lucky day!

632
01:01:03,262 --> 01:01:05,237
Hey!
You are welcome.

633
01:01:06,341 --> 01:01:08,893
- Are you coming in?
- Thank you.

634
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:11,167
But I paid the bill.
for two.

635
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:13,423
Get your money, my love.

636
01:01:15,457 --> 01:01:16,778
Love?

637
01:01:17,315 --> 01:01:19,575
Trixie?
This one!

638
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,404
What supplies
we are talking?

639
01:01:41,405 --> 01:01:44,000
Almost there.
Keep going down, love.

640
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,250
Get in there!

641
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:54,732
<i> Billy! </i>

642
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,765
Billy!

643
01:01:58,204 --> 01:02:00,613
God, Billy.
Answer!

644
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:03,849
You need to stay calm.
And talk low.

645
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:07,755
Billy, are you listening?

646
01:02:08,173 --> 01:02:11,490
Joe, Vaquero,
any!

647
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:13,856
We are almost at the top.
Already arrived?

648
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:15,604
Are you listening?
Exchange!

649
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:18,573
Holy shit!

650
01:02:18,923 --> 01:02:20,535
It's a trap!

651
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,193
Guys, can you talk downstairs?

652
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:26,122
- We have to get out of here!
- Whiskey Joe is enjoying it!

653
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:27,555
They work for Apocalypta!

654
01:02:27,556 --> 01:02:29,025
- What?
- Shit!

655
01:02:29,026 --> 01:02:31,812
Bitch
Honey I got to go!

656
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:34,814
I swear I did not know
What was she doing.

657
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:38,058
<i> Young girls,
Do not let them escape! </i>

658
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,643
<i> They're worth the price! </i>

659
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:42,821
Face!

660
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:44,832
Here we go!
Let's go!

661
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:50,439
Vacaro!

662
01:02:54,693 --> 01:02:56,561
Come on, Vacaro!
You can face it!

663
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:59,008
Let's go!
Faster, partner!

664
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,331
Whiskey!

665
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:07,800
Oh no!

666
01:03:07,808 --> 01:03:10,047
<i>Oh man, Vacaro .
Come on, man! really?</i>

667
01:03:10,048 --> 01:03:11,552
Cowboy!

668
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:13,743
Of all people,
Did not have another?

669
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:01,171
EVAN MEYER, 13 YEARS.
TAKEN VERY YOUNG.

670
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,769
I've never seen her so closely.

671
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,361
Few have seen.

672
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,579
This place
Seems to be abandoned.

673
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:18,179
Where's Apocalypta?
And the rest of her men?

674
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,822
They live in the mines.

675
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:21,641
We have to find
an entry.

676
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,919
Let's find my brother.

677
01:04:57,892 --> 01:04:59,434
Jack!

678
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,717
Down here.

679
01:05:28,514 --> 01:05:30,865
It seems we found
Our entrance.

680
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,988
- Daisy.
- Billy.

681
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:12,945
Love.

682
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,946
Daisy!
Release it!

683
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:23,489
No!

684
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:24,879
Let her go, Johnny!

685
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,911
I have a surprise
for you guys.

686
01:06:26,912 --> 01:06:29,694
I think the last time
Did not work right.

687
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,204
Hold on, my love.

688
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:32,581
If you hurt her ...

689
01:06:32,582 --> 01:06:34,641
Tell Apocalypta
I'm cleaning here.

690
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:37,423
Go ahead,
We can start now.

691
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:42,358
Johnny is with them.
It's time.

692
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,489
Yes.

693
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:47,039
It's time.

694
01:07:01,629 --> 01:07:05,848
Yes.
Now you're done!

695
01:07:07,436 --> 01:07:09,976
Join your brothers
And his sisters,

696
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:14,499
And destroy Desert Springs,
by me!

697
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:30,014
You made a deal
With the Devil, boy.

698
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:32,797
She will be a great specimen
Of my army!

699
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,382
- No!
- Daisy!

700
01:07:35,383 --> 01:07:36,813
No!

701
01:08:02,005 --> 01:08:04,944
<i> No! Daisy! </i>

702
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,695
Billy!

703
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:21,701
No!

704
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:29,269
It's all right.

705
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,872
Let's take
That son of a bitch.

706
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,520
I'm sorry.

707
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,025
Quickly.
Through these doors.

708
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,286
<i> I am behind you ... </i>

709
01:09:12,287 --> 01:09:13,587
Jack!
-720

710
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,234
Thank you.

711
01:09:24,738 --> 01:09:27,460
The son of a bitch has guided us
Even his trap.

712
01:09:30,618 --> 01:09:33,898
Will not laugh when I get you,
You son of a bitch.

713
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:36,959
Keep running.

714
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:48,875
That should hold them
for a while.

715
01:09:49,445 --> 01:09:51,268
It should give us an advantage.

716
01:09:56,453 --> 01:09:58,180
Any idea?

717
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:01,268
At least
We went down the mountain.

718
01:10:01,269 --> 01:10:04,601
From here,
Is to guess where it went.

719
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:09,845
It looks like it's coming ...

720
01:10:09,846 --> 01:10:11,181
from here.

721
01:10:21,678 --> 01:10:23,053
This way.

722
01:10:27,252 --> 01:10:28,659
Quickly!

723
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:43,172
Great shortcut.

724
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:45,890
It's not exactly
Desert Springs.

725
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:47,502
Follow me.

726
01:10:53,017 --> 01:10:55,058
Sorry
For not having anticipated it.

727
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:57,163
Apocalypta
Rebuilt the mines

728
01:10:57,164 --> 01:10:59,819
And it's midway
Of Desert Springs.

729
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,536
And does it matter?

730
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,972
Billy, we still have
A job to do.

731
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,932
I do not care.

732
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,819
She would want
That it should continue.

733
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,068
There is nothing
So it's worth continuing.

734
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,676
Will decide for everyone
down there?

735
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:21,227
That's what you did.

736
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,929
Do not make the same mistake.
Which I have committed.

737
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,470
I messed up.

738
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:38,706
I messed up a lot.

739
01:11:39,182 --> 01:11:41,667
But I will not commit
The same error twice.

740
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:46,030
Because you will come with me.

741
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,573
We will go through this together.

742
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:51,156
Are you understanding me?

743
01:12:00,473 --> 01:12:01,773
You know...

744
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:03,710
Come here.

745
01:12:08,676 --> 01:12:11,058
- That was good!
- How beautiful.

746
01:12:11,778 --> 01:12:15,089
Yeah, I know.
Let's get everyone.

747
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,390
Almost finished.

748
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,259
Here it is!

749
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,991
- That!
- That!

750
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:26,591
This is great.

751
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:52,655
Chapel of Desert Springs.
We arrived.

752
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,455
The copper heads are
Returning to Desert Springs.

753
01:13:00,992 --> 01:13:03,242
It may be there that Jack
And the others are.

754
01:13:03,243 --> 01:13:05,876
Well, let's go there and kill
Copper heads.

755
01:13:11,768 --> 01:13:15,000
CHAPTER VII
ATTACK ON DESERT SPRINGS

756
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:24,339
Not my city.

757
01:13:32,514 --> 01:13:34,836
Who has the balls?
From whom now?

758
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:36,767
Die.

759
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:55,863
Come on, girls!
Move it! Come on!

760
01:14:07,563 --> 01:14:09,033
<i> People, are you listening? </i>

761
01:14:09,034 --> 01:14:11,493
Guys, can you hear me?
What is your situation?

762
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:13,196
We're still alive!

763
01:14:13,197 --> 01:14:15,354
<i>-  Your help would be welcome! 
- Understand.</i>

764
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:17,840
Joe, we have to go!
Pull the zipper off.

765
01:14:19,678 --> 01:14:21,478
<i> And where the hell is Jack? </i>

766
01:14:21,479 --> 01:14:23,624
Billy. Billy!

767
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,879
She knew she liked it hard.

768
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,441
- I can play hard.
- My kind of bitch.

769
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:44,749
I do not have time for this.

770
01:15:48,688 --> 01:15:50,223
Siren, be careful!

771
01:15:52,788 --> 01:15:54,088
Billy!

772
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:01,388
<i> Billy is down.
Attract them to the center. </i>

773
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,278
Leave it to me, buddy!

774
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:04,998
Come on,
Damn copper heads,

775
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:07,521
It's dinner time! That's right!
Come and get it!

776
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,270
Overjoyed!
It is the same as barbecue,

777
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:11,621
But even better!
Come and get it!

778
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:15,477
Billy! Billy!
Not this one!

779
01:16:15,478 --> 01:16:18,678
No, no, no.

780
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,729
- We have to stop.
- It will work.

781
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:22,939
- We have to finish ...
"No, no, relax.

782
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,939
Should not
Have given up on you.

783
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,830
Billy, you have to promise.

784
01:16:27,831 --> 01:16:29,326
You have to take care of yourself now.

785
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:38,200
Billy.
Billy, wake up.

786
01:16:38,593 --> 01:16:39,893
Billy, wake up.

787
01:16:40,364 --> 01:16:42,364
Billy!
Wake up, Billy!

788
01:16:53,164 --> 01:16:54,606
Vermillion is mine.

789
01:17:33,427 --> 01:17:34,767
I love you, Billy.

790
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:19,501
Quick, they're still coming.

791
01:18:19,502 --> 01:18:23,041
Come on, copperheads!
It's time to dance!

792
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:25,848
Come here.
Come and get it.

793
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:28,096
That.
That's right.

794
01:18:28,397 --> 01:18:29,942
Komodo, answer, man!

795
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:31,815
Use your swords,
Where are the blades?

796
01:18:31,816 --> 01:18:34,671
Come here now,
Because there are a lot of them coming!

797
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,110
I caught you, you bastard!

798
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:45,276
- It's not a good idea.
- Stay behind me.

799
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:47,500
<i>- Where is it?
-  Moving them away from the city. </i>

800
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:50,021
I will try to get there
As fast as you can.

801
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:02,603
Crazy whore!

802
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:09,250
They are everywhere!
And I'm running out of whiskey.

803
01:19:30,164 --> 01:19:31,957
You screwed up, did not you?

804
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:34,049
Damn it.

805
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:36,836
Komodo!

806
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:40,371
Whiskey, where are you?

807
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:00,532
Love!
Trixie Trixie.

808
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,133
Trixie.

809
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,032
I Love You Love.

810
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,333
I love you.

811
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:04,085
<i> Everything I've Known
It was death. </i>

812
01:24:04,386 --> 01:24:06,131
<i> Everything I've seen. </i>

813
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:09,740
<i> As the Sirene tells,
Was how it ended. </i>

814
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,820
<i> There can be no beginning. </i>

815
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,196
<i> With Apocalypta dead, </i>

816
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:16,994
<i> humanity has
