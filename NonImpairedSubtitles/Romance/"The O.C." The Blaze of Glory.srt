1
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,648
It's hard to believe it,
but spring is here.

2
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,787
Yep, this year's
just flying by.

3
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:45,472
Yeah, and you know, I got to say,
this year, not as good as last.

4
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:46,376
You think?

5
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:49,860
I do. I mean, look. We all tried
some new things, and that was fun.

6
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:54,582
Uh, yard guys, illegitimate daughters,
less fighting, more live music.

7
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,629
Well, maybe you remember last year
as better, 'cause it was all new.

8
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,409
So you think I've sentimentalized
the past all out of proportion?

9
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:03,496
Yeah, come on, I mean, we
can't keep living in last year.

10
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,216
Sure we can. And check this out, man.

11
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,676
Things are already going
back to the way they were.

12
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,986
I'm back together with Summer.
You're single again.

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,319
-I think I know where this is going.
-I'll tell you where it's going.

14
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,063
It's going to the Harbor
School Pep Rally Bonfire.

15
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:19,334
Come on.

16
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,292
You could rally a little
pep, couldn't you?

17
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:23,519
-Especially if you invited...
-Don't say it.

18
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:25,531
Aw, it would be
so last year though.

19
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,221
-There's nothing going on with me and Marissa.
-Really?

20
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:31,413
So, there's just no feelings there whatsoever?
You couldn't care less.

21
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,788
It's not about that.
Besides, she's...clearly already taken.

22
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:41,351
I don't know. I don't
see any chemistry there.

23
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:44,792
Maybe we should ask them to kiss...real slow-like.

24
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:48,274
Couldn't help but notice
the, uh, bonfire banner.

25
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:50,773
Oh, don't talk to me about it.
It's been so stressful.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,823
I can't even find someone
to design the bonfire.

27
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:56,408
-But you guys are coming, right?
-I don't know, it's a pep rally.

28
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:58,185
Yeah,
a bonfire pep rally.

29
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,435
-You bet we are.
-Okay, cool. Well,

30
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:01,264
I'm gonna be late.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,827
Okay. Hey, Ryan, you're going
the way of lockers and classrooms.

32
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,853
Why don't you walk her?
That'd be a nice gesture.

33
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:10,080
-Okay. Thanks.
-No problem.

34
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:15,051
-Live in the now, Seth.
-I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I can't do that.

35
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:22,471
Don't even think
about it, Cohen.

36
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:24,570
We have lived through enough
of their pain and suffering.

37
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,611
-Yeah, and it was awesome.
-Do not meddle with Ryan and Marissa.

38
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:32,436
-They're like combustible.
-Yeah, Summer, and what better place for said combustion,

39
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,770
than the Harbor School
Pep Rally Bonfire?

40
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,102
-You're kind of creeping me out.
-I'm okay wi th that.

41
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:45,638
Wait. Summer.

42
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,496
All right, nice and easy.
Now, start that shoulder turn.

43
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,705
Keep your eye on that ball.
Maintain the spine angle.

44
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,567
Come on, turn those shoulders.

45
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,831
Finish that turn,feel that weight shift!
You feel the...

46
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,120
All right, I'm just gonna stand here,
nice and quietly.

47
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,063
But supportively.

48
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:42,999
All right.

49
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:51,148
That was good. Your feet were a little busy.
Maybe quiet your feet down.

50
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:53,188
-Come on, try it again.
-No more tries.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,701
I hate golf.

52
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:55,819
I suck at golf.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,511
I no longer want
to play golf.

54
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,225
Honey, you could
only get better.

55
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:01,046
I'll have to take
your word for it.

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,794
Come on. We could
play together.

57
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,066
And you look so
cute in that visor.

58
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,139
I do?

59
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:12,411
I got to go. We're putting together our
first issue of "Newport Living,"

60
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,423
and we're trying to figure out
what photo of Julie to use on the cover.

61
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,034
Talk about Sophie's Choice.
So who'd you finally get to edit the "Medusa Monthly?"

62
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,304
Carter Buckley. He's really great.

63
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:26,096
He wants to take it beyond
gossip and dish, focus on culture,

64
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,364
the local art scene. So it's really
more of a pamphlet than a magazine.

65
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:34,593
Carter Buckley.
Now, what's he done before?

66
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:38,571
Oh, a bunch of stuff. A magazine,
called The Ugly American,

67
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,052
National Geographic, GQ,

68
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,554
and he self-published
a magazine called Revolution.

69
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,531
You gotta be kidding.

70
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,380
-You know it?
-That was the magazine of Berkeley's left wing.

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,684
Portraits of the misunderstood,
the marginalized, the crackpots.

72
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,931
-An entire magazine about losers.
-Oh, but lovable ones.

73
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:57,253
I read it religiously.

74
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,363
I'm impressed.

75
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,496
-You know, I'd love to meet him.
-Well...

76
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,582
I'll, uh, I'll set something up.

77
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:11,692
-You found your wedding ring.
-Uh...yeah, behind some cushions.

78
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:12,583
Thanks for the lesson.

79
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:42,334
-Hello, Marissa.
-Hey, Cohen.

80
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,325
You seem stressed,
a little distracted.

81
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,250
Yeah, well, it's this bonfire. It'd be
really great if we had, you know, a bonfire.

82
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,723
Well, Coop,
I think I got what ails ya.

83
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,799
First of all,
only Summer calls me Coop.

84
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:55,815
Yeah, but I figured,
we're back together now,

85
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,506
and you know, if A=C and B=C then A=B,
you know what I'm saying?

86
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,142
No.
I really don't.

87
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,824
So what's your plan?
Who's your social chair savior?

88
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:05,675
Ryan.

89
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,702
Mr. Water Polo?
I don't think so.

90
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,986
Yeah, but think about this.
That guy worked in-- no, no, no--

91
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,854
he toiled in an actual
construction job.

92
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,593
Also, he enjoys architecture
and burning stuff down.

93
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,516
He did torch Caleb's model home.

94
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:22,041
But I don't know, I mean,
do you think he'd say yes?

95
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,612
To you? How
could he resist?

96
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:26,653
Especially now that Lindsay's gone,
the kid's kind of blue.

97
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:30,531
Might be good for him.
Distract him. And it would be fun.

98
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,815
Although I personally
don't see the appeal, yes.

99
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:35,966
All right, that's
a good idea. Thanks.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,831
Don't mention it.

101
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,565
Seriously, don't,
especially to Summer.

102
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:50,028
Hello, Mother.
No, I'm not coming home, okay?

103
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:52,299
Please, do not...

104
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,724
She's such a little me.

105
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,593
Okay, like you're not creepy enough?
You're just appearing in doorways now?

106
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:05,505
-Trouble at home?
-Like I'd open up to you.

107
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,950
-Well, here if you need me.
-I'll keep that in mind.

108
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,685
-What do you want?
-I want my money.

109
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,763
Again, good to know.
How'd you get past security?

110
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,283
Charm and good looks. Now, I know
you got this magazine ready to launch.

111
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,524
-Get out, Lance.
-This is not the moment when you want

112
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:25,084
your somehow perfect reputation undone
by one bad decision, and some not so flattering lighting.

113
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,769
You got three days
to get my money,

114
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,589
or everyone in Newport's
gonna see a lot more than your face.

115
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,905
Traffic was terrible.
Is Carter here yet?

116
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:48,866
Mr. Buckley left a voice mail
at around 3:30 a.m., said don't expect him today.

117
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,972
He say why?

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,350
No, but I couldn't understand
everything on the message.

119
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,601
-He was...slurring.
-You're kidding.

120
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,735
Well, I guess Julie and I
will proceed without him.

121
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:05,372
-Oh, hey, Keeks, can't make the meeting.
-Something up?

122
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,946
Just a critical personal
emergency, but nothing important.

123
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:14,892
Well, I guess
the meeting's canceled.

124
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,863
I can try Mr. Buckley,
see if he's changed his mind.

125
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:20,214
Uh, no, I'll-I'll,
I'll take care of it.

126
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,836
So how are you and Alex?

127
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,600
Hmm? You know, really great.

128
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,908
Really great?
Or really great?

129
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:35,741
Really great.

130
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:37,573
Thanks for clearing
that up for me, Coop.

131
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,794
Oh, hey, can you tell Seth
never to call me Coop again?

132
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,135
'Cause he kind of
ruined the nickname.

133
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,908
Cohen called you Coop?

134
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,105
-When?
-Earlier.

135
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,929
-Hey, hope I'm not interrupting.
-No, actually, I was hoping I'd run into you.

136
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,970
-Oh, yeah? You were?
-You were?

137
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,855
I was. I need someone
to build the bonfire for us,

138
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,308
and I figured, who else has worked
in construction, likes architecture...

139
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,419
-And has burned down a house?
-Yeah. Exactly.

140
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:04,017
And I thought it would be fun...
working together.

141
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:05,549
-Oh, you did.
-You did?

142
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:09,893
Yeah. Besides, if you don't do it,
then the water polo team's not going to have a pep rally.

143
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,843
Yeah, well, we can't
have that happen. Um...

144
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,934
-Sure, yeah, okay.
-You'll do it? That's great.

145
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,201
-Isn't that great?
-It's great!

146
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,936
-What's great?
-Ryan's going to build the bonfire for us.

147
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,324
Hey, great idea, you two.
I love that,

148
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,853
making it happen
on behalf of the school.

149
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,130
Yeah, you know, the idea
is just inspired.

150
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,757
Well, I've got a big test
to study for,

151
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,923
so it looks like
I'll be eating in the library

152
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,383
So long.
Oh, come on! Do you have to go?

153
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:40,857
You know, will you two
excuse me?

154
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:45,872
Um, so, thanks again.
I'll see you after school?

155
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,126
-Yeah, sure. My place?
-Your place with Alex?

156
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,791
-Yeah. Is that a problem?
-No.

157
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:54,403
Okay.

158
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,168
No problem at all.

159
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,145
I looked in the box.
This computer does not have an access key.

160
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:04,213
Look, look, look, all I want
to do is check my E-mail.

161
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:08,903
No!
Do not transfer me.

162
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,719
You must have been
talking to Marissa.

163
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,461
Julie, you scared me...
more than usual.

164
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:18,571
-Always a pleasure, Sanford.
-Only Caleb gets to call me Sanford because he won't not.

165
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:22,440
-What are you doing here?
-Official business.

166
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,674
And as a new client,
I'm not impressed.

167
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:30,395
If this is a marital issue, I'm going
to have to decline. Caleb's got me on retainer.

168
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:34,417
Caleb and I are just fine,
thanks, and well, I'm trying to keep it that way.

169
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:56,933
I think this is
the first time in my life I'm actually speechless.

170
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:57,822
It was the '80s.

171
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,643
I was young,
I had no money and...

172
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,372
it was the '80s.

173
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,663
Well, that explains everything.
I'm not going to give you my whole sob story.

174
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:09,565
Needless to say,
I never thought that it would resurface.

175
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:15,112
-So where did this come from?
-The auteur behind this masterpiece, his name is Lance Baldwin.

176
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:19,724
-He's an ex.
-So you started with a porn producer and you ended up with Caleb.

177
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,230
See, I'd consider
that a lateral move.

178
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:27,442
He wants half a million or he goes public
on the eve of Newport Living's launch.

179
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:30,892
-You've got to go to the cops.
-No, Sandy, no cops.

180
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,391
And before you even suggest it,
no Caleb.

181
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:40,295
-I am so not the guy for this.
-Sandy, please.

182
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,471
I'm begging you.

183
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,698
Forget the company
or my marriage.

184
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,340
If Marissa ever
found out about this...

185
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:55,256
I mean, she's already moved out on me.
She won't take my calls.

186
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,331
She would never
speak to me again.

187
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,854
Oh, it's all right, Julie.

188
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:14,666
You deal with Marissa
and I'll...

189
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,860
I'll deal with the Colonel.
It's a Boogie Nights reference.

190
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,487
Expect a lot of them.

191
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:36,577
Fine, don't worry about
it, I wasn't reading.

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,528
What the hell
is your problem, Cohen?!

193
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,257
You're interrupting
very studious people.

194
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,133
Like me.

195
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:55,984
-Now no one can hear you scream.
-What is your problem, woman?

196
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,938
You are. What did I tell you
about messing with Ryan and Marissa?

197
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:02,548
I was concerned that the water polo team
was gonna be without a pep rally this year,

198
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,748
so I suggested it for the good of the school.

199
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:05,478
Cohen.

200
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,002
-They belong together.
-No, they don't.

201
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:11,011
Yes, they do. It is me and you
and it is Ryan and Marissa.

202
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,545
And that's the way
it's supposed to be.

203
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:13,659
Listen up, Ass Hat.

204
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,670
Ryan and Marissa separate,
both great people that I love.

205
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:19,519
Together, disaster.

206
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:21,331
So stay away from
them, all right?

207
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,108
Or otherwise more than the
bonfire is going up in flames.

208
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,458
I can make no promises.

209
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:31,474
Hey, what's up?

210
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:34,245
Nothing. I just wanted to see
what you were up to after school.

211
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,759
I feel like we haven't had
a lot of time to hang.

212
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:39,476
I know, I just, I have
this project to work on after school with Ryan.

213
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,810
With Ryan?

214
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:43,385
What thing?

215
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,560
-This bonfire pep rally.
-You never mentioned a pep rally.

216
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:50,767
Yeah, well, I kind of have a handle
on your sense of school spirit.

217
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:55,237
Yeah, good point. so I guess
I'll just see you at home?

218
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,635
-Hello?
-Yeah, sorry. I'll see you later.

219
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,312
Hello?!
Anyone here?!

220
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,268
Kirsten. Sorry, private party.

221
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,470
We had a meeting.
You want to explain what happened?

222
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,358
Oh, it was just a little thing
I like to call...

223
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,151
-my wedding anniversary.
-You're divorced.

224
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,134
No wonder this party sucks.

225
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,534
I see you found your ring.
Must mean you're still married.

226
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,083
Thanks for stopping by.

227
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,294
Look, I'm sorry
I just stopped by.

228
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,932
But you could at least apologize
for blowing off the meeting.

229
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:05,106
Right. Yeah. I'm sorry.

230
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,866
And I'm sorry for all the...
future meetings I'm gonna miss.

231
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:10,982
You see?

232
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,608
Now you don't have to feel bad
about firing me.

233
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,882
Maybe you're not in the best frame
of mind to be having this discussion.

234
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,346
And I'm going to be
less self-loathing if I'm sober?

235
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:22,282
Come on, I work for a rag
about Julie Cooper... Nichol.

236
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:24,709
No, it's about culture,
it's about art.

237
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,107
Oh, come on, Kirsten,

238
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:31,132
this magazine is just a photo opportunity
for 55-year-old women with 25-year-old breasts.

239
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:34,865
But this is a chance to turn
this community upside down.

240
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,738
Be subversive,
irreverent.

241
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:39,908
I'd rather be drunk.

242
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,825
You see, Oats, it was even
the same for The Valley.

243
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,814
Last year was just better.

244
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,751
You and Captain Oats
catching up?

245
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,034
Yeah. Does he seem grumpy
to you these days?

246
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,380
I know how he feels. This bonfire
thing, it's a disaster.

247
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:20,481
you and Marissa working on the
bonfire together. That's pretty cool, huh?

248
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:23,722
Not so far.
Did a bunch of designs, but they all suck.

249
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:26,330
Yeah, well, I'm sure whatever you
come with, Marissa will love you.

250
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:28,906
It.

251
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,943
Dude, there's nothing going on
with me and Marissa.

252
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:35,333
-Oh, it's none of my business.
-Hey. You guys cool fending for yourselves for dinner?

253
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:36,552
Sure.

254
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:39,882
Your mother's at work and I've got to run.
But I'm leaving you some money for pizza.

255
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:42,169
Thanks.
You two all right?

256
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,313
Yeah. Just a
school project.

257
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:49,482
Ryan's working with Marissa.
Oh, you and Marissa. That's nice, just like last year.

258
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:52,531
You and Mom have been
kind of working a lot lately.

259
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,230
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine, just busy.

260
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:58,882
I feel like there's maybe been
some kind of tension recently.

261
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,584
Well, listen, you're married to someone for 20 years,
you're bound to hit a few speed bumps.

262
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,706
It takes work.
But it doesn't mean we don't love each other.

263
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,225
-Good.
-Okay, I'll see ya.

264
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,356
-All right.
-Bye.

265
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:10,592
You hear that, Ryan?
Love takes work.

266
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,998
-Are you referring to me and Marissa?
-No. I'm staying out of that.

267
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:16,112
You go work on
your cool bonfire.

268
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:22,771
-Me and Oats are gonna order in.
-Hey, can I borrow Captain Oats?

269
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:26,065
Sure. But he's a poor
substitute for a broken heart.

270
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:33,183
Oats, if he touches you
anywhere weird,

271
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,004
and by weird I mean...

272
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:40,465
I want you to neigh
as loud as you can.

273
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:47,901
See, you're punching people.
That's very last year.

274
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,273
It's cool, though.

275
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:56,958
What?

276
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,588
It's nice to see you,
too, sweetie.

277
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,917
Whoa, hello?
I haven't been vaccinated.

278
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:06,184
-What do you want?
-Well, I thought that we could talk face-to-face.

279
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,372
-May I come in?
-No.

280
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:10,234
Don't you think you're
taking this a little too far?

281
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,782
You enjoy living in squalor?

282
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,711
Well, you and Caleb don't live here,
so it can't be that disgusting.

283
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,288
-I could make you come home.
-What are you gonna do, call the cops?

284
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,713
I'd love to tell them
all about you.

285
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:21,490
-I could take away your credit cards.
-I'll get a job.

286
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:25,123
-You? Doing what?
-Or maybe I'll just steal. You know I'm really good at that.

287
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,917
Marissa.
Come home, please.

288
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,361
Don't throw away your future
just because you hate me.

289
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:39,230
We've all done things in life that we regret,
but it is never too late.

290
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,479
-The door is always open.
-Not this one.

291
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,164
Hey, you're in my room.

292
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,559
Which never happened
when we were dating.

293
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,347
I hope I'm not interrupting.

294
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,062
What, are you trying on
new clothes or something?

295
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:10,034
No, actually,
I've been trying on clothes from last year.

296
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,530
Come in.

297
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:14,755
Hi. What's going on?

298
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:18,813
I know this is weird,
but, I need your advice.

299
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,730
It's about Marissa.

300
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,940
Well, I'm a little fuzzy
on your guys' relationship,

301
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,426
so perhaps you have some photos
or a video or things you...

302
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,539
I was just trying to be
thorough.

303
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:36,736
It's not about me and Marissa.
This is about Marissa and Ryan.

304
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:39,978
I just...
I have a sense about them.

305
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,110
-Yeah, I have a lot of...
-Oh, so there is something going on?

306
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:47,065
Hey, if you were this sensitive and neurotic when
we were dating, things might have really worked out.

307
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,733
I just... I really, really
have fallen hard for this girl.

308
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,032
Please, will you just tell me
if I am fighting for a lost cause here?

309
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,532
Are they just one of those couples
that will always be a couple?

310
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:03,583
Is this about the other night
at the mall?

311
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,083
What, no.
I know all about the mall, why?

312
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,779
Okay, so then, big deal.

313
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,255
They slept in a tent together.
A lot of friends would do that.

314
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,010
I'm sorry,
did you just say "tent"?

315
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,531
Does that...
did you think I said that?

316
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:17,774
No, no,
'cause I said...

317
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,827
what did you think?
No, 'cause I was saying

318
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,301
-that they repented for lent.
-Marissa forgot to mention that part.

319
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:25,193
-Probably because it wasn't a big deal.
-Well, thank you, you've been very helpful.

320
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,715
Wait, I wasn't even trying
to meddle. I was saying...

321
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,477
Summer's gonna kill me.

322
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,742
-Oh, come in.
-Great. Thanks.

323
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,836
Sorry about the mess.
We're between maids.

324
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,561
Ah, how do you survive?
So where's...where's Alex?

325
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,045
-working.
-Got it.

326
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:16,323
Just us.

327
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,373
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Okay.

328
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:23,810
Let's see.
Da-da-dum!

329
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,934
-Captain Oats?
-Yeah, Seth let us borrow him for the bonfire.

330
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,475
Oh, we're not gonna burn
him, though, are we?

331
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,243
No, no. He's our inspiration.

332
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,601
I figure we'll build a scale model so we'll
know how much wood to use for the real thing.

333
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:39,443
-Oh, a Trojan horse.
-Exactly. So, what do you think?

334
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:43,638
I think it's perfect.

335
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:51,903
Yeah, it's not bad.
So let's get started.

336
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,660
How are you with
Popsicle sticks?

337
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:57,083
Really good.

338
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:16,528
-You got a warrant?
-You're not suspicious, are you.

339
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,167
I'm Sandy Cohen.
I'm Julie Cooper's attorney.

340
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:22,089
And I'm a huge
fan of your work.

341
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,701
-You got my money?
-I'm here to negotiate.

342
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:30,900
Is this gonna be a three-way?
'Cause my rate doubles.

343
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,899
Why don't you grab some
more smokes at the store.

344
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:33,696
We got business.

345
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:44,086
You know the offer. 500 grand
makes this thing go away.

346
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,632
Oh, well, that's no offer, that's extortion.

347
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:50,349
She's willing to pay you $50,000, which could
finance a handful of your masterpieces.

348
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,211
You need to add another zero
to that offer.

349
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:56,132
Otherwise this thing is streaming live
on the Internet in 72 hours.

350
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:59,139
-Do you really think anyone's gonna care?
-Oh, I think Julie will.

351
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,427
Enough to save her magazine, her marriage.

352
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:08,152
-Well... you'll be hearing from me.
-It's been a pleasure.

353
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:12,773
-This is gonna be great.
-Ah, glad you liked it.

354
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:15,738
Yeah, and I'm glad Seth
suggested you for the job.

355
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,987
-Seth suggested me?
-Yeah. Why?

356
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:24,090
No, he's, kind of stuck in the past.

357
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,477
He thinks that now that
he's back with Summer, that...

358
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:28,596
you know.

359
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,829
-Yeah. Crazy.
-Totally.

360
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,026
Yeah.

361
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,184
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

362
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,813
You almost hit me.

363
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,098
I'm sorry, I'll try again.

364
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,992
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let me try to put it in a way you'll understand.

365
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,064
Stay away from her.

366
00:24:05,381 --> 00:24:07,067
-Alex, there's nothing going on.
-What're you talking about?

367
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,176
Studying late together?
Sharing a sleeping bag?

368
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:10,860
Yeah, there's nothing
going on at all, Ryan.

369
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,386
Hey! Hey! Listen to me...
No, no, no. You listen to me.

370
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,917
Don't go near my
girlfriend again.

371
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:19,331
You understand me now?

372
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,539
-Walk away.
-I'm gone.

373
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:45,081
-Ah, I'm sorry I missed you last night.
-I'm sorry I missed you, too.

374
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,103
The all-consuming magazine.

375
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,988
-And you were...?
-Also at work.

376
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:53,352
On a new case.
Another Newport calamity?

377
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,614
No. This is one
I've never seen before.

378
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:57,750
I hope to never see it again.

379
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,931
Hey, how about you and I log
a little quality time today?

380
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:06,344
-I'd love to, but I have to work.
-Ah, with Carter Buckley?

381
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,668
Actually, without.

382
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:10,125
It turns out that Newport Living
wasn't for him after all.

383
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:13,973
When he didn't show up for work yesterday,
I went by his place, and I found him

384
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:17,104
drowning in self-pity and tequila.

385
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,777
Only a couple weeks in Newport
and already his spirit is crushed.

386
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:23,461
I never would've thought that'd be possible.
Here's a guy who built a whole magazine

387
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,885
around people who fought the system, no matter the cost.

388
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,038
The guy was
an inspiration to me.

389
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,145
You know, that magazine of his
that you loved in college?

390
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,629
Do you happen to have a copy?

391
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,687
Revolution?
Yeah, I probably do.

392
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:40,733
Probably in the office
Or the garage.

393
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,362
Hey, man. How'd it go
last night with Marissa?

394
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,090
Things with Marissa
went great.

395
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:52,857
Good.

396
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,253
Things with Alex,
not so much.

397
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,286
-Alex was there?
-Yeah.

398
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,265
She threw a beer
can at my head.

399
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:06,186
-What?!
-And shoved me a couple times, yeah.

400
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:10,166
-Pretty hard, actually.
-That is one angry lesbian.

401
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,180
Okay,
here's the thing.

402
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:22,617
I may have accidentally let a
little something slip about, you know...

403
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,750
-A tent?
-No, I didn't. Yeah, okay, maybe. Yes, I did,

404
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:28,503
-but I don't understand why she's making
-such a big deal out of it.

405
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,822
Like there's something dirty about camping.

406
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,838
And before Alex and I had
our friendly little chat,

407
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:34,753
Marissa mentioned that it was your idea
that we work on the bonfire together.

408
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:36,973
I might have been
the one to mention it,

409
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,436
-but I don't think I should hog all the credit.
-Stay out of it!

410
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:44,013
Just 'cause you're back with Summer
doesn't mean me and Marissa...

411
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,174
I know.

412
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,549
-You were just a lot happier back then, okay, so...
-Well, that was then.

413
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:52,839
All right.

414
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,225
Hey, I'm not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

415
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:18,523
But, uh, the wood's ordered, and
you have the plans, so everything should be fine.

416
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:20,098
Have fun.

417
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:28,204
-Who was that?
-My mom.

418
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,470
More empty threats.

419
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,750
You were asleep last night when I got home.

420
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:36,602
Yeah. Yeah,
I was really tired.

421
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:39,780
You should try sleeping
in a tent with Ryan.

422
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,843
Oh, but you already did that.

423
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,236
Look, I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you that.

424
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,993
It's just, I didn't want
to make it a big deal.

425
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,203
-Well, it wasn't until you lied.
-I didn't lie.

426
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:55,510
-I just...
-Lied?

427
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,862
No big deal.

428
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,057
Please tell me
you have some good news.

429
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:14,785
Well, unfortunately, Lance is
as sleazy as he looks...

430
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,487
but not as dumb.

431
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:19,696
He owns the rights to the movie
in perpetuity,

432
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:24,704
and you were a consenting adult when it was shot,
so if he wants to make money off it, it's his prerogative.

433
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,342
Sandy, there's got to be
some way to stop him.

434
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:29,870
Yeah, we could charge him with
extortion and get an injunction,

435
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,483
but that would involve
the authorities.

436
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:35,822
Even if I paid him off, there's nothing
to stop him from leaking it anyway.

437
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,274
Look, I'll figure
something out.

438
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,914
You worry about Marissa;
I'll handle the rest.

439
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:43,831
I can worry all I want,
doesn't seem to help anything.

440
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:49,338
Why is it that the one person who knows what's best
for their childis the last person that child wants to hear from?

441
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:52,505
Yeah, we had a similar situation
with Seth last summer, and...

442
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,943
all I can say is that sometimes
it's not the message, it's the messenger.

443
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,722
I don't know, Coop, it sounds
like a pretty bad fight.

444
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:26,393
-I mean, maybe you should just move home.
-I can't

445
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:29,529
Because you love Alex and
wherever she is, that's your home?

446
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,597
Because it'll make
my mom too happy.

447
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:36,098
What was I thinking?

448
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:41,629
Well... you can't go to the
bonfire with Ryan, then go home to Alex.

449
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:44,299
You can't ride two horses
with one ass.

450
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:46,542
It's a proverb.

451
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:50,341
Okay, well, Ryan is not
going to the bonfire.

452
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,627
What? Why? I thought
it was, like, his idea.

453
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,113
He didn't say,
but I know it's because of Alex.

454
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,388
Wait, I'm confused--
I thought Alex wasn't going.

455
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:02,328
She's not, but Ryan and I were working late
at the apartment the other night,

456
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:05,597
and, well, somehow she found
out about the mall and the tent, and...

457
00:30:05,808 --> 00:30:07,696
well, I hadn't exactly
told her about it.

458
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,826
Well, if you didn't tell her,
then who did?

459
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,753
Oh, I am going to kick his ass
back to last year!

460
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,287
Whoa. Hello? Summer?
Whose ass?

461
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:26,285
Not now, Seth. I'm busy.

462
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:31,846
sorry to interrupt you
doing... whatever it is you were doing.

463
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:33,209
Brooding, is it?

464
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:36,436
Yeah, and right now I'm in the middle
of a major session, so if you could just...

465
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,475
What's going on?

466
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,097
Well, actually, I'm very glad that
I caught you before you go to the bonfire.

467
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:46,407
-I'm not going to the bonfire.
-Oh, but you have to go.

468
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:48,375
What, are you and Seth
working on the same team now?

469
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:52,350
No, I'm on my own mission:
I need help... with Marissa.

470
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:56,954
For whatever reason that I don't
quite understand, she listens to you.

471
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,342
She needs help.

472
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:00,586
Maybe she's happy
where she is.

473
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:03,191
Do you honestly think that
Marissa knows what she wants right now?

474
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:06,797
She is in so far over her head
with this relationship.

475
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:09,075
She's skipping school,
she's staying out all hours,

476
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,845
risking everything that's
important to her just to prove a point.

477
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:17,467
-Okay. So what do you want me to do about it?
-Well, I know that she wants to come home,

478
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,688
but if she does it for me, it's like she's letting me win.
But if she does it for you...

479
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,331
No, I'm not getting in the
middle of Marissa's life.

480
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,847
All right? Not again. And especially
her relationship with Alex.

481
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:32,100
This is not about Alex. It's about Marissa and her
future, which we can both see is slipping away from her.

482
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,985
Ryan, please help me.

483
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,683
Convince her to come home.

484
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:42,589
You know that's
what's for the best.

485
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,603
What the hell
are you doing here?

486
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:02,476
Looking for Marissa.

487
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:06,208
-This is you staying away?
-It's not about me. I'm here 'cause of her mom.

488
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,712
What, are you and Julie Cooper a team now?

489
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,693
-Yeah. Where is she?
-She's at her little bonfire.

490
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,698
All right.

491
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,978
No, no, you remember what I told you last night.

492
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,325
-You stay away from her.
-Or what?

493
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:18,750
-You want to find out?
-Sure.

494
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,353
You go down there, it's on.

495
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:22,386
Great.

496
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,801
You know, this sort of thing
used to be my specialty.

497
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:33,363
Oh. Little word of advice. If you got to try
this hard, it's not working.

498
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,977
Is this part for the hind legs or the front?
It's just labeled "leg."

499
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,914
Um, front, I think.

500
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:02,003
-Right or left?
-Guess. The odds are fifty-fifty.

501
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:07,384
Marissa,the horse's head
seems to only fit the hindquarters.

502
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,279
What do we do?
We're running out of time.

503
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:12,358
I don't know, okay?
I picked the font for the banner.

504
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:16,251
I color-coordinated the balloons.
This is not my area of expertise.

505
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:17,872
Maybe I can help.

506
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:23,386
-I thought you weren't coming.
-Yeah, well, Captain Oats was concerned that he'd be well-represented.

507
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:26,231
He's very self-conscious.
He is... Seth's horse.

508
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:29,317
-So you gonna stick it out?
-Uh, yeah, if I'm needed.

509
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,425
Oh, yeah. Hang on!
Hey, everybody?

510
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:36,803
This is Ryan.
He's gonna answer any and all of your questions.

511
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:53,524
All right! Great. That horse is gonna
have its head up its ass if we're not careful.

512
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:55,643
We need to rotate the neck
over to the other side.

513
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:57,884
You guys in back. You guys take care of that.

514
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,956
I need you ladies,
right over there, you need to hoe that area.

515
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,703
Hoe that thing down. We need to, uh, we need
to set the tiki torches over here.

516
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:07,000
Hey! You with the gasoline!

517
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:09,188
Away from the fire!
What are you doing, man?

518
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:11,964
All right!

519
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:16,016
Sun's gonna be down in about an hour.
We can make this happen, okay, people?

520
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:16,990
Let's go, let's go!

521
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,356
Well, that was a dirty trick.

522
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,152
Haunting me with my past.

523
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:32,088
I was trying to inspire you.
You know, looking this thing over,

524
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:34,535
it feels like a lifetime ago.

525
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,379
What was I thinking, making
a magazine all about losers?

526
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,394
Well, at least
they were lovable ones.

527
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,938
Where'd you find this?

528
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,976
Oh, a crusading idealist who remembers every word
of that magazine like it was yesterday--

529
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,980
my husband.

530
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,444
Well, I'll have to meet him.

531
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,769
So, what do you think?
You in?

532
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:10,612
You say subversive and irreverent,
I say Julie Cooper Nichol.

533
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:12,456
-Where's that leave us?
-Pretty much lost.

534
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:16,011
That's pretty much
my favorite place to start.

535
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:24,428
I've got an idea. Okay, it's not really my idea.
One of the other people from the magazine thought it up, but...

536
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,521
Summer.
Hey, how are you?

537
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:36,026
I hope you have some Motrin in the house,
'cause you are about to feel some pain!

538
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:39,967
-I just wanted everyone to be happy!
-Yeah, well, nice going 'cause now everybody is miserable!

539
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:42,239
You need to start apologizing,
starting with Ryan!

540
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:43,304
Okay!
Go!

541
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:49,975
Ryan? You around?
I'm here to apologize.

542
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,976
-He's not here.
-Yeah, I know, I can see that.

543
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:53,333
Well, where is he?

544
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:58,945
-You think he went to the bonfire?
-If so, we have a four-alarm emergency on our hands.

545
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:00,460
Break out your hose, Cohen!

546
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,909
-It's a metaphor.
-I know.

547
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:12,991
-You got me my money?
-I got this.

548
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,494
You're starting
your own film company.

549
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,995
What better star to hitch
my wagon to than Julie Cooper.

550
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:25,317
-So you're buying the film from me.
-The master, the film and the negatives.

551
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,165
We're gonna meet
your offer.

552
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:32,679
-A hundred bucks?
-Consider it a good-faith deposit.

553
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:34,253
I need two weeks
to raise the rest.

554
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:37,341
I sign this, I get
half a mil in two weeks?

555
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,146
That's right.

556
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,233
And Lance, just so you know,

557
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,509
if one frame of this
leaks onto the Internet--

558
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,949
I'm not saying that would happen
because you seem like a stand-up guy--

559
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,332
we're coming after you for
ten times the amount, all right?

560
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:57,338
For copyright infringement and piracy

561
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:07,056
and... you could go to jail.

562
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,716
I got some good news and some not-so-good news.

563
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:22,161
-Good news first, always.
-You don't have to worry about the movie surfacing

564
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,067
as long as we pay him,
which is the bad news.

565
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,115
And where am I gonna get
this money?

566
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:28,622
You're going to have
to talk to Caleb,

567
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,156
-and hopefully he'll understand.
-Oh, yeah, sure he will.

568
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:36,607
-I am so screwed.
-I know, I saw the footage.

569
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:50,811
-This is going great.
-Yeah.

570
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:57,881
-Not for long.
-Hey! What are you doing here?

571
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:03,128
-Are these your friends?
-Yeah. They're here to see Ryan.

572
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:04,691
You gotta be kidding me.

573
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,839
Why?
Do you think it's funny?

574
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:12,218
Hey, guys! Stop it!
Guys, seriously, stop it, okay? Cut it out!

575
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,610
Oh, no, not you guys.

576
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,948
You guys are great!
Go, Harbor!

577
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,907
This is between you and me.

578
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,459
Fine, then let's talk,
you and me.

579
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:29,409
-Fine.
-You've got wrist cuffs.

580
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:33,425
-You want to tell me what the hell is going on?
-I just want to talk.

581
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:38,090
You want to talk? Why don't you tell me why you
brought two skeezy ex-cons to my school bonfire?

582
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:42,252
I am sorry if I interrupted your bonfire!
It just seems like that's all you ever do lately!

583
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:44,744
Well, I didn't realize moving in
with you meant giving up my life.

584
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:48,815
I didn't ask you to give up your life!
All I ever wanted was to be a part of it!

585
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:51,682
Well, this
is my life, okay?

586
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:54,743
That's it.

587
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,719
So what do you think?

588
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,110
I think...

589
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:22,976
this is your life
and I don't fit in.

590
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:28,925
Pep rallies,
cheerleaders... boys.

591
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:31,339
Nothing happened with Ryan.

592
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:34,031
Yeah, not yet, but what do
you give it, a week? A month?

593
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,125
I really wanted this
to work between us.

594
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,717
Look, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

595
00:39:56,156 --> 00:40:00,559
I'm sorry that I brought two
skeezy ex-cons to your bonfire.

596
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,044
Actually, only one of them
ever really served time, but...

597
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:14,413
-So what happens now?
-Who knows?

598
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,077
I think I might go back home,
save some money, go back to school.

599
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,531
-Actually looks kind of fun.
-Yeah, from really far away.

600
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:52,457
Come on. We're gonna miss the human pyramid.

601
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:05,666
Pretty good, huh?
Not a school spirit thing, that's cool.

602
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,250
I'm sorry.
It wasn't about you.

603
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:17,279
That's okay.

604
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:36,324
-You okay?
-Yeah.

605
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,061
Now all that's left
is lighting the bonfire.

606
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,579
I don't hear any screaming.
I don't see any ambulances.

607
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:54,387
Maybe we're here just in time.
Or maybe someone was right all along.

608
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,874
Thanks.

609
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,340
You know what?
This honor's yours.

610
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,870
We built it together,
let's burn it together.

611
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:27,701
I think Captain Oats
would be very proud...

612
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:30,559
or deeply disturbed
by this visual.

613
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:34,483
You guys, it's so good.

614
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,889
Thanks, Seth,
for making it all happen.

615
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:40,626
Oh, see that? They're
thanking me. That's nice.

616
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:43,106
So what do you guys
want to do now?

617
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:46,407
Feel like going home?
