1
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:31,142
(singing)Well, I left New York 1949.

2
00:00:31,183 --> 00:00:35,225
(To)go across the country (wi)thout a dad-blame dime.

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Montana in the cold, cold fall.

4
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:42,642
Found my father in the gambling hall.

5
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,767
Father, Father where have you been?

6
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,142
Been out here in the world since I was 10.

7
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:56,933
Dear son, he said don't worry about me.

8
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,017
I'm about to die of pleurisy.

9
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:09,267
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara, home I'll never be.

10
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:16,933
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

11
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:22,767
For better or worse, through thick and thin.

12
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:26,933
Like being married to the little woman.

13
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,892
God loved me just like I loved him.

14
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,600
Wants you to do just the same for him.

15
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:42,725
Well, the worms eat away but don't worry, watch thewind.

16
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,433
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

17
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:51,225
So I left Montana in an ol'freight train.

18
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,850
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

19
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:03,516
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

20
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:11,808
Rode to Oklahoma, rode to El Cajon Rode to Tehachapi, rode to San Antone.

21
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:22,308
Home I'll never be Home I'll never be Home I'll never be.

22
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,183
ON THE ROAD

23
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:47,725
Got room for one more?

24
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,016
Yeah, sure, hop in.

25
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:50,141
There's room for everybody.

26
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:53,016
Alright.

27
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,850
Thanks, brother !

28
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,058
Whooooee !

29
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,433
Here we go !

30
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,891
Hang on, brother, hang on.

31
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,433
Where you guys from?

32
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,808
North Dakota.

33
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,183
We're headed for the harvest.

34
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,558
Thanks.

35
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,558
What about you?

36
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,058
Montana.

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,391
So, you going someplace, or you just going?

38
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,558
I guess I'm just going.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,558
You got any money?

40
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,516
I got enough for a pint of whiskey till we reach Denver.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,933
You reckon if we put them things in the ground, something will grow up?

42
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,641
(laughs)If I get hungry enough, I plan to eat them raw !

43
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,600
(laughs)I'll share them with you !

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,225
Aww.

45
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,641
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl.

46
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:18,766
She's sweet sixteen.

47
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:22,933
She's the prettiest little thing.

48
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:25,058
You ever seen.

49
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,641
I got a pretty little girl.

50
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:33,891
She's sweet sixteen.

51
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:38,433
She's the prettiest little thing.

52
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:40,308
You ever seen.

53
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:54,891
(All join)Oh I got a pretty little girl. She's sweet sixteen. She's the prettiest little thing I ever seen.

54
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,141
Five months earlier.

55
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,599
Leo Paradise loved many things.

56
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,933
Though part of him never left his native Quebec, when.

57
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:28,058
he moved to this country with his dear wife Gabrielle, heloved it with all his heart.

58
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,016
Now, he joins his departed son Gerard in a better place.

59
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,058
Are you all right?

60
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,262
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

61
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,691
I'm all right.

62
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,224
I'm good.

63
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,433
I first met Dean not long after my father died.

64
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,503
I'd just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about

65
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,934
except that it really had something to do with my father's death,

66
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,846
and my awful feeling that everything was dead.

67
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,599
"Let's go for a drink", says my buddy Sal.

68
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,349
But I show up and guess what — no Sal Paradise.

69
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,016
A boring, brooding mute has been inserted in his place.

70
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,183
Oh really, Carlo.

71
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,808
Well, what's there to talk about exactly?

72
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,766
The book I'm not writing?

73
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,099
The inspiration I don't feel?

74
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,558
Even the beer's flat.

75
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,183
I mean, look around, man.

76
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,433
Everything's stultified.

77
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:02,391
True, but these are temporary worries.

78
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,808
Life is long and wondrous and strange.

79
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,849
Look at me, Sal.

80
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,933
I'm full of inspiration.

81
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,474
My mind is a veritable echo chamber of epiphanies.

82
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:15,641
Dig it "The air is dark.

83
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,974
The night is sad...

84
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,391
I'll get you another beer !

85
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,349
Bravo, very nice, Carlo !

86
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,849
Chad.

87
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,058
I've been looking all over town for you hoodlums.

88
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:26,766
How you doing, man?

89
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:27,724
Listen, remember that thing?

90
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:30,349
Jailbird friend of mine from Denver?

91
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:31,641
The one that stole 500 cars?

92
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,558
The one I've been raving about?

93
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,683
He didn't think we really believed that, did he?

94
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,136
First reports of Dean came to me through Chad King,

95
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,503
who'd shown me and Carlo a few letters from him,

96
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,832
writtenfrom a Colorado reform school.

97
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,724
Come on man, let's go !

98
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,224
The great Dean awaits !

99
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,349
Dean had arrived in New York.

100
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:56,474
He'd just married a 16- year-old chick named Marylou.

101
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,266
New York, 1947.

102
00:07:59,016 --> 00:07:59,766
Come on, gentlemen.

103
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,183
One more.

104
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,224
Well, now, look who's at my doorstep, old Chad King !

105
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,266
How's it going, cowboy?

106
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:27,891
I'm Sal.

107
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,641
Sal.

108
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:30,433
Strong grip.

109
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,391
Yes, yes, yes !

110
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,433
Sal and Carlo, the writer pals.

111
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,891
I've heard all about you gone cats.

112
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,349
We're going to orient you into the Nietzschean ways of the big bad city.

113
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:42,141
And smoke your weed, of course.

114
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,557
Well, yes, we got plenty of that !

115
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,891
Marylou, why don't you get on the ball and make us some coffee?

116
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,891
My writer friends are here Come on in.

117
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:50,641
Hey hey !

118
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,432
Take your shoes off.

119
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,432
Yeah?

120
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,182
No, I'm just kidding.

121
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:02,786
(singing) Cry to hear folks chatter

122
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:09,455
And I know you cheat

123
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,063
Right or wrong don't matter

124
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:16,011
When you're with me, sweet...

125
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,391
Yes...

126
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,849
You'll never get this one.

127
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,397
(singing)Yipra (and continues)

128
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:26,686
That's not a song.

129
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,432
Yipra (etc.

130
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,182
Slim Gaillard

131
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,432
Yes, yes, yes !

132
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,224
Slim it is.

133
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:38,849
Dean.

134
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,682
Some of us need the occasional doughnut to survive

135
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,807
Ah, "the occasional doughnut".

136
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,724
I just love this gal !

137
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:46,391
Yipra !

138
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,807
And wake up, Chad King.

139
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,266
Thanks.

140
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,641
It's nice to have someone paying attention.

141
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,724
I mean, it's really nice having someone pay attention !

142
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,474
You know, I never met a girl before who could roll tea.

143
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:21,599
Oh yeah?

144
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,016
Yipra...

145
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:30,891
My friend !

146
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,516
(Book title) Swann's Way

147
00:10:54,474 --> 00:11:01,224
The day before my father died, he took hold of my hand and he looked at it.

148
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:07,391
And he said, "You got no calluses, Sal.

149
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,516
That's because you don't do any real fucking work, boy !

150
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,849
"Oh, yeah?

151
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,599
Yeah.

152
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,641
My old man's still lost.

153
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:28,266
Just wandering the hobo streets of Denver like...

154
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,766
like shit.

155
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,849
To the old men

156
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,224
Yeah.

157
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:52,266
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

158
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,682
And to the West.

159
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,474
There you go

160
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:54,182
It wasn't only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted to know Dean more.

161
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:58,390
But because somehow he reminded me of some long lost brother.

162
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:05,807
In the West, he'd spent a third of his time in the pool hall, a third in jail, and a third in the public library.

163
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:20,307
All my New York friends were giving their tired, bookish political or psychoanalytical reasons for being in the negative.

164
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,307
But Dean just raced in society.

165
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,932
I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me.

166
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,557
Oh yeah

167
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,182
Here's a cat who can really bend his girl, man !

168
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,932
Do you even know what we witnessed right there, Sal?

169
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,890
That tenor-man has it.

170
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:55,432
You see, he starts with the first chorus, then lines up his ideas, rises through his fate, and then suddenly, somewhere in the middle of the chorus, he gets it.

171
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,099
Everybody looks up and knows.

172
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,599
Time stops.

173
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:05,253
He has to blow across bridges and come back with such infinite feeling for the tune of the moment,

174
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:08,340
that everyone knows that it's not the tune that counts, but it.

175
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:14,640
"It-man", can I buy you that drink?

176
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,765
Make that three.

177
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,099
I'll buy you one.

178
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,807
Alright.

179
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,099
Thanks What's your name, man?

180
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,724
(laughs)They want to know my name !

181
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,348
There's some boys from work.

182
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,890
Hi, boys from work.

183
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:54,973
Howdy.

184
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,223
So, where was I?...

185
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,432
So there's this whore house.

186
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,932
There's this monkey at the door.

187
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,807
So you...

188
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:09,932
you place your bet in the cage, you know, and the monkey rolls the cage around, and the dice roll out...

189
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:14,765
And if you win, you get the girl for free.

190
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:21,348
But if you loose to that monkey, you gonna get your backside "bitched" !

191
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:23,640
By the monkey !

192
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,307
Now that's an evolution.

193
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,765
"Sodom andGorilla".

194
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,140
I ain't telling no lie !

195
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,057
That's cool.

196
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,348
So what is it like being with a white woman?

197
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,932
I always wondered.

198
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,640
I'd say it's like...

199
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:47,223
You never been with a white woman before?

200
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:50,432
(No...) Been with a white man.

201
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,640
Ozone Park, Queens.

202
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,723
Come in, man.

203
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,848
Memere !

204
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,598
C'est l'bon gars que j'tai parle.

205
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:02,932
Le chum a Chad, de Denver.

206
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,265
Howdy'do, Ma !

207
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:05,098
Hello.

208
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,057
You look just like her.

209
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,057
Come on, man.

210
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,973
Where's Marylou?

211
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:11,807
Oh, man.

212
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,932
We get into a big ruckus, so she calls the cops on me.

213
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:18,015
Then she whores a few bucks together and heads back to Denver.

214
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,015
Whoa, really?

215
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:19,848
Yeah.

216
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,973
You know, I'm planning on heading back, too.

217
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:24,348
When?

218
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,598
You know, soon.

219
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,932
Anyways, before I go, I absolutely have to learn how to write from you.

220
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:31,932
Well, I'm honored, man, but I...

221
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:32,598
Show me how !

222
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:33,640
Alright?

223
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,765
I want to learn.

224
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:35,848
Teach me.

225
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:49,557
Alright, then.

226
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,765
Alright, let's see.

227
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,307
"The cowboy thinks I'm some kind of genius.

228
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,723
He's leaning over my shoulder right now.

229
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,265
We gotta forget the Western stuff.

230
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:14,015
Turn ourselves into the Eastern jazz.

231
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,057
What about.

232
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:15,432
Hey.

233
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,265
I was walking down 125th street and suddenly I stopped.

234
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,265
I looked at everything in amazement.

235
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:35,456
It was like I'd just woken up from a dream that had lasted my whole life,

236
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:39,584
and I realized that God isn't somewhere out there in Heaven, he's right here.

237
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,682
Yes.

238
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:41,765
In the dirt.

239
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,223
He's an ape like us.

240
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,598
Buh.

241
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:56,348
And I shambled after as usual, as I have done my whole life, after the people that interested me.

242
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,890
'Cause the only people that interest me are the mad ones.

243
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:13,223
The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn and say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like Roman candles across the night.

244
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,931
BUS TRAFFIC ANNOUNCEMENT
... service from Albany and Poughkeepsie...

245
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:32,140
is now arriving at door number 3...

246
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:31,348
Come on.

247
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,265
Yes, Ma'am.

248
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,098
Where did you get the suit?

249
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,973
11 dollars on 3rd av'.

250
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:38,765
Come on, guys, concentrate.

251
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:48,348
Let's see.

252
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:54,306
For you.

253
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,431
And I'll keep this one.

254
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:03,681
Sal, Sal, Sal

255
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,640
I'll miss you guys.

256
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,848
To the West-orooni !

257
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,098
To the West-orooni.

258
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:16,515
Don't forget to write, Carlo.

259
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:17,848
Don't do anything I wouldn't do !

260
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:22,473
I will.

261
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,390
Alas, alas, Sal.

262
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,181
It's not me, I'm drunk.

263
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:33,848
But my soul talking direct soul language, so to speak, to my deepest blood brother and holy goof—that's you.

264
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:39,931
And to be formal and analytical about it, let me objectify the characteristics I miss the most of you.

265
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:42,140
Number 1 your conversation.

266
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:46,056
Number 2 your brotherly smile, man.

267
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:52,056
But I shall go on, so to close and get the gist Denver waits for you.

268
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:58,015
Carlo in his damp grotto and clowned misery —to use a paradox of expression— waits for you, so get on it !

269
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:01,348
Be quick and hurry to me, no delay.

270
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,431
Long dash.

271
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,348
Bring Paradise to Denver.

272
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,265
Bring Paradise to Denver.

273
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:11,890
And I love you as ever.

274
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,181
Dean.

275
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,348
Drunk.

276
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,973
With the coming of Dean Moriarty, began the part of my life you could call "My life on the Road".

277
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:52,473
Before that, I'd often dreamed of going West —always vaguely planning but never cutting out.

278
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,098
I was a young writer, trying to take off.

279
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,348
43 W80 C degrees in Clarion...

280
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,389
Dawson County, Nebraska.

281
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,431
Now what species are you?

282
00:23:58,514 --> 00:23:59,306
Traveler.

283
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:01,889
I appreciate the lift.

284
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,139
... It might be your last !

285
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,306
I'm freighting dynamite.

286
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:15,931
You looking for that toe?

287
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,764
They amputated it this morning.

288
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,598
You can't smoke, but you can drink in this car.

289
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,931
Alright Thanks.

290
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,431
"Follow me, I'm right behind you.

291
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,556
" Did it hurt?

292
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,098
I don't recommend it !

293
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,389
voice of (low) Shoot I gotta take me a piss.

294
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:00,848
A truck with a flat board at the back with about six or seven boys sprawled out on it.

295
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,473
Piss call.

296
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,348
Woo-ee !

297
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,181
Here we go !

298
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,931
-yelled the kid in the baseball cap.

299
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,973
We been riding this son of a bitch since Des Moines !

300
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:12,764
These guys never stop!

301
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:19,806
Every now and then you have to yell for piss call, otherwise you have to piss off the air and hang on brother, hang on!

302
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,181
Denver, Colorado

303
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:31,431
Thanks a lot, guys

304
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,723
N IN THE STREET (low) I know, it's.

305
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,681
I hope you're not paying rent on this place !

306
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,931
(laughs)Oh, my angel-headed Sal is here at last !

307
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,098
Good to see you.

308
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:04,931
You, too.

309
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,306
So, what are you doing?

310
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:07,931
I mean.

311
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:10,764
What exactly are you doing?

312
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,931
I am vacuuming at May Company by day.

313
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:15,889
Uhmm...

314
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:16,722
Impressive.

315
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:17,389
... I know.

316
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:21,139
And chasing our beloved, feral, mad dog by night.

317
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,514
And where is Dean?

318
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:22,931
What's the schedule?

319
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,514
So, I got off work a half hour ago.

320
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,389
At that time, Dean is screwing Marylou at the hotel.

321
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:32,181
At one sharp, he goes from Marylou to Camille, the new girl.

322
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:37,639
Of course, neither knows what's going on, but he screws her once, giving me time to arrive at 130.

323
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,764
Then we go out for our unfinished business until 6 in the morning.

324
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:43,972
"Unfinished business"?

325
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:50,347
Dean and I are trying to communicate with absolute honesty and completeness everything in our minds.

326
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,056
We do it on Benzedrine.

327
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:55,276
And then at 6, he goes back to Marylou and spends the rest of the day

328
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:57,651
running around trying to sort out the necessary papers for the divorce.

329
00:26:57,806 --> 00:27:01,389
All that he wants to do is go back to San Francisco and marry Camille.

330
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,014
It's sick !

331
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:05,222
And I bet she's incredibly ugly.

332
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:08,347
Like Helen of Troy with a fucking brain.

333
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:12,889
What are you doing?

334
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:14,806
(whispers)Camille really hates me right now.

335
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,556
Why, Sal !

336
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:23,806
(laughs)Yes, you've arrived !

337
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,931
You finally got on that old road, didn't you?

338
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:27,764
I did.

339
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:34,139
Look here, Camille, it's my good buddy Sal from New York.

340
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:39,056
Sorry for not getting up, Sal, but I wasn't expecting company at this hour.

341
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:40,014
I'm sorry.

342
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:40,847
I should leave.

343
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:46,847
It's Sal's first time in Denver and I think it's absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.

344
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:47,806
Right now?

345
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,931
I should be back no later than 314 for our hour of reverie, darling.

346
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,097
Works all day, runs around all night.

347
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,847
He never eats, he never sleeps...

348
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:56,764
Ain't she something?

349
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:57,889
The man thinks he's Superman.

350
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:58,847
Yeah.

351
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,306
As I said, not 3 but 314.

352
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:05,931
Now are we straight in the most wonderful and deepest depths of our soul, dear darling?

353
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:10,222
Is he offering me a choice?

354
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:12,514
I don't think he's offering you a choice, no.

355
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:17,264
Hee-hee !

356
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,972
Yes.

357
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,514
You look like a smart guy.

358
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,347
I bet you're wondering what he sees in me, huh?

359
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,556
Respectability?

360
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:35,889
Very good.

361
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,306
I'm impressed.

362
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,597
Let's go to work, babies.

363
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:44,264
So now that you're sleeping with half of Denver, are there any girls left for me?

364
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,097
Well now listen here, Sal.

365
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,556
I know a girl named Rita and Rita cannot wait to meet you.

366
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,222
We'll go there at once !

367
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,389
I thought we were going to talk.

368
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,889
Yes, yes, after.

369
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,681
If you want to know my true nature, at this moment?

370
00:28:56,722 --> 00:28:59,889
I'm one of those people who goes around showing his cock to juvenile delinquents.

371
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:03,139
(Sal laughs)Oh, these Denver doldrums...

372
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:06,181
Isn't he the finest, smartest fellow in the world?

373
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:22,014
You know that old guy?

374
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:24,847
I thought it was my pops.

375
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,056
Carlo, wait up !

376
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,181
Voila.

377
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:42,972
Darling.

378
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:46,305
Bless me father, for I will sin.

379
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:54,014
Yum, yum, yum

380
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,305
It's nice to have you boys.

381
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,722
What's so funny, my boy?

382
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,014
I'm checking my pulse.

383
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,305
Round two-sie, here we go !

384
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:19,430
It happens.

385
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,222
My hands...

386
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:24,972
Mine does.

387
00:30:45,430 --> 00:31:13,722
I was filled with guilt.

388
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,597
I thought he said she was my girl.

389
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,722
Nothing for you or me, Sal.

390
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,097
Everything and everyone for that faithless bitch !

391
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,305
Guess who I hear !

392
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:33,014
Carlo, come on.

393
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:33,639
No.

394
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,097
Come on.

395
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:34,305
No.

396
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:34,930
Come on.

397
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:35,430
No.

398
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:35,930
Come on.

399
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:37,347
No no no no no

400
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:39,472
Sal No No.

401
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:40,389
Sal Argh .

402
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:45,472
Rebop Sal, come on.

403
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:48,222
Yeah-oh...

404
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,139
No clothes party.

405
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,055
You enjoying?

406
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:08,722
Yeah, but now I'm finishing up my degree here in Denver.

407
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:11,972
Dean told me you do, uh, set design...

408
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,555
Set design, yeah.

409
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:14,680
That's interesting.

410
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,555
The one I enjoyed most designing was, uh, "Desire Under the Elms".

411
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:19,764
It's a great play.

412
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:20,639
Yeah.

413
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,097
Eugene O'Neill.

414
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,764
Yeah, I know it's Eugene O'Neill, Carlo.

415
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:25,680
Thank you.

416
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:29,555
There's like a rusty nail scratching across my goddam spinal cord.

417
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,639
Dean, "I've got the world on a string"?

418
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,014
Yes, you do.

419
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:02,847
Come on !

420
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:07,305
Don't tell me you New York intellectuals don't dance

421
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:14,472
(Ella Fitzgerald) I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.

422
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,805
Got the string...

423
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:29,597
around my finger... Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love...

424
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,222
You didn't say you had a nice voice.

425
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:39,055
I don't have a nice voice.

426
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,055
Yeah.

427
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:41,597
Yeah, you do.

428
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,972
Thanks.

429
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,805
Are you staying in Denver very long?

430
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,722
I got the feeling I won't be staying very long.

431
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:57,888
Yeah.

432
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,638
"Not enough hours in the day.

433
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:02,513
"Right.

434
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,388
then.

435
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,097
singing along.

436
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,972
What a world, what a life, I'm in love...

437
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:25,176
(reading)"Assuming for yourself the sorrow of my body

438
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:28,591
Thus, when you solace me in my desire

439
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:32,966
I held your body, and lay beside it sleeping

440
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,887
Feeling the pain of your own inward fire"

441
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:39,180
"Weeping myself to hear your silent weeping" .

442
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,472
Has Dean read this?

443
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:53,472
I've gotten so crazy over Dean that all his stupid friends call me "Carlo in Wonderland".

444
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,305
Clever, huh?

445
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:56,388
Ah, yes...

446
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:02,680
They don't understand this is the first time actual sex has been...

447
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:05,847
part of my relationship with a man.

448
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,180
This is how you love.

449
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm not in fucking wonderland.

450
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:16,680
I know it's not a man he wants.

451
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:19,847
I even told him we can take sexuality out of it, just...

452
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:24,638
"Be with me, man.

453
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:28,263
Hold me.

454
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,597
Just call me."

455
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:37,722
And he always promises, "Yes, Carlo, yes, man - I'll call you.

456
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,763
I'll call you."

457
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,763
Who the fuck am I kidding?

458
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:45,138
I can't even call what I feel "a heartache", it's too banal.

459
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,263
"Melancholy" is too languorous.

460
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:51,930
"Grief" is closest.

461
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:56,305
I'm 21.

462
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:59,597
By the time I'm 23 I'm going to write one great poem.

463
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,847
Then it's all over for me.

464
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,847
Sal, I'm leaving.

465
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:13,472
I'm going to Africa.

466
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,472
A la Rimbaud, non?

467
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:17,763
I might jump ship at Dakar.

468
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:19,722
I'm gonna smoke opium.

469
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,805
And I will pick up dark, mysterious men.

470
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,180
And they will love me.

471
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:41,763
I really wish I could drink whiskey like a man.

472
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,555
I know those guys are like, "Hey, do a shot !"

473
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:07,471
Home in Missoula, Home in Truckee, Home in Opelousas, Ain't no home for me.

474
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:15,433
Home in Ol'Medora, Home in Wounded Knee, Home in Ogallala, Home I'll never be.

475
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,513
Excuse me, miss.

476
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,013
I can't seem to find an empty seat anywhere.

477
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,346
May I?

478
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:52,680
If you wish.

479
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:05,471
I'm Sal.

480
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:08,305
Terry.

481
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,513
Selma, California.

482
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,096
No tienes hambre?

483
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:29,305
Que pasa Papa?

484
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,555
You want to love me now?

485
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,096
Cesar 1,20.

486
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:45,304
Matilde 1,10.

487
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,554
Terry 1,15.

488
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:55,846
Terry.

489
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,763
Sal 1,05.

490
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:00,679
Sal.

491
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:06,346
Maria 1,15.

492
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:08,388
You growing roots?

493
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,138
Jasmine 1,10.

494
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:27,554
The harvest is ending, and it's getting much colder in the nights.

495
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:31,096
Terry and I bitterly decided we'd have to leave.

496
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:38,013
She was supposed to come to New York in a month with her brother, but we both knew she wouldn't make it.

497
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:43,554
I can feel the pull of my own life calling me back.

498
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:46,096
I still have a book to write.

499
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,846
(very low)We screw one more time, then you leave...

500
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,263
See you in New York, Terry !

501
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,096
Wait.

502
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:30,013
Thanks.

503
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,179
You know what they did to me in that prison?

504
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:39,054
Solitary confinement, and a Bible.

505
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,637
I used it to sit on the stone floor.

506
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,147
But when they seen that I did that, they took away that Bible,

507
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:49,498
and they brought back a little pocket size one, like so big, and I couldn't sit on it.

508
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:53,221
You know why I been in prison my whole life?

509
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:58,887
When I was 13 years old, I was in a movie with a boy, and he makes a crack about my mother.

510
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:01,137
You know, that dirty word.

511
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:04,596
So I take out my jackknife and I cut up his throat.

512
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:07,429
I would have killed him if they hadn't drug me off.

513
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:13,387
The judge says "Henry, you know what you were doing when you attacked your friend?

514
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,304
" I say, "Yes sir, YourHonor, I want to kill that son-of-a-bitch.

515
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:19,304
" And I still do.

516
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:35,637
Bah !

517
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,679
J'suis revenu rien qu'd'un morceau, memere !

518
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,262
Penses-tu qu'fa m'fait quelqu'chose ?

519
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,762
Vieille sorciere !

520
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,596
It was over a year before I saw Dean again.

521
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:06,346
I stayed home most of the time, struggling with a half- finished manuscript on my desk.

522
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,429
Bored with all of it.

523
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:20,060
RECORD SONG I used to love you But it's all over All over now.

524
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,471
Sal's sister's house, North Carolina, December 1948.

525
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,679
Ma, on behalf of Nin and I, I just wanted to say that.

526
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:33,346
"ton gateau est fantastique !"

527
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:36,012
Thank you Hey, eh, eh.

528
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:42,679
Listen to this General Douglas MacArthur bans kissing on the streets of Tokyo.

529
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,679
Who does that puritanical old fart think he is?

530
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,304
Sal.

531
00:45:57,012 --> 00:46:00,721
Ho, ho, ho Oh hello, merry, merry…

532
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,429
Dean, I'll be goddamned !

533
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:04,179
You're early...

534
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:04,971
Yeah, well...

535
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,512
Shit Who's in the car?

536
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,762
Oh, it's Marylou and my good pal Ed Dunkel.

537
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:12,971
Anyways we need a place to clean up immediately.

538
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,096
Man, we're dog tired.

539
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:14,971
Sure.

540
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:16,137
How did you get here so fast?

541
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,429
That Hudson goes !

542
00:46:17,471 --> 00:46:18,596
Yeah?

543
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:19,971
Where did you get it?

544
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:21,971
I bought it out of my savings.

545
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:26,262
I was working as a breakman on the Southern Pacificmaking 400 bucks a month.

546
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,429
And guess what?

547
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:30,179
I'm a father now !

548
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:31,929
What?

549
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:33,471
You and Marylou?

550
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,679
No, not Marylou.

551
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:35,512
Camille !

552
00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:38,929
I annuled Marylou, hitched up with Camille, and now we have a sweet little Amy.

553
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:41,471
And a nice little pad in 'Frisco.

554
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:46,054
But as God as my witness, Marylou is the only honey- cunt I'll ever adore.

555
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:48,887
That makes perfect sense.

556
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:53,179
Dunkee !

557
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:55,596
Dig this, Sal.

558
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:58,762
Crazy Cat gets married and dumps his wife off in Tucson !

559
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,721
Come in, come in.

560
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:04,637
Holy shit.

561
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,346
We really appreciate this, man.

562
00:47:06,346 --> 00:47:08,429
There's no heater in that California car.

563
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:11,095
We haven't eaten in 30 hours.

564
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,679
Or slept in a bed since...

565
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,637
Denver?

566
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,012
We don't have a penny, one.

567
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,804
Good times on the Dean Express, huh?

568
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,012
Well, there's lots of food inside for everybody.

569
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,012
Oh great, thanks.

570
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:23,679
Look at all them books.

571
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:27,095
Hi.

572
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:27,679
Hey.

573
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,554
How are you Marylou?

574
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:31,929
I'm fine.

575
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,095
But I gotta tell you how nice it is to see a sane face.

576
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:40,679
Well, uh, sane is a very relative term around here, kid.

577
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,012
Don't call me that anymore, because that bastard aged me.

578
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:46,220
Isn't that a great game to grab ass !

579
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:50,054
If you want food, it's on the left.

580
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:57,304
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

581
00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:05,364
Ma, to repay your gregarious hospitalities and all the trimmings on this fine day of holiday giving,

582
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:09,756
I will drive you and Sal up to old mad New York so you won't have to pay for a train.

583
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:13,554
How about that, Ma?

584
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:18,679
Ok...

585
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:23,804
S.
sorry.

586
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:39,137
You don't know that feeling, man.

587
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,804
I stole a .

588
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:50,720
38 and I sat in the car, gun on my temple for 14 hours, Sal, trying to pull the trigger and I couldn't do.

589
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:54,595
And I'm sweating.

590
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,762
And I'm nauseous.

591
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:59,220
And Camille finds me this way, and I beg her to do it.

592
00:48:59,262 --> 00:49:00,970
To kill me.

593
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:03,679
And she couldn't, man.

594
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,012
I don't know what's wrong with me.

595
00:49:10,054 --> 00:49:14,845
I do all these dumb things and I think in all these distorted ways, you know, I'm burning up.

596
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,095
I'm scared I'm gonna lose all the wisdom I ever learned, Sal.

597
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:35,845
You know, I see a girl and I just, ... you know, I just tremble all over and I get lost !

598
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:38,554
Like a couple weeks ago.

599
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,595
I meet this black boy, right?

600
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:46,804
He's 25 and he's staying with his sugar mama, and we're digging some great music and we're getting high.

601
00:49:46,845 --> 00:49:49,054
And then I meet the greatest gone gal, Suzie, right.

602
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:50,304
Oh, Suzie !

603
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:52,762
And I swear she's a virgin.

604
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:57,368
So I take her back to the black boy's place and 3 hours later she's getting a little drunk,

605
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,282
and the greatest show in the world starts, you know.

606
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,262
And she does this dance for us.

607
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:06,141
She takes off her panties, she leaves on her dress, and she stands on her head and she does the splits,

608
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:08,549
you know, and she's screaming the whole time "I want your cock !"

609
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:10,679
right, "I need your cock !"

610
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,715
And she goes over next to the bed and she spreads the black boy's knees open

611
00:50:13,716 --> 00:50:17,882
and pulls out his big black beauty and starts chugging on that, going on that thing, really going at it.

612
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:23,179
Spreads the black girl's knees open and starts going down on her big black hairy muff, you know.

613
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,595
Getson the bed and does a whole other miraculous splits, you know.

614
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,929
Comes over to me, swallows me up.

615
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,304
Grabs the black boy's ears, pulls him down on her.

616
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:35,054
Black girl grabs me and its a goddam four-way orgy, Sal.

617
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,387
Goes on for four fucking hours.

618
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,553
God And I missed this?

619
00:50:46,637 --> 00:50:47,553
Yeah.

620
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:54,970
Yeah.

621
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,553
It's good to have family, isn't it?

622
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,262
Goddammit !

623
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:46,776
You see, one day that little kid's gonna throw a rock through a guy's fucking windshield

624
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:49,495
and he's going to crash and die all on account of that little piss-pants?

625
00:51:50,428 --> 00:51:51,178
See what I mean?

626
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,845
God exists without qualms.

627
00:52:05,512 --> 00:52:06,470
South Hill, Virginia.

628
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:12,053
<i>Coming up next Mike Sullivan covers the weather for your......</i>

629
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:19,428
<i>going to be up for some low...</i>

630
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,012
Stop.

631
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:35,887
Que c'est qu'il fait ?

632
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:37,803
Hein ?

633
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:39,512
Comme dit le President Truman .

634
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:42,137
"We have to cut down on the cost of living."

635
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,178
Whooooaooo !

636
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,720
Man, oh, man, we must absolutely findsome time for kicks in New York !

637
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,887
Carlo's back from Africa.

638
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,137
We all get to see Carlo first thing in the morning, darlings.

639
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,178
Lady, you shouldn't let your son drive that fast in these conditions.

640
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,678
You're in my state, you slow down.

641
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:31,762
I'll pay you back every cent, Ma.

642
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:34,970
Oh, you're fucked now, Dean.

643
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,637
But all I'm saying in the sincerities of my soul is that I miss you, darling, and I'll be right back in those arms.

644
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:50,012
(over the phone) Look, I got your postcard from Denver.

645
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:51,428
Do you think I'm an idiot?

646
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,803
I know Denver means Marylou.

647
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:54,178
Marylou who?

648
00:53:56,387 --> 00:53:57,512
Come on, Sweet Cakes.

649
00:53:57,553 --> 00:53:59,303
You know there are certainties our minds can grasp.

650
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:00,845
(over the phone) Oh shut up!

651
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,095
I never want you back!

652
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:03,262
Don't you dare come back here!

653
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:04,345
Ever!

654
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:30,595
This is the new and complete Dean, grown to his own definition of maturity.

655
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:34,761
I say to myself, "My God, he's changed!

656
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:38,345
" Fury spits out of his eyes when he tells of things he hates.

657
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:41,970
Great glows of joy replace this when suddenly he gets happy.

658
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:45,053
Every muscle lives to twitch and go.

659
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:47,345
Sal

660
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:52,720
Yeah?

661
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,928
Phone for you.

662
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,678
Thanks.

663
00:54:57,095 --> 00:54:57,720
Hello?

664
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,511
(over the phone)Sal Paradise?

665
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:01,511
Bull calling you from New Orleans.

666
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:02,511
Bull Lee?

667
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,345
How the hell are you?

668
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:08,011
Well, we have ourselves a situation that needs immediate rectifying.

669
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:11,553
I've got a girl down here just showed up on my doorstep.

670
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:18,845
This Galatea Dunkel is looking for some clown named Ed Dunkel, and I don't know who the hell these people are.

671
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:22,178
Uh, Galatea and Ed are friends of Dean's from Denver.

672
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,095
Oh, shit Dean ...

673
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:29,011
Well, she wants to talk to you.

674
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:31,136
Make it fast, would you?

675
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:34,095
The telephone cartels don't do this for free.

676
00:55:38,053 --> 00:55:39,511
Hello, its Galatea.

677
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,970
Is Ed there?

678
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,011
Uh, Ed's fine, but he's sleeping.

679
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,220
Well, would you please tell him to come and get me.

680
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,011
Mr. Lee and his wife don't seem all that happy to have me around.

681
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:56,053
And I should kill Ed for what he did to me, dumping me here like this !

682
00:55:56,095 --> 00:55:59,761
And he's simply got to come and get me as soon as he can !

683
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:04,553
He's got to help me, these people are mad They're mad!

684
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,553
Well, we'll be there right after New Years.

685
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,595
Thank you.

686
00:56:16,636 --> 00:56:18,053
Mmm hmm.

687
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:21,928
(singing) Dynamite!

688
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:27,595
Look at that !

689
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:28,803
Oh my !

690
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:54,970
I'm telling you, she's cross-eyed.

691
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,053
She's not looking at you, it's me.

692
00:56:56,095 --> 00:57:02,470
I was twenty days at sea in the doldrums, uh, when I decided to kill myself.

693
00:57:02,511 --> 00:57:06,720
And I realized that shit, I haven't written a fucking suicide note !

694
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:10,013
I'm going over, you know, searching my mind for the right words,

695
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:14,151
and then I saw all of the crew coming out onto the deck,

696
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:15,837
and I couldn't jump anymore.

697
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:20,678
But, in that moment, I resolved to follow my heart.

698
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,345
To live.

699
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:23,303
Yeah.

700
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:25,470
To experience the wisdom of life,

701
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,011
Yes.

702
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:31,428
mad with ecstasy and vengeance and truth.

703
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:35,803
I'm glad I did, because otherwise I would have missed out on this amazing pot.

704
00:57:37,511 --> 00:57:38,261
So !

705
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:44,136
On that, on that note, everybody move their feet like you feel something, like you're alive !

706
00:57:45,053 --> 00:57:45,969
Like we're alive !

707
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:53,344
And on that, I want us to raise our glasses, being alive, (Yeah ) to living, and to life.

708
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,928
and others To life(All cheer)

709
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,469
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

710
00:57:59,511 --> 00:58:02,386
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

711
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:05,636
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

712
00:58:07,386 --> 00:58:08,928
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

713
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,428
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

714
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:24,803
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

715
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:27,844
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

716
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,553
Where do you find such absolutely wonderful people?

717
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,386
I've never seen anyone like that.

718
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:49,594
She's the real mad one !

719
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:20,761
with Seven !

720
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:21,511
Six !

721
00:59:21,553 --> 00:59:22,469
Five !

722
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:23,261
Four !

723
00:59:23,303 --> 00:59:24,011
Three !

724
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:24,761
Two !

725
00:59:24,803 --> 00:59:25,636
One !

726
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,719
Happy New Year(cheers)

727
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,344
1949 !

728
00:59:31,386 --> 00:59:33,136
Happy New Year !

729
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,969
Love you as ever, Sal.

730
00:59:35,011 --> 00:59:35,886
Whatever man.

731
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:36,511
Love you.

732
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:36,928
Love you.

733
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:38,053
What have you got?

734
00:59:52,928 --> 00:59:53,803
Hell of a night !

735
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:55,511
Happy New Year ...

736
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,178
I love you...

737
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:05,886
Sal, I have something to ask of you, very important.

738
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:06,844
Uh-uh.

739
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:08,511
I wonder how you'll take it.

740
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:11,428
We're buddies, aren't we?

741
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:15,094
Yeah?...

742
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:17,928
Carlo's apartment, Harlem.

743
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,261
Sal said yes, my darling.

744
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,178
Sal, that's great.

745
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,219
Well, hop in, the water's fine.

746
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:45,303
What?

747
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,636
Fuck, I can't do this !

748
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:31,469
Come on, man.

749
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:32,594
You promised.

750
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:34,552
Do you really want to do this, Marylou?

751
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:37,844
She thinks it's swell.

752
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:52,844
What?

753
01:01:52,886 --> 01:01:56,052
Now, come on now, we have to just all goddam relax !

754
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:58,302
Dean.

755
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,011
Can you go wait in the kitchen?

756
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,677
Like now, please?

757
01:02:15,052 --> 01:02:17,302
Honey, he just wants to see what it would be like.

758
01:02:19,177 --> 01:02:22,469
I told him that I wouldn't do that with any guy (whispers) but you.

759
01:02:31,386 --> 01:02:33,219
Well, you can still change your mind.

760
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,177
(Sound of Marylou and Dean having sex)Very good.

761
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,927
(off) Gee.

762
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:22,552
Write that down.

763
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:23,677
I got it.

764
01:03:27,844 --> 01:03:30,844
So Ed, why did you abandon Galatea in Tucson?

765
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:32,344
She's your wife.

766
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:37,011
What are you doing wandering around the country like this?

767
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:42,094
Dean, why did you leave Camille and pick up Marylou?

768
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:44,219
What are your womanly intentions?

769
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:49,552
And, what is this mad obsession you have with him?

770
01:03:52,302 --> 01:03:54,677
(laughs)What is this mad obsession you have with him?

771
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:57,719
Touche !

772
01:03:59,886 --> 01:04:01,844
Days of wrath are coming my friends.

773
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:05,094
This high you're on is a mirage.

774
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:10,844
You're all going to go flying off to the West Coast and come crashing down to earth.

775
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:13,052
Like this, Carlo?

776
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:16,552
Yeah, Dean.

777
01:04:18,552 --> 01:04:19,802
Exactly like that.

778
01:04:19,844 --> 01:04:21,677
Alrighty, who's hungry?

779
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:40,802
We were leaving confusion and nonsense behind, and performing our one noble function of the time move.

780
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,760
New Orleans and ol'Bull Lee.

781
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,969
Then West.

782
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,844
It would take all night to talk about ol' Bull Lee.

783
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:54,094
Let's just say now he was a teacher.

784
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:57,802
And he had every right to teach, 'cuz he spent all his time learning.

785
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:17,719
Now listen darling.

786
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:24,052
You know that I'm capable of everything at the same time, and I have unlimited energy.

787
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:30,052
So now when we get back to San Francisco we must absolutely go on living together.

788
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,302
I know just the place for you to live.

789
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:39,260
I'll be home every night and be at Camille's by the morning.

790
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,344
We've done it before, see, she'll never know.

791
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:57,677
<i>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause.</i>

792
01:05:57,677 --> 01:06:03,094
<i>It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce.</i>

793
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,844
<i>Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral...</i>

794
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:08,219
Shit.

795
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,302
Ed, slow down.

796
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:11,302
Underpants.

797
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:29,927
Do you guys think you can rush through here as fast as you want 'cuz you're from California?

798
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:33,427
Don't worry officer, we're heading back to California.

799
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,052
I need everybody to step out of that car, please.

800
01:06:45,094 --> 01:06:46,052
How old are you, young lady?

801
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:48,094
I'm eighteen.

802
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:50,385
Who's that guy you're with?

803
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:51,885
My husband.

804
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,885
I've got the certificate right in the back if you want to see it.

805
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:00,802
Who you all in such a hurry to see out there in California?

806
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:03,510
My wife.

807
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,052
Your wife?

808
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:10,344
This one here just said she's your wife.

809
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,802
She's my ex-wife.

810
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:16,385
What the hell you doing with your ex-wife?

811
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:17,760
You're going out to see your wife !

812
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:18,635
That's not important.

813
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:19,177
Hey boy !

814
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:22,302
You gonna waltz in here and tell me what's important?

815
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:37,635
It's gonna be 25 dollars for speeding.

816
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:38,594
Or what?

817
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:43,844
Or I can run you in right now and slap a special California-boy charge on your ass.

818
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:44,635
Yeah?

819
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:45,469
What charge?

820
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,010
Don't you worry about it, wise guy.

821
01:07:59,344 --> 01:08:01,052
That guy's got it so goddam easy !

822
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:03,010
They'll out and shoot you if you complain, too.

823
01:08:03,052 --> 01:08:04,844
I wish I had a fucking gun !

824
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:08,218
Dunkel, you are not driving anymore.

825
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,968
Marylou, spread those knees and lets smoke some weed.

826
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:38,177
It was my father's.

827
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:42,385
It works.

828
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:53,135
Thanks a lot.

829
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:04,385
Flomaton, Alabama

830
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,177
<i>Don't know...</i>

831
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:09,872
<i>When it comes to buying a gift or it comes to buy a present, </i>

832
01:09:09,873 --> 01:09:12,365
<i>I never have to wonder, I never have to thunder.</i>

833
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,125
<i>If it's a wedding present, if it's an engagement present, if its a shower,</i>

834
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:19,891
<i> it it's a husband who wants to buy his wife something, I know exactly what to say...</i>

835
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:21,718
<i>I go to...</i>

836
01:09:22,802 --> 01:09:24,927
Like President Truman says.

837
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,635
"You have to cut down on the cost of living."

838
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:29,927
Yes, yes we do.

839
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:52,135
I'm telling you it's true Sal, I started at 9.

840
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:54,635
With a girl named Millie Mayfair !

841
01:09:54,677 --> 01:09:57,760
That's when my old man was barbering a bit still.

842
01:09:57,802 --> 01:10:03,260
Oh honey Marylou, if only I'd known you then, how sweet you must have been at 9 !

843
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:06,343
Hey, here's another one for you Sal.

844
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:09,510
One time I jumped a freight from New Mexico clear to LA.

845
01:10:09,593 --> 01:10:10,468
And I was 11.

846
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:15,927
I lost my father along the side, and we were staying in a hobo jungle and I hadn't seen him for months.

847
01:10:15,968 --> 01:10:20,954
So, by the time I get to LA I'm so starved for milk that I get a job right in the dairy

848
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:24,489
and straight off drink 2 quarts of heavy cream and just puke

849
01:10:27,885 --> 01:10:29,593
Poor, tragic Dean

850
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:06,093
So Dunkel, I suppose you're happy to get back to your wife.

851
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:24,010
Algiers, Louisiana

852
01:11:39,385 --> 01:11:40,176
Bull?

853
01:11:43,343 --> 01:11:44,010
Jane?

854
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:48,260
Hello?

855
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:07,968
Bull?

856
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:17,468
Bull?

857
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:23,760
Bull?

858
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,843
That sounds like the angel Sal Paradise.

859
01:12:35,676 --> 01:12:36,468
How are you?

860
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:41,885
Fair.

861
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:52,635
Hi Jane !

862
01:12:54,593 --> 01:12:56,260
We finally brought Ed Dunkel with us.

863
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,843
Is Galatea home?

864
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:02,968
Excuse me.

865
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,135
Lizards.

866
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,010
Ed?

867
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:30,301
Hi, Galatea

868
01:13:32,176 --> 01:13:33,843
Get out of my sight !

869
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:35,551
You're an animal !

870
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:38,385
I guess I'll go help the missus sweep the tree.

871
01:13:38,426 --> 01:13:40,301
Ass !

872
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:43,801
You're Sal, right?

873
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:45,968
It depends.

874
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,801
Do you know what these bastards did to me?

875
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:51,926
Dean leaves his wife and baby penniless because he wants to visit you.

876
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:55,260
And Ed, being a sheep wants to tag along.

877
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:56,885
Only they have no money !

878
01:13:56,926 --> 01:14:01,051
So Ed asks me for the money, and I say, "I'm not giving you any unless we're married."

879
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:04,426
And Dean says, "Hey, Ed, stupid ass.

880
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:05,676
Marry the broad !

881
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:06,885
"No, I do love you too, honey...

882
01:14:06,885 --> 01:14:07,385
Shut up !

883
01:14:07,718 --> 01:14:09,301
So he marries me for gas fare !

884
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:12,347
And we get in the car, and Dean drives like Satan,

885
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,698
smoking marijuana the whole way,

886
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,026
and they won't even let me stop to use the ladies room.

887
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,718
And when I say something about it, they dump me in Tucson. In Tucson!

888
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,676
Come on, Galatea.

889
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:27,010
I mean.

890
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,426
Dean will be dead some day and then what can you say to him?

891
01:14:29,426 --> 01:14:30,801
The sooner he's dead, the better.

892
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,385
Where were you going?

893
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,801
Can't I watch you guys screw?

894
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:42,801
Honey, I'm sorry.

895
01:14:42,801 --> 01:14:44,468
A week, a couple of weeks.

896
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,010
I just thought...

897
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:45,885
You just thought what?

898
01:14:45,926 --> 01:14:48,218
You could just leave me here in this house with strangers?

899
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:08,719
"Old woman, old woman, old woman, quoth I, "

900
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,159
"Oh whither, oh whither, oh whither so high "

901
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,124
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky"

902
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:17,652
"Shall I go with thee?"

903
01:15:20,093 --> 01:15:21,384
I would go with her.

904
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:25,836
We could go together, and we could brush the cobwebs from the sky.

905
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:28,676
"By and by, by and by."

906
01:15:28,718 --> 01:15:31,509
What the hell has he ever done to anyone?

907
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:34,426
Well, he drove my mother halfway across the country.

908
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:35,468
Did he?

909
01:15:35,509 --> 01:15:36,301
Yeah.

910
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:38,468
Nah...

911
01:15:39,884 --> 01:15:43,468
Dean does not feel responsibility towards others.

912
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:45,343
He does not know the concept.

913
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:51,509
Then again, he feels others have some mysterious obligation to support him.

914
01:15:52,384 --> 01:15:53,634
No, I'm OK, Bull.

915
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,051
I find it unspeakably distasteful.

916
01:15:57,093 --> 01:16:00,301
But Dean gives everyone a damn good time just being himself

917
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:02,259
He gives illusions.

918
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:03,259
Tricks.

919
01:16:03,301 --> 01:16:07,801
Maybe that's because you're not seeing what's really holy about Dean.

920
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,509
So he's a holy man now !

921
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:13,343
A religious figure in your eyes !

922
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:14,968
Argh, Paradise ...

923
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:17,801
Aren't you a pretty little bird?...

924
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:20,593
What I see in him is compulsive psychosis.

925
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:25,176
Dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence.

926
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:36,301
Well, young man, I do believe the cocktail hour is upon us.

927
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:43,426
Now this nation is dead in its soul and we do nothing.

928
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:47,051
All we do is wait, for the end to come.

929
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:49,176
See?

930
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:49,801
She knows.

931
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:52,176
The female always knows.

932
01:16:52,218 --> 01:16:55,759
And the end of the world will start here, too.

933
01:16:55,843 --> 01:16:57,551
In Texas.

934
01:16:58,343 --> 01:16:59,218
Louisiana.

935
01:17:00,926 --> 01:17:03,468
Louisiana and Texas.

936
01:17:05,468 --> 01:17:07,593
This is an outstanding martini.

937
01:17:07,634 --> 01:17:09,676
Yes.

938
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:11,593
May I?

939
01:17:11,634 --> 01:17:13,051
Please.

940
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:13,801
MmmMmm.

941
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,176
That is an outstanding martini.

942
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:32,468
You know that a bat, when they suck the blood out of things squirrels, and...

943
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:33,843
Dad, draw a face.

944
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,426
Dad draw a face.

945
01:17:35,468 --> 01:17:43,343
They got teeth, long teeth, that's what they stick in the squirrels and then they suck the blood out of them.

946
01:17:43,384 --> 01:17:45,509
What's their names?

947
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:50,759
I think, uh, Lorraine is a good name for a bat.

948
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:52,509
That's Lorraine

949
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:57,634
I need some wings on it like that, ain't that right, you little beast?

950
01:17:57,676 --> 01:17:58,935
Here the toes.

951
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:02,464
I'm gonna sell it for a lot of money.

952
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:03,465
Money...

953
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:38,967
Translation is indeed treason.

954
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:40,467
I got him.

955
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:42,342
In English you got him saying "fingers rummaging...

956
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,217
person...

957
01:18:43,259 --> 01:18:44,217
in his pockets".

958
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:46,634
Celine did not write that.

959
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:51,009
He wrote, "Hands in assholes and pockets."

960
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:52,134
Uh.

961
01:18:55,217 --> 01:19:01,842
Well, um, if you could push it away from here.

962
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:04,259
Away, um, the crumbs.

963
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,717
So, how's it been with Ed?

964
01:19:07,759 --> 01:19:10,551
I don't know how to do it.

965
01:19:11,801 --> 01:19:13,509
How to make him happy.

966
01:19:15,592 --> 01:19:18,176
Oh, it's simple really, honey, all you have to do is...

967
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:25,842
Okay, I'm.

968
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:29,301
Here is you, here's him, right here.

969
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:31,009
palm of your hand.

970
01:19:31,051 --> 01:19:34,926
I mean, with mouth, but he'll be in the palm of your hand.

971
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:36,842
Boys always love that.

972
01:19:36,842 --> 01:19:39,051
You'll love it too, I promise.

973
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:43,426
Merci

974
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:53,717
Now, something can and should be done to eliminate the black seed of noxious effluviants gestating in our unsuspecting gut.

975
01:19:53,759 --> 01:19:57,592
I give you the orgone accumulator !

976
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:02,426
Captures the vibratory atmospheric atoms of the life principal.

977
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:06,467
Folks get cancer 'cuz they run out of orgone.

978
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:07,801
Come on !

979
01:20:07,842 --> 01:20:09,426
You gotta try it with me.

980
01:20:09,467 --> 01:20:11,884
It'll put some juice in your bones, I'm telling you.

981
01:20:11,926 --> 01:20:17,592
I always rush up and take off 90 miles to the nearest whore house !

982
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:24,092
All right, oh hey, look at that, see how big he got?

983
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:28,176
See that, not an inch of cancer !

984
01:20:32,009 --> 01:20:32,926
Let's crank her up.

985
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:37,509
And don't let the cocksuckers get you down

986
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:39,217
Looks like a fucking closet

987
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:49,509
The purity of the road.

988
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:58,176
The white line in the middle of the highway unrolled, and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove.

989
01:20:58,217 --> 01:21:00,592
Dunkel, Dunkle, who's gonna shepherd you now?

990
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:02,967
Here are a couple bucks for you.

991
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:04,759
You know you don't have to do that, Bull.

992
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:06,509
It's alright, it's only money.

993
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:07,759
Thanks.

994
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:08,967
Don't forget to write !

995
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:10,051
I won't.

996
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:11,176
Bye, brother.

997
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:14,842
Dean, you keep her out of the ditch !

998
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:26,259
And zoom went the car!

999
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:28,217
And we were off again - for California.

1000
01:21:57,426 --> 01:21:59,176
Hey, listen to this one, Sal.

1001
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:03,176
"'Not caring for their lives' is it?

1002
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:05,908
Why, what in the world is there that we should care

1003
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:10,899
for if it is not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time."

1004
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,134
What do you think about that one, Sal?

1005
01:22:19,175 --> 01:22:20,050
Welcome.

1006
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,009
I'll be right with you.

1007
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:21,425
Thanks.

1008
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:44,550
Willcox, Arizona

1009
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:10,759
Can't you wait 'til we're in Frisco?

1010
01:23:14,134 --> 01:23:15,134
I don't care.

1011
01:23:15,134 --> 01:23:17,300
Dean's gonna leave me anyway.

1012
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:21,717
When are you going to go back to Denver?

1013
01:23:24,509 --> 01:23:25,259
I don't know.

1014
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,342
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1015
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:29,509
I could go back to my fiance.

1016
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:32,842
Fiance?

1017
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,300
He's a sailor.

1018
01:23:35,342 --> 01:23:37,634
He's been away awhile.

1019
01:23:37,675 --> 01:23:38,509
He's.

1020
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,134
he's nice.

1021
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:40,509
That's good.

1022
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:47,092
I wish Dean wasn't so crazy now.

1023
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:49,092
You could be wishing that the rest of your life !

1024
01:23:51,884 --> 01:23:53,050
I just want a house.

1025
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,467
A baby.

1026
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:57,884
You know, something normal.

1027
01:23:57,925 --> 01:23:59,592
I really do want that.

1028
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:14,425
I just had a great idea, you guys are gonna love it.

1029
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:17,634
Is everybody absolutely comfortable?

1030
01:24:29,884 --> 01:24:30,884
You alright Sal?

1031
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,217
(Yeah.

1032
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:04,350
"For it always happened when I woke like this and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt

1033
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:11,118
to discover where I was, everything would be moving around me through the darkness, things, places, years.

1034
01:25:11,675 --> 01:25:15,342
My body still too heavy with sleep to move."

1035
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,092
How much money you got, kid?

1036
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,258
Nothing.

1037
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:41,758
But I got an aunt in Tulare, California.

1038
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:45,508
She owns a grocery store and as soon as we get there, I'll have money for you all.

1039
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:52,925
Yes, yes, we all got aunts, well let's go jump in back, let's see the aunts and uncles and grocery stores all away across the road to get our kicks.

1040
01:25:55,258 --> 01:25:55,883
I'm Alfred.

1041
01:25:55,883 --> 01:25:56,592
Sal.

1042
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:57,300
Hi.

1043
01:25:57,342 --> 01:25:57,967
Marylou.

1044
01:25:58,008 --> 01:25:58,633
Hi.

1045
01:25:58,675 --> 01:25:59,092
Alfred.

1046
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:09,258
Hot damn, I left Bakersfield in a travel bureau car, left my guitar in the trunk of another one.

1047
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,550
It never showed up.

1048
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:13,342
Guitars and cowboy duds.

1049
01:26:13,383 --> 01:26:14,800
How much you got?

1050
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,300
How much you want?

1051
01:26:30,508 --> 01:26:34,758
I knew a man, he forgave his wife for shooting him and got her out of jail.

1052
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,633
Only, she shoots him a second time !

1053
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:42,717
That's a good one

1054
01:26:43,383 --> 01:26:45,467
Hold on to your girdles

1055
01:26:49,092 --> 01:26:50,633
Baby !

1056
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:03,133
Yes, yes, yes

1057
01:27:34,092 --> 01:27:39,694
(singing) Had my finger on the trigger so long

1058
01:27:40,614 --> 01:27:44,789
Seems like I'd shoot again by now

1059
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:51,553
So hard when you can't stand the sound

1060
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,687
I gathered your remains, cleaned up the stains

1061
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:04,477
I took care for we once were friends

1062
01:28:05,821 --> 01:28:11,364
But it's hard when you're burning in a hell

1063
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:20,517
And it's hard enough to be in love

1064
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:29,447
And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1065
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:47,925
San Francisco, California

1066
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:25,203
(low) Alright.

1067
01:29:29,836 --> 01:29:30,555
Go, hurry !

1068
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,225
Really, you better make it to Camille's in time for dinner so she can feed your lazy ass !

1069
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,516
Do you see what a bastard he is?

1070
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:13,058
By the end of the week, darling.

1071
01:30:17,183 --> 01:30:17,891
Thank you.

1072
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:19,808
Thank you.

1073
01:32:32,516 --> 01:32:33,808
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop !

1074
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:58,141
Darling Sal, I'm going back to Denver, to my fiance the sailor.

1075
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:00,433
No more road for me.

1076
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:03,599
Thanks for an amazing night, my sweet lover.

1077
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:07,349
Why don'tyou kick Dean in the ass if you ever see him again.

1078
01:33:07,391 --> 01:33:09,099
I love you.

1079
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:10,974
P.S.

1080
01:33:11,391 --> 01:33:12,558
Good luck with your book.

1081
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,058
What the hell you looking at?

1082
01:35:05,141 --> 01:35:07,558
Campbell, California

1083
01:35:47,838 --> 01:35:48,378
Yoshi.

1084
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:52,704
Brada.

1085
01:35:56,724 --> 01:35:57,433
Rodriguez.

1086
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:01,221
Luigi.

1087
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,641
Sal.. Shit, no. Oh oh oh

1088
01:37:15,391 --> 01:37:16,557
How the hell are you, man?

1089
01:37:16,599 --> 01:37:18,557
Better than you, my boy.

1090
01:37:18,557 --> 01:37:20,057
Have you eaten these last few months?

1091
01:37:20,099 --> 01:37:21,974
Not as much as you, fat ass !

1092
01:37:27,214 --> 01:37:28,849
Family man, huh?

1093
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:29,807
Yeah.

1094
01:37:32,016 --> 01:37:32,849
How's Camille?

1095
01:37:32,891 --> 01:37:34,641
She's good, she's just resting.

1096
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:36,807
Where's the Hudson?

1097
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:38,516
Yeah.

1098
01:37:38,557 --> 01:37:42,224
Man, it's so beat I had to leave it on Market Street for the vultures.

1099
01:37:42,266 --> 01:37:43,266
Oh, shit.

1100
01:37:48,099 --> 01:37:48,807
And Marylou?

1101
01:37:48,849 --> 01:37:51,932
That dumb little box married one of her sailors.

1102
01:37:54,016 --> 01:37:57,405
And he's threatened to kill me if he finds me, so I'm gonna have to defend myself

1103
01:37:57,406 --> 01:37:59,782
and kill him and go to San Quentin for life.

1104
01:38:00,224 --> 01:38:01,807
That would be the end of me.

1105
01:38:01,849 --> 01:38:03,516
Oh, come on

1106
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:09,266
How's your ma?

1107
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:12,016
Still waiting for that 15 bucks you owe her !

1108
01:38:14,724 --> 01:38:16,557
Yeah, one day...

1109
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,891
Guess what.

1110
01:38:18,891 --> 01:38:21,224
I'm gonna be a father again.

1111
01:38:21,266 --> 01:38:22,599
Really?

1112
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,266
Yeah.

1113
01:38:23,307 --> 01:38:28,849
Sweet little Amy, she can stand alone for 30 seconds, she's 22 pounds and 29 inches long.

1114
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:32,847
And I found out that she's 31 one fourth percent English,

1115
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:35,079
27 and a half percent German,

1116
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:38,479
27 percent Irish, 8 and three fourths percent Dutch,

1117
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,711
7 percent Scotch and one hundred percent wonderful.

1118
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:43,849
Yes.

1119
01:38:59,557 --> 01:39:00,557
Hush.

1120
01:39:06,849 --> 01:39:08,391
Ahh, heebie jeebies !

1121
01:39:08,432 --> 01:39:11,057
We gotta find ourselves some kicks.

1122
01:39:20,099 --> 01:39:21,307
Sal's here.

1123
01:39:21,349 --> 01:39:22,724
I heard.

1124
01:39:24,891 --> 01:39:27,182
He wants to take me out to hear some music.

1125
01:39:27,224 --> 01:39:28,516
You wish to come?

1126
01:39:29,891 --> 01:39:32,182
Who's gonna stay here and take care of Amy?

1127
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,432
Alright then, I'll just go.

1128
01:39:45,849 --> 01:39:50,307
Dean, don't make yourself feel better by asking me along

1129
01:39:51,015 --> 01:39:52,432
I'll be back in a little bit.

1130
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:09,099
Sal !

1131
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,474
By Marylou's cunt, it can't be !

1132
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:12,599
What?

1133
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,839
That's 1.10 a ticket and a dime each for the jackets.

1134
01:40:18,265 --> 01:40:20,057
Can I hear a vouchii?

1135
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:21,182
Vouchii !

1136
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:23,474
Can I hear a sharooni mo' mo' mo' mo' mo'?

1137
01:40:23,515 --> 01:40:25,765
Sharooni mo' mo'mo'mo'!

1138
01:40:25,807 --> 01:40:26,974
You left out one mo' !

1139
01:40:26,974 --> 01:40:27,849
Let me hear that last mo' !

1140
01:40:27,849 --> 01:40:28,390
Mo' !

1141
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:29,224
Mo'!

1142
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,015
No way

1143
01:40:33,765 --> 01:40:34,599
Yip-rok!

1144
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,849
Hereesi!

1145
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:10,599
Look at that, Slim knows time, Sal !

1146
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,432
He knows time !

1147
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:45,640
Thank you !

1148
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:50,974
But most important my sure-ooni mo' loves you !

1149
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:54,640
Goodness !

1150
01:41:54,682 --> 01:41:56,474
Oh my goodness !

1151
01:41:56,515 --> 01:41:58,370
You are the bee's knees.

1152
01:41:58,371 --> 01:42:01,434
Wanna take you home and wake up with fleas.

1153
01:42:01,435 --> 01:42:05,127
Please, say hello to my future ex-wife!

1154
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,099
Hey, Camille !

1155
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,640
Congratulations on the baby.

1156
01:42:31,724 --> 01:42:32,724
If you.

1157
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:34,057
Sal, excuse me.

1158
01:42:34,099 --> 01:42:35,807
Dean, I need to talk to you.

1159
01:42:41,057 --> 01:42:42,307
I want you to get out.

1160
01:42:43,599 --> 01:42:44,349
Just go.

1161
01:42:44,349 --> 01:42:45,057
Just get out.

1162
01:42:45,099 --> 01:42:45,932
Now, honey...

1163
01:42:45,974 --> 01:42:46,390
No.

1164
01:42:46,432 --> 01:42:49,849
You said you were going to take care of us and you were done fooling around.

1165
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:54,974
I know that look on your face, Dean.

1166
01:42:55,807 --> 01:42:56,765
You're bored.

1167
01:42:56,807 --> 01:43:01,015
You're sick of me, and you're sick of work, and the baby.

1168
01:43:01,057 --> 01:43:01,765
I wanna.

1169
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:05,973
I just want you to take your friend and get out of my house.

1170
01:43:15,807 --> 01:43:17,682
Do you realize how much I've given up for you?

1171
01:43:41,432 --> 01:43:44,557
I never want you back.

1172
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,348
I never want to see you again !

1173
01:43:56,432 --> 01:43:58,015
I'll see you very soon, I promise.

1174
01:44:00,182 --> 01:44:01,807
Don't you dare lie to her, too.

1175
01:44:01,848 --> 01:44:02,973
You're a liar.

1176
01:44:02,973 --> 01:44:04,557
You're a liar.

1177
01:44:06,973 --> 01:44:09,973
Liar... Liar...

1178
01:45:24,682 --> 01:45:29,223
I realized as we racked our brains for where to go and what to do, that it was up to me.

1179
01:45:33,015 --> 01:45:37,140
I counted my money and showed it to Dean and said, "Come to New York (with me)."

1180
01:45:37,182 --> 01:45:39,348
"Let's go to Denver first," he said.

1181
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,890
"This time we must absolutely find my father, Sal!"

1182
01:45:47,557 --> 01:45:48,890
Your signature here...

1183
01:45:49,098 --> 01:45:52,057
We're taking the semi-pristine Chrysler to Kansas.

1184
01:45:52,265 --> 01:45:55,390
Along with yourselves, there's a nice young married couple.

1185
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:58,390
We share the gas expenses equally among the five of us.

1186
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:01,973
Are we all copacetic on that score gentlemen?

1187
01:46:05,098 --> 01:46:06,057
Yeah.

1188
01:46:59,931 --> 01:47:00,723
Ola

1189
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:09,806
I'm very glad you have accepted my invitation to a few drinks after that perilous journey.

1190
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,390
Ah, no problem, amigo.

1191
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:17,848
Thank you.

1192
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:24,973
Hmm, whiskey

1193
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,723
I like young men like you.

1194
01:47:39,265 --> 01:47:42,223
You probably don't believe it, but, uh.

1195
01:47:44,515 --> 01:47:48,556
the truth is, I really don't like girls.

1196
01:47:48,598 --> 01:47:50,265
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

1197
01:47:50,306 --> 01:47:52,265
Excuse me.

1198
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:10,640
To tell you the straight deal, I sometimes had to survive the streets of Denver by working far into the night.

1199
01:48:12,598 --> 01:48:14,098
Yes, I can appreciate, uh...

1200
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:16,556
"Never leave a customer unsatisfied."

1201
01:48:16,598 --> 01:48:19,098
I had that tattooed on my ass.

1202
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:28,973
Perhaps there will be some money involved...

1203
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,265
Oh, yeah?

1204
01:49:01,598 --> 01:49:02,181
Ah.

1205
01:49:02,223 --> 01:49:03,806
Ah.

1206
01:49:03,848 --> 01:49:04,848
Jesus !

1207
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:23,473
Denver, Colorado

1208
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:42,181
You see?

1209
01:49:42,223 --> 01:49:44,848
You give them what they secretly want and they just panic.

1210
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,473
And here you go.

1211
01:49:55,515 --> 01:49:56,556
Club, extra mayo.

1212
01:49:56,598 --> 01:49:58,306
Enjoy.

1213
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:04,889
Look, I did it for us, man.

1214
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,139
I got twenty bucks off the old fag.

1215
01:50:36,223 --> 01:50:39,264
My old man, a little guy, Moriarty.

1216
01:50:39,306 --> 01:50:41,139
Known in these parts as "the Barber".

1217
01:50:41,181 --> 01:50:42,848
"Moriarty"?

1218
01:50:42,889 --> 01:50:44,223
No.

1219
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,639
Never heard of him.

1220
01:50:57,223 --> 01:50:58,264
Sorry, son.

1221
01:50:58,306 --> 01:51:00,139
I ain't seen your old man in.

1222
01:51:00,139 --> 01:51:01,723
I don't know how many years.

1223
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:45,723
New York, 1950

1224
01:51:54,723 --> 01:51:56,681
How long have we known each other?

1225
01:51:56,723 --> 01:51:58,139
5 years?

1226
01:51:58,181 --> 01:51:59,264
5 pretty good years.

1227
01:51:59,306 --> 01:52:00,389
Who are we now?

1228
01:52:00,473 --> 01:52:02,181
Who are we, yes?

1229
01:52:02,223 --> 01:52:03,098
Who are we now?

1230
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:04,514
ah, a simple question.

1231
01:52:04,556 --> 01:52:06,139
Are you gonna tell us, Carlo?

1232
01:52:08,223 --> 01:52:09,264
I know I'm 23.

1233
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:16,556
I know that I rely on my friends and my family for money...

1234
01:52:16,598 --> 01:52:17,764
Ah, ah.

1235
01:52:17,806 --> 01:52:19,264
Join that club, please !

1236
01:52:19,306 --> 01:52:20,889
I know I will.

1237
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:22,556
I know there's no gold at the end of the rainbow.

1238
01:52:24,098 --> 01:52:26,806
There's just shit and piss.

1239
01:52:26,848 --> 01:52:30,223
But to know that, that makes me free.

1240
01:53:13,639 --> 01:53:15,973
<i>You come in contact with social controls.</i>

1241
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:21,639
<i>With custom, with moral code, and with law.</i>

1242
01:53:21,723 --> 01:53:26,223
<i>The town or city in which you live has laws which control you.</i>

1243
01:53:26,264 --> 01:53:30,347
<i>There are state laws, and the federal government in your name...</i>

1244
01:53:46,097 --> 01:53:47,556
Mexico, huh?

1245
01:53:50,014 --> 01:53:52,222
Damn Sal, that's big

1246
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:54,931
You know, I've been thinking.

1247
01:53:56,306 --> 01:53:57,431
I've never been south.

1248
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:02,431
Damn, Sal, I wish you weren't going.

1249
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:05,972
It'll be my first timein ol' New York without my good boy.

1250
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:11,597
Shit, Sal.

1251
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:13,972
We haven't talked straight in a long time.

1252
01:54:16,681 --> 01:54:17,681
Yeah, I know.

1253
01:54:17,722 --> 01:54:19,181
Yeah.

1254
01:54:19,222 --> 01:54:20,597
You see, man.

1255
01:54:21,806 --> 01:54:24,806
The older you get, those troubles just keep piling on.

1256
01:54:32,431 --> 01:54:33,389
Look at this.

1257
01:54:37,681 --> 01:54:38,722
That's Joanie.

1258
01:54:40,056 --> 01:54:41,847
Look at that smile, too.

1259
01:54:41,889 --> 01:54:43,806
Ain't she gonna break some hearts

1260
01:54:43,806 --> 01:54:45,056
Yeah.

1261
01:54:47,222 --> 01:54:48,264
She's beautiful.

1262
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:56,389
Did I tell you Marylou's pregnant?

1263
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:02,264
Well if it speaks French-Canadian, it's a complete coincidence

1264
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,139
(laughs) Shit

1265
01:55:16,347 --> 01:55:17,264
I'll leave you to it.

1266
01:55:20,389 --> 01:55:21,472
Thanks for the visit.

1267
01:55:22,847 --> 01:55:23,681
I'll write you.

1268
01:55:23,722 --> 01:55:25,431
I know you will.

1269
01:55:31,139 --> 01:55:32,014
Take care buddy.

1270
01:55:32,056 --> 01:55:32,847
Go get 'em !

1271
01:55:41,597 --> 01:55:42,306
Hey, Sal !

1272
01:55:43,764 --> 01:55:46,431
Now you know I habla la espanol, don't you?

1273
01:56:11,347 --> 01:56:12,722
La Estrella, Mexico

1274
01:56:20,597 --> 01:56:21,139
Gracias

1275
01:56:21,681 --> 01:56:22,889
Sir, sir !

1276
01:56:22,972 --> 01:56:23,889
Do you like it?

1277
01:56:23,931 --> 01:56:24,972
60 pesos.

1278
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:26,972
No, gracias.

1279
01:56:28,556 --> 01:56:29,139
Hey kid !

1280
01:56:29,222 --> 01:56:31,389
You got any marijuana?

1281
01:56:31,431 --> 01:56:32,722
Marijuana?

1282
01:56:32,764 --> 01:56:33,389
Si.

1283
01:56:33,431 --> 01:56:34,347
Si si si.

1284
01:56:51,472 --> 01:56:54,556
Those are my brothers, my sister and my grandmother too.

1285
01:56:57,681 --> 01:56:58,806
Well, shit.

1286
01:57:22,097 --> 01:57:24,555
Your 'ma could learn a few lessons from this kid's grandma.

1287
01:57:26,597 --> 01:57:27,555
A man of word !

1288
01:57:31,805 --> 01:57:32,514
Victor.

1289
01:57:33,597 --> 01:57:37,014
This is the biggest bomber of tea I have ever smoked

1290
01:57:40,847 --> 01:57:41,930
What's his name?

1291
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:44,055
Thomas.

1292
01:57:46,847 --> 01:57:47,805
Thomas.

1293
01:57:47,847 --> 01:57:48,639
Thomas.

1294
01:57:53,305 --> 01:57:54,055

01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:53,472
Thank you.

1303
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:59,680
Look at this traffic, Sal !

1304
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,097
Everybody just goes !

1305
02:00:04,514 --> 02:00:05,722
Dig those faces.

1306
02:00:05,764 --> 02:00:07,305
I want to be one of them !

1307
02:00:13,097 --> 02:00:13,930
Now we gotta eat this.

1308
02:00:21,639 --> 02:00:22,264
.How much?

1309
02:00:22,305 --> 02:00:27,139
We've got so much, we're rich !

1310
02:00:36,472 --> 02:00:37,805
They look just like us.

1311
02:00:37,847 --> 02:00:38,888
See, they're brothers !

1312
02:00:44,805 --> 02:00:47,597
My brother, I can smell the marijuana !

1313
02:00:48,972 --> 02:00:49,763
Yes !

1314
02:01:16,555 --> 02:01:22,013
Voyager, c'est bien utile, ga fait travailler l'imagination.

1315
02:01:22,055 --> 02:01:25,305
Tout le reste n'est que deceptions et fatigues.

1316
02:01:25,305 --> 02:01:27,847
Prends soin de ta mere.

1317
02:01:27,847 --> 02:01:32,430
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

1318
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:33,930
Voila sa force.

1319
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:35,847
Il va de la vie a la mort.

1320
02:01:35,847 --> 02:01:36,597
To the West.

1321
02:01:36,597 --> 02:01:38,680
To the West.

1322
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,847
"You got no calluses, Sal."

1323
02:01:41,305 --> 02:01:43,347
C'est un moment...

1324
02:01:46,722 --> 02:01:47,972
Notre voyage a nous est entierement imaginaire.

1325
02:01:48,013 --> 02:01:49,763
"(indistinct dialogue, baby crying) C'est oublie!

1326
02:01:49,805 --> 02:01:50,847
I've never been able to kill myself.

1327
02:01:50,888 --> 02:01:53,388
I am at your immediate disposal.

1328
02:01:53,388 --> 02:01:54,888
Immediate disposal.

1329
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:58,513
Because you've crushed all the poetry you had in you.

1330
02:01:58,555 --> 02:02:04,513
Take a close look at yourself and the degree of rottenness you've come to.

1331
02:02:05,763 --> 02:02:07,555
You can't deny the blood guilt.

1332
02:02:07,597 --> 02:02:08,847
You 're white.

1333
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,222
White!

1334
02:02:10,263 --> 02:02:12,180
White

1335
02:02:27,138 --> 02:02:28,805
Poor Sal got sick.

1336
02:02:28,847 --> 02:02:30,180
Poor Sal got sick.

1337
02:02:32,638 --> 02:02:34,180
Dysentery, man.

1338
02:02:37,472 --> 02:02:39,972
Now listen if you can hear in your sickness, my boy.

1339
02:02:40,055 --> 02:02:44,305
I got my divorce with Camille down here, and I gotta get back if the car can hold up.

1340
02:02:46,305 --> 02:02:47,305
Not that again.

1341
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,430
All that again, good buddy.

1342
02:02:51,472 --> 02:02:52,638
I've got to get back to my life.

1343
02:02:53,805 --> 02:02:55,222
Wish I didn't have to go.

1344
02:03:09,222 --> 02:03:10,847
Yes, yes, yes.

1345
02:03:10,888 --> 02:03:12,888
I gotta go now, ol' fever Sal.

1346
02:03:18,138 --> 02:03:19,055
Goodbye.

1347
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,555
Ozone Park, 1951

1348
02:04:17,721 --> 02:04:18,263
Humm.

1349
02:04:18,305 --> 02:04:19,513
Pour toi.

1350
02:04:22,471 --> 02:04:23,221
Merci.

1351
02:04:33,971 --> 02:04:36,768
(Book title) Denver Doldrums- For S.P. and D.M.

1352
02:04:36,768 --> 02:04:39,614
the secret heroes of these poems - Poems by Carlo Marx

1353
02:04:47,263 --> 02:04:53,786
I would rather go mad, gone down the track to Mexico, heroin dripping in my veins,

1354
02:04:53,787 --> 02:05:02,290
eyes and ears full of marijuana, eating the god Peyote on the floor of a mudhut on the border...

1355
02:05:02,888 --> 02:05:08,283
rather jar my body down the road, crying by a diner in the Western sun;

1356
02:05:08,284 --> 02:05:19,522
rather crawl on my naked belly over tincans in Cincinnati; rather drag a rotten railroad tieto a Golgotha in the Rockies;

1357
02:05:19,523 --> 02:05:25,561
rather crowned with thorns in Galveston; nailed hand and foot in Los Angeles;

1358
02:05:25,562 --> 02:05:30,536
raised up to die in Denver; pierced in the side in Chicago;

1359
02:05:30,537 --> 02:05:37,561
perished and tombed in New Orleans; and resurrected somewhere on Garret Mountain.

1360
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:48,638
December, 1951

1361
02:05:56,971 --> 02:05:57,846
(at a distance, to a woman) Hey.

1362
02:06:10,388 --> 02:06:11,013
Sal?

1363
02:06:13,846 --> 02:06:15,013
Is that you, man?

1364
02:06:18,096 --> 02:06:19,221
(to his friends, very low) Hang on a minute.

1365
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,930
What are you doing in New York, man?

1366
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,263
Dear Sal...

1367
02:06:42,971 --> 02:06:45,180
I came on the railroad pass.

1368
02:06:45,221 --> 02:06:47,013
Old hard bench coaches.

1369
02:06:48,263 --> 02:06:49,971
Crossing railroads.

1370
02:06:50,055 --> 02:06:56,805
Long, long awful trip, five days and nights, just to see you, Sal.

1371
02:06:59,346 --> 02:07:00,096
Are you alright?

1372
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:03,388
How's Camille?

1373
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:05,346
How are the babies?

1374
02:07:22,388 --> 02:07:25,805
(then reading)"Dear Dean, Its the end of the first half of the century.

1375
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:29,929
Welcome with love and kisses to spend the other half with us.

1376
02:07:32,888 --> 02:07:34,054
We all wait for you.

1377
02:07:34,054 --> 02:07:36,971
Camille, Amy and little Joanie."

1378
02:07:37,013 --> 02:07:39,263
That's great

1379
02:07:39,263 --> 02:07:39,846
Yeah.

1380
02:07:50,138 --> 02:07:56,388
We still haven't talked of Mexico, and us leaving, and the fever of last year.

1381
02:07:56,429 --> 02:07:57,138
But we don't...

1382
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:58,638
Hey Sal, we gotta go, man !

1383
02:07:59,429 --> 02:08:01,679
We don't have to talk about that right now.

1384
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:02,304
No.

1385
02:08:03,429 --> 02:08:04,096
Hey.

1386
02:08:04,138 --> 02:08:06,138
Hey Sal, for Christ's sake.

1387
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:08,388
Duke Ellington ain't gonna wait

1388
02:08:08,804 --> 02:08:10,054
Yeah, just give me a minute, Remi !

1389
02:08:10,096 --> 02:08:12,221
They're all waiting.

1390
02:08:13,596 --> 02:08:14,263
Do you think.

1391
02:08:14,304 --> 02:08:16,971
you can give me a ride to East 14th?

1392
02:08:16,971 --> 02:08:21,304
I want to spend as much time with my boy as possible, you know.

1393
02:08:23,304 --> 02:08:26,388
Man, I wish we didn't have tickets to this concert.

1394
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:30,721
Yeah.

1395
02:08:49,179 --> 02:08:50,263
Bye, Dean.

1396
02:08:59,763 --> 02:09:00,471
Hey, Sal !

1397
02:09:05,096 --> 02:09:06,179
I love you as ever.

1398
02:10:24,096 --> 02:10:31,471
I first met Dean not long after my father died...

1399
02:10:34,221 --> 02:10:35,929
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl...

1400
02:10:35,929 --> 02:10:39,388
Dean, I'll be goddamned!

1401
02:10:39,388 --> 02:10:40,554
You're early...

1402
02:10:40,554 --> 02:10:40,971
Yeah, well...

1403
02:10:40,971 --> 02:10:43,221
around my finger...

1404
02:10:43,221 --> 02:10:44,929
I was in reform school all the time.

1405
02:10:45,763 --> 02:10:48,554
I was like a young punk asserting myself......

1406
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:57,513
and she stands on her head and she does the splits......

1407
02:10:57,554 --> 02:10:59,387
"I need your cock!

1408
02:10:59,429 --> 02:11:03,887
"The only people that interest me are the mad ones...

1409
02:11:03,887 --> 02:11:05,971
Mad to live, mad to talk...

1410
02:11:10,012 --> 02:11:12,012
<i>... the West coast and come crashing down to earth...</i>

1411
02:11:12,054 --> 02:11:15,304
And the sound of the wild...

1412
02:11:15,346 --> 02:11:16,471
Bless me, Father, for I will sin

1413
02:11:16,512 --> 02:11:17,471
Man, I just love women!

1414
02:11:17,512 --> 02:11:18,637
I just want a house...

1415
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:19,554
Ah, shit, Dean!

1416
02:11:19,554 --> 02:11:19,887
a baby.

1417
02:11:19,929 --> 02:11:20,471
Sal.

1418
02:11:20,512 --> 02:11:22,137
I've come to ask you to teach me how to write.

1419
02:11:22,179 --> 02:11:29,283
(singing)And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1420
02:11:29,283 --> 02:11:30,098
That Hudson goes!

1421
02:11:39,926 --> 02:11:40,641
Hey, Sal !

1422
02:11:46,379 --> 02:11:49,813
I love you as ever.

1423
02:12:02,962 --> 02:12:10,587
So in America, when the sun goes down and I sit on the old, broken-down river pier, watching the long long skies over New Jersey,

1424
02:12:10,587 --> 02:12:16,046
and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West coast,

1425
02:12:16,087 --> 02:12:23,046
and all of that road going, and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it,

1426
02:12:23,046 --> 02:12:28,296
and in Iowa I know by now that the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

1427
02:12:28,296 --> 02:12:32,746
which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the Earth,

1428
02:12:32,747 --> 02:12:37,372
darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in,

1429
02:12:37,407 --> 02:12:40,770
and nobody, nobody knows what is going to happen to anybody,

1430
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:44,207
besides the forlorn rags of growing old,

1431
02:12:45,212 --> 02:12:50,285
I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of old Dean Moriarty, the father we never found,

1432
02:12:51,331 --> 02:12:55,657
I think of Dean Moriarty, I think of Dean Moriarty.

1433
02:13:15,796 --> 02:13:16,546
Can you hear me now?

1434
02:13:19,421 --> 02:13:20,421
But anyway...

1435
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:25,754
Tonight also, I wrote a song, called "On the Road".

1436
02:13:26,885 --> 02:13:29,921
I'm just rather reading what I wrote all night.

1437
02:13:29,962 --> 02:13:32,837
There are better things coming than what I wrote all night.

1438
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:38,087
Straight from the mind to the voice, with no hand intervening.

1439
02:13:38,129 --> 02:13:45,754
(singing) I left New York, 1949To go across the country without a dad-blame dime.

1440
02:13:45,754 --> 02:13:56,962
Montana in the cold, cold fall Found my father in the gambling hallFather, Father where have you been?

1441
02:13:57,004 --> 02:14:00,587
You've been in the world since I was a teen.

1442
02:14:03,712 --> 02:14:10,671
Dear son, he said, don't worry about me I'm about to die of pleurisy

1443
02:14:14,296 --> 02:14:20,087
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara,

1444
02:14:20,129 --> 02:14:21,837
home I'll never be.

1445
02:14:21,879 --> 02:14:29,504
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

1446
02:14:29,545 --> 02:14:36,754
For better or worse, through thick and thinLike being married to the little woman.

1447
02:14:36,795 --> 02:14:45,045
God loved me just like I loved himI want you do the same just for him.

1448
02:14:45,087 --> 02:14:49,295
The worms eat away but don't worry, watch the wind.

1449
02:14:49,337 --> 02:14:52,212
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

1450
02:14:54,564 --> 02:14:58,033
So I left Montana on an ol'freight train

1451
02:14:58,034 --> 02:15:01,597
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

1452
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:09,480
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

1453
02:15:09,515 --> 02:15:11,614
Home I'll never be.

1454
02:15:11,615 --> 02:20:12,615
ON THE ROAD
