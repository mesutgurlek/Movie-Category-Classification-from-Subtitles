11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,078
Yohei Honda was consultant for some revisions and annotations, providing much additional translation from the books named in the bibliography on request.

12
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:54,080

23
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:24,082
This video is NOT for sale or rent...

24
00:01:24,082 --> 00:02:08,050
 

25
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,072
You had said you would take a ten-day vacation so I just assumed you would be travelling abroad.

26
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,006
 

27
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,076
But you are headed for Yamagata, Okajima-san [Miss Okajima]?

28
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:15,078
 

29
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,080
Yes.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,082
 

31
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,060
Did you break up with someone...?

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,045
 

33
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,009
I yearn for the countryside.

34
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,018
 

35
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:22,097
`Bye!

36
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:22,097
 

37
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:23,070
See you later!

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,070
 

39
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,012
Let's go to Hama's house.

40
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
 

41
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,002
Nyah, nyah!

42
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:26,002
 

43
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,098
What do you mean, ``Nyah'' ?!

44
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:28,066
 

45
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,056
Let's go, let's go!

46
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:29,056
 

47
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,003
So...did your grades go up?

48
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:31,003
 

49
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:31,097
Uh-uh.

50
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,007
 

51
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:34,015
But it's all right.

52
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:34,026
 

53
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:34,096
How come?

54
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:34,098
 

55
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:40,066
As soon as I get home, we're going to Grandma's house.  So I won't be in trouble until much later.

56
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,066
 

57
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,020
Wow, that's nice.

58
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,047
 

59
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,097
Toko-chan, are you going to the country, too?

60
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,016
 

61
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,097
Yeah, to Nagano.  Are you, Taeko-chan?

62
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:46,097
 

63
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:48,004
I'm not sure.

64
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:48,004
 

65
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:50,084
Well, guess what--my father bought a cabin!

66
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:50,093
 

67
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,084
Wow, that's great!

68
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,035
 

69
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:57,030
As I expected, your math grade's not good.

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,014
 

71
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:03,090
Yeah, but I got a ``B'' in science.  Oh, Mom?  Are we going somewhere for vacation?

72
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,090
 

73
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,024
Nowhere special.

74
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:05,086
 

75
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,090
Hey, Mom, take me someplace.

76
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,080
 

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,034
I'll take you to a movie. "Tsuru No Ongaeshi" [<The Crane's Return>] is playing, isn't it?

78
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:13,054
 

79
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:16,052
That's not what I meant--someplace in the country.

80
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:16,054
 

81
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:17,052
The country?

82
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:17,052
 

83
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:20,002
Right, like ``Grandma's house in the country''.

84
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:20,008
 

85
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,064
Your Grandmother lives here, doesn't she?

86
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:21,064
 

87
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:22,050
Then Grandpa!

88
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,050
 

89
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,052
Didn't he pass away?  We don't know any places in the country.  Please don't ask for something we can't possibly do.

90
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:32,050
 

91
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:39,098
I was born and raised in Tokyo, and my parents were as well. I always envied my friends who had a country hometown to return to.

92
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:42,062
 

93
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:45,076
It's impossible to take a trip now, because everywhere will be crowded.

94
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:45,078
 

95
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:47,060
But I want to go somewhere.

96
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,056
 

97
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,072
How about Ohnohya?

98
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:49,076
 

99
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,052
Huh?

100
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:50,054
 

101
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:54,066
We've been regular visitors, so if we chose to go to Ohnohya, we might be able to reserve a room.

102
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:54,066
 

103
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,010
Where, where is it?

104
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,012
 

105
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:59,044
Oh, sure--Ohnohya is good, because Taeko hasn't been there before.

106
00:03:59,044 --> 00:03:59,046
 

107
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,076
Say, that's right...

108
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:00,078
 

109
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,032
Hey, is it in the mountains?  By the sea?

110
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:03,032
 

111
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:05,018
It's the Atami hot springs.

112
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:05,018
 

113
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:07,072
Huh--``Atami''?

114
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:07,074
 

115
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:10,022
Right.  You can reach it by bullet train.

116
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:10,024
 

117
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:12,068
Oh, sure, that place would be good.

118
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:16,038
 

119
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,050
Atami...

120
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,052
 

121
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:20,046
It's really fun--there are all kinds of baths.

122
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:20,048
 

123
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,056
Um, yeah, there's a giant Roman Bath.

124
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:23,058
 

125
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:29,062
That's right, and many smaller ones like the Swan Bath and the Pansy Bath.

126
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:29,062
 

127
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,070
Right, right!  The Pansy Bath!

128
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,034
 

129
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,072
Pansy Bath?

130
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:33,074
 

131
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:36,010
Yeah, it's a really fantastic bath!

132
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,012
 

133
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:38,018
Taeko, you just love baths, don't you?

134
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:38,054
 

135
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:42,086
Okay, well Father is working and can't go, so why don't you four go together?

136
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:42,088
 

137
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,026
Huh?

138
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,078
 

139
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,092
US...

140
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:48,094
 

141
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:50,010
...go TOO?

142
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,010
 

143
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:57,036
1,2,3,4,5,6...lean to the side...

144
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:57,036
 

145
00:04:57,036 --> 00:05:00,060
Taeko-chan, it's incredible--you've come to every single radio exercise.

146
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,036
 

147
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,060
Well, everyone else has gone to the countryside, after all.

148
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,076
 

149
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,098
Taeko-chan, aren't you going anywhere?

150
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,064
 

151
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,046
I'm going!

152
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:09,046
 

153
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,010
Where?

154
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,012
 

155
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:11,042
Atami!

156
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:11,044
 

157
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,062
Atami?  What are you going to Atami for?

158
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:14,064
 

159
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,010
To go bathing!

160
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,083
 

161
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,026
Ohhh?

162
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,038
 

163
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,086
Well, it's good timing.  I'll be going, too--my relative's place, next Monday.

164
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:26,030
 

165
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,044
So maybe no one will come to exercises for a while.

166
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:32,055
 

167
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:34,052
Hello, Okajima residence.

168
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:34,052
 

169
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,000
Ah, Nanako `ne-san?  It's me, Taeko.

170
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,054
I'm leaving today, and was wondering if Mitsuo `ni-san had anything for me to tell his family at the farm.

172
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:41,056
 

173
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,084
Hmm...doesn't seem like he had anything special to say...

174
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:43,084
 

175
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:50,001
...oh yeah, would you buy some cookies or something for Naoko-chan?  Say it's from Mitsuo Oji-chan and me, and I'll pay you back later.

176
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:50,048
 

177
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,042
That's fine...I'll say hello for you.  How's Mother?

178
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:53,042
 

179
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,006
She went out today.

180
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:55,006
 

181
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:59,064
She was angry, though--after all, you did turn down her Ohmiai [<arranged marriage (traditional)>] meeting, didn't you?

182
00:05:59,064 --> 00:05:59,064
 

183
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:03,050
Considering that you're 27, you're not going to get any better choices for a husband.

184
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,052
 

185
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,018
That's all Mother ever talks about.

186
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:06,020
 

187
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,002
But you should think about it, you know.  You're not so young anymore.

188
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:10,004
 

189
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,062
Is that so?

190
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:11,064
 

191
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:15,048
Yes, it is--you can't be a cute little girl forever.

192
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:15,056
 

193
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:20,018
You can be so impulsive--you actually pitched in with the farming last year, didn't you?

194
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:20,030
 

195
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,074
Yeah, harvesting rice!  And this year, I'm going to pick benibana [<safflower>].

196
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:23,076
 

197
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,088
Benibana?

198
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:24,090
 

199
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:32,018
That's right!  Because of your husband's family in the country, I can have a hometown. I might as well make the most of it!

200
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,015
 

201
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:35,098
Oh, cut that out.

202
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:35,098
 

203
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:43,034
You don't get a vacation like this often, so instead of staying at such an old place, why not go to a nice rental cottage and have a "delicious life"?

204
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,006
 

205
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,020
You might be able to meet a nice guy.

206
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,022
 

207
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:50,076
Stop, stop!  You're trying to trick me again, like you did with the Pansy Bath at Ohnohya!

208
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,076
 

209
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:56,012
Ohnohya..?  Oh...ah, that time, huh?

210
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,046
 

211
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:03,024
You just talked about that a while ago, too.  What a burden your past must be if you're still holding a grudge like that!

212
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:12,070
 

213
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,002
At that time, my sisters wouldn't have been caught dead going to a place like Atami.

214
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,004
 

215
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,024
Hey Grandma.

216
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:21,024
 

217
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:21,098
Hmm...?

218
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,040
 

219
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,082
Done yet?

220
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,012
 

221
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,004
C'mon, let's go to the bath.

222
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:27,055
 

223
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,034
Didn't we just go?

224
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:29,054
 

225
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,084
But that was only to the Swan Bath.

226
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,034
 

227
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:39,010
I was incredibly bored. So starting with the Grimm Bath...

228
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,010
 

229
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,040
...and then to the Mermaid Bath...

230
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,040
 

231
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,073
...the Lemon Bath...

232
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:41,073
 

233
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,077
...and the Pansy Bath...

234
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:43,086
 

235
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,096
...I went from one to the next on my own.

236
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:45,098
 

237
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,084
It's enormous!

238
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,026
 

239
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:51,066
By the time I had reached the Roman Bath, I was starting to feel dizzy...

240
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,067
 

241
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,022
Wow...!

242
00:07:55,022 --> 00:08:05,060
 

243
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,012
...And I finally passed out.

244
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,008
 

245
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:10,060
Thus my much-anticipated one-night trip came to an abrupt end,

246
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,060
 

247
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,013
and was followed by a long, long Summer vacation that was still waiting for me.

248
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:14,017
 

249
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:27,083
...Jumping jacks--open, close, open, close.  Next, arm and leg exercises.  1,2,3...

250
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,096
 

251
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:35,038
When I met with my sisters last time, I slipped and mentioned the disastrous bath trip, so we laughed,

252
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:35,040
 

253
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,014
``Oh yeah, and then there was that time...'', and the conversation turned to other memories of those days.

254
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:45,036
 

255
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:48,068
You've eaten this before?

256
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:48,070
 

257
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,020
Nope, my first time.

258
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,020
 

259
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,058
Remember, I'm the one who asked for it.

260
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:52,060
 

261
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,090
We know.

262
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,092
 

263
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:55,086
Where did you buy it, Dad?

264
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:55,088
 

265
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:57,088
The Senbiki shop in Ginza.

266
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:57,088
 

267
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,072
It was expensive, then?

268
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,088
 

269
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:02,038
So, how do we eat this?

270
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:02,040
 

271
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,092
We slice it into rings.

272
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:03,094
 

273
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,092
How?

274
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:07,056
 

275
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,050
...I don't know.

276
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,008
 

277
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,052
Father, didn't you ask the people at the shop?

278
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,014
 

279
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:13,082
Uh-uh.

280
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:18,028
 

281
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,022
Let's eat it next Sunday.

282
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:20,044
 

283
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:23,020
Huh---we're not going to eat it today?

284
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,052
 

285
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,038
But we don't know how to eat it, do we?

286
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:28,024
 

287
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,094
I'm gonna eat a banana.

288
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:30,024
 

289
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,064
Me too!

290
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:35,044
 

291
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:39,022
Warmer countries have rather unusual fruit, don't they?

292
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:42,071
 

293
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:43,065
I'm home!

294
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,054
 

295
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,058
I found out how to serve pineapple.

296
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:46,060
 

297
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,096
What, really?

298
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:52,092
 

299
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,090
I..I'll get that.

300
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,082
 

301
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,094
Carefully, now.

302
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,028
 

303
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,090
Wouldn't a fish knife be better?

304
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:11,064
 

305
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,022
Nice smell, nice smell!

306
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:22,088
 

307
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,058
Nice fragrance, nice fragrance!

308
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:27,042
 

309
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,050
Oh, I see.

310
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,030
 

311
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,056
Hey--plates, plates!

312
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:31,058
 

313
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,022
..Oh, right!

314
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:35,060
 

315
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,022
Itadakimasu [We shall try it now].

316
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:36,024
 

317
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:37,064
Itadakimasu [Let's try it].

318
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:58,066
 

319
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,082
It's tough.

320
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:04,062
 

321
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,040
Not such a big deal.

322
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,052
 

323
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,018
Not very sweet at all.

324
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:08,020
 

325
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,030
It's completely different from when it's canned.

326
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,041
 

327
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,058
If you live a long time, you get to have many experiences.

328
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:19,048
 

329
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,048
Taeko can have mine.

330
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:20,050
 

331
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,048
Mine too.

332
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:51,046
 

333
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,010
...Delicious...

334
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,072
 

335
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,088
You don't have to force yourself to eat it.

336
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:01,002
 

337
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,026
You'll get a stomachache.

338
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:11,048
 

339
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:14,072
Oh well, that was boring.

340
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:17,062
 

341
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,094
Bananas are far more tasty, aren't they?

342
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:19,096
 

343
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,028
True, true.

344
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:21,030
 

345
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,032
As I expected, the banana is the king of fruit, I guess.

346
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:24,052
 

347
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm gonna have a banana.

348
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:50,044
 

349
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:53,060
As I thought, the king of fruit is...

350
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,010
 

351
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,088
the king of fruit is...

352
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,052
 

353
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:58,000
...the banana!

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,076
 

355
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:08,086
The year I passed out at the Roman Bath and ate pineapple for the first time,

356
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:08,088
 

357
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:13,042
was the same year that the "group sound" became a fad, starting with the Beatles' visit to Japan.

358
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,044
 

359
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,092
Soon after that, the electric guitar boom would come.

360
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:19,078
 

361
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:24,050
My sister Nanako 'ne-san was a freshman at an art college, and was always the first to try out all the new fads.

362
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,024
 

363
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,030
Yeah, ``Michelle,'' isn't it?   Another cool Beatles song, huh?

364
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,030
 

365
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:35,006
She tried the mini-skirt when it first came out, and like everyone else, she hid her behind with a bag whenever going upstairs.

366
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:38,030
 

367
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,090
My other sister, Yaeko 'ne-san, the smart eleventh grader, was completely in love with someone in the Takarazuka theater [all-female theater].

368
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,002
 

369
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:45,030
Yaeko 'ne-chan...

370
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,002
 

371
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,026
D....didn't I tell you to always knock first??!!

372
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:52,064
 

373
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:57,092
The memories that my sisters mainly talked about were the stars and fashions that they were into.

374
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,034
 

375
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:07,028
1966 was a memorable teenage year for my sisters.  But back then, I was only in the 5th grade.

376
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:08,024
 

377
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:12,012
I became a fan of Julie of The Tigers...but they didn't debut until later.

378
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:12,032
 

379
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:17,046
There was no way for me to have big dreams in the days when I was just simply going back and forth between school and home.

380
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:17,046
 

381
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,096
...and it's been on the wall for a long time.

382
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:18,096
 

383
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:21,054
That's nice.

384
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:21,056
 

385
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:30,010
And I was told to keep the essay I wrote on the book, because they might send it to a contest. If that happens, I'll be very happy...

386
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,012
 

387
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,082
You didn't eat your school lunch again.

388
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,052
 

389
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,004
...huh?

390
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:33,006
 

391
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,038
Why do you put it between bread?

392
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:35,038
 

393
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,046
Because I hate namasu<daikon radish and carrots marinated in vinegar>.

394
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:37,048
 

395
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:40,068
Well, if you do this, we can't use the bread or the namasu.

396
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,076
 

397
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:43,078
How wasteful.

398
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:44,032
 

399
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:50,078
The kid who can eat all of her food is more respected than the one who can write an essay.

400
00:14:50,078 --> 00:15:06,094
 

401
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:10,054
Wow, how can you drink that tasteless stuff?

402
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,003
 

403
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:15,091
The milk's all right.  It's the daikon radish and onion I can't stand.

404
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:16,011
 

405
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:19,090
Since I'm leaving carrots today, I have to drink the milk.

406
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,052
 

407
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,099
I wonder who decided you could only leave one thing?

408
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,025
 

409
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,006
Want me to drink it?

410
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:26,034
 

411
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,090
W..would you?

412
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,092
 

413
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,008
And next time, you could eat my daikon or onion in return?

414
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:31,056
 

415
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,020
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

416
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,080
 

417
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,042
``Thank you!''

418
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:43,028
 

419
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:44,042
Aah, carrots!?

420
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:44,042
 

421
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,066
You can leave one thing, you know...

422
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:55,004
 

423
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,088
I was right, the second bowl is worse...

424
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,084
 

425
00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:03,038
There are people who keep running if they are told to start over again by the hall monitors.

426
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:03,040
 

427
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,072
I think to keep running is really bad.

428
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:06,002
 

429
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:09,036
``Start over again?''  Spare me.

430
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:09,058
 

431
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,002
You can't run in the halls.

432
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:11,040
 

433
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,062
That's right, that's right.

434
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:12,076
 

435
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,063
It's dangerous--you might hurt somebody.

436
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:14,076
 

437
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:18,070
No way--if I hit a girl like you, Toko, I would be the one hurt.

438
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,070
 

439
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,004
Oh, PLEASE...

440
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:20,004
 

441
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,010
I'm hit!

442
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,020
 

443
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,052
Once you ran, what can you do about it?

444
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,001
 

445
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:25,081
Here, here.

446
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:25,081
 

447
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,069
Be quiet.

448
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,069
 

449
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,041
Why not abolish the system of starting over?

450
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,041
 

451
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,094
You can't, it's part of the rules.

452
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:30,045
 

453
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:32,082
If you have an opinion, please raise your hand.

454
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:32,084
 

455
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,076
I do.

456
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:33,076
 

457
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,014
Tani-san.

458
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:36,056
 

459
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:43,004
I think the hall monitor should run after the runner, catch them, and make them go back and start over.

460
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:43,032
 

461
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:44,066
I do!

462
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:44,068
 

463
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,070
Suzuki-san.

464
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,008
 

465
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,084
And then the hall monitor has to go back and start over, too.

466
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,006
 

467
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:52,046
Right, right!

468
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:52,074
 

469
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,018
That's more like it!

470
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:54,048
 

471
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,054
That's right.

472
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:55,056
 

473
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,020
Yes, Tani Tsuneko-san.

474
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,022
 

475
00:16:57,022 --> 00:17:01,044
I don't think that the hall monitors need to start over because...

476
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:01,046
 

477
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:08,034
...their job is just like a police patrol car catching a speeder.

478
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:14,090
 

479
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,070
Any opposing arguments?

480
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,004
 

481
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,044
Like a patrol car...?

482
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:20,082
 

483
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,002
...Then running is no good.

484
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,002
 

485
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:27,086
The decision rests on allowing the hall monitor to run.

486
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:30,044
 

487
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,006
Anything else to discuss?

488
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:32,036
 

489
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,024
Yes.

490
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:33,026
 

491
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:34,044
Tani-san.

492
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:35,024
 

493
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,020
Her again?!

494
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,022
 

495
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,000
The show-off!

496
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,002
 

497
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,028
Quit chattering.

498
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:38,056
 

499
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:45,068
Lately I've been seeing people leaving food at lunch.  I just read a magazine article about the war in Vietnam.

500
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,020
 

501
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,068
In foreign countries like those there are many poor people.  We are happily more fortunate.

502
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:51,070
 

503
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,010
Yeah,``we're happy.''

504
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,078
 

505
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:59,072
We must be thankful for the food we have.

506
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:00,018
 

507
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:06,095
Right now we may leave one thing per meal, but I feel that is too lenient.

508
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:09,075
 

509
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:12,016
Geez, Tsuneko...aren't you the goody two-shoes?

510
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:12,027
 

511
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:12,088
Bleah!

512
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:12,090
 

513
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,000
Why can't we leave even one thing?

514
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 

515
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,006
And then everyone could leave the milk.

516
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:17,008
 

517
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,038
Why not ask somebody to eat what you don't like?

518
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:19,040
 

519
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,060
That's obvious.

520
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,062
 

521
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,080
Some people leave extra by hiding it between their bread.

522
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 

523
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,042
Ohh, cheaters!

524
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:25,003
 

525
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,044
School lunch stinks.

526
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:26,046
 

527
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,044
If you have an opinion..

528
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:27,049
 

529
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,050
If you have an opinion, raise your hand, please!

530
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,054
 

531
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,062
``Oh...you got me!''

532
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:36,006
 

533
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:47,052
After I said goodbye to my sisters and went to bed, one by one, my memories of fifth grade came back.

534
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:51,030
 

535
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,042
Memories about our dog, Gon...

536
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:53,042
 

537
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:56,016
...about sports day...

538
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:56,018
 

539
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:59,060
...about the scary feeling we got from reading Kazuo Umezu's comics...

540
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,062
 

541
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:03,008
...and even about yearning for an electric pencil sharpener.

542
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,020
 

543
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:16,018
Even such trivial things came back vividly, occupying my mind as if I were watching a movie, and overwhelmed the real me.

544
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:22,000
 

545
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,004
Is there an ``Okajima-san'' here?

546
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:25,038
 

547
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,012
There's the one.

548
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:38,020
 

549
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,052
Hirota-kun says that ``I like Okajima-san of room 5.''

550
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:46,056
 

551
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:47,034
...Shall we go?

552
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:50,054
 

553
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:52,094
I'm gonna tell Hiro that you know, now!

554
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,054
 

555
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:54,012
Hurry up!

556
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,045
 

557
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,061
You see?

558
00:19:56,061 --> 00:20:03,012
 

559
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:04,052
Where, where?

560
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:04,054
 

561
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,050
Over there.

562
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,048
 

563
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,089
Oh, she's right!

564
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,026
 

565
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:09,080
See?

566
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,018
 

567
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,070
What kind of guy is Hirota-kun?

568
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,072
 

569
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,084
I don't know.

570
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:14,086
 

571
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,064
Me neither.

572
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:15,066
 

573
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,008
Taeko-chan, are you sure you don't know him?

574
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,008
 

575
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,076
I..I..I don't know him.  Not at all.

576
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:26,008
 

577
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,006
Which one here is named Hirota-kun?

578
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:28,038
 

579
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:29,050
Oh, it's some room 5 kids.

580
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,068
 

581
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,000
Hiro, you're being called.

582
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,014
 

583
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:35,070
Yes, that's me!

584
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,076
 

585
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:39,084
D...don't write strange things at ``Naughty Alley''...

586
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:39,090
 

587
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,052
Huh?

588
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:40,054
 

589
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,006
...Okajima-san said to tell you.

590
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:42,032
 

591
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,058
I...I didn't write anything.

592
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:44,060
 

593
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,022
Ah, but Hiro, didn't you say you liked ``Okajima-san from room 5?''

594
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:48,024
 

595
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:49,044
He did, he did!

596
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:49,072
 

597
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,028
So we wrote it for you.

598
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:51,028
 

599
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:52,040
Whaa...?!

600
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,002
 

601
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,082
``I love you, but...''

602
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:55,084
 

603
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,054
Cha cha cha cha!

604
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,056
 

605
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,092
``...we're apart,''

606
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:58,094
 

607
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,038
Cha cha cha cha!

608
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:00,040
 

609
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
``just like the stars...''

610
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,082
 

611
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:03,076
Cha cha cha cha!

612
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:03,076
 

613
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:04,070
Goodbye.

614
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,070
 

615
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,090
``...that we see far away.''

616
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,024
 

617
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:16,046
Taeko-chan! We just got back from meeting Hirota-kun.

618
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:16,046
 

619
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:17,054
Whaa...?

620
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:18,036
 

621
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:21,082
I certainly didn't forget to tell him you didn't want him writing strange things!

622
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,064
 

623
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,050
Tsuneko-chan!

624
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,096
 

625
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,064
Oops, not supposed to do that.

626
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:30,092
 

627
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:32,068
Good for you, Taeko-chan.

628
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:50,052
 

629
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:54,074
Here, here.  Look there--that's Hirota-kun.

630
00:21:54,074 --> 00:22:01,068
 

631
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:05,018
What, Hirota from room 4 likes Okajima?

632
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,004
 

633
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:08,094
Hirota's incredible--he's an ace.

634
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:08,094
 

635
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,092
Oh, a pitcher?

636
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:10,092
 

637
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:13,024
The only one who can hit that guy's pitches is Tonomura.

638
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:13,026
 

639
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:15,044
Whoa, you don't say?

640
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,035
 

641
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,094
We'll be playing against the team from his class in the fifth grade school tournament.

642
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:26,048
 

643
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:31,015
Go for it, go for it, Hirota! Go for it, go for it, Hirota!

644
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:31,015
 

645
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,056
``Play ball!''

646
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,052
 

647
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,065
Hit it Hinomura!

648
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,075
 

649
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,017
Hit it hard!

650
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,004
 

651
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:42,027
Go for it, Hiro...!

652
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,060
 

653
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,058
...Okajima-san's watching you!

654
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:55,046
 

655
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:57,078
Tonomura-kun, good luck!

656
00:22:57,078 --> 00:23:06,064
 

657
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:07,080
``STRIKE!''

658
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,090
 

659
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,098
Attaboy, Hiro!

660
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:09,098
 

661
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:11,039
Strike 'em out, Strike him!

662
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,042
 

663
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,008
Taeko-chan, I'll never forgive you if you encourage their side.

664
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:15,010
 

665
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,084
I...I wouldn't even think of such a thing!

666
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,024
 

667
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:26,014
Hit it, hit it, Tonomura! Hit it, hit it, Tonomura! Hit it, hit...

668
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:29,093
 

669
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,092
``OUT!''

670
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:33,095
 

671
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:38,031
All right, all right, Hirota! All right, all right, Hirota!

672
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:40,012
 

673
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:41,018
Get him, Suu'!

674
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:41,054
 

675
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,002
One leg hitter!

676
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:45,030
 

677
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,042
``Strike!''

678
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:49,098
 

679
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:50,088
``Strike!''

680
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:53,030
 

681
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,012
``Strike!  Batter out!''

682
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,076
 

683
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,004
Amazing...

684
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,096
 

685
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:07,040
All right, all right, Hirota! All right, all right, Hirota! All right, all right, Hirota!

686
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,052
 

687
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:12,012
Even though I knew nothing about baseball, at least I could tell he was incredible.

688
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:20,032
 

689
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:26,024
All right, all right, Hirota! All right, all right, Hirota!

690
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:26,054
 

691
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,058
What's the matter, Taeko-chan?

692
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:29,050
 

693
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,030
Because of the cold and my nervousness, I had to run to the bathroom five times.

694
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,004
 

695
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,008
Over here!

696
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:36,038
 

697
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,036
``Safe!''

698
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:41,050
 

699
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,006
``Game Set.''

700
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:46,084
 

701
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:49,046
5 to 3.  Class 4 wins.

702
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:49,090
 

703
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,070
Thank you for the game.

704
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,090
 

705
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,086
Terrific, Hiro!

706
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:54,088
 

707
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:55,084
Way to go!

708
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:55,094
 

709
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,088
You were great!

710
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,036
 

711
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:00,042
It's Suu's fault.

712
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:00,042
 

713
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,052
Why?

714
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:01,054
 

715
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:03,002
You don't know anything.

716
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,054
 

717
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:06,082
Even Tonomura couldn't hit the ball, so how could we win?

718
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:06,084
 

719
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,002
Right.

720
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:08,038
 

721
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,088
It's because Suu' had an error.  That's how we gave them three extra points.

722
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:12,090
 

723
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,046
That's not true.

724
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:14,046
 

725
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:17,098
Hey, the coach is going to buy us all ice cream!

726
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,000
 

727
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,063
Really?

728
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:18,063
 

729
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,039
Great!

730
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,076
 

731
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:23,042
Hey, Hiro, why don't you go talk to Okajima-san from room 5?

732
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:23,042
 

733
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,096
Yeah, yeah!

734
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,046
 

735
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:29,028
I...I'm...ggg, going home!

736
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,022
 

737
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,044
What's the matter, Taeko-chan?

738
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:36,068
 

739
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,062
Hey, she's going home...

740
00:25:38,062 --> 00:26:27,042
 

741
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,010
Uh..umm!

742
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:36,094
 

743
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:44,080
Nah! ...Naughty! n..n..nah-Naughty Al..luh...luh...al..al...

744
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,000
 

745
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,058
Ruh...Rainy days!

746
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:49,061
 

747
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:50,040
Huh?

748
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,042
 

749
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:54,032
...Cloudy days, or sunny days...which do you like?

750
00:26:54,032 --> 00:27:06,046
 

751
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:10,018
...kuh..Cloudy days...

752
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:11,002
 

753
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:12,070
Oh, we're alike!

754
00:27:12,070 --> 00:28:52,012
 

755
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:54,008
Rainy days...

756
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:54,010
 

757
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,056
...cloudy days, or sunny days...

758
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:57,058
 

759
00:28:57,058 --> 00:28:59,074
...which do you like?

760
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,096
 

761
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:03,040
Oh...we're alike.

762
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:21,044
 

763
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:27,050
I didn't intend to bring my fifth grade self with me...

764
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,078
 

765
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:35,070
...but once she was revived, she wasn't going to leave easily.

766
00:29:35,070 --> 00:30:05,090
 

767
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,006
But why the fifth grade...?

768
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:12,040
 

769
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,030
The boys in the fourth period class will play baseball, and the girls will meet in the gymnasium.

770
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:30,090
 

771
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,060
Today there is something important to talk about.

772
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,030
 

773
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:47,092
After you graduate from elementary school, you will go to junior high school, then high school, then grow up and have a baby.

774
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,054
 

775
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:52,052
In order to have a baby, a woman's body starts preparing for it.

776
00:30:52,052 --> 00:31:00,088
 

777
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:02,004
You knew?

778
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:02,004
 

779
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:02,096
Uh-huh.

780
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:02,098
 

781
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:04,048
Really?

782
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:05,024
 

783
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:10,036
My mom told me when I was in fourth grade since I have been developing faster.

784
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:10,046
 

785
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,054
``Developing?''

786
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:11,056
 

787
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:16,087
Right...I've heard that if you're taller or more overweight than average, your period might come sooner.

788
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:16,087
 

789
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:22,095
So, in other words, Enomoto-san, Onobu, and Rie-chan all probably already started theirs.

790
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:23,032
 

791
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:24,064
Oh...?

792
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:27,048
 

793
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,040
Hey, hey...

794
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,048
 

795
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:30,040
Will you buy THAT?

796
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,042
 

797
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,022
I'll buy it.

798
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:31,030
 

799
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,026
I thought so.

800
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:32,069
 

801
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,058
Taeko-chan, will you buy it too?

802
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,092
 

803
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,052
Uh....uh-huh....

804
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:37,088
 

805
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:44,069
Buying it's a good idea.  Hey, remember like the school nurse said, you're going to need it eventually, after all.

806
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:44,086
 

807
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:46,002
That's true, you know.

808
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:59,016
 

809
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:02,076
Hey, did you know the girls are buying underpants from the infirmary?

810
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:02,078
 

811
00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:04,014
Huh?

812
00:32:04,014 --> 00:32:06,010
 

813
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,084
Didn't you know, Suu?

814
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,037
 

815
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:09,033
Nope.

816
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:09,058
 

817
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,094
How come?

818
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,060
 

819
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,024
How come you're buying underpants?

820
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:15,050
 

821
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,026
W...well it's...um,

822
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:17,029
 

823
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,056
That is...

824
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:18,093
 

825
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,076
Why do they sell underpants at school?

826
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:20,076
 

827
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,010
Are they swimming shorts?

828
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,002
 

829
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:24,022
Say what---!?

830
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,072
 

831
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:27,076
You went and told Nakayama-kun?

832
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,016
 

833
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:29,072
What did you have to go do that for?

834
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:29,096
 

835
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,098
You're not supposed to tell any boys!

836
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,000
 

837
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,042
That's for sure, girls are supposed to keep it to themselves.

838
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:39,026
 

839
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:42,067
Rie-chan, you like Nakayama-kun, so that must be why, well...

840
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:42,081
 

841
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,052
He must've asked you to tell him.

842
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:44,094
 

843
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:47,018
Um...uh-huh.

844
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:50,028
 

845
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:51,040
What's the matter?

846
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,042
 

847
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:54,092
Well, Rie-chan here went and told Nakayama-kun all about periods.

848
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:54,094
 

849
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,020
No way...!

850
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,010
 

851
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,040
That Nakayama-kun, he'll tell everyone about it.

852
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,094
 

853
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:01,038
I told him to keep it a secret.

854
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:01,052
 

855
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,088
You can't trust him on that.

856
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:03,090
 

857
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,034
Right?  Right.

858
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,042
 

859
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:08,040
Omigosh.

860
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,045
 

861
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:10,052
The boys are so dirty-minded.

862
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:10,098
 

863
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:13,000
They sure won't only look up skirts, now.

864
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,080
 

865
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,020
Hey!

866
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,020
 

867
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,033
Safe!

868
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,039
 

869
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,058
Pervert!

870
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:20,004
 

871
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:20,096
Jerk!

872
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:20,096
 

873
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:24,030
This skirt-peeping had caught on earlier, and not surprisingly, the knowledge of menstruation only complicated the problem.

874
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,036
 

875
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:26,034
Safe!  Ah, but your period isn't!

876
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,055
 

877
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,086
Eek!  Why you...!  Wait up!

878
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,012
 

879
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:31,020
Sorry!  Sorry!

880
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,038
 

881
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,010
PERIODical cleaning.

882
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,044
 

883
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,030
Jerk!

884
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,046
 

885
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:35,062
Hey, that hurt.

886
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:35,062
 

887
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,058
Wait...!

888
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,046
 

889
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:38,011
Ouch!

890
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:38,011
 

891
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,010
You jerk!

892
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,010
 

893
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,020
You've got a period.

894
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,043
 

895
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:41,056
Do not!

896
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:42,096
 

897
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,096
This is all Rie-chan's fault.

898
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:50,066
 

899
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,086
I'm sorry.

900
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:51,088
 

901
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,014
What for?

902
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:53,016
 

903
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:55,048
That I slipped and told Nakayama-kun.

904
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:55,048
 

905
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,002
Well, no big deal.

906
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:57,062
 

907
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:01,060
But the school nurse said it was important, didn't she?

908
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,062
 

909
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:03,060
That's true, but...

910
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,030
 

911
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,016
I...I was a fourth grader, when mine came.

912
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:07,018
 

913
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:08,068
Huh....really?

914
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:08,070
 

915
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,068
So that's why sometimes I skip P.E. class.

916
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:13,006
 

917
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:15,020
You skip P.E. when you have your period?

918
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,052
 

919
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,030
Right, my mother told me I should.

920
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,010
 

921
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,092
Nakayama-kun said that it must be a big bother for girls after I told him.

922
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:24,092
 

923
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:26,066
You told him about skipping P.E. class?!

924
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,006
 

925
00:34:27,006 --> 00:34:32,028
Uh-huh, though I told him to keep his promise and not tell any other boys.

926
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,030
 

927
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,094
If you told him that...

928
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,018
 

929
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:37,028
When any girl skips P.E. class, everyone will think she's having her period, won't they?!

930
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:37,030
 

931
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,064
Huh, you think so?

932
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:38,064
 

933
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:39,078
Darn right!

934
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,056
 

935
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:43,036
...really?  I'll have to tell the guys.  Hey...!

936
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,078
 

937
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:46,056
Please excuse Taeko from P.E. class because of the flu.

938
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:52,084
 

939
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:54,062
I'm not going to skip P.E.

940
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:54,064
 

941
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:58,018
Forget it--that summer flu will only get much worse if you don't skip it.

942
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:58,018
 

943
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,088
Well, then I'm staying home.

944
00:34:59,088 --> 00:34:59,088
 

945
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:02,028
You don't have a fever, so you're going.

946
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:02,030
 

947
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,088
Then I'll go to P.E., too.

948
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:03,088
 

949
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,048
Fine, go ahead.

950
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:06,006
 

951
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,048
But then if you get worse, it's on your head.

952
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:12,032
 

953
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:13,042
I'm going now.

954
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,086
 

955
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:17,092
I wonder when she started liking P.E. so much...

956
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:24,037
 

957
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:26,046
Taeko-chan, your face is real red.

958
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:26,076
 

959
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:28,030
Oh, it really is.

960
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,044
 

961
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,068
What's the matter?

962
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:29,070
 

963
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,022
Its a cold.

964
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:31,024
 

965
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:32,060
Do you have a fever?

966
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,062
 

967
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,092
You ought to skip P.E.

968
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:33,094
 

969
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,018
She's right.

970
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:35,064
 

971
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,078
I'll go tell the teacher.

972
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:37,048
 

973
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:38,032
That's okay!

974
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:38,066
 

975
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:39,074
But...

976
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:40,052
 

977
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,082
I have a note to excuse me from P.E.

978
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:43,008
 

979
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,080
What, well, that's okay then.

980
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,084
 

981
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,084
Right?

982
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,046
 

983
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,054
Gangway!

984
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:57,006
 

985
00:35:57,006 --> 00:36:00,038
I'm also skipping it today, so we're together.

986
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:07,096
 

987
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:10,030
That looks nice...

988
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,032
 

989
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:12,068
I wish I could be playing dodge-ball.

990
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:16,080
 

991
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,040
Rie-chan, do you...that is, are you...having your period?

992
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,007
 

993
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:24,008
Mmm-hmmm.

994
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:26,004
 

995
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:28,040
I'm not, I've got a cold.

996
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,040
 

997
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,026
I know that, Taeko-chan, you're just sick.

998
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:31,028
 

999
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,016
Right, just sick, that's what I am.

1000
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:34,016
 

1001
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,088
A period isn't being sick, of course.

1002
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:42,078
 

1003
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:45,082
I'm sure I could play dodge-ball.

1004
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:49,014
 

1005
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:50,020
Oh, period contagion!

1006
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,032
 

1007
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,024
Huh?

1008
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:52,030
 

1009
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,091
Back off, back off!

1010
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:54,040
 

1011
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,024
That was close--any further and we could have been contaminated!

1012
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:57,062
 

1013
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:59,028
(``Contaminated?!'')

1014
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,002
 

1015
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:02,044
Hey, over here!

1016
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:04,038
 

1017
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:06,026
Periods are contagious?

1018
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:10,010
 

1019
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,066
How stupid!

1020
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,046
 

1021
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:15,012
It...It's not funny!

1022
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:18,096
 

1023
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:20,046
Taeko-chan [Taeko]...?

1024
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:27,098
 

1025
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,032
Hey, a pair with periods!

1026
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:29,034
 

1027
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:30,056
It's not true!

1028
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:31,070
 

1029
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,096
What a pervert, huh?

1030
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:41,060
 

1031
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,086
Rie-chan, how can you stand this?

1032
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:43,088
 

1033
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:48,054
But it isn't really a bad thing, or so my mom tells me.

1034
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,086
 

1035
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:51,076
Well, I suppose so, but...

1036
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:56,066
 

1037
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,090
A larva has to become a pupa in order to become a butterfly.

1038
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,034
 

1039
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:05,024
I didn't want to become a pupa....

1040
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:16,072
 

1041
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:23,000
I wonder, maybe the reason I am remembering those days is because my period of becoming a pupa has come once again.

1042
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,024
 

1043
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:32,020
I know something is different now compared to several years ago when I got my job.  I am changing again.

1044
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,002
 

1045
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:39,010
In work and play, we were always more lively than the boys.

1046
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,020
 

1047
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,048
We thought we had already flown away from home...

1048
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:44,080
 

1049
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:51,002
...but now I look back and think maybe we were just too busy flapping our wings and forgot who we were.

1050
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:56,042
 

1051
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:05,031
I wonder if the reason my fifth grade self is following me is that she is trying to tell me to look back and figure out who I am.

1052
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:11,076
 

1053
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:16,086
Whatever the case, I decided to take a short nap until I arrived in Yamagata.

1054
00:39:16,086 --> 00:40:04,006
 

1055
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,013
Watch out.

1056
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:15,006
 

1057
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:17,058
'Scuse me--has the ``Akebono #3'' train already left?

1058
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:17,070
 

1059
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,060
You missed boarding it?

1060
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,062
 

1061
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:21,034
Er...no...

1062
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:24,008
 

1063
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,058
Oh!

1064
00:40:25,058 --> 00:40:27,066
 

1065
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:30,024
You're...Taeko Okajima-san, right?

1066
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:30,062
 

1067
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:32,056
Well...yes...

1068
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:32,080
 

1069
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,068
Whew, that's good! The car's this way.

1070
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:35,096
 

1071
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:38,062
Um, er, excuse me, but just who ARE you?

1072
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:39,088
 

1073
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,028
Oh, don'tcha remember?

1074
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:42,008
 

1075
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,098
Well, can't say I blame you, there's small chance you would.

1076
00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:45,000
 

1077
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,092
I'm Toshio.  Um...Kazuo's second cousin.

1078
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,075
 

1079
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:54,054
Oh...ah, really...?

1080
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:58,076
 

1081
00:40:58,076 --> 00:41:00,070
Oh dear.

1082
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,054
 

1083
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:03,076
What's so funny?

1084
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:05,082
 

1085
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:11,032
Oh, um, nothing.  I'm sorry, it's just I thought you were trying to steal my bag.

1086
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:12,062
 

1087
00:41:12,062 --> 00:41:18,016
Huh, that's cruel--remember, I certainly made it clear I knew your name, didn't I?

1088
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:18,018
 

1089
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:26,062
I spoke too soon.  Thanks for coming out of your way to pick me up.  I'm sorry about this.

1090
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:26,080
 

1091
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,014
No trouble.

1092
00:41:28,014 --> 00:41:31,000
 

1093
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,036
What happened to Kazuo 'ni-san?

1094
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:32,038
 

1095
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:37,042
He suddenly called last night and asked me to pick you up instead.

1096
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,046
 

1097
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:39,084
It's been raining?

1098
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:39,084
 

1099
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:42,028
Yep, but it's stopped for today.

1100
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:43,098
 

1101
00:41:43,098 --> 00:41:50,088
I should've borrowed my pa's car...but, well, I happen to like this one.

1102
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:54,060
 

1103
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,028
It's a little cramped, but hop in.

1104
00:41:56,028 --> 00:42:10,007
 

1105
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:13,046
Oh, mind if I keep it on?

1106
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:13,048
 

1107
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:14,088
Um, sure.

1108
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:45,050
 

1109
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,046
What unusual music...

1110
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:47,074
 

1111
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:51,006
Its a group of five Hungarians called "Muzsikas".

1112
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:51,006
 

1113
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:53,032
Oh, Hungarian?

1114
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:53,034
 

1115
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,038
Yep.

1116
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:54,064
 

1117
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:55,098
Do you know much about it?

1118
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:56,056
 

1119
00:42:56,056 --> 00:43:00,040
A little.  It's music for peasants.  I like it 'cause I'm one, too.

1120
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,092
 

1121
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:02,068
Wow, that's cool.

1122
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,030
 

1123
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,048
Isn't it?

1124
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:28,000
 

1125
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,024
You recall the time,  when we all had a sake party at the main farmhouse after the rice harvest, that one time...?

1126
00:43:32,024 --> 00:43:32,026
 

1127
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,072
Umm, oh...

1128
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:33,072
 

1129
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:38,014
Yep.  And that time, a buncha guys crashed the party?  Don't you recall that...?

1130
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:38,054
 

1131
00:43:38,054 --> 00:43:48,042
Well, to be quite frank, since they got wind of a young Tokyo gal being there, they decided to go check her out.  I was one of those fellas.

1132
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,068
 

1133
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:49,094
Ah, ah...

1134
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,076
 

1135
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:51,086
That fool!

1136
00:43:51,086 --> 00:44:03,000
 

1137
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,050
You came out here to pick benibana?  Are you into dyes or something?

1138
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:08,052
 

1139
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:16,090
No, just curious.  You see, benibana are unusual...but maybe not so much for people here.

1140
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:16,090
 

1141
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:25,020
Nah.  What's famous is just the name of the cosmetics made from it, but it ain't so common anymore.  Like my farm doesn't make it these days, for one example.

1142
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,022
 

1143
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:27,030
But I heard it prospered during the Edo era.

1144
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,032
 

1145
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:34,028
True, 'cause there was a politician who gained influence through its sales.  It would've been a big deal for the wealthier people, but it was only a product as far as we peasants were concerned.

1146
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:36,096
 

1147
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:38,024
Ummm...

1148
00:44:38,024 --> 00:44:38,032
 

1149
00:44:38,032 --> 00:44:42,090
``In the end,/Someone else's skin would be touched by/The vermillion flower.'' Do you know this one?

1150
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,092
 

1151
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:46,064
Right, its a haiku by Basho {<Matsuo Basho>}, right?  I had looked it up before I came here.

1152
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:46,064
 

1153
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:51,096
Do tell?  Well, honestly, I looked it up myself yesterday.

1154
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:51,098
 

1155
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:54,052
Really...

1156
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:55,022
 

1157
00:44:55,022 --> 00:45:03,058
That same book also said that the women who gathered the flowers never were able to wear the lipstick made from them.

1158
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:13,040
 

1159
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,038
Is there going to be a festival here?

1160
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:15,040
 

1161
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,050
Yep, the riverbank'll be full of people.

1162
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:30,004
 

1163
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:34,022
Agriculture's still in trouble, isn't it, with fields being reduced to make way for markets, and such.

1164
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:34,024
 

1165
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:42,020
Sure, already there's a lot of trouble, and if it goes on, Japanese agriculture'll be ruined.  Just some day, suddenly ``poof,'' and it's gone.

1166
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,072
 

1167
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:51,062
But y'know, even with all this trouble or not, if you're trying your best, it still doesn't come easy.  The work in the big city must be the same, right?

1168
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,062
 

1169
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:57,056
Sure...but the people who think work is everything are becoming fewer in number.

1170
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,074
 

1171
00:45:58,074 --> 00:46:00,050
How 'bout you, Taeko-san [Taeko]?

1172
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,052
 

1173
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:02,064
Huh?  Me?

1174
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:04,094
 

1175
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:10,002
I don't think I'm obsessed...with work, but I don't hate it, either.

1176
00:46:10,002 --> 00:46:12,004
 

1177
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:18,058
As for me, well, I think I can do my best in agriculture, 'cause its so interesting to raise living things.

1178
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:19,080
 

1179
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,082
You...raise livestock?

1180
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:21,084
 

1181
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:23,004
Huh?

1182
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:23,086
 

1183
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:33,071
No, that's not what I meant.  I do have cows and chickens, but I don't mean livestock.  Hey, look there...rice, as well as apples and cherries, they're all living things.

1184
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:34,044
 

1185
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,022
Ohh.

1186
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:35,044
 

1187
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:41,096
Yep.  If I take care of them the best I can, I feel like they respond to me by trying to grow up their best.

1188
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:44,082
 

1189
00:46:44,082 --> 00:46:48,036
I guess I'm sounding a bit like some hotshot farmer, huh?

1190
00:46:48,036 --> 00:46:48,052
 

1191
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:51,052
Not at all...I feel I understand.

1192
00:46:51,052 --> 00:46:52,012
 

1193
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:57,080
To be frank, I was working at a company until recently.  I'm really just a beginning farmer, so...

1194
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,058
 

1195
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:02,012
Oh...is that so?

1196
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:02,078
 

1197
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:07,068
So y'know, with my parents still in good health, maybe that's why my attitude is positive.   But that's how I have to be, you see?

1198
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:09,074
 

1199
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:16,030
I quit the company because someone doing ``organic farming'' called me and asked me to try it, too.  Everyone said I was a fool, but so far, I have no regrets.

1200
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,036
 

1201
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:19,004
``Organic farming?''

1202
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:21,020
 

1203
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:27,062
``Farming that requires guts...farming that gives you guts.'' That's a little joke.

1204
00:47:27,062 --> 00:47:28,046
 

1205
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:34,088
An ``organic farm'' uses as much compost as possible and as few agricultural chemicals and chemical fertilizers as possible.

1206
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,018
 

1207
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,076
Ohh, I've heard about this, it's non-chemical or uses few chemicals.

1208
00:47:38,076 --> 00:47:38,076
 

1209
00:47:38,076 --> 00:47:42,019
But that's not right, it sounds so negative.

1210
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:42,082
 

1211
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:50,040
It's really an ideal agriculture that takes advantage of the life force of living things.  And people are only beneficial to it.  That's what makes the whole idea so cool.

1212
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,012
 

1213
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:51,078
Huh.

1214
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,024
 

1215
00:47:53,024 --> 00:47:56,060
But this ``helping'' part is extremely hard.

1216
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:04,020
 

1217
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,084
Well, I've been told to take you directly to the fields...

1218
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,004
 

1219
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:08,070
Right, I'm ready to help out.

1220
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,018
 

1221
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,044
Oh?  You're not going to sleep?

1222
00:48:11,044 --> 00:48:11,090
 

1223
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,004
You see, I heard that benibana should be picked in the early morning, when the dew makes the thorns soft.

1224
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:17,004
 

1225
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,054
Well, that's true, but...

1226
00:48:18,054 --> 00:48:18,054
 

1227
00:48:18,054 --> 00:48:24,096
I'm a night owl, so I thought the best way to switch my life to being a morning person is to come by a night train.

1228
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:25,016
 

1229
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:27,074
Huh, you really get into it, huh?

1230
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:55,086
 

1231
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:56,040
There it is!

1232
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:55,002
 

1233
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:56,088
Good morning!

1234
00:49:56,088 --> 00:50:06,060
 

1235
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,090
Taeko-san, welcome back!

1236
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:08,092
 

1237
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:10,034
Once again, I'm in your debt.

1238
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:12,054
 

1239
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:15,090
Obaa-chan, its good to see you doing well.

1240
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,060
 

1241
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,012
Welcome, welcome.

1242
00:50:19,012 --> 00:50:19,014
 

1243
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:20,010
Aren't you tired?

1244
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:20,044
 

1245
00:50:20,044 --> 00:50:22,072
No, not at all.

1246
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:23,002
 

1247
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:25,064
I made your bed for you just in case...

1248
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:25,098
 

1249
00:50:25,098 --> 00:50:29,004
I'm fine, look--I'm full of energy!

1250
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:29,042
 

1251
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:33,082
Wow, you really are ready--you're wearing a farming uniform.

1252
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:34,052
 

1253
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:36,088
Though this is all I'm prepared for.

1254
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:37,050
 

1255
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:45,086
Young farmers' wives seldom wear them these days.  But Taeko-san, you're more into it.

1256
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:46,014
 

1257
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,098
Ain't that a fact.

1258
00:50:47,098 --> 00:51:11,044
 

1259
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:12,062
Taeko-san!

1260
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:14,064
 

1261
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:16,000
Quit that!

1262
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,050
 

1263
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,086
And thus began my second experience with country life.

1264
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:34,058
 

1265
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:39,042
How can such a vivid crimson color be born from this flower?

1266
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:40,074
 

1267
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:43,070
Kiyoko 'ne-san [my sister-in-law, Kiyoko] once told me a sad story that goes with it.

1268
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,082
 

1269
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:47,012
Long ago, there were no such things as rubber gloves.

1270
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:48,000
 

1271
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,022
When the young girls picked the flowers with their bare hands, they were pricked by the thorns and bled.  The blood turned the color deeper crimson.

1272
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:58,098
 

1273
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:07,074
I felt as if I heard the hostile feeling the girls, who never got to put the red color on their lips, must have had against the women in Kyoto that wore it.

1274
00:52:07,074 --> 00:52:09,068
 

1275
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:19,078
In order to get a handful of rouge, 60 heads of flowers are necessary. That shining, iridescent color had the same value as gold back then, I've heard.

1276
00:52:19,078 --> 00:53:46,094
 

1277
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:55,056
After washing them with water and stamping on them, kneading them by hand, and letting them sit in the air and water, they become oxidized, and begin to get closer to red in color.

1278
00:53:55,056 --> 00:53:59,046
 

1279
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:05,028
In addition to that, if you let it sit two or three more days, the flower will ferment, becoming sticky, and turn into a deep red.

1280
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:08,080
 

1281
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:17,098
Next, you stamp it with a mortar, squeeze it, and shape it into balls. And if you dry it in an oven, you finally are done with the flower patty, from which the main ingredient of rouge is made.

1282
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:23,032
 

1283
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:26,056
A long time ago they didn't waste the remaining water which we got from compressing it earlier.  Now this by-product usually goes unsaved.

1284
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:26,099
 

1285
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:33,034
The crimson color, which is still in the leftover water, could be used for making a dye, which cloth can be stained in.  This is the "benibana-dye."

1286
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:33,076
 

1287
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:37,010
Be dyed!  Be dyed!/It's benibana-dye!

1288
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,010
 

1289
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,071
Nice colors dye well--Nice colors make my heart brave.

1290
00:54:40,071 --> 00:54:41,052
 

1291
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:49,066
It's said that the village women, who were denied the rouge or bright kimonos, used to add color to their simple lives by using the benibana-dye.

1292
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:54,010
 

1293
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:59,056
The remaining yellow color dissolves in water, and the cotton or hemp is dyed with a beautiful light rouge color.

1294
00:54:59,056 --> 00:55:00,016
 

1295
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:01,036
Oh, pretty!

1296
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,070
 

1297
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:12,056
Although a little time and labor has been cut these days, by using machines for example, every day they repeat the work of harvesting the flowers.

1298
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:40,024
 

1299
00:55:40,024 --> 00:55:44,040
The flower-patties get moldy easily, so precise timing when harvesting the flowers is necessary, for they never wait.

1300
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,044
 

1301
00:55:45,044 --> 00:55:50,090
If you turn around after you've finally finished picking the flowers, you'll see that other new flowers have emerged in the meantime.

1302
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:54,022
 

1303
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:59,022
The rainy season comes without mercy, and sometimes work can continue until midnight.

1304
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,008
 

1305
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:09,096
Day after day passed in the blink of an eye and as I comfortably became tired, I wondered about the women flower harvesters and their conditions.

1306
00:56:09,096 --> 00:56:12,022
 

1307
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:20,076
If I had a chance to help with such things during my childhood, I surely would have been able to write more lively compositions than my book reports.

1308
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:37,046
 

1309
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:39,026
Hey, mom, lemme have 5000 yen<around $30 in 1982>.

1310
00:56:39,026 --> 00:56:39,028
 

1311
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,064
5000 yen?  We don't have that kind of extra money.

1312
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:41,082
 

1313
00:56:41,082 --> 00:56:45,010
You said you'd buy me a new pair of sports shoes, didn'tcha?

1314
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:45,030
 

1315
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,072
Are sport shoes so expensive?

1316
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,074
 

1317
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:48,066
Yep.

1318
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:48,066
 

1319
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:49,082
I don't buy that.

1320
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:49,084
 

1321
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:50,098
`Cause they're PUMAs.

1322
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:51,000
 

1323
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,040
PUMA?

1324
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,042
 

1325
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,086
Yep, Pu...ma!

1326
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:56,022
 

1327
00:56:56,022 --> 00:57:00,058
I don't know anything about Pumas, but I DO know you can find ones for cheaper.

1328
00:57:00,058 --> 00:57:00,098
 

1329
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:02,092
Like how about the same kind you have now?

1330
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:02,094
 

1331
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:05,056
No one's wearing boring shoes like them anymore.

1332
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:05,076
 

1333
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:08,072
Everybody's getting Puma sports shoes.

1334
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:08,072
 

1335
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:09,092
Who's everybody?

1336
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:09,094
 

1337
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:13,084
Kako-chan an' Megu-chan, an' also Ya-chan n' Non-chan.

1338
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:13,084
 

1339
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:16,056
See, only four people, right?

1340
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:16,086
 

1341
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:19,066
I know others--everyone's buying them.

1342
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,008
 

1343
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:23,042
Nope, you can't ask for that anyway when you're not helping with the chores enough.

1344
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:23,066
 

1345
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:26,021
Hey, you got another dress for "Barbie-san" {*} ["Barbie"], didn't you-

1346
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:26,026
 

1347
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:32,050
-though you promised to ask for presents only on your birthday and Christmas--and you must have at least known it wasn't your birthday, right?!

1348
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,054
 

1349
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:35,094
I can't believe Dad's so soft on Taeko!

1350
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:35,094
 

1351
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:38,050
Did you promise that, "Ta-bo"<nickname>?

1352
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:38,094
 

1353
00:57:38,094 --> 00:57:42,054
Unexpectedly, my fifth-grade self emerged yet again.

1354
00:57:42,054 --> 00:57:43,022
 

1355
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:50,008
But...you bought Yaeko 'ne-chan a long-sleeved kimono, didn't you?  Even though it wasn't even an Adult Celebration day.

1356
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:50,046
 

1357
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:51,088
That was for my tea ceremony.

1358
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:52,004
 

1359
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:58,064
Well, we see you get a lot of little things all the time, while we get something big only once in a while...right?

1360
00:57:58,064 --> 00:57:58,066
 

1361
00:57:58,066 --> 00:57:59,052
Right!

1362
00:57:59,052 --> 00:58:04,044
 

1363
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:08,064
Would you stop that...picking only the food you like?!

1364
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,032
 

1365
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:12,032
Daddy, you like onions, don't you.

1366
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:12,086
 

1367
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:13,082
Uh-huh.

1368
00:58:13,082 --> 00:58:14,090
 

1369
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,000
Well, as for the long-sleeved kimono, eventually that dress will be yours anyway, so don't complain.

1370
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,078
 

1371
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,042
``Hand-me-downs''...oh gee.

1372
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:21,068
 

1373
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:24,000
Well, some girls don't even get ``hand-me-downs''.

1374
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,012
 

1375
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:25,038
True, true.

1376
00:58:25,038 --> 00:58:25,058
 

1377
00:58:25,058 --> 00:58:28,030
Then give me that enamel bag<purse>of yours soon.

1378
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:28,032
 

1379
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:30,008
Oh, didn't you give it to her yet?

1380
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:30,030
 

1381
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:34,000
What a baby! The sooner you give it to Taeko, the better.

1382
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,019
 

1383
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,034
I don't want it.

1384
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:44,065
 

1385
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,052
That handbag, I don't want it...

1386
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:49,034
 

1387
00:58:49,034 --> 00:58:51,016
Oh, really?  That's fine, then I won't give it to you.

1388
00:58:51,016 --> 00:58:52,018
 

1389
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:54,006
I won't be buying a new one.

1390
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:54,028
 

1391
00:58:54,028 --> 00:58:55,034
Fine by me!

1392
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,006
 

1393
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:59,048
Whew, that's good.  That bag was a favorite of mine, anyway.

1394
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:00,000
 

1395
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,062
I totally hate that one!

1396
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:05,074
 

1397
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,086
Hey, I'm ready.  Could you take care of this?

1398
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:08,099
 

1399
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:11,040
See--and the food gets thrown away anyway.

1400
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,048
 

1401
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,012
Wasteful, isn't she?

1402
00:59:13,012 --> 00:59:14,086
 

1403
00:59:14,086 --> 00:59:17,005
No, don't throw it away! Hey, Mother...!

1404
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:17,036
 

1405
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:20,096
You picked these out, didn't you? If you're going to complain now, then you should have eaten all the food on your plate.

1406
00:59:20,096 --> 00:59:23,031
 

1407
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:26,011
All of my kids are so selfish.

1408
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:36,011
