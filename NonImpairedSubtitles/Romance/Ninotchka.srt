1
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,467
Is there anything I can do
for you, monsieur?

2
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,866
No.

3
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,506
Yes, monsieur?

4
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,208
Just Iooking around.

5
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,429
Comrades, why shouId we Iie
to each other? It's wonderfuI.

6
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,165
Let's be honest.
Have we anything Iike it in Russia?

7
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,228
No.

8
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,208
Can you imagine what the beds wouId be
in a hoteI Iike that?

9
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,744
They teII me when you ring once,
the vaIet comes in.

10
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,643
When you ring twice, you get a waiter.

11
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,581
And do you know what happens
when you ring three times?

12
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,619
A maid comes in, a French maid.

13
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:54,756
Comrades, if we ring nine times....
Let's go in.

14
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,086
Just a minute.

15
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,821
I have nothing against the idea,
but I stiII say...

16
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,920
Iet's go back to the HoteI Terminus.

17
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,592
Moscow made our reservations there.
We are on an officiaI mission...

18
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,602
and we have no right
to change the orders of our superiors.

19
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,570
Where is your courage,
Comrade BuIjanoff?

20
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,903
Are you the BuIjanoff
who fought on the barricades?

21
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,205
And now you are afraid
to take a room with a bath?

22
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,539
I don't want to go to Siberia.

23
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,443
And I don't want to go to HoteI Terminus.

24
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,413
And I don't want to....

25
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:22,076
-No.
-Listen to me.

26
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:25,386
Look, BuIjanoff, if Lenin were aIive,
he wouId say:

27
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,356
''BuIjanoff, comrade,
for once in your Iife you're in Paris.

28
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:30,858
''Don't be a fooI.
Go in there and ring three times.''

29
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:31,985
He wouIdn't say that.

30
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,292
What he wouId say is:
''You can't afford to Iive in a cheap hoteI.

31
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,163
''Doesn't the prestige of the BoIsheviks
mean anything to you?

32
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,633
''Do you want to Iive in a hoteI...

33
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,398
''where you press for the hot water
and coId water comes...

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,339
''and when you press for coId water,
nothing comes at aII?''

35
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,932
Phooey, BuIjanoff.

36
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,808
I stiII say our pIace
is with the common peopIe.

37
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,609
But who am I to contradict Lenin?
Let's go in.

38
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,683
-Are you the manager?
-Yes, monsieur.

39
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,847
Pardon me for introducing
Comrade Iranoff...

40
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,084
-member of the Russian Board of Trade.
-Monsieur.

41
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,058
-This is Comrade KopaIski.
-Monsieur.

42
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,118
-And I am Comrade BuIjanoff.
-Monsieur.

43
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,390
May I ask you how much your rooms are?

44
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,126
GentIemen, I'm afraid
our rates are rather high.

45
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,191
Why shouId you be afraid?

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,065
I might be abIe to accommodate you.

47
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,039
-Is there some more Iuggage?
-Yes.

48
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,268
But have you a safe
big enough to hoId this?

49
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,141
I'm afraid we have no boxes
of that size in the vauIt...

50
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:26,079
-but there's a suite with a private safe.
-That's even better.

51
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,016
-But, gentIemen, I'm afraid--
-He's aIways afraid.

52
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,482
I just wanted to expIain.

53
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,485
The apartment
may suit your convenience...

54
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,717
but I doubt whether
it wiII fit your convictions.

55
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,885
-It's the RoyaI Suite.
-The RoyaI Suite?

56
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,189
Just a minute.

57
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:43,426
Comrades, I warn you, if it gets out in
Moscow that we stay in the RoyaI Suite...

58
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,989
we'II get into terribIe troubIe.

59
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,559
We'II teII them we had to do it
on account of the safe.

60
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:50,435
That's a perfect excuse.
There was no other safe big enough.

61
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,303
-That's right.
-That's fine.

62
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,775
Of course, we couId take out the pieces...

63
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,711
and distribute them
in three or four boxes in the vauIt...

64
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,270
and take a smaII room.

65
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,477
-That's an idea, isn't it?
-Yes, that's an idea.

66
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,414
But who said we had to have an idea?

67
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,978
-That's right.
-That's very good.

68
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,854
-Give us the RoyaI Suite.
-Step this way, pIease.

69
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:31,840
HeIIo.

70
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:35,211
PIease connect me with Mercier.
Yes, the jeweIer.

71
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:41,555
HeIIo? No, I want to speak
to Monsieur Mercier personaIIy.

72
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:42,682
Yes.

73
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,860
HeIIo, Monsieur Mercier?

74
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,691
This is Iranoff,
Member of the Russian Board of Trade.

75
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,698
Yes, we arrived this morning.

76
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,663
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,294
Yes, we have everything here.
The neckIace, too.

78
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,396
AII 14 pieces, at the.... What?

79
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,805
No, Monsieur Mercier.

80
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:04,006
The court jeweIs of the Grand
Duchess Swana consisted of 14 pieces.

81
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,044
Why don't you check on that?

82
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,514
Of course, we have
aII the necessary credentiaIs.

83
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,649
Take care of the RoyaI Suite.
I'II be back in 10 minutes.

84
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,917
-AII right, Rakonin.
-Thank you very much.

85
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,119
-8 rue de ChaIon.
-Bien, monsieur.

86
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,681
-HeIIo, Leon.
-Good morning, Swana, darIing.

87
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,310
It's reaIIy a wretched morning.
I can't get myseIf right.

88
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:45,251
I wanted to Iook meIIow and I Iook brittIe.

89
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,017
My face doesn't compose weII.
It's aII highIights.

90
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,957
How can I dim myseIf down, Leon?
Suggest something.

91
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:54,895
I'm so bored with this face.
I wish I had someone eIse's face.

92
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,125
Whose face wouId you have
if you had your choice?

93
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,566
I guess one gets the face one deserves.

94
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,933
There's one marveIous advantage
to your composition.

95
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,802
However many questions you ask,
you never expect an answer.

96
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,569
Don't you find that restfuI?

97
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,338
-Good morning, darIing.
-Good morning.

98
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:12,676
-Why didn't you come Iast night?
-I was Iooking after your interests.

99
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:13,806
Did you win?

100
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,078
We can forget horse racing,
rouIette, everything.

101
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:17,278
Our worries are over.

102
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,981
You remember the pIatinum watch
with the diamond numbers?

103
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,081
You'II be in a position
to give it to me now.

104
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,353
DarIing, you're so good to me.

105
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,328
We couId be rich, if you say the word.

106
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:30,797
-I had dinner with the Guizots Iast night.
-Those awfuI newspaper peopIe.

107
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,233
You'd be surprised
how many nice peopIe dine with them.

108
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,600
What a gruesome proof
of the power of the press.

109
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:39,004
I soId Monsieur Guizot the idea
of pubIishing your memoirs...

110
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,508
-in the Gazette Parisienne.
-What?

111
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:43,943
''The Life and Loves of the
Grand Duchess Swana of Russia. ''

112
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,949
We won't have to worry about our future
if you're wiIIing to raffIe off your past.

113
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,779
Come in.

114
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,425
Count Rakonin asks the priviIege
of a few words, Your Highness.

115
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,154
-Rakonin?
-He's a waiter at the CIarence, poor deviI.

116
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,627
-You know him.
-Yes.

117
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:03,130
TeII him I won't be abIe to see him
for haIf an hour.

118
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,429
The Count says if it couId be
as soon as possibIe.

119
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,492
It's Iuncheon time,
and he is between courses.

120
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,094
AII right, I'II see him right away.

121
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:12,699
-I can't get myseIf right today--
-Count Rakonin's between courses.

122
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,840
My IittIe VoIga boatman.

123
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,910
-How do you do, my friend? Won't you sit?
-Your Highness.

124
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,044
-Your Highness, forgive this intrusion--
-Have you Iost your job?

125
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,180
No, madame.
Something of the utmost importance.

126
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,383
-It concerns your jeweIs.
-My jeweIs?

127
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,188
I remember one birthday of His Majesty,
our beIoved Czar...

128
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,388
I had the honor of being on guard
at his paIace.

129
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,897
I stiII see you bending before His Majesty.

130
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,332
You wore your diadem and a neckIace.

131
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,364
But why do you bring this up now?

132
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,564
They are here. Your jeweIs, here in Paris.

133
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,334
AIexis, do you know what you're saying?

134
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,205
This morning, three Soviet agents arrived.

135
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,211
I overheard a teIephone conversation
with Mercier, the jeweIer.

136
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,271
-They're going to seII them.
-Did I hear something about jeweIs?

137
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,510
Rakonin has just given me
the most amazing news.

138
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,110
You know Count d'AIgout.
I must caII my Iawyer at once.

139
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:01,623
-I'm sorry, Your Highness. I have to Ieave.
-I'II get in touch with you.

140
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,591
-HeIIo. BaIzac, 2769.
-Au revoir, monsieur.

141
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,751
Au revoir.

142
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,860
This is the Grand Duchess Swana.

143
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,696
I want to speak to Monsieur CorniIIon.
It's very important. Get him right away.

144
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,329
HeIIo, Monsieur CorniIIon?

145
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:16,860
The most incredibIe thing has happened.
My jeweIs are here in Paris.

146
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,203
Three BoIshevik swine
are trying to seII them.

147
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,264
Yes!

148
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,872
Now, we must act immediateIy.
CaII the poIice, have them arrested.

149
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,915
WeII, then get an injunction.

150
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,580
But do something, Monsieur CorniIIon!

151
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,219
But they are my jeweIs.

152
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,187
There must be some way
of getting them back.

153
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,621
What does he say?

154
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,881
But how can there be a question?

155
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,293
Are you my Iawyer or theirs?

156
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:43,960
It's aII right.

157
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,560
Yes, aII right, I wiII caII you Iater.

158
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,127
-What did he say?
-They're pretty hopeIess.

159
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,729
There may be a chance, that's aII.

160
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,138
The French government has recognized
Soviet Russia...

161
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,178
and he doubts that they wiII risk a war
for my poor sake.

162
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:59,976
He might be abIe to make up some kind
of a case, but it wouId cost money.

163
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:03,210
Money, that's aII they are interested in,
those Iawyers.

164
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,754
DarIing, caIm down.
Why do you need a Iawyer?

165
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,652
Haven't you your IittIe VoIga boatman?

166
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,361
Very good, exceIIent, superb.

167
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,362
It'd be fooIish to beIittIe the quaIity
of the merchandise...

168
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,763
but your terms are impossibIe.

169
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,562
My counteroffer is the absoIute maximum.

170
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:20,693
But Monsieur Mercier--

171
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,204
GentIemen, I'm going to Iet you in
on a IittIe secret.

172
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,435
We are undertaking this deaI
onIy because of the prestige invoIved.

173
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,670
And, frankIy,
we're expected to take a Ioss.

174
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,742
CapitaIistic methods.

175
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,680
They accumuIate miIIions
by taking Ioss after Ioss.

176
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,653
This is BuIjanoff, Iranoff, and KopaIski.

177
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,615
Who? Count d'AIgout?

178
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,123
No, that must be a mistake.

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,425
No, we can't be disturbed.

180
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:49,658
I assure you no one eIse can meet
the figure named by my syndicate.

181
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,666
At Ieast not under
these economic conditions.

182
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,723
We can wait.

183
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,669
Do we give the impression of peopIe
who are pressed for money?

184
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,762
Yes.

185
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,773
GentIemen, Iet's put our cards
on the tabIe.

186
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,275
Right now, there's
a Russian commission in New York...

187
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,572
trying to seII 15 Rembrandts.

188
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,079
Another in London
mortgaging the oiI fieIds in Baku.

189
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,546
You need money, and quickIy.

190
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:10,574
My offer is a very fair one, and doesn't
even take advantage of your situation.

191
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,415
Just a minute.

192
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:19,454
-Now, Iisten.
-We have just a minute.

193
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:24,696
-The pieces are aII registered.
-I know. Thank you so much.

194
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,632
-He's cutting our throat.
-What can we do? We have to accept.

195
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,265
Comrades, don't Iet's give in so quickIy.

196
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,139
After aII, we have to uphoId
the prestige of Russia.

197
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,374
AII right, Iet's uphoId it
for another 10 minutes.

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,883
-We don't want to be disturbed.
-My name is d'AIgout. I teIephoned.

199
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,948
If you want to see us,
you must come in Iater.

200
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,118
-Just a word with Mercier.
-You can't come in.

201
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,924
Monsieur Mercier, may I introduce myseIf?
I'm Leon d'AIgout.

202
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,591
I had the pIeasure of meeting you
in your beautifuI shop.

203
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,396
I was admiring the pIatinum watch
with the diamond numbers.

204
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,903
-Yes, of course.
-You remember, I....

205
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,367
GIorious, aren't they?

206
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,171
-You have no right.
-I did not permit you to come in here.

207
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,576
Just a moment.
I hope you haven't cIosed this deaI.

208
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,809
-It may bring you serious troubIe.
-Who are you and what do you want?

209
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,874
Those jeweIs beIong to
Grand Duchess Swana...

210
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,249
and were seized iIIegaIIy
by the Soviet government.

211
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,050
I am acting for Her Highness.
Here is my power of attorney.

212
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,421
You know, Monsieur Mercier,
this is aII nonsense.

213
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,290
These may have been the jeweIs
of the Grand Duchess Swana...

214
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:29,422
but Iike aII private property,
they were confiscated by the State.

215
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,092
We'II Ieave the probIem of ownership
to the French courts.

216
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,693
MeanwhiIe, I have fiIed a petition
for an injunction...

217
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,637
to prohibit you from either seIIing
or removing the jeweIs.

218
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,365
Here is a copy.

219
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:43,942
If there is anything which isn't cIear,
I shaII be gIad to expIain it.

220
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,505
Thank you.

221
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,807
GentIemen, this introduces
a new eIement into our negotiations.

222
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:52,149
-UntiI this cIaim is compIeteIy settIed--
-We can caII our ambassador.

223
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,451
I give you my word,
they were confiscated IegaIIy.

224
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,512
That's right.

225
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:58,219
HoId on, gentIemen,
pIease try to understand my position.

226
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,228
I am not withdrawing. My offer stands.

227
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:03,424
When you can produce a cIear titIe
approved by the French courts...

228
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:04,830
we can cIose the deaI.

229
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,959
UntiI then, gentIemen, good day.

230
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,694
I thought it my duty to warn you.
I shouId have hated...

231
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,205
-to see you in troubIe.
-Thank you.

232
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,265
-I hope you wiII forgive me.
-I consider myseIf very Iucky.

233
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,277
-Good day.
-Good day, monsieur.

234
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,939
You beIieve me, I....

235
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,141
GentIemen, how about a IittIe Iunch?

236
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,151
-WiII you get out of here!
-Yes, get out.

237
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,710
But don't Iook so gIoomy.
You may have a chance.

238
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,847
-We may have a chance?
-That's ridicuIous.

239
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,220
Yes, a very sIim one.

240
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,124
I want to be fair.
I don't deny that you might have a case.

241
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:35,425
We haven't anything to discuss with you.
We'II taIk to a Iawyer.

242
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,591
You taIk to a Iawyer and I'II taIk to a judge.

243
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,100
That won't heIp you.
You can't intimidate us.

244
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,694
Soviet Russia wiII put
aII its might behind this case.

245
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,740
Yes. You think because you represent
the former Grand Duchess--

246
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,799
-The Grand Duchess.
-The former Grand Duchess.

247
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,675
At any rate, gentIemen,
a charming, exquisite woman.

248
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,580
I warn you, if this case comes to triaI,
it wiII be before a French court.

249
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,811
And when the Grand Duchess
takes the stand--

250
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:59,946
Go ahead, get her on the witness stand.
What can she say?

251
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,887
But how wiII she Iook?

252
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,423
The fashions this spring
are very becoming to her.

253
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,860
GentIemen, the judge wiII be French,
the jury wiII be French...

254
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,160
everybody in the courtroom
wiII be French.

255
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:13,668
Have you seen a French court when
a beautifuI woman sits on the stand...

256
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,795
and raises her skirt a IittIe?

257
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:19,272
You sit down and puII up your pants
and where wouId it get you?

258
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:23,168
I suppose you expect us
to hand over the jeweIs?

259
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:26,043
No, I'm not a highwayman,
just a nuisance.

260
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,042
AII I want to do is make things
as difficuIt as possibIe.

261
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,350
Not that we are giving in one inch,
but teII us what is in your mind?

262
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:34,514
Yeah.

263
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,785
-What about my proposition?
-What proposition?

264
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,622
I just said, Iet's have some Iunch.

265
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,537
Hey, Sasha, Sergei, Misha.

266
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,673
What? What do you want?

267
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:09,775
What can we do for you?

268
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,514
That teIegram from Moscow,
why shouId you bother about it?

269
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:15,284
-I've written it for you.
-Leon, Leonitchka.

270
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,723
Why are you so good to us?

271
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:21,458
That's very nice, boys.
Now, wait a minute.

272
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,158
What was the name of that
Commissar of the Board of Trade?

273
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,495
Razinin.

274
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,626
Commissar Razinin,
Board of Trade, Moscow.

275
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,467
-You wouIdn't Iike Razinin.
-No, he's a bad man.

276
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,337
-He sends peopIe to Siberia.
-We don't Iike Razinin.

277
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,967
-No.
-We don't Iike him.

278
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,875
We Iike Leon. Don't we Iike Leon?

279
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,172
Yes!

280
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,677
Wait a minute.

281
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,184
Now wait a minute, how's this?

282
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,485
''Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade,
Moscow. Unexpected situation here.

283
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,787
''Grand Duchess Swana in Paris,
cIaims jeweIs...

284
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,726
''and has aIready brought
injunction against saIe or removaI.

285
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,162
''After Iong and serious study...

286
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,927
''we suggest in the interest

287
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,026
''a 50-50 settIement as best soIution.

288
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,003
''Iranoff, BuIjanoff, and KopaIski.''

289
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,632
If we say that, we'II aII be sent to Siberia.

290
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,472
-And if we have to go to Siberia--
-I wiII send you a muff.

291
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,944
Leon, why are you so good to us?

292
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,811
Comrade waiter!

293
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,180
Why are you so good to us?

294
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,685
Get the champagne to the other room.

295
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,729
That's enough. Go aIong.

296
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:31,022
-Take this to the teIegraph office at once.
-Yes, monsieur.

297
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,447
HeIIo. Yes, Leon. What is it, Leon?

298
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:54,015
You can't hurry such things.
You must give Moscow a IittIe time.

299
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,886
There's nothing we can do about it.

300
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,425
Why don't you drop in Iater?

301
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,983
Yes. Au revoir.

302
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,220
What's the matter?

303
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:04,197
This is a teIegram from Moscow.
It must have been here aII day.

304
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,858
''HaIt negotiations immediateIy.

305
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:09,870
''Envoy Extraordinary arrives Thursday
5:20 p.m. with fuII power.

306
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,736
''Your authority canceIIed herewith.
Razinin.''

307
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,901
-It is Thursday.
-It's 5:00 aIready.

308
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,070
I aIways said it wouId be Siberia.

309
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,745
Give me the desk, pIease.

310
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,386
This is this is the RoyaI Suite,
Iranoff speaking.

311
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,945
Listen, a speciaI envoy
is coming from Moscow today.

312
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,490
He'II occupy the RoyaI Suite.

313
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,118
Move our things
to the smaIIest room you've got.

314
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,287
Yes. Right away, instantIy.

315
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,328
Pass, pIease.

316
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,103
Now this is a fine thing.
Maybe we've missed him aIready.

317
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,077
How can we find somebody
without knowing what he Iooks Iike?

318
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,384
That must be the one.

319
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,017
Yes, he Iooks Iike a comrade.

320
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,796
Heil Hitler.

321
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,327
-No, that's not him.
-PositiveIy not.

322
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,304
-What are we going to do now?
-I don't know.

323
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,476
We must have missed him.

324
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,314
I'm Iooking for
MichaeI Simonovitch Iranoff.

325
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,858
I am MichaeI Simonovitch Iranoff.

326
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,417
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova,
Envoy Extraordinary...

327
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:43,259
acting under direct orders
of Comrade Commissar Razinin.

328
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,232
Present me to your coIIeagues.

329
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,733
-Comrade BuIjanoff.
-Comrade.

330
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,497
-Comrade KopaIski.
-Comrade.

331
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:52,132
What a charming idea for Moscow
to surprise us with a Iady comrade.

332
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,801
If we had known,
we wouId have greeted you with fIowers.

333
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,004
Don't make an issue of my womanhood.

334
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,810
We are here for work, aII of us.
Let's not waste any time. ShaII we go?

335
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,248
Porter, here, pIease.

336
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,578
What do you want?

337
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,712
-May I have your bags, madame?
-Why?

338
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,586
-He is a porter, he wants to carry them.
-Why?

339
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,789
Why shouId you carry other peopIe's bags?

340
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,327
That's my business, madame.

341
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:16,193
That's no business. That's sociaI injustice.

342
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:17,493
That depends on the tip.

343
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,693
-AIIow me, comrade.
-No, thank you.

344
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,793
Ticket, pIease.

345
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,964
-How are things in Moscow?
-Very good.

346
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,010
The Iast mass triaIs were a great success.

347
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,876
There are going to be fewer
but better Russians.

348
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,116
What's that?

349
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,991
It's a hat, comrade. A woman's hat.

350
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,891
How can such a civiIization survive...

351
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:50,090
which permits their women
to put things Iike that on their heads?

352
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,500
It won't be Iong now, comrades.

353
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,704
This is the apartment we have reserved
for you, Comrade Yakushova.

354
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,272
I hope you Iike it.

355
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,803
Which part of the room is mine?

356
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,110
You see, comrade,
it's a IittIe different here.

357
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,144
They don't rent rooms in pieces.
We had to take the whoIe suite.

358
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,671
-How much does this cost?
-2,000 francs.

359
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,434
-A week?
-A day.

360
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,803
Do you know how much a cow costs,
Comrade Iranoff?

361
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,573
-A cow?
-2,000 francs.

362
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:43,543
If I stay here a week,
I wiII cost the Russian peopIe seven cows.

363
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,647
Who am I to cost the Russian peopIe
seven cows?

364
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,850
We had to take it on account of the safe.

365
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,984
For ourseIves, we are much happier now...

366
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,826
since we moved to a IittIe room
right next to the servants' quarters.

367
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,991
I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin
in a room Iike this.

368
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,365
-Do you want to be aIone, comrade?
-No.

369
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:07,601
Comrades, your teIegram was received
with great disfavor in Moscow.

370
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,938
We did our best, comrade.

371
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,174
I hope so, for your sake.
Let's examine the case.

372
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,676
-What does the Iawyer say?
-Which Iawyer?

373
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,210
You didn't get IegaI advice?

374
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:20,254
We deaIt directIy with the representative
of the Grand Duchess.

375
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:23,348
I am sure if you caII him,
he wiII give you a very cIear picture.

376
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,052
I wiII not repeat your mistake.

377
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,563
I wiII have no deaIings with
the Grand Duchess nor her representative.

378
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,831
-Comrade BuIjanoff?
-Yes, comrade?

379
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,200
Do you speII BuIjanoff
with one or two ''F's''?

380
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,044
With two ''F's,'' if you pIease.

381
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,851
Have you some cigarettes?

382
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:58,352
This is the RoyaI Suite.
PIease send up some cigarettes. Yes.

383
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,389
You just teIephone
and you get what you want.

384
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,455
That's the capitaIistic system.

385
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:08,268
Comrades, I am not in a position
to pass finaI judgment.

386
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:11,237
But at best, you've been careIess
in your duty to the State.

387
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,469
You were entrusted with more
than a mere saIe of jeweIry.

388
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:18,740
Why are we peddIing our precious
possessions to the worId at this time?

389
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,612
Our next year's crop is in danger
and you know it.

390
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,186
UnIess we can get foreign currency
to buy tractors...

391
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,818
there wiII not be enough bread
for our peopIe.

392
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,824
-And you, comrades--
-We did it with the best intentions.

393
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:33,793
We can't feed the Russian peopIe
on your intentions.

394
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,987
Fifty percent to a so-caIIed Grand Duchess.

395
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,062
HaIf of every Ioaf of bread to our enemy.

396
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,727
-Comrade KopaIski.
-Yes, comrade.

397
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:45,466
Go at once to our embassy and get me
the address of the best Iawyer in Paris.

398
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,564
Yes, comrade.

399
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,632
Comrade Iranoff, go to the pubIic Iibrary...

400
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,201
and get me the section
of the Civil Code on property.

401
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,146
-Is there anything I can do, comrade?
-Yes.

402
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,974
You might get me
an accurate map of Paris.

403
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:00,112
I want to use my spare time
to inspect pubIic utiIities...

404
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,749
and to make a study of aII outstanding
technicaI achievements in the city.

405
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,053
Yes, comrade.

406
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:07,283
Come in.

407
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,863
-HeIIo. Cigarettes?
-HeIIo.

408
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,335
Comrades, you must
have been smoking a Iot.

409
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:27,804
Desk.

410
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,845
Yes, Monsieur KopaIski.

411
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,977
You are expecting Count d'AIgout?

412
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,988
But he is not to go to the RoyaI Suite
under any circumstances.

413
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,251
He shouId go to your new room, 985.

414
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,724
Thank you, monsieur.

415
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,348
You, pIease.

416
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:03,840
Me?

417
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,046
CouId you give me some information?

418
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:07,247
GIadIy.

419
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,915
How Iong must we wait here?

420
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,288
WeII, untiI the poIiceman bIows
his whistIe again.

421
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:16,023
-At what intervaIs does he whistIe?
-What?

422
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:19,595
How many minutes between
the first and second whistIe?

423
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,497
That's very funny.
I never thought of that before.

424
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:26,040
You've never been caught
in a simiIar situation?

425
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,508
Yes, I have. Now that I come
to think about it, it's staggering.

426
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:33,105
Good heavens, if I add it up, I must
have spent years waiting for signaIs.

427
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:36,514
Imagine, an important part of my Iife
wasted between whistIes.

428
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,644
-In other words, you don't know?
-No.

429
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,518
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

430
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,571
Can I be of any assistance to you?

431
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,770
-You might hoId this for me.
-I'd Iove to.

432
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,708
Correct me if I am wrong.

433
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,840
-We are facing north, aren't we?
-Facing north?

434
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:12,786
I wouId hate to commit myseIf
without my compass.

435
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,481
-Pardon me, are you an expIorer?
-No, I am Iooking for the EiffeI Tower.

436
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,925
Good heavens, is that thing Iost again?

437
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,925
Are you interested in a view?

438
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,990
I'm interested in the EiffeI Tower
from a technicaI standpoint.

439
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,329
TechnicaI?

440
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:30,064
No, I'm afraid I couIdn't be of much heIp
from that angIe.

441
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:33,505
A Parisian onIy goes to the Tower
in moments of despair to jump off.

442
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,770
How Iong does it take a man to Iand?

443
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:41,339
Now isn't that too bad?
The Iast time I jumped, I forgot to time it.

444
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,976
Let me see now, the EiffeI Tower....

445
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,620
Your finger, pIease.

446
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,616
Why do you need my finger?

447
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,157
It's bad manners to point with your own.

448
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,885
There, the EiffeI Tower.

449
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,396
And where are we?

450
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:58,762
Where are we? Now, Iet me see.

451
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,198
Here we are.

452
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,496
There you are and here am I.

453
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:04,230
FeeI it?

454
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:08,072
I'm interested onIy in the shortest
distance between these two points.

455
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:11,112
-Must you fIirt?
-WeII, I don't have to but I find it naturaI.

456
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,739
-Suppress it.
-I'II try.

457
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,077
For my own information...

458
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,586
wouId you caII your approach toward me
typicaI of the IocaI moraIe?

459
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,281
It is that approach
which has made Paris what it is.

460
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,187
You're very sure of yourseIf, aren't you?

461
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:25,818
Nothing's happened recentIy
to shake my seIf-confidence.

462
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,421
I have heard of the arrogant maIe
in capitaIistic society.

463
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:33,126
It is having a superior earning power
that makes you that way.

464
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,295
A Russian. I Iove Russians.

465
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:40,941
Comrade, I've been fascinated by
your Five-Year PIan for the Iast 15 years.

466
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:43,500
Your type wiII soon be extinct.

467
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,142
Taxi!

468
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:15,773
Can you teII me the exact width
of the foundation...

469
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,937
on which these piers are resting,
and the depth?

470
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,912
You don't have to worry. The thing is safe.

471
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,212
-I am not afraid--
-''The foundation is 141 yards square.''

472
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:26,353
-I hope you'II forgive me but I thought--
-Go on.

473
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,447
''Four massive pieces of masonry
are sunk to a depth of 46 feet...

474
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:32,288
''on the side of the Seine,
and 29.5 feet on the other side.

475
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,261
''The girders of interIaced ironwork,
which stay the structure...

476
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,195
''have an incIination of 54 degrees.''

477
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,699
-That's a strange angIe.
-Yes, that's very strange.

478
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:43,260
''Ascending to the first pIatform
is a staircase consisting of...

479
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:46,136
''829 steps.''

480
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:51,343
''And an additionaI 254 steps
to the very top.

481
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,907
''There's an eIevator incIuded
in the price of admission.''

482
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:57,778
It'II take you hours to waIk up there.

483
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:00,184
The eIevator wiII get you up
in three minutes.

484
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:33,849
You gave me some very
vaIuabIe information. Thank you.

485
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,990
Thank you for getting me up here.
I've never seen this before.

486
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,187
-BeautifuI, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

487
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,522
I'm gIad I saw it before becoming extinct.

488
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,868
Now don't misunderstand me.
I do not hoId your frivoIity against you.

489
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:52,899
As basic materiaI, you may not be bad.

490
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:56,102
But you are the unfortunate product
of a doomed cuIture.

491
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,906
I feeI very sorry for you.

492
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,476
But you must admit
that this doomed oId civiIization sparkIes.

493
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,574
Look at it. It gIitters.

494
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:07,979
I do not deny its beauty,
but it's a waste of eIectricity.

495
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,421
What a city.

496
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:13,049
There are the grand bouIevards
bIasted out of the heart of the oId city.

497
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,891
The Arc de Triomphe,
buiIt to greet NapoIeon's army.

498
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,524
The Opera. Montparnasse. Montmartre.

499
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:24,132
And now, I'II show you
the greatest attraction of aII.

500
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:27,171
It'II cost me a franc, but it's worth it.

501
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:30,611
The most unique spot in aII Paris.
ReaIIy, I'm not exaggerating.

502
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:32,873
It's wonderfuI. It's charming. It's....

503
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,504
PIease.

504
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:39,585
What do you see?

505
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:43,184
I see a house. Looks Iike any other house.

506
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,458
-What's remarkabIe about it?
-It's not the structure.

507
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,621
It's the spirit that dweIIs within it.

508
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:52,097
It has three rooms and a kitchenette
dedicated to hospitaIity.

509
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,930
-So it's your house?
-Let's say I Iive in it.

510
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,437
It's such a pIeasant IittIe pIace.
It has aII the comforts.

511
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,941
Easy to reach,
near the subway, bus, and streetcar--

512
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,605
-Does it mean you want me to go there?
-PIease, don't misunderstand me.

513
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,944
-Then you don't want me to go there?
-No.

514
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,541
I didn't say that either.
Nothing wouId pIease me more.

515
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,142
Then why don't we go?

516
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,588
You might be an interesting
subject of study.

517
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,289
I'II do my best.

518
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,826
-Good evening, Gaston.
-Good evening, monsieur.

519
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:30,234
-Is this what you caII the ''butIer''?
-Yes.

520
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,897
Good evening, comrade.

521
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,403
This man is very oId.
You shouIdn't make him work.

522
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,807
He takes good care of that.

523
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,903
He Iooks sad. Do you whip him?

524
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,039
No, but the mere thought
makes my mouth water.

525
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,515
The day wiII come when you wiII be free.

526
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,577
Go to bed, IittIe father.
We want to be aIone.

527
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:48,580
PIease.

528
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:52,416
Count d'AIgout,
there have been severaI teIephone caIIs.

529
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,222
Go to bed, IittIe father.

530
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:14,173
-Now, may I offer you a drink?
-Thank you, I'm not thirsty.

531
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:15,408
Perhaps something to eat.

532
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:18,179
I've had aII the caIories
necessary for today.

533
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,651
Yes, aII the caIories.

534
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,211
What do we do now?

535
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,518
-ShaII we have some music?
-Is that customary?

536
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,055
It heIps.

537
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,626
It has ever since King David
wooed Bathsheba with his harp.

538
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,533
Not being so fortunate as to have
my harp at hand, I'II turn on the radio.

539
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,273
If there's anything you'd Iike to study,
pIease go ahead.

540
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,577
I've nothing to conceaI.

541
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:52,779
This is my desk, these are my books,
and here am I.

542
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,287
Where shaII we begin?

543
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,482
-I wiII start with you.
-ExceIIent.

544
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,292
Let's see, I'm 35 years oId,
just over 6 feet taII...

545
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,454
and weigh 182 pounds, stripped.

546
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,225
What is your profession?

547
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,128
My profession?

548
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,466
Keeping my body fit,
keeping my mind aIert...

549
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:12,165
and keeping the IandIord appeased,
that's a fuII-time job.

550
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,037
And what do you do for mankind?

551
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:15,737
For mankind?

552
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,312
Yes, not so much for mankind.

553
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:23,348
But for womankind,
my record isn't quite so bIeak.

554
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:26,342
You are something
we do not have in Russia.

555
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,487
Thank you. GIad you toId me.

556
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,389
That's why I beIieve
in the future of my country.

557
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,090
I'm beginning to beIieve in it myseIf
since I've met you.

558
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,695
I stiII don't quite know what it's aII about.

559
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,631
It confuses me, frightens me.

560
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,005
But it fascinates me.

561
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,510
Ninotchka...

562
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,639
do you Iike me just a IittIe bit?

563
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,950
Your generaI appearance is not distastefuI.

564
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,418
Thank you.

565
00:34:00,988 --> 00:34:03,081
The whites of your eyes are cIear.

566
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,082
Your cornea is exceIIent.

567
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,560
Your cornea is terrific.

568
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,160
Ninotchka, teII me.
You're so expert on things.

569
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,134
Can it be that I'm faIIing in Iove with you?

570
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,367
Why must you bring in wrong vaIues?

571
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:24,508
Love is a romantic designation
for a most ordinary bioIogicaI...

572
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,547
or shaII we say ''chemicaI,'' process.

573
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,208
A Iot of nonsense is taIked
and written about it.

574
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:30,443
I see.

575
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,647
What do you use instead?

576
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,747
I acknowIedge the existence
of a naturaI impuIse common to aII.

577
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,918
What can I possibIy do
to encourage such an impuIse in you?

578
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,895
You don't have to do a thing.

579
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,858
ChemicaIIy, we are aIready
quite sympathetic.

580
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,962
You are the most incredibIe creature
I've ever met.

581
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:51,937
Ninotchka.

582
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,700
You repeat yourseIf.

583
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,343
Yes, I'd Iike to say it 1,000 times.

584
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:59,310
You must forgive me
if I seem a IittIe oId-fashioned.

585
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,813
After aII, I'm just a poor bourgeois.

586
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:03,049
It's never too Iate to change.

587
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:05,517
I used to beIong
to the petite bourgeoisie myseIf.

588
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:06,610
No.

589
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,451
My father and mother wanted
me to stay and work on the farm.

590
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,991
But I preferred the bayonet.

591
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,026
The bayonet? Did you reaIIy?

592
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:16,029
-I was wounded before Warsaw.
-Wounded, how?

593
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:19,089
I was a sergeant
in the Third CavaIry Brigade.

594
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,197
WouId you Iike to see my wound?

595
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:24,636
I'd Iove to.

596
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,338
A PoIish Iancer. I was 16.

597
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,938
Poor Ninotchka.

598
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:39,586
Don't pity me. Pity the PoIish Iancer.
After aII, I'm stiII aIive.

599
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,115
What kind of a girI are you, anyway?

600
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:44,590
Just what you see.

601
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,826
A tiny cog in the great wheeI of evoIution.

602
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,654
You're the most adorabIe cog
I've ever seen.

603
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,430
Ninotchka, Iet me confess something.

604
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:56,766
Never did I dream I couId feeI Iike this
toward a sergeant.

605
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,439
Do you hear that?

606
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,911
-It's 12:00.
-It's midnight.

607
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,449
Look at the cIock. One hand has met
the other hand. They kiss.

608
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:11,780
Isn't that wonderfuI?

609
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,754
That's the way a cIock works.
What's wonderfuI about it?

610
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,312
Ninotchka, it's midnight.

611
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,359
One haIf of Paris
is making Iove to the other haIf.

612
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,123
You mereIy feeI you must put yourseIf
in a romantic mood...

613
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:23,561
to add to your exhiIaration.

614
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:25,599
I can't possibIy think of any better reason.

615
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,031
That's faIse sentimentaIity.

616
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,160
You anaIyze everything out of existence.

617
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,899
You'd anaIyze me out of existence,
but I won't Iet you.

618
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,907
Love isn't so simpIe, Ninotchka.

619
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,569
Ninotchka, why do doves biII and coo?

620
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,877
Why do snaiIs,
the coIdest of aII creatures...

621
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,575
circIe interminabIy around each other?

622
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,343
Why do moths fIy hundreds of miIes
to find their mates?

623
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,183
Why do fIowers sIowIy open their petaIs?

624
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:52,822
Ninotchka, sureIy you feeI some
sIight symptom of the divine passion?

625
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,520
A generaI warmth
in the paIms of your hands.

626
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:59,865
A strange heaviness in your Iimbs.

627
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:02,501
A burning of the Iips that isn't thirst...

628
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,631
but something 1,000 times more
tantaIizing, more exaIting than thirst.

629
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:10,142
You are very taIkative.

630
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,212
Was that taIkative?

631
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,587
No. That was restfuI.

632
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:25,651
Again.

633
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,567
Thank you.

634
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,699
My barbaric Ninotchka...

635
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:43,172
my impossibIe, unromantic, statisticaI--

636
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,079
Again.

637
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,553
-The teIephone is ringing.
-Let it ring.

638
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,651
One of your friends may be in need of you.
You must answer.

639
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:09,829
HeIIo.

640
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:11,832
Yes. What?

641
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,800
Yes. WeII, I'm sorry. I couIdn't make it.

642
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,366
No, I ran into an oId friend from the army.

643
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:19,806
What?

644
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,314
The whoIe deaI is off?
Are you crazy, BuIjanoff?

645
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,874
A speciaI envoy arrived.

646
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,218
I'II be gIad to see her
whenever she wants to.

647
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,020
She doesn't want to see me?

648
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,659
What do you know about that? Why?

649
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,924
I'II get in touch with her myseIf.
What's her name?

650
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:44,300
Good heavens, these Russian names.
How do you speII it?

651
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,567
Y-A....

652
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,470
''Yakushova.''

653
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,009
Thanks.

654
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:05,348
Yakushova Ninotchka.

655
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,155
Yes, aII right, thank you.

656
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,534
I must go.

657
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,543
Or shouId I say
''SpeciaI Envoy Yakushova''?

658
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:27,078
-Let's forget we ever met.
-No, I have a much better suggestion.

659
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:30,777
Let's forget the teIephone ever rang.
I never heard that you are Yakushova.

660
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,615
You are Ninotchka, my Ninotchka.

661
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,481
I was sent here by my country
to fight you.

662
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:40,152
AII right, fight me as much as you want,
onIy fight me tomorrow morning.

663
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:43,025
There's nothing sweeter than
sharing a secret with an enemy.

664
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,759
You represent White Russia
and I represent Red Russia.

665
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,063
Tonight Iet's not represent anybody
but ourseIves.

666
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,261
It is out of the question.

667
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,566
-If you wish to approach me--
-You know I want to.

668
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,334
Then do it through my Iawyer.

669
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,809
But Ninotchka,
you can't waIk out Iike this.

670
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,173
I am crazy about you.

671
00:39:57,244 --> 00:40:00,611
I thought I'd made an impression on you.
You Iiked the white of my eye.

672
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,148
I must go.

673
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:05,715
I heId you in my arms.

674
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,944
You kissed me.

675
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,856
I kissed a PoIish Iancer, too...

676
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,351
before he died.

677
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:26,096
Yes, Marianne darIing.

678
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,903
No, you didn't waken me.
I'm not onIy up, I'm on my way out.

679
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:31,274
Yes, I want to catch Leon
before he rushes out...

680
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,506
and Ioses himseIf in my business affairs.

681
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:35,981
Everything was going perfectIy
untiI three days ago...

682
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,746
when some horrid femaIe envoy
arrived from Moscow.

683
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,377
Now, we don't know where we are.

684
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:43,048
I'II teIephone you tonight, darIing.
Goodbye, dear.

685
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,924
I seem to remember
some additionaI injunctive provision...

686
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:49,861
deaIing with the property of foreigners
residing in France.

687
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,366
You are referring to Paragraph 59B,
Section 25F of the Civil Code.

688
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,295
Page 824.

689
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,966
And do not faiI to read the three footnotes.

690
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,339
WhiIe you are studying it, I wiII eat.

691
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:21,825
-Where to, madame?
-Can you recommend a restaurant?

692
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,921
There's Grenier if you care for seafood.

693
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:25,898
-Where do you eat?
-At Pre Mathieu.

694
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,093
-Where is that?
-It's just a pIace for workmen.

695
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,399
-Where is it?
-Down eight bIocks, rue de ProveIIes.

696
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:31,529
Thank you.

697
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:50,052
Are you aIone, madame?
A nice IittIe corner tabIe?

698
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:52,058
Or perhaps by the window
wouId be better?

699
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:53,753
This way, madame.

700
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,135
I think this is the first time
you've been in my IittIe pIace.

701
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:04,762
Your face is new to me.

702
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:06,905
Now what shaII it be?

703
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:08,839
Raw beets and carrots.

704
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,774
Madame, this is a restaurant,
not a meadow.

705
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:13,710
Now, here's what we are offering today.

706
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,873
PIease make your choice.

707
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,146
I'm sure you wiII find something
to tempt your appetite.

708
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,063
WeII, for goodness' sake, heIIo.

709
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,225
It certainIy is a smaII worId, isn't it?

710
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,232
WeII, madame, shaII we start with soup?

711
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,365
Fish soup today.

712
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:43,433
I got up at 5:00
to fish them from the Seine.

713
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,070
-Crawfish soup for me.
-Very weII, monsieur.

714
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,376
Then may I suggest
an omeIet with mushrooms?

715
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,781
Bring me something simpIe.
I never think about food.

716
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:53,786
Madame, if you don't think about food,
what do you think about?

717
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,719
The future of the common peopIe.

718
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,950
That's aIso a question of food.

719
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:01,552
I wiII bring you a nice IittIe Iunch,
 Ia Pre Mathieu.

720
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,236
May I say something?

721
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,968
You insuIted him, do you know that?
You hurt his feeIings.

722
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:17,772
It's just Iike teIIing a musician
that you don't Iike music.

723
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,337
That good oId man beIieves in food
just as you beIieve in KarI Marx.

724
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:25,407
You can't go around hurting peopIe
Iike that, Comrade Yakushova.

725
00:43:26,987 --> 00:43:29,080
But you can make it up to him.
Do you know how?

726
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:31,954
By eating everything
that he brings you with reIish...

727
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,584
by drinking everything with gusto...

728
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:36,494
by having a good time
for the first time in your naturaI Iife.

729
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:39,191
-I don't Iike you foIIowing me.
-I didn't foIIow you.

730
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,393
-How did you get here?
-I aIways eat here.

731
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:43,095
This is a pIace for working men.

732
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,298
But my dear chiId,
I am most at home among working men.

733
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,036
I hate those pIaces where you circuIate,
the CIarence HoteI and those pIaces.

734
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,805
This is my naturaI eIement.

735
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,245
After aII, what are any of us?
Working men.

736
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:56,647
At Ieast, those of us
who are worth our saIt.

737
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,082
-Hiya !
-Hi.

738
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,656
Hiya, boys. How's everything today?

739
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,124
-Is the Iunch aII right?
-Fine.

740
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,717
-Pay our check.
-Thank you, I wiII.

741
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:09,023
Great bunch of feIIows.

742
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:11,064
My friend, I am happy to see you again.

743
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,361
I'm aIways gIad to meet a new customer.

744
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,562
And I hope this first visit
wiII not be your Iast one.

745
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,771
He's just an oId man. His memory is weak.

746
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,569
What are you after?

747
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:24,007
Must one aIways be after something?

748
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,272
Your tactics are useIess.

749
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:27,814
I'm not BuIjanoff, Iranoff, or KopaIski.

750
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:30,042
Ninotchka, why must we taIk business?

751
00:44:30,117 --> 00:44:32,915
If you win the suit, fine.
If we win the suit, better.

752
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:34,817
You do me an injustice.

753
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,190
Ninotchka, when we first went
to my apartment...

754
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,523
did I have the sIightest idea
that you were connected with this deaI?

755
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,653
You know now.

756
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,392
I know now that you're a man
who empIoys business methods...

757
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:47,991
which in Russia
wouId be punished by death.

758
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:51,330
Death, aIways so gIum.

759
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,232
What about Iife, Ninotchka?
Do Russians never think about Iife?

760
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,144
Of the moment in which we are Iiving?
The onIy moment we ever reaIIy have.

761
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:04,313
Don't take things so seriousIy.
Nothing's worth it, reaIIy.

762
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,113
PIease, reIax.

763
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:09,283
I beg you, Sergeant.

764
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,381
-SmiIe.
-What?

765
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,084
-WiII you smiIe?
-Why?

766
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:17,189
-WeII, just smiIe.
-At what?

767
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:18,896
At anything.

768
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:23,460
At the whoIe ridicuIous spectacIe of Iife,
at peopIe being so serious...

769
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,467
taking themseIves pompousIy,
exaggerating their own importance.

770
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,533
If you can't think of anything to Iaugh at,
you can Iaugh at us.

771
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,772
-Why?
-Because we're an odd coupIe.

772
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:34,939
Then you shouId go back to your tabIe.

773
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:37,808
No, I can't Ieave you. I won't, not yet.

774
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:39,853
Not untiI I've made you Iaugh
at Ieast once.

775
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:43,180
Now go back to your tabIe.

776
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,082
That's not a Iaugh.

777
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,093
I mean a Iaugh from the heart.

778
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:48,652
I know.

779
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,420
I'm going to teII you a funny story.

780
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,328
Wait a minute, Iet me think of one.

781
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,298
I've got it.

782
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,835
It seems that there were two Frenchmen
who went to America--

783
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,429
On which boat?

784
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,404
Let's drop it.

785
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,078
I don't think you'd care very much
for that one anyway.

786
00:46:06,146 --> 00:46:07,374
ProbabIy not.

787
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:11,146
Here's a great one.

788
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:18,989
Maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it.

789
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:22,892
-Do you Iike Scotch stories?
-Never heard one.

790
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,328
WeII, here.

791
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:26,728
Two Scotchmen met on the street.

792
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,995
And I don't know the name of the street.

793
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,730
It doesn't matter anyway.

794
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:33,932
One's name was McGiIIicuddy
and the other one's name was McIntosh.

795
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:36,874
McGiIIicuddy said to McIntosh,
''HeIIo, Mr. McGiIIicuddy.''

796
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:39,344
And McGiIIicuddy....
McIntosh said to McGiIIicuddy:

797
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:40,778
''HeIIo, Mr. McGiIIicuddy.''

798
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,612
Then McGiIIicuddy said to McIntosh,
''How is Mrs. McIntosh?''

799
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:46,551
And McIntosh said to McGiIIicuddy,
''How is Mrs. McGiIIicuddy?''

800
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,247
I wish they'd never met.

801
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,085
So do I.

802
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,552
How is this one?

803
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:58,429
Two men are Iooking at the moon.
One of them says to the other:

804
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:01,024
''Is it true that a Iot of peopIe
Iive on the moon?''

805
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,729
The other one says,
''Sure it's true, about 500 miIIion.''

806
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,704
Then the first one says:

807
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:09,938
''They must be pretty crowded
when it's haIf-moon.''

808
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:18,781
-So you don't think that's funny?
-No.

809
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,145
It seemed funny to me
when I first heard it.

810
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,421
Maybe the troubIe isn't with the joke.
Maybe it's with you.

811
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:26,857
I don't think so.

812
00:47:27,995 --> 00:47:29,929
I'II give you one more chance.

813
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:31,755
Here goes.

814
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,460
When I first heard this joke,
I Iaughed myseIf sick.

815
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:38,030
Here goes.

816
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,335
A man comes into a restaurant.

817
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:42,602
He sits down at the tabIe
and he says, ''Waiter...

818
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:44,644
''bring me a cup of coffee without cream.''

819
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:47,043
Five minutes Iater
the waiter comes back and says...

820
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,481
''I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.
Can it be without miIk?''

821
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,583
It's good, isn't it?

822
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,356
-Not funny?
-No.

823
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,426
WeII, it is funny!
Everybody eIse thought it was funny!

824
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:06,994
Maybe you didn't get the point.

825
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:09,158
I'II teII it to you again.

826
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:11,466
A man comes into a restaurant.

827
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:12,900
-Did you get that?
-Yes.

828
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,962
AII right.

829
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:17,499
He sits down at the tabIe and he says
to the waiter.... Did you get that?

830
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:19,842
-Yes.
-It isn't funny so far, but wait a minute.

831
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,609
He says to the waiter,
''Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee.''

832
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,708
Five minutes Iater,
the waiter comes and says:

833
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,650
''I'm sorry, sir, we're aII out of coffee.''

834
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,483
No, you've got me aII mixed up now.

835
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:31,991
Sits down at the tabIe, says,
''Bring me a cup of coffee.'' That's it.

836
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,289
He says,
''Bring me a cup of coffee without cream.''

837
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:36,659
Five minutes Iater,
the waiter comes back and says:

838
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,291
''I'm sorry, sir. We have no cream.
Can it be a gIass of miIk?''

839
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,460
You have no sense of humor!

840
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:44,870
None whatsoever.

841
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,668
Not a grain of humor in you.
There's not a Iaugh in you.

842
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:50,209
Everybody eIse Iaughs at it, but not you.

843
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:03,251
What's so funny about this?

844
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:43,048
In addition to the arguments above
enumerated for Iifting this injunction...

845
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,919
we wish to cite the decision of the
High Court of Paris rendered in the case...

846
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,982
of Princess Marishka against
the Government of Montenegro...

847
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,549
on the fifth day of August, 1897.

848
00:49:51,628 --> 00:49:54,688
Comparing the facts in that case
with our present set of facts...

849
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:58,757
we feeI that the treaty between
the RepubIic of France and the USSR--

850
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,305
I'm sorry, gentIemen.

851
00:50:07,377 --> 00:50:11,746
The other day I heard such a funny story,
it stiII makes me Iaugh.

852
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:13,508
It's very funny.

853
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:17,181
Yes, about this injunction.

854
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,788
The hearing is set
for the twentieth of this month.

855
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,881
That's two weeks from Thursday.

856
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:23,858
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.

857
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,519
I know, gentIemen.

858
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:28,758
It's in the hands of the court.
We're heIpIess, aren't we?

859
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:30,732
Yes, it is unfortunate.

860
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:33,863
There's nothing we can do.
Why get excited?

861
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:37,896
We'II Ieave these papers with you
for your further consideration.

862
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:39,908
-Au revoir, madame.
-Au revoir.

863
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:44,438
WeII, that means
another two weeks in Paris.

864
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:46,778
Too bad we have to waste aII that time.

865
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,112
I acted on your suggestion...

866
00:50:48,184 --> 00:50:50,709
and got in touch
with the power and Iight authorities.

867
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,779
Whenever you want to visit their pIants,
they are open to you.

868
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,655
Yes, power and Iight. Thank you.

869
00:50:56,726 --> 00:50:59,388
There is something eIse
which I know wiII appeaI to you.

870
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,430
A visit to the Paris sewers.

871
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:03,898
They teII me it's extremeIy instructive.

872
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:07,131
Why don't you get a haircut, BuIjanoff?

873
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:09,433
You aII Iook so wintry, comrades.

874
00:51:09,506 --> 00:51:11,940
And why do we aIways keep
the windows cIosed?

875
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,307
Isn't that amazing?

876
00:51:19,382 --> 00:51:23,443
At home, there is stiII snow and ice,
and here, Iook at the birds.

877
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:28,486
I aIways feIt a IittIe hurt
when our swaIIows deserted us...

878
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:31,026
in the winter for capitaIistic countries.

879
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:33,385
Now I know why.

880
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,721
We have the high ideaI...

881
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,224
but they have the cIimate.

882
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,460
Comrades, I don't think
I need you anymore.

883
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:44,132
-Is there anything we can do for you?
-Not a thing.

884
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:46,038
WouId you Iike to go out?

885
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:48,168
-Yes, sure.
-Have you any money?

886
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:57,242
-Here are 50 francs.
-Thank you.

887
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,147
Bring me back 45.

888
00:52:01,224 --> 00:52:02,748
Yes, of course.

889
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:05,387
-Yes, that's fine.
-Goodbye, comrade.

890
00:53:12,495 --> 00:53:15,589
-Have you the time, Gaston?
-It's 8:42, sir.

891
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:17,694
I guess it must be 8:42.

892
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:20,731
-You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
-I am, Gaston.

893
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:24,466
If you'II forgive me, sir,
ever since you met that BoIshevik Iady...

894
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,065
I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.

895
00:53:27,143 --> 00:53:29,043
-Have you, Gaston?
-DecidedIy.

896
00:53:30,213 --> 00:53:33,114
Yesterday I was greatIy amazed
when I came from the market...

897
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:35,309
and found you'd made your bed, sir.

898
00:53:35,385 --> 00:53:37,512
Yes, I feIt better for it aII day Iong.

899
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:39,782
I feIt as if I'd contributed something.

900
00:53:39,856 --> 00:53:42,017
May I add, sir,
it was with great amazement...

901
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:45,652
that I found a copy of KarI Marx's
Capital on your night tabIe, sir.

902
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:49,892
That is a sociaIistic voIume,
which I refuse to so much as dust, sir.

903
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:53,633
I view with aIarm the infIuence over you
of this BoIshevik Iady.

904
00:53:53,703 --> 00:53:55,796
But I don't foIIow you, Gaston.

905
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:59,399
Isn't it about time that you reaIized
the unfairness of your position?

906
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:00,737
Your being my servant...

907
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,278
wouIdn't you Iike to stand
on an equaI footing with me?

908
00:54:03,346 --> 00:54:04,370
No, sir.

909
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:06,540
Good heavens,
isn't there any revoIt in you?

910
00:54:06,616 --> 00:54:09,881
When I order you around,
don't you feeI Iike kicking me in the pants?

911
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:11,146
No, sir.

912
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,017
You're a reactionary.

913
00:54:13,122 --> 00:54:15,886
You can't teII me
that you don't Iook forward to the day...

914
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:18,358
when you can come in here,
stand on your two feet...

915
00:54:18,428 --> 00:54:20,760
and say, ''From now on,
it's share and share aIike.''

916
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:24,266
EmphaticaIIy not, sir.
The prospect terrifies me.

917
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,198
Now, don't misunderstand me, sir.

918
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:29,067
I don't resent your not paying me
for the past two months...

919
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:32,073
but the thought that I shouId spIit
my bank account with you...

920
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:34,507
that you shouId take
haIf of my Iife's savings...

921
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:36,772
that is reaIIy too much for me, sir.

922
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:41,010
Go to bed, IittIe father, go to bed.

923
00:55:01,204 --> 00:55:04,970
-I don't Iook too fooIish?
-FooIish?

924
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:09,970
If this dress were waIking down
the bouIevard aII by itseIf...

925
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:12,844
I'd foIIow it from one end of Paris
to the other.

926
00:55:12,915 --> 00:55:15,110
And when I caught up with it, I'd say:

927
00:55:15,184 --> 00:55:18,017
''Wait a moment,
you charming IittIe dress.

928
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:22,148
''I want you to meet Ninotchka.
You two were meant for each other.''

929
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:43,673
Remember this room?

930
00:55:44,814 --> 00:55:46,975
I've never been here before.

931
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:49,683
I wonder whom you're thinking of?

932
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:52,983
I know. The girI with the map...

933
00:55:53,156 --> 00:55:57,593
aIways figuring out each step
and worrying about north and south.

934
00:55:58,528 --> 00:55:59,790
Today....

935
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:01,420
Now, this might shock you.

936
00:56:01,497 --> 00:56:05,092
I waIked up to a taxi,
I said, ''883 du Bois''...

937
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:06,533
and here I am.

938
00:56:06,602 --> 00:56:09,036
You see? Life can be so simpIe.

939
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:12,802
-For 12 francs 75.
-12.75? From the CIarence?

940
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,843
The son of a gun made a detour.

941
00:56:16,879 --> 00:56:18,471
But he got you here.

942
00:56:25,154 --> 00:56:26,485
It's 9:00.

943
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:31,521
That's when one haIf of Paris
says to the other haIf:

944
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:33,892
''What are you pIans
for this evening, madame?''

945
00:56:34,497 --> 00:56:37,193
First, I wouId Iike to take off my hat.

946
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,865
Then, couId we have some music?

947
00:56:40,203 --> 00:56:41,830
A wonderfuI idea.

948
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:45,734
-Radio or records?
-Not radio.

949
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:48,368
Let's have music that's just for ourseIves.

950
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:53,477
I'II pIay it very softIy...

951
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:55,949
because I have things to teII you about,
which I can't shout.

952
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:05,983
DarIing, I....

953
00:57:12,268 --> 00:57:14,566
You see, I couIdn't shout that.

954
00:57:15,605 --> 00:57:16,902
Oh, Leon.

955
00:57:18,174 --> 00:57:21,701
Leon, you know the jokes
you toId me a few days ago?

956
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:25,706
I wake up in the middIe of the night
and Iaugh at them.

957
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:28,249
You know, that's wrong.

958
00:57:28,551 --> 00:57:30,178
They aren't funny.

959
00:57:30,553 --> 00:57:32,783
They're siIIy, they're stupid.

960
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:35,220
And stiII I Iaugh at them.

961
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:39,488
And when I Iook at BuIjanoff
and Iranoff and KopaIski...

962
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:42,725
I know they're scoundreIs
and I shouId hate them.

963
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,730
Then I reaIize who made them Iike that.

964
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:50,004
And instead of sending my report
to Moscow...

965
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:52,563
I go down and buy a ridicuIous hat.

966
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:55,272
And if this keeps on....

967
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,544
-Am I too taIkative?
-No, go on.

968
00:57:59,315 --> 00:58:04,275
And Leon, I want to teII you something
which I thought I wouId never say...

969
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:10,258
which I thought nobody ever shouId say,
because I didn't think it exists.

970
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:17,260
And, Leon, I can't say it.

971
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,334
What a gesture for a sergeant.

972
00:58:58,507 --> 00:59:01,340
-Leon, may I ask you something?
-Anything.

973
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,571
If you don't want to answer, you needn't.

974
00:59:03,646 --> 00:59:07,480
-But if you do, you must teII the truth.
-I promise.

975
00:59:07,783 --> 00:59:10,377
Did you make any change in this room?

976
00:59:11,554 --> 00:59:13,181
I don't think so.

977
00:59:13,756 --> 00:59:17,715
When I was here before,
I noticed a photograph of a woman...

978
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:20,318
on the desk in a wide siIver frame.

979
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:25,163
I thought, what a waste of siIver.
That's aII I was interested in then.

980
00:59:26,002 --> 00:59:29,631
Now, I wouId Iike to know.
What happened to the woman?

981
00:59:52,828 --> 00:59:54,489
The Grand Duchess?

982
00:59:56,165 --> 00:59:57,996
She's very attractive.

983
00:59:58,768 --> 01:00:00,702
She has great eIegance.

984
01:00:02,171 --> 01:00:05,072
She's what you caII a woman of the worId,
isn't she?

985
01:00:05,141 --> 01:00:06,472
Ninotchka.

986
01:00:07,376 --> 01:00:08,775
I Iove you.

987
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:11,505
I suppose she's very entertaining.

988
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:15,882
It must be Iots of fun to be with
a woman Iike that, so witty and--

989
01:00:15,951 --> 01:00:17,282
Ninotchka.

990
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:19,712
You're jeaIous.

991
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:27,522
Leon, don't ever ask me
for a picture of myseIf.

992
01:00:28,064 --> 01:00:30,828
I couIdn't bear the thought
of being shut up in a drawer.

993
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,563
-I couIdn't breathe. I couIdn't stand it.
-Oh, my darIing.

994
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:51,409
Caf de Lutce.

995
01:00:51,854 --> 01:00:54,846
A tabIe for tonight?
CertainIy, Count d'AIgout.

996
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:58,821
What time, may I ask?
After the opera, thank you very much.

997
01:01:02,865 --> 01:01:04,093
Good evening, Your Highness.

998
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,726
Good evening. You seem
to be very crowded this evening.

999
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:10,033
-Can you manage a tabIe near the fIoor?
-CertainIy, this way pIease.

1000
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:12,939
-Count d'AIgout made the reservation.
-Count d'AIgout?

1001
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:16,273
Yes. It is onIy a smaII tabIe,
but we wiII put in some extra chairs.

1002
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:17,471
No, that's another party.

1003
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,912
Let's go to some other pIace.
It's so crowded here.

1004
01:01:19,982 --> 01:01:23,816
No. This is gIory. At Iast I'm going
to have a Iook at that femaIe BoIshevik.

1005
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:25,114
Can we manage another tabIe?

1006
01:01:25,187 --> 01:01:27,280
-OnIy one in the rear, I'm afraid.
-Perfect.

1007
01:01:27,356 --> 01:01:29,916
You mean Leon's bringing
the BoIshevik you toId us about?

1008
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:32,688
-Isn't it divine?
-I wouIdn't have missed this for anything.

1009
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:34,956
We must be very discreet.
If she sucks her soup...

1010
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:37,123
or drinks out of her finger bowI,
don't Iaugh.

1011
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,133
We mustn't embarrass poor IittIe Leon.

1012
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:42,500
He's gone through enough for my sake.
We mustn't add insuIt to injury.

1013
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:44,869
Is this satisfactory, Your Highness?

1014
01:01:44,974 --> 01:01:47,670
-Is it to be dinner, Your ExceIIency?
-Later, perhaps.

1015
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:50,303
-We'II just start with champagne.
-Champagne.

1016
01:01:50,379 --> 01:01:54,839
I'm onIy afraid the doorman may spoiI
aII our fun. If onIy he Iets her in.

1017
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:57,010
-Look, there's Leon.
-Where?

1018
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:13,634
Good evening, Count d'AIgout.
If you pIease.

1019
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:18,463
GeneraI, shaII we dance?

1020
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:23,310
-Is it dry?
-Yes, monsieur.

1021
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:26,871
-Is that right, or do you prefer it sweet?
-I wouIdn't know.

1022
01:02:27,383 --> 01:02:30,409
The cIosest I ever came
to champagne was in a newsreeI.

1023
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:33,216
The wife of some president
was throwing it at a battIeship.

1024
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:35,849
It's aIways good Iuck
to Iaunch something with champagne.

1025
01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:38,018
A battIeship or an evening.

1026
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:43,289
It's funny to Iook back.
I was brought up on goat's miIk.

1027
01:02:43,566 --> 01:02:47,434
I had a ration of vodka in the army,
and now champagne.

1028
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,031
From goats to grapes.
That's drinking in the right direction.

1029
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:12,458
It's good.

1030
01:03:23,672 --> 01:03:26,573
From what I've read,
I thought champagne was a strong drink.

1031
01:03:26,642 --> 01:03:28,132
It's deIicate.

1032
01:03:28,477 --> 01:03:30,775
Does anyone ever get drunk on this?

1033
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:34,344
WeII, there have been cases.
But the headache...

1034
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:38,580
the next morning is worthwhiIe
if you drink it with the right toast.

1035
01:03:39,788 --> 01:03:41,449
To us, Ninotchka.

1036
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:50,526
Thank you, GeneraI.

1037
01:03:53,569 --> 01:03:56,538
HeIIo, Leon! How are you, my dear?

1038
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:59,005
-HeIIo, Swana. Good evening, GeneraI.
-How do you do?

1039
01:03:59,074 --> 01:04:01,542
You're Iooking magnificent tonight.
Isn't he, GeneraI?

1040
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,703
-Thank you.
-Is this your new dress suit?

1041
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:06,213
I toId you Benson and Benson
were the taiIors for you.

1042
01:04:06,282 --> 01:04:08,011
-Yes, you did.
-It's a dream of beauty.

1043
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,550
Never takes my word for anything.

1044
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:11,279
-But I was right, wasn't I?
-Yes.

1045
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,753
-Am I interrupting?
-No, not at aII.

1046
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:16,052
Your Highness,
may I present Comrade Yakushova?

1047
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,319
How do you do?

1048
01:04:17,393 --> 01:04:19,258
-GeneraI Savitzky.
-How do you do?

1049
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:22,786
I've some wonderfuI news about Punchy.
Do you mind if I sit down?

1050
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:23,991
No, pIease.

1051
01:04:24,066 --> 01:04:26,091
WouId you mind making my excuses
at our tabIe?

1052
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:29,069
-CertainIy.
-WiII you say I'II be back soon?

1053
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:33,273
We can be proud of our Punchy.
He had a triumph at the dog show.

1054
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:36,072
He won another bIue ribbon
and bit the judge.

1055
01:04:36,145 --> 01:04:38,773
I bought him the IoveIiest IittIe sweater
as a reward.

1056
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:42,408
You shouId see him strutting in it.
He Iooks Iike a IittIe boulevardier.

1057
01:04:42,484 --> 01:04:44,850
Count d'AIgout gave me
Punchy for my birthday.

1058
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,686
You must've searched for weeks before
you found anything as divine as Punchy...

1059
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:50,782
-didn't you, Leon?
-Months, Swana.

1060
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:53,419
Poor Madame Yakushova.
Here we are taIking in mysteries.

1061
01:04:53,495 --> 01:04:55,963
-I'm sure you wonder what it's aII about.
-Not at aII.

1062
01:04:56,031 --> 01:04:59,398
I understand perfectIy.
Count d'AIgout gave you a dog.

1063
01:04:59,468 --> 01:05:01,629
You made it very cIear, madame.

1064
01:05:01,704 --> 01:05:04,502
Oh, dear me. I must be Iosing my finesse.

1065
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:07,874
If I'm not carefuI,
I'II be understood by everybody.

1066
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:11,143
-Charming crowd here tonight, isn't it?
-I'm going, Leon.

1067
01:05:11,213 --> 01:05:15,149
But before I go, I must compIiment you
on your gown, Madame Yakushova.

1068
01:05:15,217 --> 01:05:17,412
Is that what they're wearing
in Moscow this year?

1069
01:05:17,486 --> 01:05:19,511
No, Iast year, madame.

1070
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:23,285
Isn't it amazing? One gets
the wrong impression of the new Russia.

1071
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,227
It must be charming. I'm deIighted
conditions have improved so.

1072
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:30,356
I assume this is what the factory workers
wear at their dances?

1073
01:05:30,432 --> 01:05:34,334
ExactIy. It wouId have been
very embarrassing for peopIe of my sort...

1074
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:37,099
to wear Iow-cut gowns in the oId Russia.

1075
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:40,831
The Iashes of the Cossacks
across our backs were not very becoming.

1076
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:43,002
And you know how vain women are.

1077
01:05:43,078 --> 01:05:45,205
Yes, you're quite right about the Cossacks.

1078
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,874
We made a great mistake
when we Iet them use their whips.

1079
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,383
They had such reIiabIe guns.

1080
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:52,386
WiII you do me a favor?
Let's not taIk about the good oId days.

1081
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:54,081
Yes, it's a very wise suggestion.

1082
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:55,987
I'm afraid madame and I wiII never agree.

1083
01:05:56,058 --> 01:05:58,356
The onIy thing we have
in common is our Iawsuit...

1084
01:05:58,427 --> 01:06:00,657
and that wiII be settIed next week.

1085
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:03,892
I understand everything
wiII be over by Thursday.

1086
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,099
Am I right?

1087
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:08,496
Yes. You're right, madame.

1088
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:11,435
It'II aII be over by Thursday.

1089
01:06:11,707 --> 01:06:14,369
It's too bad you have
so few more days here in Paris.

1090
01:06:14,443 --> 01:06:16,411
Leon, be sure and redoubIe your efforts...

1091
01:06:16,478 --> 01:06:20,346
so madame can take some pIeasant
memories when she returns to Moscow.

1092
01:06:21,283 --> 01:06:23,217
-Good night, Leon.
-Good night, Swana.

1093
01:06:27,089 --> 01:06:29,819
Now I think I need a gIass of champagne.

1094
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:52,503
QuickIy, pIease teII me
one of your funny stories.

1095
01:06:52,581 --> 01:06:53,980
A funny story?

1096
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:58,110
You never finished the one
about the two Scotchmen with the names.

1097
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:01,816
PIease.

1098
01:07:03,992 --> 01:07:06,290
WeII, there were two Scotchmen.

1099
01:07:07,229 --> 01:07:10,665
One's name was McIntosh
and the other one was McGiIIicuddy.

1100
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,632
They met on the street.

1101
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:18,499
No, I'II teII you another story.
A much better one.

1102
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:23,877
The onIy thing that'II be over
on Thursday wiII be the Iawsuit.

1103
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:28,444
There wiII be no Thursday for us.
Next week or any other week.

1104
01:07:28,517 --> 01:07:32,044
I won't Iet it happen.
I'II tear it out of the caIendar.

1105
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:35,657
Isn't that a good story?

1106
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:40,053
WonderfuI, if one couId beIieve it.

1107
01:07:41,396 --> 01:07:43,057
You must, darIing.

1108
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,937
To the IoveIiest story I ever heard.

1109
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,984
Let's dance.

1110
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,396
Leon, something is the matter.

1111
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,236
You just made that trip
from goats to grapes a IittIe too quickIy.

1112
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:29,710
Everything is so wonderfuI.
It's getting farther and farther away.

1113
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:31,678
-What, darIing?
-Thursday.

1114
01:08:31,747 --> 01:08:35,114
Yes, don't worry,
everything's going to be aII right.

1115
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:40,278
Comrades!

1116
01:08:40,355 --> 01:08:42,118
DarIing, pIease.

1117
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,317
I want to taIk to my brothers.

1118
01:08:44,493 --> 01:08:48,293
Don't shush me, pIease. I am the peopIe.
I want to hoId a speech.

1119
01:08:48,363 --> 01:08:51,423
-I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess.
-You can't do that.

1120
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,731
Oh, comrades! The good peopIe of France!

1121
01:08:54,803 --> 01:08:58,534
-Now, Ninotchka.
-But they're aII grand duchesses here.

1122
01:08:58,607 --> 01:09:02,008
I ordered out thousands of
grand duchesses and I want to teII them.

1123
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:05,774
Yes, dear, you're quite right. But first,
you're going through that door.

1124
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:08,645
You're going to Iie down
and take some spirits of ammonia.

1125
01:09:08,717 --> 01:09:10,651
-No speech?
-No speech.

1126
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:13,286
I Iove you, my IittIe Leonitchka.

1127
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:16,153
And I adore you, Ninotchka.
Go ahead, now.

1128
01:09:19,428 --> 01:09:22,420
-No speech?
-No. For heaven's sake, no speech.

1129
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:31,169
-Give me a doubIe brandy.
-Yes, sir.

1130
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:53,657
I'm sorry, Count, it is most embarrassing,
but the Iady you brought with you...

1131
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:56,220
is spreading communistic propaganda
in the powder room.

1132
01:09:56,298 --> 01:09:58,823
What? Give me another doubIe brandy.

1133
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:02,401
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere,
but inciting the attendants...

1134
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:04,098
of the powder room to go on strike?

1135
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:06,834
If she succeeds,
the consequences wiII be disastrous.

1136
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,170
What can I do about it?

1137
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:11,269
She has been asked to Ieave
the powder room, but without success.

1138
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:15,180
We wouId appreciate it very much
if you wouId see to it yourseIf.

1139
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:19,242
-You want me to go in there?
-I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

1140
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,440
-Make it a tripIe brandy.
-Yes, sir.

1141
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,317
AII right, teII the Grand Duchess.
TeII everybody.

1142
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:03,527
They know it anyway.
It doesn't make any difference. Get out.

1143
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:07,858
-Don't teII them where we're going.
-No, darIing, nobody wiII find us.

1144
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:11,933
-Are we going to buiId our IittIe house?
-Yes, a IittIe white house.

1145
01:11:12,007 --> 01:11:15,340
-No, not white.
-AII right, we'II make it red.

1146
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:19,738
No, Iet's not have any coIor. No coIor.
Just a ''house'' house.

1147
01:11:20,716 --> 01:11:23,446
-Let's form our own party.
-Right.

1148
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:25,543
Lovers of the worId, unite.

1149
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,453
-And we won't stretch up our arms.
-No!

1150
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,020
-And we won't cIench our fists.
-No.

1151
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:34,290
-Our saIute wiII be a kiss.
-Yes.

1152
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,194
A kiss. SaIute.

1153
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:44,338
I am so happy.

1154
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:49,269
No one can be so happy
without being punished.

1155
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:52,438
I wiII be punished,
and I shouId be punished.

1156
01:11:53,348 --> 01:11:57,216
-Leon, I want to confess.
-I know. It's the Russian souI.

1157
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:59,276
WeII, everyone wants to confess.

1158
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:02,721
And if they don't confess,
they make them confess.

1159
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:04,919
I am a traitor.

1160
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,454
When I kissed you,
I betrayed a Russian ideaI.

1161
01:12:09,397 --> 01:12:11,831
I shouId be stood up against the waII.

1162
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,097
-WouId that make you any happier?
-Much happier.

1163
01:12:16,438 --> 01:12:17,803
AII right.

1164
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:58,843
I've paid the penaIty.
Now, Iet's have some music.

1165
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:02,546
-Yes, Iet's turn on the radio.
-Radio? What's radio?

1166
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:06,019
Radio's a IittIe box that you buy
on the instaIIment pIan...

1167
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:09,750
and before you tune it in,
they teII you there's a new modeI out.

1168
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:14,592
Yes, I know where that is.
There's one around here somewhere.

1169
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:18,290
It has a IittIe knob that you turn.

1170
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:21,665
-A IittIe knob, that's right.
-Yeah. Maybe it's in here.

1171
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:24,569
-Just a IittIe knob.
-It's a radio and has a knob.

1172
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:28,837
Now, maybe it's in here.
Let's see. There it is.

1173
01:13:29,177 --> 01:13:31,907
-There's the knob.
-There's the knob.

1174
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:34,107
Now, what shaII we get, the news?

1175
01:13:34,216 --> 01:13:38,016
No news. We don't want to know
what's happening in the worId.

1176
01:13:38,086 --> 01:13:40,384
We want to be Ieft aIone, don't we?

1177
01:13:40,455 --> 01:13:43,083
Yes, darIing, aII by ourseIves.

1178
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:47,424
Then turn to the Ieft and stop at seven.

1179
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:52,425
Turn to the Ieft and stop at seven.

1180
01:13:56,905 --> 01:13:59,999
-No music.
-No music.

1181
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:03,476
There it is, Thursday.

1182
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,479
You can't rip it out of the week.

1183
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:11,342
There they are.

1184
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,316
-They're terribIe things, those jeweIs.
-But big.

1185
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:18,958
They are the tears of OId Russia.

1186
01:14:19,995 --> 01:14:23,123
-See that stone?
-Who cried that one?

1187
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:26,596
Czar Peter gave it to his wife,
Catherine the Great.

1188
01:14:27,135 --> 01:14:30,298
For it he soId 10,000 serfs in the market.

1189
01:14:30,372 --> 01:14:34,274
But, darIing, don't get impatient.
Wait tiII we're married.

1190
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:38,137
You know that worthIess butIer of mine,
that reactionary?

1191
01:14:38,747 --> 01:14:40,977
Some day I'II come home
to you and I'II say:

1192
01:14:41,049 --> 01:14:44,644
''DarIing, I drove Gaston
to the market this morning...

1193
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:48,319
''and Iook what I got for him.''

1194
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:51,383
DarIing, come here.
Let me put this on you.

1195
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:54,553
-No.
-Yes, you wiII teach these jeweIs.

1196
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,731
For the first time,
they wiII Iearn how they can reaIIy Iook.

1197
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,700
They beIong to the peopIe.

1198
01:15:00,769 --> 01:15:03,169
And I give them back to the peopIe.

1199
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:06,774
I make you Ninotchka the Great...

1200
01:15:07,509 --> 01:15:09,477
Duchess of the PeopIe...

1201
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:12,806
Grand Duchess of the PeopIe.

1202
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:17,109
-Is this the wish of the masses?
-It is their wish.

1203
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:21,214
Thank you, Leon. Thank you, masses.

1204
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:24,817
-Can I make a speech now?
-PIease.

1205
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:29,088
Comrades, peopIe of the worId.

1206
01:15:29,564 --> 01:15:33,000
The revoIution is on the march. I know.

1207
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:37,335
Bombs wiII faII, civiIization wiII crumbIe...

1208
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:40,272
but not yet, pIease.

1209
01:15:40,842 --> 01:15:43,003
Wait. What's the hurry?

1210
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:46,671
Give us our moment. Let's be happy.

1211
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:51,642
-We're happy, aren't we, Leon?
-Yes, darIing.

1212
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:56,320
So happy and so tired.

1213
01:16:58,653 --> 01:17:02,316
SmiIe, IittIe father. SmiIe.

1214
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,608
Come in.

1215
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:42,389
-Good morning.
-What?

1216
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:47,760
It's tomorrow morning. Tomorrow noon,
to be exact. I hope you'II forgive me.

1217
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:51,636
I know it's extremeIy crueI
to awaken anyone at such an hour.

1218
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:56,267
Don't you recognize me?
I'm the Grand Duchess Swana.

1219
01:17:58,379 --> 01:18:02,179
I know exactIy how you feeI, my dear.
The morning after aIways does Iook grim...

1220
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,616
if you happen to be wearing
Iast night's dress.

1221
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:06,677
Don't be embarrassed
by my presence, though.

1222
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:09,848
You couIdn't have found anyone
more sympathetic to your condition.

1223
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:11,983
I think we can cut your visit short.

1224
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,552
-Leon is not here.
-Of course not, my dear.

1225
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:18,394
I didn't come here
with any such suspicion. How ridicuIous.

1226
01:18:18,466 --> 01:18:20,934
Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.

1227
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:24,096
What is it you peopIe aIways say,
regardIess of what you mean?

1228
01:18:24,172 --> 01:18:25,867
''I'm deIighted to have you here.''

1229
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,808
I haven't reached that state of civiIization,
therefore I must ask you to Ieave.

1230
01:18:29,878 --> 01:18:33,905
Leave? That's exactIy what I came here
to ask you to do. Leave.

1231
01:18:33,982 --> 01:18:37,850
I don't mean this hoteI,
and I don't mean Paris. I mean France.

1232
01:18:37,919 --> 01:18:39,853
There's a pIane for Moscow at 5:40.

1233
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:43,322
Do you stiII think you're issuing orders
from your paIace in Petrograd?

1234
01:18:43,391 --> 01:18:45,325
My paIace in Petrograd.

1235
01:18:45,994 --> 01:18:48,360
Yes, you took that away from me.

1236
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,565
You took away my czar,
my country, my peopIe.

1237
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:55,868
Everything I had. But nothing more.

1238
01:18:56,404 --> 01:18:58,770
PeopIe cannot be taken away, madame...

1239
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,502
neither 160 miIIion nor one.

1240
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,179
Not if you have their Iove. You hadn't.

1241
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:07,979
That's why you're not in Russia
any Ionger...

1242
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:10,574
and that's why you came here
this morning.

1243
01:19:10,652 --> 01:19:13,416
ProbIems were never soIved
by bowing from a baIcony.

1244
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:16,286
My dear, you don't know how
impressive I couId be.

1245
01:19:16,357 --> 01:19:20,623
Did you ever see me in my regaIia
with my diadem and aII my jeweIs?

1246
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:39,178
EIyse 2763.

1247
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,011
BeIieve me, Leon can't heIp you.

1248
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:45,279
He doesn't know anything
about the jeweIs.

1249
01:19:45,353 --> 01:19:47,651
I give you my word. I swear it.

1250
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:49,948
Where are they?

1251
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:52,652
You were very careIess
with our precious jeweIs, my dear.

1252
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:55,389
They're too expensive a toy
for two chiIdren to pIay with.

1253
01:19:55,463 --> 01:19:56,589
Where are they?

1254
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:59,929
Don't worry, Iast night a very trustworthy
friend kept his eyes open.

1255
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:02,265
He may have overstepped
his function as a waiter...

1256
01:20:02,337 --> 01:20:05,033
but he fuIfiIIed his duty as a Russian.

1257
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:10,000
I just put this on for sentiment.
The rest are absoIuteIy safe, I assure you.

1258
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:13,479
-But if you feeI Iike notifying the poIice....
-You Ieave me no choice.

1259
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:15,914
Won't it be rather embarrassing
for a Soviet envoy...

1260
01:20:15,984 --> 01:20:18,612
to discIose the circumstances
under which she Iost them?

1261
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:21,018
I'II have to face the consequences,
but so wiII you.

1262
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:23,182
Don't forget,
they'II ask you how you got them.

1263
01:20:23,258 --> 01:20:27,058
That's very simpIe to answer.
They were given to me by my mother.

1264
01:20:27,128 --> 01:20:28,993
They were given to her by her mother.

1265
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:32,032
In fact, they're mine.
You can't steaI what beIongs to you.

1266
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,965
They aIways beIonged
to the Russian peopIe.

1267
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:37,630
They paid for them with their bIood,
their Iives, and you'II give them back.

1268
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:41,300
I toId you we had pIenty to taIk about.
ShaII we sit down?

1269
01:20:41,376 --> 01:20:43,469
Let's free ourseIves from emotionaIism...

1270
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:46,012
and try to soIve the probIem
in a practicaI way.

1271
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,514
Our situation has considerabIy changed.

1272
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:52,110
Before I had onIy a cIaim to the jeweIs.
Now I have the jeweIs.

1273
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:55,280
In other words,
moraI ideas have no weight with you.

1274
01:20:55,356 --> 01:20:57,950
AII right, then Iet's deaI with IegaI facts.
You know...

1275
01:20:58,026 --> 01:21:00,586
-France has recognized the Soviet.
-UnfortunateIy.

1276
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:03,130
Under the Soviet Iaw,
the jeweIs beIong to the State.

1277
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:06,860
-France is going to uphoId that ownership.
-Yes, my Iawyer agrees with you.

1278
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:09,528
He says that France wiII uphoId it
in every court...

1279
01:21:09,604 --> 01:21:13,301
but I wiII drag you through every court,
don't forget that.

1280
01:21:13,408 --> 01:21:15,774
And when I say it wiII take two years...

1281
01:21:15,843 --> 01:21:18,471
I am, as aIways, conservative.

1282
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:21,112
Won't those two years in court
be expensive for you?

1283
01:21:21,182 --> 01:21:22,615
I know money was no object...

1284
01:21:22,684 --> 01:21:25,676
as Iong as you couId squeeze it out of
the pockets of the peopIe.

1285
01:21:25,753 --> 01:21:28,745
I may run out of money,
but you have aIready run out of bread.

1286
01:21:28,823 --> 01:21:32,088
Two years is a Iong time
for your comrades to wait.

1287
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:36,288
I see. You've caIcuIated it
in terms of hunger.

1288
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:39,756
No, I just wanted
to be absoIuteIy impartiaI.

1289
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:43,867
Both of us are faced
with two rather uncomfortabIe years.

1290
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:46,600
We can condense those two years
to two minutes...

1291
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:49,666
-if you want to accept my proposition.
-Go on.

1292
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:55,177
I am wiIIing to hand over the jeweIs
and sign any necessary papers...

1293
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:58,452
if you wiII take that 5:40 pIane to Moscow.

1294
01:22:00,288 --> 01:22:04,088
That's not the way to win him back.
Not Leon.

1295
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,719
I think I know Leon quite as weII as you.
Perhaps a IittIe better.

1296
01:22:09,797 --> 01:22:11,355
Leave that worry to me.

1297
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:15,766
Now, 5:40 Ieaves you time enough
to cIose the deaI with Monsieur Mercier...

1298
01:22:16,337 --> 01:22:18,635
but naturaIIy you'II...

1299
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,731
be too busy for any fareweIIs.

1300
01:22:21,943 --> 01:22:25,845
I wiII see to it that everything is done
in the most expeditious manner.

1301
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,676
And I wiII aIso see you to the airport.

1302
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:32,347
That's my proposition,
Comrade Yakushova.

1303
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:53,671
Yes? HeIIo.

1304
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:05,416
Yes, Leon.

1305
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:08,722
No, you didn't waken me.

1306
01:23:09,357 --> 01:23:11,120
I'm fine, thank you.

1307
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:15,485
Yes, it was wonderfuI.

1308
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:19,499
For Iuncheon?

1309
01:23:21,436 --> 01:23:25,202
I'm afraid I can't. I have Iots of things
to attend to today, Leon.

1310
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:27,002
I'm going to be very busy.

1311
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:32,806
To teII you the truth,
I'm a IittIe tired and I wouId Iike to rest.

1312
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:35,377
Maybe you're right.

1313
01:23:35,716 --> 01:23:37,843
Perhaps it is the champagne.

1314
01:23:39,153 --> 01:23:40,552
For dinner?

1315
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:44,386
Of course, 7:00 here.

1316
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:48,552
7:00 wiII be aII right.

1317
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,722
Come in. Yes.

1318
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:56,193
Just a moment.

1319
01:23:57,772 --> 01:23:59,967
-You can Ieave it here.
-Yes, madame.

1320
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:54,193
Operator, wiII you switch the caII, pIease?

1321
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:57,687
DarIing, your present just arrived.

1322
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:02,693
It's very siIIy and very wonderfuI.

1323
01:25:04,906 --> 01:25:05,964
What?

1324
01:25:07,174 --> 01:25:09,768
I won't forget. 7:00.

1325
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:14,447
Goodbye, darIing.

1326
01:25:15,116 --> 01:25:16,378
What?

1327
01:25:20,054 --> 01:25:21,453
SaIute.

1328
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:33,925
-Good afternoon, JacqueIine.
-Good afternoon, Your Highness.

1329
01:25:34,001 --> 01:25:35,127
-Madame, I....
-Yes, I know.

1330
01:25:35,202 --> 01:25:38,171
You didn't find my other gIove.
It's aII right. You're forgiven.

1331
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,934
Thank you, Your Highness.

1332
01:25:40,007 --> 01:25:42,737
Count d'AIgout is waiting.
He's been here for some time.

1333
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,641
Count d'AIgout? Yes.

1334
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:51,919
Leon, darIing. How nice.

1335
01:25:51,986 --> 01:25:55,012
-Have you ordered tea or a cocktaiI?
-No, thanks, Swana.

1336
01:25:55,089 --> 01:25:57,956
Did I act stupidIy Iast night?
ShouId I apoIogize?

1337
01:25:58,025 --> 01:26:01,893
No. I'm the one who shouId apoIogize.
I shouId have taIked to you before.

1338
01:26:01,963 --> 01:26:04,454
Is this, by any chance,
going to be a confession?

1339
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:07,000
-Yes.
-No, my IittIe VoIga boatman.

1340
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:08,831
Have you forgotten
our First Commandment?

1341
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:10,837
Never compIain, never expIain.

1342
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:14,773
It's worked so often and so perfectIy
in the past, Iet's not break the ruIe.

1343
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,810
PIease don't Iook so guiIty. Otherwise, I--

1344
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:20,313
Swana, just this once,
I must ask you to Iisten to me.

1345
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:22,814
AII right.

1346
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:29,048
-I'm Iistening.
-I know you hate the obvious.

1347
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:32,526
But do you mind if,
for the moment, I'm not the Ieast subtIe?

1348
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:34,959
BrutaI frankness, if you insist.

1349
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:38,430
There are 100 ways of approaching it...

1350
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:41,434
but I feeI it can best be said
in one simpIe phrase.

1351
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:43,493
I'm in Iove, Swana.

1352
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:47,931
I thought it was something serious.
How couId you frighten me so?

1353
01:26:48,009 --> 01:26:49,601
It must be serious.

1354
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:52,874
Not so Iong ago I'd have considered
such a statement juveniIe...

1355
01:26:52,947 --> 01:26:54,915
and rather middIe-cIass.

1356
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:58,315
Now I can say it without a stammer,
without a bIush.

1357
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:00,848
I'm in Iove, Swana.

1358
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:04,152
But, Leon, this has the ugIy
sound of regeneration.

1359
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:07,558
-I'm afraid that's what it is, Swana.
-AIways Iate.

1360
01:27:07,628 --> 01:27:10,358
Same oId troubIe, Leon.
Whether you take me to the opera...

1361
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,922
or caII for me at a beauty shop,
you're never on time.

1362
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,869
Now, when it's a question of your reform,
Iate again by about five minutes.

1363
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,272
-What is this, Swana?
-Knowing the efficiency...

1364
01:27:22,343 --> 01:27:25,073
of the French air service,
I think I can safeIy guarantee...

1365
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:27,376
that Madame Yakushova
has taken off for Moscow.

1366
01:27:27,448 --> 01:27:29,848
-Has done what?
-She's gone, Leon.

1367
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:35,118
-You don't expect me to beIieve that?
-There's the teIephone.

1368
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:39,423
If you caII the hoteI,
you'II find you have no 7:00 appointment.

1369
01:27:48,402 --> 01:27:52,133
Imagine. For once in our Iives
we were in Paris...

1370
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,337
-and we never went to the EiffeI Tower.
-That's right.

1371
01:27:56,711 --> 01:28:00,112
They teII me it has a wonderfuI restaurant
on the second fIoor.

1372
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:03,173
Yes, it is an amazing piece
of engineering...

1373
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:06,777
stiII the most remarkabIe
iron structure in the worId.

1374
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:11,448
Leading to the top...

1375
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:15,552
there is a staircase of over 1,000 steps...

1376
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:21,461
but there is an eIevator incIuded
in the price of admission.

1377
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:38,447
Everything's in order,
I hope you wiII enjoy your trip to Russia.

1378
01:28:38,519 --> 01:28:41,317
Thank you. By the way,
I've heard so many rumors...

1379
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:45,381
about Iaundry conditions in Russia.
Is it advisabIe to take one's own toweIs?

1380
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:48,019
CertainIy not.
That is onIy capitaIistic propaganda.

1381
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:50,996
-We change the toweI every week.
-Thank you.

1382
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,668
HeIIo. Comrade Cazabine?

1383
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:58,299
No, I am sorry.
He hasn't been with us for six months.

1384
01:28:58,372 --> 01:29:00,602
He was caIIed back to Russia
and was investigated.

1385
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:04,405
You can get further detaiIs
from his widow. You're very weIcome.

1386
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:07,546
Pardon me. I was interested
in what you were saying.

1387
01:29:07,615 --> 01:29:10,948
When an envoy goes back to Russia
and they don't Iike what he's done...

1388
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,280
they put him out of the way?

1389
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:15,288
Not aIways.
Look at me. I've been back twice.

1390
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:17,957
Here's my passport. PIease give me a visa.

1391
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:22,189
-I must Ieave for Russia immediateIy.
-Count Leon d'AIgout. A count.

1392
01:29:22,263 --> 01:29:24,561
-A nobIeman.
-Don't hoId that against me, pIease.

1393
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:26,691
Why shouId an aristocrat
want to go to Russia?

1394
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:28,564
-Business.
-What business?

1395
01:29:28,636 --> 01:29:31,434
-Private.
-There is no private business in Russia.

1396
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:35,464
This whoIe thing seems very suspicious.
What is the reaI reason?

1397
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:39,145
If you ever want to get into Russia,
take my advice. Confess.

1398
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:41,545
Listen. I'II be absoIuteIy frank with you.

1399
01:29:41,615 --> 01:29:44,448
-I have no business in Moscow.
-I think so, too.

1400
01:29:44,518 --> 01:29:46,918
I want to see a friend of mine,
a very dear friend.

1401
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:50,821
It's a personaI matter that has no reIation
to sociaI phiIosophies or poIitics.

1402
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:54,156
-It's a girI.
-It is Iove which drags you to Moscow.

1403
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:55,786
-Yes.
-No visa.

1404
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:59,156
-But I must get into that country of yours.
-No visa.

1405
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:02,532
But that's impossibIe. You can't do it!
You haven't the right to....

1406
01:30:02,603 --> 01:30:05,800
-Listen. If you don't give me that visa--
-You're going to force us?

1407
01:30:05,873 --> 01:30:09,070
You advertise aII over the worId
for peopIe to go into your country...

1408
01:30:09,143 --> 01:30:11,111
and when somebody tries,
you won't Iet them !

1409
01:30:11,178 --> 01:30:12,839
-Why shouId I take a chance?
-On what?

1410
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:15,143
How do I know you don't want
to bIow up a factory?

1411
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:17,377
-What for? Why?
-Or a tunneI, or a bridge?

1412
01:30:17,451 --> 01:30:20,079
Nothing but suspicions.
That's the troubIe with you.

1413
01:30:20,154 --> 01:30:23,920
Listen, if you don't Iet me in,
I'II stand in front of this office of yours...

1414
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:25,822
and warn peopIe
to keep away from Russia.

1415
01:30:25,893 --> 01:30:30,159
I'II picket your whoIe country.
I'II boycott you, that's what I'II do.

1416
01:30:30,431 --> 01:30:34,663
No more vodka, no more caviar,
no more Tchaikovsky, no more borscht!

1417
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:38,027
-Wait a minute. I've got a better idea.
-What?

1418
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,597
You can teII the KremIin
that's just the beginning!

1419
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:42,642
No visa.

1420
01:30:44,612 --> 01:30:46,876
March!

1421
01:30:47,514 --> 01:30:49,004
Comrades of the world...

1422
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,950
never has there been
such a May Day parade as this.

1423
01:31:37,031 --> 01:31:39,295
-Good afternoon, Anna.
-Good afternoon.

1424
01:31:39,366 --> 01:31:40,560
Aren't you Iate?

1425
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:44,035
No. The opera starts an hour Iater tonight
on account of the parade.

1426
01:31:44,104 --> 01:31:47,904
-Didn't you march today?
-They didn't Iet me. I'm in disgrace.

1427
01:31:47,975 --> 01:31:51,240
Last week, at the performance
of Carmen, I pIayed a sour note.

1428
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:53,371
The conductor got so excited, he yeIIed:

1429
01:31:53,447 --> 01:31:56,280
''There is sabotage in the string section! ''

1430
01:31:57,651 --> 01:32:00,381
Too bad, Anna.
You missed an inspiring day.

1431
01:32:00,454 --> 01:32:03,719
Yes, I know. Are you expecting someone?

1432
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:07,659
-A few friends. Just a smaII dinner party.
-And what are you serving?

1433
01:32:07,728 --> 01:32:10,060
-An omeIet.
-An omeIet?

1434
01:32:10,597 --> 01:32:12,929
Aren't you Iiving a IittIe above your ration?

1435
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,467
I saved two eggs...

1436
01:32:14,535 --> 01:32:17,333
and each of my friends is bringing his own.
We'II manage.

1437
01:32:17,404 --> 01:32:19,736
Just goes to prove the theory of our State.

1438
01:32:19,807 --> 01:32:22,207
If you stand aIone, it means a boiIed egg...

1439
01:32:22,276 --> 01:32:26,713
but if you're true to the coIIective spirit
and stick together, you've got an omeIet.

1440
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:30,580
That reminds me. Have you heard the
Iatest they're teIIing about the KremIin?

1441
01:32:30,651 --> 01:32:33,279
WeII, one man.... I'II teII you Iater.

1442
01:32:45,532 --> 01:32:46,624
That Gurganov.

1443
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:50,397
You never know whether he's on his way
to the washroom, or the Secret PoIice.

1444
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:53,099
-You shouId be more carefuI.
-And you, too, Ninotchka.

1445
01:32:53,173 --> 01:32:56,472
-About what?
-Ever since you've been back from Paris--

1446
01:32:56,543 --> 01:32:59,740
I haven't taIked to anyone about Paris.
I haven't said a word.

1447
01:32:59,813 --> 01:33:02,441
That's just it. It makes peopIe feeI queer.

1448
01:33:02,516 --> 01:33:04,575
And I don't want you to get in any troubIe.

1449
01:33:04,651 --> 01:33:07,950
-I have nothing to hide.
-You shouId. I'II show you.

1450
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:11,554
When I passed through
the Iaundry yard today...

1451
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:15,584
I saw aII the women huddIed around this,
so I brought it up here.

1452
01:33:15,662 --> 01:33:19,758
Things Iike this create a bad feeIing.
First they didn't know whose it was...

1453
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,893
and then they saw the Paris IabeI
and did it start a commotion.

1454
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,370
Some said it's what we aII ought to wear.

1455
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,499
Others said it's Iike hanging foreign ideas
on our cIothesIine.

1456
01:33:28,575 --> 01:33:31,271
-It undermines our whoIe cause.
-I see.

1457
01:33:31,612 --> 01:33:34,172
You know how it is today.
AII you have to do is wear...

1458
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:37,581
a pair of siIk stockings, and they
suspect you of counter-revoIution.

1459
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:40,779
Thank you, Anna.
I'II dry it up here when I wash it next.

1460
01:33:40,854 --> 01:33:44,585
I shouId hate to see our country
endangered by my underwear.

1461
01:33:44,892 --> 01:33:48,521
Ninotchka, I'm your friend.
You can trust me.

1462
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:51,557
-Did you bring back anything eIse?
-No.

1463
01:33:51,732 --> 01:33:55,600
I Ieft everything in Paris.
I just happened to be wearing this.

1464
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:58,069
TeII me, what eIse did you have?

1465
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:01,003
WeII, a hat.

1466
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,232
What was it Iike?

1467
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:07,139
Oh, it was very siIIy.
I'd be ashamed to wear it here.

1468
01:34:07,614 --> 01:34:09,479
As beautifuI as that.

1469
01:34:10,384 --> 01:34:12,375
What eIse? Come, teII me.

1470
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,281
-An evening gown.
-An evening gown?

1471
01:34:17,524 --> 01:34:19,719
Yes, it's a dress you wear in the evening.

1472
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:21,658
What do you wear in the morning?

1473
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:26,222
When you get up you wear a negIigee,
then you change into a morning frock.

1474
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:30,728
You mean to teII me you wear a different
dress for different times of the day?

1475
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:34,205
-Yes.
-Now, Ninotchka, you are exaggerating.

1476
01:34:34,274 --> 01:34:38,233
No, it's true.
That's how they Iive in the other worId.

1477
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:42,004
Here we dress to cover up our bodies.
To keep warm.

1478
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:43,413
And there?

1479
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:48,418
Sometimes they're not
compIeteIy covered, but they don't freeze.

1480
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:53,823
They must have wonderfuI materiaIs
to make a thing Iike this.

1481
01:34:53,894 --> 01:34:55,122
So soft.

1482
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:58,688
-Something you don't even see.
-You feeI it, though.

1483
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:04,170
Ninotchka, I wouIdn't bring this up
if we weren't such good friends.

1484
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:05,637
What is it, Anna?

1485
01:35:05,806 --> 01:35:09,572
You know I toId you that PavIov and I
are going to get married...

1486
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:12,043
when he comes back from the maneuvers.

1487
01:35:12,112 --> 01:35:13,977
WouId it be asking too much if....

1488
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:16,413
-You want this?
-Just for the honeymoon.

1489
01:35:16,483 --> 01:35:20,044
-It's yours for good.
-Ninotchka.

1490
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:24,121
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1491
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:27,354
I'II never forget what you've done.

1492
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:30,157
Am I going to pIay that cadenza tonight!

1493
01:35:44,511 --> 01:35:47,639
...individuals, yes.
As atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia.

1494
01:35:47,714 --> 01:35:52,276
...and 30 million peasants,
85% of the population....

1495
01:35:52,553 --> 01:35:55,454
...into an automobile
and the muzhik into a tractor...

1496
01:35:55,522 --> 01:35:58,286
and then let the capitalists try to keep....

1497
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:04,293
No music.

1498
01:36:09,469 --> 01:36:10,868
Ninotchka.

1499
01:36:12,005 --> 01:36:16,442
BuIjanoff, Iranoff, and KopaIski!
How are you, you three scoundreIs?

1500
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:18,375
WeII, we are back home.

1501
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:20,879
You know what they say,
there is nothing Iike home.

1502
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:22,506
Yes, and we might as weII face it.

1503
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:25,450
Now, you mustn't taIk that way,
you must adjust yourseIves.

1504
01:36:25,519 --> 01:36:28,317
-Let's be brave.
-Brave, that's right.

1505
01:36:28,388 --> 01:36:31,118
-Come and sit down.
-Let's be happy that we are aII aIive.

1506
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:32,351
That we owe to Ninotchka.

1507
01:36:32,426 --> 01:36:35,862
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin
such a wonderfuI report about us...

1508
01:36:35,929 --> 01:36:38,659
-who knows what wouId've happened?
-I can teII you exactIy.

1509
01:36:38,732 --> 01:36:41,223
Let's forget everything,
except we're together.

1510
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:44,464
-Yes, Iet's do that.
-It's a reaI Paris reunion.

1511
01:36:44,538 --> 01:36:48,338
If you cIose your eyes and Iisten
to our voices, we might be in Paris.

1512
01:36:48,408 --> 01:36:52,139
Let's not cIose our eyes. There are many
good things to see here, too.

1513
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:54,578
Look how niceIy
she has arranged the tabIe.

1514
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:59,278
Yes, how IoveIy. And what a
wonderfuI room you have here.

1515
01:36:59,353 --> 01:37:03,346
-How many famiIies Iive here with you?
-OnIy myseIf and two other girIs.

1516
01:37:03,423 --> 01:37:06,517
A ceIIo pIayer in the opera,
and a streetcar conductor.

1517
01:37:06,593 --> 01:37:09,118
Just three peopIe in a room this size?

1518
01:37:10,063 --> 01:37:11,997
BuIjanoff, Iook here.

1519
01:37:12,065 --> 01:37:13,828
-Isn't that wonderfuI?
-Look at this.

1520
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,926
-What good materiaI.
-NaturaIIy, it's not the RoyaI Suite.

1521
01:37:17,004 --> 01:37:20,064
Comrades, once and for aII,
we are in Moscow.

1522
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:23,769
Yes, there's no doubt of that. Just Iook
out of the window and there it is.

1523
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:25,209
And it's great.

1524
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,407
Think what it was a few years ago
and what it is now.

1525
01:37:28,482 --> 01:37:30,473
It's a tremendous achievement.

1526
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:33,178
-You must be reasonabIe, comrades.
-She is right.

1527
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:34,982
Anyhow, Iet's taIk ourseIves into it.

1528
01:37:35,055 --> 01:37:39,048
AII right. It's great.
It's marveIous. It's wonderfuI.

1529
01:37:39,126 --> 01:37:41,287
Just see how happy the peopIe Iook
from here.

1530
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:44,194
Can you bIame them?
At Ieast the May Day parade is over.

1531
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:45,788
That's another thing. It's spring.

1532
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:48,835
The same spring we had in Paris.
Just as good.

1533
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:51,132
-Even the swaIIows are back.
-ReaIIy?

1534
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:55,334
Yes, that's right. Maybe it's
the same swaIIow we saw in Paris.

1535
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:58,538
Yes, it is, Ninotchka. It is.

1536
01:37:58,612 --> 01:38:01,740
He must have been in Paris.
You can see it in his whoIe attitude.

1537
01:38:01,815 --> 01:38:05,376
He picked up a crumb of our bIack bread,
shook his head and dropped it.

1538
01:38:05,452 --> 01:38:08,853
We must be patient.
FinaIIy we got the spring, didn't we?

1539
01:38:08,922 --> 01:38:11,618
Let's forget the future.
Let's stop being sentimentaI.

1540
01:38:11,692 --> 01:38:14,354
-Let's start that omeIet.
-That's right.

1541
01:38:14,428 --> 01:38:17,261
-Here is my egg.
-And here is mine.

1542
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:18,798
And here are mine.

1543
01:38:18,865 --> 01:38:22,062
I don't know where's my egg?
I had an egg, too.

1544
01:38:24,237 --> 01:38:26,137
Comrades, I am out of the omeIet.

1545
01:38:26,206 --> 01:38:28,674
-Don't worry, there'II be enough.
-Of course, comrade.

1546
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:31,040
-Thank you.
-Now come over here.

1547
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:35,305
Come, Ninotchka,
Iet's make it in reaI Parisian styIe.

1548
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:38,317
-Yeah.
-Let's fiII it with confiture des prunes.

1549
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:53,095
A man Iike that.

1550
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:56,602
AII he has to do is waIk through a room
and the omeIet drops.

1551
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,762
Yes.

1552
01:39:45,552 --> 01:39:48,612
Comrade Yakushova, here,
the postman Ieft this Ietter for you.

1553
01:39:48,688 --> 01:39:50,178
Thank you, VIadimir.

1554
01:39:57,798 --> 01:40:00,631
-What is it, Ninotchka?
-Ninotchka, what is it?

1555
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,361
-It's from Paris.
-From Paris?

1556
01:40:02,436 --> 01:40:04,199
-A biII?
-From Leon.

1557
01:40:04,271 --> 01:40:07,035
-From Leon?
-How is he, teII us?

1558
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:45,372
Bad news?

1559
01:41:11,304 --> 01:41:13,636
WeII, I think it's getting Iate.

1560
01:41:15,942 --> 01:41:17,807
Good night, Ninotchka.

1561
01:41:18,612 --> 01:41:20,739
Thanks for a wonderfuI dinner.

1562
01:41:23,783 --> 01:41:26,047
-Good night, Ninotchka.
-Good night.

1563
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,151
Good night.

1564
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:34,683
They can't censor our memories, can they?

1565
01:41:35,595 --> 01:41:36,789
No.

1566
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:13,930
Come in.

1567
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:24,367
-Good morning, comrade.
-Good morning, Comrade Commissar.

1568
01:42:24,444 --> 01:42:28,141
Here's my report on materiaIs avaiIabIe
for trading in the next four months.

1569
01:42:28,214 --> 01:42:30,648
Does it incIude products
of the far eastern provinces?

1570
01:42:30,717 --> 01:42:33,777
-Yes, it does.
-You've finished the whoIe investigation?

1571
01:42:34,087 --> 01:42:36,487
That's marveIous.
You must have worked day and night.

1572
01:42:36,556 --> 01:42:39,354
-Don't you ever sIeep?
-I need very IittIe sIeep.

1573
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:42,554
We must be extremeIy carefuI
what goods we take in exchange.

1574
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:45,496
I have aIready started a survey
on our most urgent needs.

1575
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:49,729
Comrade, I am afraid you wiII have
to turn over that work to someone eIse.

1576
01:42:49,803 --> 01:42:51,270
May I ask why?

1577
01:42:51,805 --> 01:42:53,932
-PIease sit down.
-Thank you.

1578
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:58,409
Now, comrade, have you heard
from KopaIski, BuIjanoff, and Iranoff?

1579
01:42:58,478 --> 01:42:59,911
-No.
-I haven't either...

1580
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,175
but I have heard about them.
You must reaIize...

1581
01:43:02,248 --> 01:43:06,514
it was on the strength of your Paris report
that I sent them to ConstantinopIe.

1582
01:43:06,586 --> 01:43:08,781
Without that,
I never wouId have trusted them...

1583
01:43:08,855 --> 01:43:11,016
on a mission as important as a fur deaI.

1584
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:12,581
May I ask what has happened?

1585
01:43:12,659 --> 01:43:16,117
If I toId you what's going on
in ConstantinopIe right now...

1586
01:43:16,196 --> 01:43:17,720
you wouIdn't beIieve it.

1587
01:43:17,797 --> 01:43:20,231
They are sitting there, those three,
for six weeks...

1588
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,359
and haven't soId a piece of fur.

1589
01:43:22,435 --> 01:43:24,767
This anonymous report was sent to me.

1590
01:43:24,838 --> 01:43:28,968
They are dragging the good name of our
country through every caf and nightcIub.

1591
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:33,445
Here. ''How can the BoIshevik cause
gain respect among the MosIems...

1592
01:43:33,513 --> 01:43:38,109
''if your three representatives, BuIjanoff,
Iranoff, and KopaIski get so drunk...

1593
01:43:38,184 --> 01:43:40,982
''that they throw a carpet
out of their hoteI window...

1594
01:43:41,054 --> 01:43:43,488
''and compIain to the management
that it didn't fIy.''

1595
01:43:43,556 --> 01:43:45,683
UnbeIievabIe! It's an outrage.

1596
01:43:46,259 --> 01:43:50,218
They shouIdn't do such things.
Are you sure this report's correct?

1597
01:43:50,296 --> 01:43:53,925
NaturaIIy, I want to verify it,
and that's why I need you.

1598
01:43:54,634 --> 01:43:58,331
-You want me to go to ConstantinopIe?
-Yes, Ieaving immediateIy.

1599
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:00,805
I appreciate your confidence in me...

1600
01:44:00,874 --> 01:44:03,775
but I must ask you
to entrust someone eIse with this mission.

1601
01:44:03,843 --> 01:44:06,334
I shouId hate
to interrupt my present work.

1602
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:08,677
I am positive my survey
is more important...

1603
01:44:08,748 --> 01:44:11,546
than finding out whether
three of our comrades have been...

1604
01:44:11,618 --> 01:44:13,381
drinking some extra gIasses
of champagne.

1605
01:44:13,453 --> 01:44:15,978
That is for me to decide,
Comrade Yakushova.

1606
01:44:16,056 --> 01:44:19,787
I am sorry. I don't want
to overstep my position...

1607
01:44:20,493 --> 01:44:24,020
but pIease don't send me.
PIease, comrade, Iet me stay here.

1608
01:44:24,097 --> 01:44:26,759
Let me finish my work.
I'm in the rhythm of it now.

1609
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:28,266
I don't want to go away.

1610
01:44:28,334 --> 01:44:31,132
I don't want to be sent
into that foreign atmosphere again.

1611
01:44:31,204 --> 01:44:32,466
It throws you out of gear.

1612
01:44:32,539 --> 01:44:36,270
Let me finish my work.
I have concentrated everything in it.

1613
01:44:36,509 --> 01:44:38,602
PIease don't make me go.

1614
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:42,678
Don't waste my time, comrade.
Do your duty. Goodbye.

1615
01:44:44,017 --> 01:44:45,746
I shaII do my best.

1616
01:45:27,794 --> 01:45:30,661
How do you Iike it, Ninotchka?
Isn't it wonderfuI?

1617
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:33,824
-TeII us, Ninotchka.
-BuIjanoff, Iranoff, KopaIski--

1618
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,368
Now, pIease don't start
figuring it out in cows.

1619
01:45:36,436 --> 01:45:38,529
You've done it again, and I'm responsibIe.

1620
01:45:38,605 --> 01:45:40,300
How can you forget yourseIves this way?

1621
01:45:40,373 --> 01:45:42,637
You were sent here to make money
not to spend it.

1622
01:45:42,709 --> 01:45:45,473
BuIjanoff, she stiII has those
oId-fashioned ideas.

1623
01:45:45,545 --> 01:45:48,173
-It is high time she got out of Russia.
-Comrades.

1624
01:45:48,248 --> 01:45:51,012
-I must be stern with you.
-That's our oId Ninotchka.

1625
01:45:51,084 --> 01:45:55,077
Don't forget the day wiII come
when you wiII have to face Razinin.

1626
01:45:55,822 --> 01:45:57,756
Ninotchka ! Razinin?

1627
01:45:58,424 --> 01:46:02,019
Good oId Razinin. Is he stiII aIive?
How does he manage?

1628
01:46:02,595 --> 01:46:05,655
-Comrades--
-Friends, Ninotchka, we are friends.

1629
01:46:05,732 --> 01:46:08,030
Imagine, we don't have
to whisper any more.

1630
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:09,830
No. We can say whatever we want.

1631
01:46:09,903 --> 01:46:12,497
We can shout, we can compIain. Look.

1632
01:46:16,009 --> 01:46:18,637
The service in this hoteI is terribIe!

1633
01:46:20,246 --> 01:46:23,215
See? Nobody comes,
nobody pays any attention.

1634
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:26,881
-That's freedom.
-That's bad management.

1635
01:46:26,953 --> 01:46:29,649
Is it possibIe to bring you back to reaIity
for one moment?

1636
01:46:29,722 --> 01:46:32,555
I must have a compIete report
of your negotiations...

1637
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:36,083
-and a detaiIed expense account.
-No, don't ask for it.

1638
01:46:36,162 --> 01:46:38,096
There is a Turkish proverb which says:

1639
01:46:38,164 --> 01:46:40,462
''If something smeIIs bad,
why put your nose in it?''

1640
01:46:40,533 --> 01:46:42,091
And there is an oId Russian saying:

1641
01:46:42,168 --> 01:46:45,467
''The cat who has cream on his whiskers
had better find good excuses.''

1642
01:46:45,538 --> 01:46:47,062
With our cream situation as it is...

1643
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:49,768
it's Russia that shouId apoIogize
to the cats.

1644
01:46:50,176 --> 01:46:52,644
I don't know how I can
get you out of it this time.

1645
01:46:52,712 --> 01:46:53,940
How wiII it end?

1646
01:46:54,013 --> 01:46:55,776
-ShaII we teII her?
-Yes.

1647
01:46:56,983 --> 01:47:00,214
-Ninotchka, I hope you'II be our guest.
-Guest?

1648
01:47:00,353 --> 01:47:04,016
-Yes, we have opened a restaurant.
-A restaurant?

1649
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:06,558
We have a wonderfuI eIectric sign:

1650
01:47:06,626 --> 01:47:09,026
''Dine with BuIjanoff, Iranoff,
and KopaIski.''

1651
01:47:09,095 --> 01:47:11,188
You mean you're deserting Russia?

1652
01:47:11,364 --> 01:47:16,063
Ninotchka, don't caII it desertion.
Our IittIe restaurant, that is our Russia.

1653
01:47:16,135 --> 01:47:19,434
The Russia of borscht,
the Russia of beef stroganoff.

1654
01:47:19,505 --> 01:47:22,906
-Of bIinis and sour cream.
-The Russia of pirozhki.

1655
01:47:22,976 --> 01:47:26,468
-PeopIe wiII eat and Iove it.
-We are not onIy serving good food...

1656
01:47:26,546 --> 01:47:29,515
we are serving our country.
We are making friends.

1657
01:47:29,582 --> 01:47:33,143
Who gave you this idea?
Who's responsibIe for aII this?

1658
01:47:33,219 --> 01:47:37,019
There is something in ConstantinopIe,
something irresistibIe.

1659
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:39,388
It's in the air.
It may come around the corner...

1660
01:47:39,459 --> 01:47:42,292
-when you waIk down the street.
-It may step out of a bazaar.

1661
01:47:42,362 --> 01:47:46,423
It may be waiting for you in a corridor.
It may hide in the shadow of a minaret.

1662
01:47:46,499 --> 01:47:48,592
And right now it's on the baIcony.

1663
01:47:54,173 --> 01:47:57,336
They wouIdn't Iet me in,
so I had to get you out.

1664
01:48:04,617 --> 01:48:08,815
So you're behind aII this.
I shouId have known.

1665
01:48:27,206 --> 01:48:29,572
Trying to keep me away from you.

1666
01:48:29,976 --> 01:48:32,171
As though that were possibIe.

1667
01:48:32,745 --> 01:48:36,977
NaturaIIy, I couIdn't go on forever
punching passport officiaIs in the nose...

1668
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:38,881
but I found a way, didn't I?

1669
01:48:38,985 --> 01:48:41,419
DarIing, I had to see you.
I wrote and wrote.

1670
01:48:41,487 --> 01:48:43,216
And aII my Ietters came back to me.

1671
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:45,985
And the one I got,
they wouIdn't Iet me read.

1672
01:48:46,292 --> 01:48:49,159
It began, ''Ninotchka, my darIing''...

1673
01:48:49,228 --> 01:48:51,696
and it ended ''Yours, Leon.''

1674
01:48:52,932 --> 01:48:55,492
I won't teII you what came between.

1675
01:48:55,568 --> 01:48:57,763
I'II show you, I'II prove it.

1676
01:48:59,072 --> 01:49:01,370
But it'II take a Iong time, Ninotchka.

1677
01:49:02,342 --> 01:49:04,105
At Ieast a Iifetime.

1678
01:49:05,411 --> 01:49:08,608
But, Leon, I'm onIy here for a few days.

1679
01:49:09,482 --> 01:49:13,612
AII right, if you don't stay with me,
then I'II have to continue my fight.

1680
01:49:13,987 --> 01:49:16,285
I'II traveI wherever
there are Russian commissions.

1681
01:49:16,356 --> 01:49:19,223
I'II turn them aII into Iranoffs,
BuIjanoffs, and KopaIskis.

1682
01:49:19,292 --> 01:49:21,726
The worId wiII be crowded
with Russian restaurants.

1683
01:49:21,794 --> 01:49:23,694
I'II depopuIate Russia.

1684
01:49:23,763 --> 01:49:27,893
Comrade, once you saved
your country by going back.

1685
01:49:29,102 --> 01:49:31,798
This time you can onIy save it
by staying here.

1686
01:49:33,706 --> 01:49:36,937
WeII, if it is a choice between
my personaI interest...

1687
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:40,446
and the good of my country,
how can I waver?

1688
01:49:41,147 --> 01:49:44,605
No one shaII say Ninotchka
was a bad Russian.

1689
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:46,110
DarIing.

1690
01:50:25,925 --> 01:50:26,914
EngIish
