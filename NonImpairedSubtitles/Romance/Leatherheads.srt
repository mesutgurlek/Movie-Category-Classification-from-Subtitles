00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,839
-You think so?
-Oh, yeah.

303
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,959
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,519
You're the kind of cocktail
that comes on like sugar,

305
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,959
but gives you a kick in the head.

306
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,879
The only thing you hate worse
than a guy making a play

307
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,399
is when a guy doesn't make a play.

308
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,359
Were you making a play? l hadn't realised.

309
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,559
Lt might work on my Aunt Lurleen.
She's a little near-sighted.

310
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
There's an article on peach-canning in here
that l'm dying to get back to.

311
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,319
Well, l know you, too, Dodge Connelly.

312
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,199
You think you're the slickest operator
in Duluth, and maybe you are,

313
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
but being the slickest operator in Duluth is
kind of like being the world's tallest midget,

314
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,679
-if you ask me.
-lt's too bad we know each other so well.

315
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,079
-We might have gotten along.
-Well, l'll live.

316
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,359
Alone.

317
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,319
CC: Lexie?

318
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,199
Mr Frazier, Lexie Littleton.

319
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,199
L do apologise for keeping you waiting.

320
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
-So, where is this cute boyfriend of mine?
-Well, l thought he was behind me.

321
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,599
There he is now.

322

(PEOPLE CHATTERlNG EXClTEDLY)

323
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
(LAUGHlNG) He finds it very difficult
moving around in public.

324
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,679
Carter.

325
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,119
Say, CC!

326
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,120
He loves his fans.

327
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Carter, this is Miss Littleton of the Tribune.
She's doing a piece on you.

328
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,039
Well, that'll be fine.

329
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,399
-A pleasure, Mr Rutherford.
-Carter, Miss Littleton.

330
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
Lexie, Carter.

331
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,159
-Say, CC...
-There you are.

332
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,079
Could you bring the car around?
We're ready to leave.

333
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,479
-l don't think this gentleman works here.
-No?

334
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,839
He certainly looks like the retrieving type.

335
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,159
(LAUGHlNG)

336
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,160
-Do you work here, Dodge?
-No, CC, l came to talk to you.

337
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Yes, well, l'm afraid we're going to dinner.
Come, let's find a real valet, shall we?

338
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
L have $20,000
that says you might want to talk.

339
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,479
So if l understand you correctly,
Mr Connelly,

340
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
it's your intention
to legitimise professional football?

341
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,519
-That's right.
-Well, let me say straight off,

342
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,039
there's no such beast
as professional football.

343
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,040
There's only miners and farmers and
shell-shocked veterans of the Great War,

344
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
smashing each other's skulls together

345
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
in a million turnip fields
from Duluth to East Jesus.

346
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Now l ask you,
how do you intend to legitimise that?

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,399
By keeping it alive, by investing in a team.

348
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Well, you see, there's the catch.
l'm not interested in investing.

349
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,880
L'm more of a 20-percenter.
New talent, new ideas interest me.

350
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,239
Professional football
does not attract new talent,

351
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,240
and investing in a professional
football team is not a new idea.

352
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,759
Dodge,

353
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,559
we had some laughs a few years ago.

354
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
-You had some laughs.
-(CHUCKLlNG) Yes.

355
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Yes, l guess l did.

356
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
-So...
-Okay.

357
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,399
How about this for a new idea?

358
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,199
Carter Rutherford leaves Princeton
to play for the Duluth Bulldogs.

359
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,959
-What?
-Hear me out.

360
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,879
Carter, you're a pretty remarkable guy,
aren't you?

361
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,919
-l just play football.
-You don't have to be modest with me.

362
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,079
L know your story.

363
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
How you put your education on hold
to serve your country, to fight in the war.

364
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,559
L was just doing what l thought was right.

365
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,239
DODGE: The President
gave you a medal for bravery.

366
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,319
CARTER: l was just in
the right place at the right time.

367
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
That's not what the papers said.
They called you the hero of the Argonne.

368
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,519
Then, when you went back to school,
you turned out to be a football hero, too.

369
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,959
-Mr Connelly, l'm just a guy...
-Carter.

370
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,439
Do kids chase you down the hallway
at school?

371
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,519
Sometimes.

372
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,479
Follow you around?
Ask you for an autograph?

373
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,199
Lt happens, yeah,
but you can't take that stuff too seriously.

374
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
You feel like sometimes
everybody wants something from you?

375
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,400
And how are you compensated for living
your life under that kind of public scrutiny?

376
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
By paying tuition to Princeton.

377
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Let me ask you a question.
Do you like playing football?

378
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,359
L love playing football.

379
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Good. You got one more year and that's it.
That's all she wrote.

380
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,359
What are you gonna do then?

381
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,519
Actually, l've already been accepted
to Yale Law School.

382
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,519
L have a position waiting for me
at Hager, Danes and Upton

383
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,159
when l get my law degree.

384
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Lt turns out, l'm not too bad a student,
when l put my mind to it.

385
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,760
You... That's good. lt's good.

386
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,520
And all of that will be waiting for you,
no question about it.

387
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,399
But the world's full of good lawyers.

388
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,799
Ln football,
there's only one Carter Rutherford.

389
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You don't need any more teaching
to be what you are out on the field.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You ought to be playing football, and
you ought to be rewarded for your talent.

391
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,239
Makes sense. Sort of.

392
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,999
So did bloodletting at the time.

393
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
CC: You're very passionate, Mr Connelly.
What exactly do you have in mind?

394
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Carter Rutherford takes a temporary leave
from Princeton to play for Duluth,

395
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,160
and in exchange
he is guaranteed $5,000 a game.

396
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,479
Let's you and l have another drink,
Mr Connelly.

397
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,879
You're the boss.

398
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,399
Why don't you two run along,
conduct your interview,

399
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
whilst Mr Connelly and l
thrash out your future?

400
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Come on, Carter.

401
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,159
Carter Rutherford wouldn't sit on a bench
for that kind of money.

402
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,759
Did l say 5? l meant 10.

403
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,399
L assume you'll be paying this
out of the gate receipts?

404
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,199
-That's right.
-Of course, l'll want it in the form

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,999
of a guarantee.
Plus l get a percentage of the overages.

406
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,319
Of course. ln the neighbourhood of 5%.

407
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,959
L was thinking a little more uptown.

408
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
-10?
-25.

409
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,120
L'll understand if you decline.
Most teams would.

410
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Most, but not all.

411

412
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,799

for the Duluth Bulldogs starting Sunday.

413
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
We're... What? No, just listen.
We're taking a Pullman to Duluth tonight.

414
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,639
We're gonna get there in the morning.
Round up everybody you can.

welcoming committee when we pull in.

What? Just trust me. Thanks, pal.

417
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Harvey, change of plans. l'm taking a train
with these knuckleheads to Duluth.

418
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
What? No, l haven't been drinking!
lt's a long story.

So don't use his name.

Believe me, Harvey, by the end of the week,
this kid will cook his own goose.

422

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,399
But college baseball isn't too popular.

429

Where'd all that courage come from?

out of much less.

get so curious

-she worked her way up a newspaper room?
-Not really the homemaker type.

Depends on the home, l guess.

L'd dare say it wouldn't look good
for anyone to be caught in a place like this.

756
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,960
Come on, let's dance.

757
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Hey.

758
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,360
Come on.

759
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,520
What happened tonight?

760
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,919
Our boy's taken a liking to yours truly.

761
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,239
Seems mutual, if you ask me.

762
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,039
So much so

763
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,040
that he felt compelled to clear his
conscience on his Sergeant York routine.
