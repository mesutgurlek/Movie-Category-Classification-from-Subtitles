1
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,525
You´re lucky, you know.

2
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,884
l rarely allow anyone into my flat.

3
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:13,603
l know, l know, l know.

4
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:15,758
Humble digs.

5
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,158
Not exactly what you´d call
a ´´panty peeler. ´´

6
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,439
Do you know what I mean?

7
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,841
But it suits me just fine.

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,636
To be honest, I rareIy spend a night
in my own bed anyway.

9
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,845
You see, here´s my theory:

10
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,999
For most women, if a guy´s
a good provider

11
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:41,445
and generaIIy a nice chap, six-pack
abs reaIIy aren´t a deaI-breaker.

12
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,200
On the fIip side, however,

13
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,517
even though the PC boyfriend
sat next to you

14
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:48,235
with his arm sIung around
your shouIder wiII deny it--

15
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:53,517
And he wiII deny it. For us boys,
it´s aII about F.B.B.

16
00:01:56,807 --> 00:02:00,402
Face. Boobs. Bum.

17
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,239
I´m just being honest.

18
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:05,679
It´s been said that cIothes
speak the internationaI Ianguage.

19
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:09,078
And I have to admit,
I´m a bit of a fashion whore.

20
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,724
UnfortunateIy, today I´ve got work,
and I have to tone it down a IittIe bit,

21
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,959
but that´s aII right. Gucci.
End-of-summer saIe.

22
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:20,564
Very understated.
And I can easiIy spice it up with...

23
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,880
What? No, no. I know
what you are thinking.

24
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,197
If you ooze mascuIinity,
Iike some of us do,

25
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,564
you have no reason to fear pink.
Smashing.

26
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:34,237
Now, in the coIogne department,
most men overdo it.

27
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,560
Americans practicaIIy spray it on
with a crop-duster.

28
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,004
My ruIe: Nothing above the neck,

29
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:45,557
though I do Iike a IittIe spIash
on Big Ben.

30
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:48,157
You never know
where the day may take you.

31
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,084
AImost forgot.

32
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,166
New word for the day.

33
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:02,962
´´Ostentatious: The attempt
to attract attention to oneseIf.´´

34
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,562
Who? Me?

35
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,839
Oh, bIimey. I´m so rude.
I haven´t introduced myseIf.

36
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,362
- I´m...
- AIfie?

37
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,077
There you go. AIfie.

38
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:20,957
Are you the IittIe eIf that Ieft these
mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

39
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,756
No, no, no. You must have
a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

40
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:28,795
You are such a doII, AIfie.
But I´m supposed to be on a diet.

41
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,002
Oh, on a diet?

42
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,362
- A diet.
- You?

43
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,882
- Yeah.
- Now, I don´t mean to be forward, Lu,

44
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:37,802
but you shouId know by now
that a fuII-figured girI Iike yourseIf

45
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:40,726
- is every guy´s secret fantasy.
- Stop it.

46
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,316
So she´s a tub of Iard.
The ship´s aIready saiIed,

47
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,842
so why not make her
feeI good about herseIf, right?

48
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,805
- Oh, Lu?
- Yes, angeI?

49
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,036
I´m working the night spot,

50
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,681
and my apartment is a horror show,
so I´m sorry if I keep you up

51
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,441
- with the dust-busting at 2 a.m.
- Oh, don´t you worry.

52
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,724
- I´II give it a quick straighten.
- Oh, no, no, you don´t need to that.

53
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,482
Nonsense.
I Iike doing things for you, AIfie.

54
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,680
I´m a bIessed man
having you in my Iife.

55
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:07,676
Thank you.

56
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,283
Keys are in the usuaI spot.

57
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,680
Now, back home, you´re always
hearing tales about some bloke

58
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,919
migrating to the States and winding
up with buckets of money.

59
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:26,285
So not long ago, l packed up
my bucket and headed west.

60
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,280
Now, I must admit,
I had a second motive.

61
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:34,683
I´d aIways been toId that the most
beautifuI women in the worId...

62
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,399
...resided in Manhattan.

63
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:40,844
And when it comes to shagging birds,
it´s aII about one thing:

64
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:46,077
Location, Iocation, Iocation.

65
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,000
God, l love this city.
AII right, girIs.

66
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:53,726
Just look around. l mean,
every one of them, unique, special,

67
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,764
like snowflakes.

68
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,806
And with such a pIethora--

69
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:04,446
CaIendar word meaning ´´abundance,´´
of gorgeousness and diversity,

70
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,566
weII, how couId a man ever choose
to settIe down with just one?

71
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,084
I myseIf subscribe more
to the European phiIosophy of Iife.

72
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,558
My priorities Ieaning towards
wine, women--

73
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:18,843
WeII, actuaIIy, that´s about it.

74
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,918
Wine and women.

75
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:27,119
AIthough, women and women
is aIways a fun option.

76
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,560
So...

77
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,801
...to Iive Iife to the fuIIest,

78
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:39,236
I require onIy enough
to cover my modest expenses.

79
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,643
I´ve no desire to be the richest stiff
in the cemetery.

80
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:56,683
I think this might just be my
favourite position.

81
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:59,395
I know it was President Kennedy´s.

82
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,557
He was such a great Ieader.

83
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,082
Of course, JFK used the oId
bad-back excuse,

84
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,285
but if you ask me, he knew
it gave you maximum pIeasure

85
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:09,926
with minimum exertion.

86
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,806
What is it about the back of a Iimo?

87
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,203
ObIigatory cuddIing.

88
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,524
Thousand one,

89
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,883
thousand two...

90
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:28,405
Cripes. Hey, I´ve gotta get cracking.
I´ve got a 1 0:00 pickup.

91
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:33,675
You better hurry up.
You don´t want to keep her waiting.

92
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,355
Quite the number, isn´t she?

93
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:46,803
Yet, she teIIs me her oId man
hasn´t shagged her in six months.

94
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,525
Six months. I mean, thank God
there are gentIemen Iike me around

95
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,723
to pick up the sIack.

96
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,642
Just Iook at her.
Legs Iike a racehorse.

97
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:01,721
Perfect yoga bum. I give her
my highest grade:

98
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,885
A-minus.

99
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,763
Where did we teII the oId man
we were going tonight?

100
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,680
- A movie.
- Treasure, pIease, no, no, no.

101
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,725
Stop messing about.
You´II ruin my presets.

102
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,356
- Sorry.
- What movie?

103
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,041
I don´t know. What´s the difference?

104
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:31,964
The difference is, the more detaiI
you give, the Iess interested he´II be.

105
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,925
It wouIdn´t matter what I said.

106
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,119
It wouId never occur to PhiI
that another man

107
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,119
- wouId ever Iook twice at me.
- Dor, darIing,

108
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,436
you fishing for a compIiment?

109
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:40,962
No.

110
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:45,564
You shouId know by now they onIy
come from me when Ieast expected.

111
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:50,043
Now, come and have a mint so PhiI
doesn´t smeII the AIfie on your breath.

112
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,801
I don´t care if he does.

113
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:57,440
There´s one thing that puts me
off marriage: It´s married women.

114
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,883
Dorie doesn´t know it yet,

115
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,722
but you won´t be seeing
much more of her.

116
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,481
I´ve got that aII-too-famiIiar feeIing.

117
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:10,039
Sooner or Iater, she´II be wanting
a IittIe bit more than I´m abIe to give.

118
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,597
WouIdn´t it be great if I was
going home with you tonight

119
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:16,315
instead of PhiI the PiII?

120
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,445
Yeah.

121
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,317
lt´s definitely time
to stage a disappearing act.

122
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,237
So next Tuesday,
same time, same pIace?

123
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:33,083
I´m sorry, Iove, it´s Fashion Week.
I´m booked doubIe shifts.

124
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,600
- I´II caII you the instant things Iet up.
- Okay.

125
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,121
In the meantime, I Ieft you
a IittIe souvenir to remember me by.

126
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,005
Oh, Dor?

127
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:53,005
Your derrière Iooks reaIIy rather
ravishing from this vantage point.

128
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:57,046
See?

129
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,878
A compIiment when Ieast expected.

130
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,916
What can I say?
Happy as a pup with two taiIs.

131
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:16,038
And I think I´ve done oId PhiI
a bit of a favour too.

132
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,198
Of course, he´d be the Iast to see it.

133
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,158
Never expect any thanks in this Iife.

134
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:28,400
You know what I mean?
So Tuesday...

135
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,278
...1 0:03 p.m.

136
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:37,203
Do I drag myseIf home
to a coId fIat, empty fridge,

137
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:44,285
or nip across town for a hot bath,
warm body, breakfast in bed?

138
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,920
Decisions, decisions...

139
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:01,317
Yeah, l think l´ll pay a visit
to my semi-regular,

140
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,639
quasi, sort of girlfriend.

141
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,883
My sweet Julie.

142
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,517
Let me guess.
Unexpected Iast-minute fare.

143
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,839
Yeah. She had me going
up and down for hours.

144
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:22,557
That supposed to be funny?
Because it is so very--

145
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,845
Not.

146
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,126
Hey!

147
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,282
I´m not kidding, AIfie!

148
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,126
I´m not kidding. I hate you sometimes.

149
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,079
You have a very ostentatious way
of showing it.

150
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,999
Yeah, I sure do.

151
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:42,876
No, darIing. Can we hit pause?
I just need a second to unwind.

152
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, I nicked haIf a bottIe
of StoIi from the Iimo.

153
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,000
How do you want yours,
on the rocks?

154
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,715
I just want my usuaI, AIfie. Straight up.

155
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:54,084
No, I´m so totaIIy knackered.
I´II make it up to you in the morning.

156
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,397
Cross my heart.

157
00:10:57,087 --> 00:11:01,524
But tonight, aII I´m good for
is a bite to eat, hot bath

158
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,758
and a nice Iong sIeep.

159
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,997
You know, this isn´t
a HoIiday Inn, AIfie.

160
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:21,879
What´s that again?

161
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,155
Where were you tonight? ReaIIy?

162
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:27,762
You´ve got to open a restaurant.
That´s seriousIy deIicious.

163
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,726
Thanks, AIfie. It´s just chiIIi.

164
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,126
Hey.

165
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,925
A IittIe eye contact, pIease.

166
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,444
We have something here,

167
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,722
or am I just a gIorified booty caII?

168
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:47,800
Hey.

169
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,040
Hey.

170
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,718
Here´s what she´s reaIIy saying:

171
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,880
She wants me to commit.
TransIation: Become ´´domestified.´´

172
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:06,201
Now, it doesn´t do to become
dependent on anybody in this Iife.

173
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:12,963
Change your nature,
you´re a dead man.

174
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,484
ChiIIi, pIease.

175
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:24,445
Don´t get me wrong.
She´s adorabIe.

176
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:28,157
Cute? AbsoIuteIy.
But is it ever enough?

177
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,244
I toId you how we men are.
We want showstoppers.

178
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,201
And the probIem is,
JuIie hasn´t got enough

179
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,001
of the superficiaI things
that reaIIy matter.

180
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:45,683
- I don´t deserve you.
- Yeah, that´s probabIy true.

181
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,241
Too bad I Iove you.

182
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:52,845
Thanks, babe.

183
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:56,159
- AIfie, AIfie...
- What?

184
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,601
You´re giving me the ´´Thanks, babe.´´

185
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,163
You´re giving me the ´´Thanks, baby.´´

186
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,477
- CaIm down.
- Don´t teII me to caIm down!

187
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,405
- I know how you feeI!
- Wait a minute.

188
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:09,002
- You´re gonna wake up--
- Max.

189
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,362
Hey, IittIe man. Did we wake you up?

190
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,245
Yes.

191
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,477
Now, Iads, Iearn from my mistake.

192
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,438
Never get invoIved
with a singIe mum.

193
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,042
See, they come with accessories,

194
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,925
some of which can be...

195
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:32,842
...unfortunateIy, irresistibIe.

196
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:54,362
Sights Iike that make you reaIize
we aII have an expiration date.

197
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,761
And women do have a shorter
sheIf Iife than men, don´t they?

198
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,641
I think that´s what JuIie
was banging on about yesterday.

199
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,881
EIegant Limousine and Chauffeur.

200
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:10,120
This is where I make
my reasonabIy honest Iiving.

201
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:13,924
Standards of eIegance has taken
quite a pounding, wouIdn´t you say?

202
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,125
I know. BeIieve me,
it´s mereIy a stepping stone.

203
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,844
CurrentIy parked on one
of those stepping stones

204
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:24,399
is my best mate and future
business partner, MarIon.

205
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:30,438
BIack. Like Lonette´s skin...

206
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:33,995
...which I wiII never again touch.

207
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:40,236
I´m afraid you´re not meeting
my man on top form.

208
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,482
See, MarIon´s got a probIem.

209
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,198
lt´s called Lonette.

210
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,086
And very recently, it dumped him.

211
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,079
Oh, dear. Come on,
what was it this time?

212
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:05,240
Three a.m. begging, at her front door.

213
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,206
- LeveI of inebriation?
- Vomiting.

214
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,275
Right. So Iet me get this straight.
You were at her front door,

215
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:14,724
3 a.m. in the morning,
begging and vomiting?

216
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:18,756
And what,
she wasn´t charmed by that?

217
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:24,602
AIfie? Why is there no StoIi
in car number two?

218
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,599
I´ve no idea.

219
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,359
I gotta watch this guy Iike a hawk.

220
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:32,086
That IittIe chap´s name is Wing.

221
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:35,478
My boss and owner
of this tragic enterprise.

222
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,321
- Wipe that car good.
- Owner, that is, tiII me and MarIon

223
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,882
swing a Ioan and buy it out
from underneath his scrawny--

224
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,039
HeIIo. You miss bird shit.

225
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,519
Wing.

226
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,564
He´s barking mad.

227
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,082
Check out the way he taIks
to the IittIe woman.

228
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,200
She´s given him her best years,
cooked his chop suey,

229
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,881
heIped with the business, and I bet
at one time he couIdn´t wait

230
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,516
to rip off her kimono.
And now Iook at him.

231
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,275
And I´m supposed to respect
the institution of marriage?

232
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,925
That´s a great figure, man.
We swing that Ioan,

233
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,045
cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...

234
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:25,280
We´re gonna take Wing
by surprise with an offer Iike this.

235
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,085
I couId´ve predicted this. See,
MarIon and Lonette have reached

236
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,682
that criticaI 1 8-month ´´Where are
we going, what are we doing,

237
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,646
what´s happening here?´´ crisis point
that rears its ugIy head

238
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:44,926
in every reIationship.
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

239
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,886
MarIon wanted another 1 8 months

240
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,197
to make sure nothing better
was coming his way.

241
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,677
I fucked up egregiousIy.

242
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,839
I see you´re making the most
of that birthday caIendar.

243
00:16:56,527 --> 00:17:00,566
By the time he reaIized he´d made
a mistake and he wanted her back...

244
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:04,326
- ...it was too Iate.
- Hey, stranger.

245
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,366
Hey.

246
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,206
CaroI.

247
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,405
- CaroI. Hi, CaroI.
- Hi.

248
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,878
You Iook wonderfuI.

249
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:28,115
So, CaroI, weII, it´s nice
to see you again. You be weII.

250
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,236
What´s up with that?

251
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:40,843
Put it this way, the show cIosed
after one performance onIy.

252
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,725
- Do I even wanna know why?
- No. Come on,

253
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,959
it wouId be Iess than discreet
to teII you why.

254
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:51,323
Hair on the arms. SeriousIy.
Long, thick--

255
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,639
What are you taIking about?
You don´t have hair on your arms?

256
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,719
- You´re Iooking very IoveIy tonight.
- Thank you.

257
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,915
Dude, the iron door
has sIammed shut, man.

258
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:14,724
CIassic, isn´t it?

259
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:18,642
Now that he can´t have her,
he thinks he can´t Iive without her.

260
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,083
Some peopIe are funny.

261
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,841
Marlon´s predicament got me thinking
about my own situation.

262
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:32,366
Maybe-- Maybe it was time
to stoke the home fires.

263
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,959
Anybody in the mood
for a IittIe AIfie, straight up?

264
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,280
Oh, this isn´t a good time, AIfie.
Got a Iot on my mind.

265
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:46,520
Oh, God. Yeah, I reaIIy hate
when that happens.

266
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:51,363
Open up, baby.
You Iook seriousIy beautifuI.

267
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:54,679
- Not tonight, AIfred.
- What´s the matter? TeII me.

268
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,522
I don´t-- I´m just--
WeII, I guess I´m-- I´m just...

269
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,316
I´m just seeing red.

270
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,878
I mean, the poor guy, he´s dying.

271
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,436
Come on, haven´t you--?
You´ve tortured him Iong enough.

272
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,325
AIfie, he shouId´ve thought
about aII that

273
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,286
before he was screwing around
with that ex-girIfriend of his.

274
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,722
Those fake-ass, $5 titties.

275
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:31,716
- Those are fake?
- HeIIo?

276
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,198
Wow, I´m devastated.
They´ve got, Iike...

277
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,917
AIfie, you´re supposed to be consoIing
my devastation, remember?

278
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,317
I am. Look, he came back, didn´t he?

279
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,842
Begging, crawIing on his knees,
vomiting--

280
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:45,645
I don´t care.

281
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:49,846
I´m sorry, I´m not that easy. I don´t
forgive and I definiteIy do not forget.

282
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,282
- Is okay if I Ieave now, miss?
- Oh, sí, FeIix.

283
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,121
And hit the Iights on your way out,
por favor.

284
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,845
I better go.

285
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,597
It´s reaIIy coming down out there.

286
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:05,678
Yeah.

287
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,763
And I´m wearing suede.

288
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,441
You´re teIIing the truth. That´s briIIiant.

289
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:17,122
Okay. I got one. I never swam
in the Pacific Ocean.

290
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:21,636
- Me neither.
- Oh, shit. Okay.

291
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:28,679
Okay. I´ve never seen
a James Bond movie.

292
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,038
You´re joking.
Not even a Sean Connery?

293
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,275
You serious?

294
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:37,645
Wow, I don´t know
if that´s magic or tragic.

295
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,805
Okay. Five baII. My go.

296
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:45,082
- I´ve never made my own bed.
- Oh, buIIshit.

297
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,318
No, I repeat, I´ve never
made my own bed.

298
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,081
WeII, what kind of mama you got?

299
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:52,126
That´s a good question.

300
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:01,003
Let´s see. AII right.

301
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,761
- I got something for you.
- AII right.

302
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,845
I´ve never had sex...

303
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:09,760
I´ve never had sex
with two peopIe in one night.

304
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:13,283
Six-five, your favour.

305
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,199
Gotcha.

306
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:20,878
So, AIfie, what´s the most
you´ve had in one night?

307
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:27,401
We´ve stopped pIaying the game,
haven´t we?

308
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:35,158
Am I wrong, or is there a IittIe
innocent fIirting going on here?

309
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:51,166
Driftin´ on a memory

310
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:57,324
Ain´t no place l´d rather be
Than with you

311
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,238
Loving you

312
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,877
See, if I had that kind of taIent...

313
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,879
And a song

314
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,164
- Go on, finish your sentence.
- If I had that kind of taIent,

315
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:21,725
and I Iooked Iike you...

316
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,446
And a song

317
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:25,757
- ...I wouId be strutting my stuff
- Oh, yeah?

318
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,083
on a stage.

319
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,039
Trust me, what happens next
was the furthest thing from my mind

320
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,124
when l dropped by tonight.

321
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,837
But then l thought to myself,

322
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,361
´´You know what?

323
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:02,360
lf this will help her get past
her anger towards Marlon,

324
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:05,758
l owe it to both of them,
as a friend, right?

325
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,601
To do whatever l can to help. ´´

326
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,683
l find that, lately,

327
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:20,080
even lying to myself comes easily.

328
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:10,435
The next morning, and l can´t
get last night out of my mind.

329
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:15,040
Try desperately to focus
on something else, anything else.

330
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:18,598
Anything to get my mind
off my best friend´s incredibly hot,

331
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:22,956
best-ass-l´ve-ever-seen-in-my-life
girlfriend.

332
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:27,121
AIfie. AIfie.

333
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,961
- AIfie!
- ShaII I pretend I can´t hear him?

334
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,646
Dude.

335
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:35,081
- Hey!
- Too Iate. Too Iate.

336
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:38,478
- Dude, wouId you sIow down?
- Hey, MarIy, what´s up?

337
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,236
´´MarIy´´?

338
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,322
Hey, Iisten, I gotta taIk to you.
You ain´t going nowhere

339
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,205
tiII you teII me
what went down Iast night.

340
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:47,915
- Down Iast night?
- Dude, don´t mess with me.

341
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,203
What happened with Lonette?

342
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,283
Have you ever heard
the word ´´knock´´?

343
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,200
- What went down?
- What? Nothing happened.

344
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:59,598
- We had a few shots.
- Missus give me siIent treatment.

345
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:03,396
LittIe she know, not hearing constant
´´bIah, bIah, bIah´´ is gift from heaven.

346
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:05,399
You keep it up. Keep it up,
mate, it´II work.

347
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:07,524
AIfie, what happened?

348
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,316
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

349
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:15,646
- I drank a Iot Iast night.
- Drunk.

350
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,044
WeII, I...

351
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,002
I reaIIy-- I don´t remember.

352
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:24,761
- Dude, you did something to her.
- No.

353
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,963
Oh, yeah, you did.
Because she shows up at my house,

354
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,198
at 4 in the morning,
saying that she wanted me back.

355
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:32,245
She even said
that if I needed more time,

356
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,285
that she understood compIeteIy.

357
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,119
How fucking crazy.

358
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:43,564
ChaIk one up for the bIokes.
Thanks to me, MarIon won the game.

359
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,963
Which means he´s off scot-free,
and so am I.

360
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,801
This is a bIoody miracIe.
That´s fantastic. Fantastic.

361
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,998
- Come on, what did you say to her?
- Look, Iook.

362
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:53,715
- It´s aII good.
- Come on, what did you say?

363
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:56,401
I asked her to marry me.

364
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,322
You know you´re my best man, right?

365
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,438
Moral of the story:

366
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:10,759
No good deed goes unpunished.

367
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:06,040
New word for the day?

368
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,681
´´ResiIience:

369
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:15,003
The abiIity to readiIy recover
after disappointment or Ioss.´´

370
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,366
Capacity to spring back.

371
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:22,519
Understand, it´s not
about replacing Julie.

372
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,235
l just wanna get back
to the simple life:

373
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:28,001
Women who mean nothing to me.

374
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:33,795
So l´ve struck up a friendship
with a nightclub hostess called Uta.

375
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:35,480
HeIIo, Uta.

376
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:51,477
Now, as a heat-seeking bacheIor,

377
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:53,479
I have to Iive
by some very simpIe ruIes.

378
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:56,446
AIfie EIkins´ credo or phiIosophy,

379
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,679
which is probabIy best summed up
by the onIy advice

380
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,804
my father ever gave me.

381
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:06,325
He said, ´´Son, whenever you
meet a beautifuI woman...

382
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:11,601
...just remember, somewhere there´s
a bIoke who´s sick of shagging her.´´

383
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,997
- Can I heIp you, man?
- G and T, pIease.

384
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:18,486
ExpIain to me what everyone sees
in that Eurotrash?

385
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:39,317
I think it´s incredibIy unfair
that it´s acceptabIe for men

386
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:41,319
to be sexuaIIy experimentaI,
then with a woman,

387
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:45,606
if she wants to try something--
A kiss or a threesome.

388
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,441
You know, that they´d be judged.
I wouIdn´t judge them.

389
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,281
And I think if you two were to kiss,
I wouId-- I wouId just--

390
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,958
I wouId just see it
as a thing of beauty.

391
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,840
Although l´m living every guy´s
Rat Pack fantasy,

392
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:02,521
something feels a bit off.

393
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,598
And throwing myself
back into the old lifestyle

394
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:06,963
isn´t going quite as smoothly
as l´d hoped.

395
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,560
Sorry.

396
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:10,320
I´m sorry.

397
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:13,163
You carry on without me.

398
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:16,361
Oh, my Ioves, I--

399
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,445
I don´t know what happened.
This is so unIike me.

400
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:23,477
Yeah, you-- You two just...

401
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:33,444
l used to think
there was nothing worse than death.

402
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,840
Then, from out of nowhere...

403
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:41,996
...the unthinkabIe.

404
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,996
Now I reaIIy don´t get
what everyone sees in you.

405
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:54,405
It just keeps on happening
and happening.

406
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:58,159
Or more accurateIy, not happening
and not happening.

407
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:03,483
This never happens, Uta.
HonestIy, never.

408
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:08,080
HonestIy.

409
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,201
Not the word around town...

410
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,285
...peewee.

411
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,443
Mr EIkins? Miranda KuIp.

412
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,365
Miranda.

413
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,121
The penis doctor is a he
with a IittIe bit of she thrown in.

414
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,723
So I understand you´re experiencing
some erectiIe dysfunction.

415
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,877
I am experiencing a IittIe-- A IittIe--
A IittIe bit of-- What you just said.

416
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,357
Not to worry.
That´s my area of expertise.

417
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:44,479
So have you been under any unusuaI
emotionaI stress IateIy, Mr EIkins?

418
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:48,276
Stress? EmotionaI? Me? No, never.

419
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:54,039
WeII, unIess you count
that recent chat I had with JuIie.

420
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,800
I can´t see you anymore, AIfie.

421
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,877
- Why? You angry?
- No, I´m reaIIy not angry.

422
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:03,563
Just, you know,
we want different things.

423
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:07,565
And I can´t have you traipsing
in and out of Max´s Iife.

424
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:15,006
You´ve changed your hair,
haven´t you?

425
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:16,600
You have, haven´t you?
No, you have.

426
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,838
You´ve changed your hairdo.
You cut it?

427
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,725
It Iooks gorgeous.

428
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,958
- Thanks.
- How come...?

429
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:26,925
How come you never had it Iike that
when we were together?

430
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,759
I reaIIy gotta go.

431
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,046
WeII, I guess...

432
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,480
...you need these back.

433
00:31:39,127 --> 00:31:40,640
Thank you.

434
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,644
AIfie?

435
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:48,515
You gonna be okay?

436
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:52,997
Yeah. No worries. I´m aIways okay.

437
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:01,959
AIrighty, Iet´s take a gander
at that penis of yours.

438
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,838
I see.

439
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,080
WeII.

440
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,921
- It seems we have Iift-off.
- It seems we do.

441
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:21,719
Wunderschön.

442
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,566
What a reIief.

443
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,721
WeII, I mean, if he can give me
a stiffy, I shouId have no probIem

444
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:29,646
keeping it up for the target
demographic, shouIdn´t I?

445
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,685
WeII, there doesn´t appear
to be anything physioIogicaIIy wrong,

446
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:35,600
so, in short, we can be
fairIy certain your probIem

447
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:39,840
- was simpIy stress-reIated.
- TransIation: JuIie-reIated.

448
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:44,239
Like I aIways say, if they don´t get you
one way, they´II get you another.

449
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:46,999
However,

450
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:53,000
- I did feeI something a IittIe kooky.
- Kooky?

451
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:56,205
There is nothing to get upset about,
Mr EIkins.

452
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,477
I thought I feIt a Iump...

453
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:03,804
...on your penis.

454
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,561
But with any Iuck, it wiII be nothing.

455
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:11,643
The words ´´Iump´´ and ´´penis´´
in the same sentence.

456
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,162
There´s something
you don´t hear every day.

457
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:19,240
And so young Alfred
got an early Yuletide gift.

458
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:23,082
A penis biopsy.

459
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:26,239
I get my test resuIts in three days--
WeII, five.

460
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:29,957
Five counting the weekend.
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

461
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,801
How am I gonna stop myseIf
going compIeteIy bonkers?

462
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:34,042
I´II be fine.

463
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,678
I´II be fine.

464
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,838
I´m a young man.

465
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:43,160
Shift focus, AIfie. Shift--

466
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,602
Let´s go, kids. Let´s go.

467
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:55,082
Move aIong, chiIdren.
Look straight ahead.

468
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,281
Come on. Do not Iook at the man.
Look straight ahead.

469
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:01,963
In the meantime, perhaps I´m safer
hobbIing on home.

470
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,879
AIfie, dear, what´s wrong?
You Iook Iike death warmed over.

471
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,641
No, I´ve just-- I´ve got a bit of
a footbaII injury, that´s aII,

472
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,605
Mrs Schnitman--
HeIIo, Mrs Liberman.

473
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,280
You two Iook IoveIy.
Where you going?

474
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:30,041
- Shopping. You need anything?
- I´m fine.

475
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:33,636
HeIIo.

476
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:36,204
Can I taIk to you for a minute?

477
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:38,366
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

478
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:42,839
She´s IoveIy. Good for you,
dating an African-American.

479
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,520
Yeah.

480
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:49,680
Hey. Hey, girI. I missed you.

481
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:53,442
Don´t mind us. We´re not here.
You kids keep taIking.

482
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:56,121
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you, Mrs Liberman.

483
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,880
Shop tiII you drop, girIs.

484
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,319
So how have you been?

485
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:06,078
I´m pregnant.

486
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,399
lt seems to me

487
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,395
the problems you worry yourself
sick about never seem to materialize.

488
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,677
lt´s the ones that catch you
unexpectedly

489
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:19,243
on a Wednesday afternoon
that knock you sideways.

490
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,795
l offered to face the music
with her...

491
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:26,441
...but she wanted to go it alone.

492
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,086
We both knew that if the baby
was born with any white-boy features

493
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:49,881
it would mean the end
of Lonette and Marlon.

494
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:53,405
Not to mention your host
for this evening.

495
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:59,476
But standing in the cold,
l find myself having regrets.

496
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,325
Thinking thoughts like,

497
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,963
´´Here´s another kid you´ll never
get a chance to know.

498
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,123
Your own. ´´

499
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:25,686
Didn´t take Iong.

500
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,442
BIoody heII, you´re freezing.

501
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,121
How do you feeI?

502
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:42,765
Empty.

503
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:59,926
That night in the bar, I thought
I was getting something for nothing.

504
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:03,958
Doesn´t seem to have worked out
that way, does it?

505
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:18,002
Oh, man.

506
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:21,878
lf everything turns out okay,
maybe this little brush with mortality

507
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,236
is a sign.

508
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:28,398
l should think about making--
Making some changes.

509
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,841
PossibIy.

510
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:31,916
- Next week.
- Excuse me.

511
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,005
Did I just--? Did you just Iook at me?
Did I just notice you turn away?

512
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:38,517
Look, if you know the resuIts
to my tests, and they´re teIIing you--

513
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:40,319
- Mr EIkins.
- PIease. PIease.

514
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:44,805
Mr EIkins, for the miIIionth time,
sit down.

515
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:50,642
Mr BeIson, I have a canceIIation
on Tuesday at 1 1 :30.

516
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,803
I´m gonna be fine.

517
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,162
- I just feeI it.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

518
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:07,519
I´II just be a minute. Or ten.

519
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:10,956
- It´s aII right. Take your time.
- I don´t have a choice.

520
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,125
I used to pee. Now I trickIe.

521
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:17,080
- I´m Joe. What´s your name?
- AIfie.

522
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,361
So how you doing, AIfie?

523
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,321
- Hanging in. You?
- Shitty.

524
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,121
Yeah, me too. Me too.

525
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:32,926
- I Iike the boIo tie.
- Oh, thanks. I have a coIIection.

526
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:38,121
You know, when you´re oId,
you Iearn to be patient.

527
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:39,642
Yeah.

528
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:42,281
Used to be I never
had time for nothing. Go, go, go.

529
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,398
- I know that feeIing.
- Yeah.

530
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:49,158
My wife was aIways hawking me
to take a IittIe vacation. Hawaii. Reno.

531
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,483
I aIways said,
´´Next year, Evie, next year.

532
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,757
I got too much on my pIatter.´´

533
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,676
I aIways thought
I´d have more time.

534
00:38:56,887 --> 00:39:00,436
Then one Sunday night,
she takes the pot roast out of the oven.

535
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:04,481
YeIIs, ´´Soup´s on,´´
and sIumps to the kitchen fIoor.

536
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,405
Just Iike that.

537
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:08,438
Dead as disco.

538
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,877
Jesus, I´m sorry.

539
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,476
I tried picking up the pieces.

540
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,121
Even went to Waikiki aIone
on the 8-day cruise package

541
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:18,283
she was aIways yakking about.

542
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:21,281
CouIdn´t get Evie out of my mind.

543
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:27,481
There´s two things
I Iearned in Iife, kid:

544
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,325
You find someone to Iove,

545
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,001
and Iive every day
as though it were your Iast.

546
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:37,765
She´s aII yours, AIfie.

547
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,446
Enjoy.

548
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:48,925
You aII right, son?

549
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:52,244
Yeah. I hope so.

550
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:58,597
Look, if you ever get bored
or feeI Iike schmoozing...

551
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,037
...give me a hoIIer.

552
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,197
- You´II never caII.
- Maybe I wiII.

553
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,915
AII right, good. We´II go to a bar
together, hit on some chicks.

554
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,480
Damn right.

555
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,279
Thanks, Joe.

556
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,879
Hey.

557
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:20,238
I´m sorry about Evie.

558
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:24,799
We...

559
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,475
...weren´t aII that fond
of each other...

560
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:31,441
...but we were very cIose.

561
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:36,116
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.

562
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:05,437
I´ve been thinking a Iot IateIy
about God and death.

563
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:08,445
And how, if what they taught me
in BibIe cIass is true,

564
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:10,478
I´m reaIIy in for it.

565
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:16,166
But I won´t be partying
with Lucifer any time soon,

566
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,244
because my test resuIts
were negative.

567
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,915
I´m gonna Iive! I´m gonna Iive!

568
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,680
I ruined my Prada Iace-ups
and I don´t care.

569
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:37,166
Don´t think I´ve forgotten my oath
to compIeteIy change my Iife,

570
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,119
because I haven´t.

571
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:10,165
Carrot-appIe with a dash
of wheat grass.

572
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:11,641
Yep.

573
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,405
HeaIth is now priority number one.

574
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,038
Business pIan
moves onto the fast track.

575
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:25,122
- If you say so...
- Tonight´s preview at St. Ambrose...

576
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:31,039
No, I definiteIy don´t want to taIk.
Okay, hoId on, what eIse have I got?

577
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:35,365
Okay, yeah.

578
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:38,044
AII right, if we must, we must, but...

579
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:42,679
New sIate. New beginning.

580
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:04,565
- What´s your name, driver?
- AIfie, sir.

581
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:05,722
Wait here, AIfie.

582
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:08,037
Do you know how Iong
you´re gonna be, roughIy?

583
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:10,841
- You got somepIace to go?
- No, I was just gonna nip off

584
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:13,601
- and get a cup of tea.
- Look, why don´t you just stay put.

585
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:42,163
Yea or nay?

586
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:47,196
A definite yea, I think. ReaIIy.

587
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:49,557
Stunning.
WouIdn´t you say so, sir?

588
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:52,196
I´m sorry, didn´t I ask you
to wait by the car?

589
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,086
I reckoned I shouId heIp
the Iady with her packages.

590
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:56,885
Definite yea?

591
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:00,479
I think.

592
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,599
With one minor...

593
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,126
- May I?
- You may.

594
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:06,806
Adjustment.

595
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,961
BuIIfighter. Another Iifetime.
Don´t ask.

596
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,846
Fifty, if she´s a day.

597
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:24,480
But don´t they say 50
is the new 40,

598
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,882
and is she not Iiving proof?

599
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:29,840
I mean, have a Iook.
BeautifuIIy preserved.

600
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,601
And cIeavage
Iike the HoIIand TunneI.

601
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:36,845
- Better?
- Much.

602
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:40,716
You are so right to trust ChaneI.
A pair of hot-pink stiIettos,

603
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:42,804
and you´re good to go.

604
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:46,845
- WeII, aren´t you Mr FuII-Service?
- We try.

605
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:52,679
- He´s getting a IittIe pissy, isn´t he?
- Oh, it´s fine. It´s good for him.

606
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:56,243
- Is your husband a Iot oIder than you?
- He´s not my husband.

607
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:59,085
He´s wearing a wedding ring.

608
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,438
WeII, I never said he wasn´t
somebody eIse´s husband.

609
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,125
- Grab the stuff from the trunk?
- You got it.

610
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:16,680
Cheers.

611
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:26,163
Ma´am, if you require
my services in the future.

612
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:30,918
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma´am.

613
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:36,760
Now that, my friends,
is a real woman.

614
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,561
Smart and sexy and...

615
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,755
You noticed the IittIe fIirt
going on between us, huh?

616
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,239
Makes me think,

617
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,086
if a woman Iike that,
of that caIibre

618
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:53,686
shouId take notice
of a bIoke Iike me,

619
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,924
then, perhaps...

620
00:45:58,287 --> 00:46:01,916
Perhaps I´m seIIing myseIf
a bit short.

621
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:04,159
ln a flash,

622
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,961
l have my New Year´s resolution.

623
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,639
Aim higher.

624
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:23,558
Catastrophic. Doomed.

625
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:26,804
DesoIate. CatacIysmic.

626
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:29,157
Bought him a word-of-the-day
caIendar for Christmas.

627
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:31,076
Big mistake.

628
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:33,403
HoIiday season,
busiest time of the year.

629
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:34,881
I try to run a business.

630
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,124
- What´s the probIem, Mr Wing?
- Your souI brother.

631
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:40,318
He quit.

632
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:48,837
ln the letter Marlon left me,
he called me his best friend...

633
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:52,878
...but apologized for bailing
on our business scheme.

634
00:46:53,087 --> 00:46:56,124
He said his whole thing now
was to make Lonette happy.

635
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,405
They decided,
on the spur of the moment,

636
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,563
to move upstate,

637
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:03,560
and l had a standing
invite to drop by any time.

638
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:07,520
Somehow Lonette
convinced Marlon

639
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:10,605
it would be too painful
to say our goodbyes in person.

640
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:12,604
And to make matters worse,

641
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:16,322
it all dovetails into
the second loneliest night of the year:

642
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,397
Christmas Eve.

643
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:26,876
A night that brings on all those
familiar festive feelings

644
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:32,320
of hopelessness,
anguish, despair.

645
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:35,999
Not a great time to be flying solo.

646
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:40,236
That´s why I´m of the beIief
coupIes shouId never spIit up

647
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:42,597
between Thanksgiving
and January 2nd.

648
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,921
AIways have a reIationship to see
you through the hoIidays. AIways.

649
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:49,880
The downside, of course, being gifts.

650
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,279
PersonaIIy, I´ve aIways
suspected that everyone eIse

651
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:00,240
is having a far merrier
Christmas than I am.

652
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:03,803
Not that I´ve ever actuaIIy
had a Christmas.

653
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:06,166
That´s a whoIe other Dickens story.

654
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:07,561
Taxi.

655
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,286
Taxi.

656
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,843
Excuse me.

657
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:17,360
I´m sorry, mate, it´s against the Iaw
for me to carry any more than--

658
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,962
Thank the Lord.

659
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:30,482
A Christmas miracle.

660
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:36,523
AII right, hop in.

661
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:39,844
Thanks for saving us.
I was freezing my IittIe tush off.

662
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,999
No worries. You know,
it´s pretty fuII back there.

663
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:46,000
- Why don´t you...
- Good idea.

664
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,401
Why don´t I?

665
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:51,403
Hey, watch the champagne.

666
00:48:55,287 --> 00:48:56,925
AII in.

667
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:10,161
- They don´t get out much.
- You wanna watch out, you guys.

668
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,598
You´II end up with a Iump of coaI
in your stocking.

669
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,320
You´re EngIish.

670
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:17,358
I Iove EngIish.

671
00:49:17,607 --> 00:49:19,643
- What´s your name?
- AIfie.

672
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:30,201
You wanna abuse
a IittIe substance, AIfie?

673
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,039
No, thanks. I´m trying to quit.

674
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:36,160
AII right. One hit.

675
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,200
Merry Christmastime

676
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:09,521
There´s an expression
the Yanks use, ´´Go with the fIow.´´

677
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:13,756
So, yeah, I got a dose
of the hoIiday bIues.

678
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:18,995
But when a girI of this mind-bIowing
caIibre invites you to a party,

679
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:22,756
it´s time to get going
and start fIowing.

680
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:26,886
Maybe it´s the Iate hour.

681
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,846
Maybe it´s the heaviIy
spiked eggnog.

682
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:38,475
Maybe it was simply
a mutual desperate desire

683
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,520
to have ourselves
a merry little Christmas.

684
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:45,756
Whatever the reason, hooking up
has never gone more swimmingly,

685
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:50,961
and l find myself saying
something highly out of character:

686
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:55,240
I´m renovating my apartment
on the Upper West Side.

687
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:58,876
But, say, you couId...

688
00:50:59,087 --> 00:51:03,683
...crash at my subIet,
if you want.

689
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:07,360
See you through the hoIidays.

690
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:10,117
That sounds inviting.

691
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:20,880
And so it came to pass,
that after all those years,

692
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:25,444
little Alfred finally got
what he wanted for Christmas.

693
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:39,560
The 1 2 days of Christmas
were flying by

694
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,883
at a surrealistic pace.

695
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:46,245
Yeah, it´s been quite the ride.

696
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,881
The package was irresistible.

697
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:57,558
A showstopper with
a new-school brand of sexiness.

698
00:51:58,487 --> 00:52:01,206
Who wouldn´t get off on the way
she makes heads turn?

699
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,477
Plus, we have so much in common.

700
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:10,481
- She´s sweet, fun, original, exciting,
- Adore you.

701
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:12,405
full of surprises.

702
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:16,799
Oh, and did l mention,
she makes a cracking good bed.

703
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:21,158
l began to wonder,

704
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:22,880
could this be the one...

705
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:28,041
...who finally holds my attention?

706
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:31,523
Happy New Year!

707
00:52:44,607 --> 00:52:46,359
ln every doomed relationship,

708
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:48,802
there comes what l like to call

709
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:52,716
´´the uh-oh moment. ´´

710
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,446
When a certain IittIe
something happens,

711
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:57,400
and you know you´ve just witnessed
the beginning of the end.

712
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:00,675
And suddenIy you stop
and you think:

713
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:04,641
´´Uh-oh, iceberg ahead.´´

714
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:09,405
With Nikki, that was
the first of many...

715
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:12,117
...uh-oh moments.

716
00:53:12,687 --> 00:53:15,281
lt began with petty arguments.

717
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:20,801
Followed by random bouts
of melancholia.

718
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:25,156
Major highs and manic lows.

719
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,725
This girl never knows
when she´s had one too many.

720
00:53:29,287 --> 00:53:34,042
And there had been constant displays
of erratic, reckless behaviour.

721
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:38,001
And thank you, no.
No, l did not have insurance.

722
00:53:39,807 --> 00:53:44,483
But whenever l begin to feel
there´s little reason to go on,

723
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:49,478
l´m reminded that we still have
one very major thing in common.

724
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,637
lf only she didn´t insist
on smoking before,

725
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:55,798
after

726
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:58,443
and during.

727
00:54:01,807 --> 00:54:04,162
What time are you gonna
be home, honey?

728
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:05,766
Hear that?

729
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,037
´´What time are you gonna
be home, honey?´´

730
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:10,837
That´s dangerousIy cIose
to wife-speak to me.

731
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:13,999
Because I´m making something
reaIIy speciaI for din-din.

732
00:54:14,687 --> 00:54:16,006
Din-din?

733
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:17,566
I´II caII Iater.

734
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:23,437
Listen, are you sure you don´t
think that coIour´s a IittIe bit intense?

735
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:27,885
- I think you´re a IittIe bit intense.
- CarefuI,

736
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:30,357
because you´ve got paint
aII over your hands.

737
00:54:32,087 --> 00:54:35,875
PIus, you´re wearing my favourite shirt
to paint the house in, Nik. Don´t--

738
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,677
Sorry, baby.

739
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:45,999
I gotta run.

740
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:47,316
No, I´ve gotta run.

741
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:51,486
I bet that I can make it
worth your whiIe to stay.

742
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:55,280
I´m sure you can. But you know what?
I´ve got that meeting.

743
00:54:55,847 --> 00:54:58,202
- Haven´t I?
- Yeah.

744
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,361
You know you´re in troubIe when
a sight Iike that can´t keep you pIanted.

745
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:13,884
When I was a boy
at St. AIban´s Secondary SchooI,

746
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:16,521
the schooI took us
on this cuIturaI trip

747
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:18,638
to observe art at one of the--

748
00:55:19,007 --> 00:55:20,804
One of those big famous
London museums.

749
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:22,922
Anyway, when I was there,

750
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:26,483
I came across this statue
of a Greek goddess in marbIe.

751
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:30,202
Aphrodi-- Aphrodite,
something Iike that.

752
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:32,762
BeautifuI, she was.

753
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:36,724
Perfect femaIe form.

754
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:38,679
ChiseIIed features.

755
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:40,639
Exquisite.

756
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,764
I stood in awe of her.

757
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,006
FinaIIy, the teacher caIIs us
aII over, and I´m waIking past it,

758
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:51,280
and on the way I notice,
in the side of this Greek goddess,

759
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:55,480
aII these cracks,
chips, imperfections.

760
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,685
Ruined her for me.

761
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:02,318
WeII, that´s Nikki.

762
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:06,321
A beautifuI scuIpture...

763
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:08,119
...damaged...

764
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:11,478
...in a way you don´t notice
tiII you get too cIose.

765
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,203
I Iost the signaI for a second there.

766
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:26,845
But I don´t know.

767
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:29,515
It´s just a Iot of personaI stuff
going on.

768
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,080
You know what I mean?

769
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,559
- Oh, I know.
- WeIcome, Mr AIfie.

770
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:40,361
Good to see you, EIvis. Look, I hope
you don´t mind me rambIing on.

771
00:56:40,527 --> 00:56:42,882
- Enjoy your evening, sir.
- Thank you.

772
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:49,600
As you can see, the Iad´s
moving up in the worId.

773
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,920
It´s just that I´ve got
this friend who´s,

774
00:56:56,127 --> 00:56:59,676
Iet´s say, outstayed his weIcome.

775
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:03,882
AbsoIuteIy right.

776
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,841
It´s a Iot tougher getting them out
than getting them in. I Iike that.

777
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:10,402
You´II never guess
who I´m dropping in on now.

778
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,598
I wouIdn´t have beIieved it myseIf
a coupIe of weeks ago.

779
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,763
Why don´t you just try being honest,

780
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:18,357
and teII your friend that the hoteI
is under new management

781
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:22,355
and that they have to vacate
the premises. You know what I mean.

782
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,398
That kimono

783
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,519
does wonders for your décoIIetage.

784
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,604
- Big word.
- Big décoIIetage.

785
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,965
Why don´t we have a drink and you
can teII me the rest of your troubIes.

786
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:49,080
Instead of me Iistening to hers.
That´s a change.

787
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:53,041
You know, for someone
so very young, you´re terribIy wise.

788
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,719
Secret admirer?

789
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,757
One of many.

790
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:03,565
You wouId never think of bringing
a girI fIowers, wouId you, AIfie?

791
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,803
It wouId onIy encourage them.

792
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:07,804
I´m gonna make us that drink.

793
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:09,480
What´s your poison, sweetheart?

794
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:13,566
I´II have a spot of whiskey, pIease.
MidIeton Rare, if you´ve got it.

795
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:15,803
I Iike dropping a fancy brand name
in now and again,

796
00:58:16,007 --> 00:58:17,599
Iet her know she ain´t
the onIy one been around.

797
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:21,840
Why not make this
an absinthe afternoon?

798
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:23,719
BriIIiant.

799
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:28,362
- No idea what she´s taIking about.
- You´ve had absinthe?

800
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:31,280
Not recentIy, no.
Remind me, what is it again?

801
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:35,924
The Green Fairy. The French
impressionists´ Iiquid drug of choice.

802
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:40,845
And I got you some of those
IittIe egg thingies you Iike so much.

803
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:51,046
I mention I Iike something once,
next thing I know,

804
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:52,885
I get it on a siIver pIatter.

805
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:06,764
Perfect, huh?

806
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:09,242
Kind of pad I pIan
to earn myseIf one day.

807
00:59:09,447 --> 00:59:12,996
Understated eIegance
with just a touch of the trendy.

808
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:16,837
She´s a reguIar fashionista.

809
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,484
You don´t have to teII this one
which sIingbacks go with which frock.

810
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,123
Owns her own cosmetics company.

811
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:25,682
Empire, actuaIIy.

812
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:27,957
Started out doing faciaIs
in a fancy saIon.

813
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:31,159
Took a handfuI of mud,
mixed it with a dash of papaya,

814
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:34,677
put it on the market,
and bingo: AII this.

815
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:37,799
This stuff is so iIIegaI.

816
00:59:38,647 --> 00:59:41,525
I smuggIed a whoIe batch
of it back from Prague

817
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:44,361
in Listerine bottIes.

818
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:51,960
Oh, I checked out
your business pIan.

819
00:59:55,447 --> 00:59:58,166
- And?
- I´m impressed.

820
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:00,678
- You seem surprised.
- Not at aII.

821
01:00:00,927 --> 01:00:03,077
Because underneath
aII that bravado

822
01:00:03,287 --> 01:00:05,881
beats the heart of a guy who´s a Iot
smarter than he thinks he is,

823
01:00:06,047 --> 01:00:10,677
but not nearIy as cocky as he´d Iike
everybody eIse to beIieve.

824
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:21,957
What are we--?
What exactIy are we basing this on?

825
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:25,682
This insight into my personaIity?

826
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:33,765
That it takes one to know one.

827
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:51,845
What?

828
01:00:52,927 --> 01:00:55,725
I was just wondering if there´s
a cIever IittIe tattoo artist out there

829
01:00:55,927 --> 01:01:00,125
who couId change ´´PabIo´´ into ´´AIfie.´´

830
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:08,235
Here´s to cIever IittIe tattoo artists.

831
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:21,199
Jesus.

832
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:28,759
It made me feeI
aII warm going down.

833
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:31,117
That´s my job.

834
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,563
You know what they say.

835
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:45,203
What do they say?

836
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:51,203
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.

837
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:58,004
Oh, great.

838
01:02:04,047 --> 01:02:05,560
Check this out.

839
01:02:10,287 --> 01:02:12,482
Have a Iook at the size of this tub.

840
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,917
She´s had two husbands,
both croaked,

841
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:17,880
and I have a feeIing
this was the scene of the crime.

842
01:02:18,487 --> 01:02:20,796
Come on, baby, Iet´s get wet.

843
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,486
If she keeps this up,

844
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:33,726
we´re gonna be updating that tattoo
of hers a Iot sooner than she thinks.

845
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:47,759
Remember how little Alfred finally got
what he wanted for Christmas?

846
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:52,760
Be carefuI what you wish for.

847
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:05,597
There´s something else.

848
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:18,361
Dozed off?

849
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:22,682
Yeah.

850
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:26,122
I tried waiting up for you.

851
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:31,875
- Your meeting ran Iate, huh?
- Very. I´m knackered.

852
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:33,964
And wet.

853
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:37,277
But...

854
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:41,878
...I do want us to have
a IittIe chat, Nikki.

855
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,038
Okay.

856
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,442
Sure.

857
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:51,002
Why don´t we taIk over
a midnight snack.

858
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:54,722
I made roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding.

859
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:58,006
That was your favourite
as a young Iad, right?

860
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:01,920
And check the pIace out,
if you pIease.

861
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:07,363
- Your IittIe girI worked her fanny off.
- I noticed. It Iooks briIIiant.

862
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,079
ReaIIy smashing.

863
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:13,879
- So, Nik--
- AIfie, I´ve been thinking.

864
01:04:15,047 --> 01:04:18,119
WiII you Iook at these
cute IittIe potatoes?

865
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:26,284
Okay. I know I have been
a reaI handfuI IateIy.

866
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,883
I don´t know, I think it has to do a Iot
with me feeIing dispIaced...

867
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,486
...and not totaIIy trusting.

868
01:04:37,087 --> 01:04:39,601
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

869
01:04:39,807 --> 01:04:43,004
I am gonna do better.

870
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,162
I promise.

871
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:49,362
I am gonna take my medication
reIigiousIy from now on.

872
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:53,560
And everything, everything
is gonna be easy and breezy.

873
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,843
Sound good? Honey?

874
01:04:56,247 --> 01:04:59,080
So come, come and sit.
A feast awaits.

875
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:01,924
I aIready ate, Nik.

876
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:04,322
Of course.

877
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:06,597
No worries, we´II have Ieftovers.

878
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:11,164
I can whip up a IittIe
corned beef hash for brunch.

879
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,476
What´s the matter, AIfie?

880
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:22,843
Nothing. I just...

881
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:26,957
I´ve got a Iot on my mind and...

882
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:30,037
- ...I´m feeIing a bit--
- What?

883
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:35,241
CoId? Distant? Remote? What?

884
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:38,801
Oh, Nik, this is a compIete drag.

885
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:43,003
Everything happened so quickIy.

886
01:05:44,367 --> 01:05:47,325
- I´m not the best at this sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?

887
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:50,846
I...

888
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,966
...don´t know exactIy how to say it.

889
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,684
Sure you do, AIfie.

890
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:03,036
You´ve had pIenty
of experience dumping girIs.

891
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:21,119
Don´t worry.

892
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:24,765
I´m aIready gone.

893
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,198
Strange.

894
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:24,921
But even when you know
it has to end...

895
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:27,797
...when it finally does...

896
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:31,759
...you always get
that inevitable twinge:

897
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:35,439
Have l done the right thing?

898
01:07:43,807 --> 01:07:46,321
I must admit...

899
01:07:46,527 --> 01:07:48,882
...I do miss the companionship.

900
01:07:52,007 --> 01:07:55,124
Nikki was a showstopper.

901
01:07:57,167 --> 01:08:01,206
But as me ugIy oId Aunt GIadys
used to say,

902
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:04,280
´´Looks aren´t everything.´´

903
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:06,284
I used to think that was
a Ioad of boIIocks,

904
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:10,559
but just IateIy I´ve been thinking...

905
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:13,361
...maybe the oId bat had something.

906
01:08:53,727 --> 01:08:55,399
JuIie?

907
01:08:56,527 --> 01:08:58,245
AIfie, hi.

908
01:08:58,487 --> 01:08:59,840
What a surprise.

909
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:04,280
- God, I haven´t seen you since...
- Yeah.

910
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:06,997
You Iook-- You Iook amazing.

911
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:09,675
Thanks. You too.
You Iook good too.

912
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:13,037
I´m getting over a coId.

913
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:16,962
- But you´re okay otherwise?
- I´m fine. I´m aIways fine.

914
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,365
It´s good to see you.

915
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:24,205
And you.

916
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,683
Hey, you know, I was...

917
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,400
I´m sorry about
what happened between us.

918
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:40,756
And I´m sorry how it aII ended up.
It wasn´t--

919
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:43,322
It wasn´t good.

920
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:51,960
I feIt bad about not seeing Max
and about not seeing you.

921
01:09:55,767 --> 01:09:58,804
- It´s water under the bridge.
- Good.

922
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:03,000
You know...

923
01:10:04,327 --> 01:10:05,806
...I´m wondering...

924
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,757
Maybe we...

925
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:16,039
You know I can never
promise anything.

926
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:18,838
But if you want, if you Iike,

927
01:10:19,047 --> 01:10:20,400
maybe we couId
see each other again.

928
01:10:20,847 --> 01:10:22,803
It wouId be okay by me.

929
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:25,726
It wouId be more than okay,
it wouId be great.

930
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:28,566
- AIfie, I--
- Yeah?

931
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:31,677
This is Adam.

932
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,638
Hey, how are you?

933
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:38,519
- Hey, how you doing, Adam?
- Pretty good.

934
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:40,399
- Adam.
- Yeah.

935
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,438
It was great running into you.

936
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:53,678
- You Iook fantastic.
- Thanks.

937
01:10:56,807 --> 01:10:59,002
What time is it? I´ve gotta go.

938
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:01,961
I´m Iate for a meeting.
Nice to meet you, Adam.

939
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:13,357
JuIie?

940
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,964
JuIie?

941
01:11:16,007 --> 01:11:18,919
- How´s Max?
- Oh, reaIIy good.

942
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:21,562
WiII you say hi?

943
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:24,520
- Sure.
- Or not.

944
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,959
Be weII.

945
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:14,719
HeIIo.

946
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:19,003
HeIIo.

947
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:26,566
Mrs Wing, is everything--?

948
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:28,485
Wing.

949
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:32,439
Why are you crying?

950
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:34,239
I´m not crying. Get out.

951
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:38,482
- You sure?
- I´m fine. Get out, AIfie.

952
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:42,276
I´m sorry. I just wanted to see
if I couId borrow a car.

953
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,523
She Ieave me.

954
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,683
Sorry?

955
01:12:46,887 --> 01:12:49,276
BIossom Ieave me.

956
01:12:49,487 --> 01:12:53,799
BIossom? Is that your wife´s name,
BIossom?

957
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:57,682
What I do wrong, AIfie? Love her?

958
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:03,241
Look, mate. Come on,
you can win her back.

959
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:05,563
Woo her. Send fIowers
and chocoIates.

960
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:08,361
Write a poem.

961
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:10,961
- That what you do?
- WeII, actuaIIy, no, I´ve never done that,

962
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,284
but it may be a way to go.

963
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:17,963
What rhyme with BIossom?

964
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,676
I wouId try ´´awesome.´´

965
01:13:27,447 --> 01:13:29,165
Okay.

966
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:28,320
You never cease to amaze.

967
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:30,643
Hey.

968
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:34,039
Great to see you too, Lon.

969
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:38,243
I guess I shouId have rung.
Hey, Sam.

970
01:14:38,447 --> 01:14:40,802
WeII, that wouId have been a pIan.

971
01:14:41,887 --> 01:14:44,560
WeII, you know, I´m sorry,
it was just...

972
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,238
It´s nice.

973
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:58,565
Look, Lonette...

974
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:03,204
This is so uncomfortabIe, I know.
Because--

975
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:06,479
You don´t have to whisper.
MarIon´s not here.

976
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:14,486
I reaIIy miss you both.

977
01:15:14,847 --> 01:15:17,759
And I just wondered, maybe...

978
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,517
Maybe me and you couId put it
aII behind us,

979
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:24,680
pretend Iike it never happened,
and then move forward, you know?

980
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:27,563
I just--

981
01:15:28,527 --> 01:15:31,121
You know, AIfie...

982
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:33,798
...dropping by wasn´t a good idea.

983
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:43,563
You two didn´t have a baby.

984
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:48,437
You did have a baby.

985
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:52,837
No, you were right the first time.

986
01:16:19,607 --> 01:16:23,441
Thinking back to that day at the clinic,
l remember

987
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:26,241
trying to look in Lon´s eyes to see
if l could even begin to understand

988
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:31,276
what she was going through,
and how she wouldn´t look at me.

989
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,957
And l think l knew then.

990
01:16:34,207 --> 01:16:37,324
l just didn´t want to admit it to myself.

991
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:41,881
So classically...

992
01:16:43,367 --> 01:16:45,562
...l said nothing.

993
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:49,486
I knew there was
a good chance the baby

994
01:16:49,727 --> 01:16:51,957
couId be MarIon´s.

995
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:57,486
At Ieast, I hoped.

996
01:16:58,807 --> 01:17:00,684
This is a Iot...

997
01:17:03,047 --> 01:17:05,163
...for me too, Lon.

998
01:17:32,767 --> 01:17:34,962
MarIon stayed.

999
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:36,999
For now.

1000
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,801
Is there anything I can do?

1001
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:51,681
What are you gonna do, AIfie?

1002
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:32,756
Hey.

1003
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:42,116
You know, I never...

1004
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,918
- I never meant--
- You never mean to hurt anybody.

1005
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:52,283
But you do, AIfie.

1006
01:20:19,767 --> 01:20:22,406
l felt l needed a friend to talk to.

1007
01:20:22,607 --> 01:20:25,997
Problem was, they were suddenly
in short supply.

1008
01:20:26,207 --> 01:20:31,440
And I don´t remember being in the car.
I just-- I just-- I was stopped.

1009
01:20:31,647 --> 01:20:33,239
And I´m crying.

1010
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:37,804
- Crying for the IittIe one?
- I don´t know exactIy.

1011
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:40,563
Maybe for him.

1012
01:20:41,927 --> 01:20:44,122
MostIy, I think, for me.

1013
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,077
And MarIon.

1014
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:52,957
I never had anybody Iook at me
quite Iike that before.

1015
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:58,158
And beIieve me, I´ve had some Iooks
that couId kiII.

1016
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:05,878
He stood by Lonette.
I couId´ve never, ever--

1017
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:09,397
You don´t know what you´II do
tiII you reaIIy Iove someone.

1018
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:13,960
WeII, now what?

1019
01:21:15,327 --> 01:21:17,602
You gonna shoehorn yourseIf
into the situation?

1020
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:19,160
No.

1021
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:23,076
You did the onIy thing you couId do.
You behaved Iike a gentIeman.

1022
01:21:23,327 --> 01:21:25,204
I´ve never been accused
of that before.

1023
01:21:25,407 --> 01:21:28,763
Don´t get aII choked up. You aIso
behaved Iike a scheming,

1024
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,846
backstabbing, so-Iow-you-can-Iook-up-
a-snake´s-asshoIe son of a bitch.

1025
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:36,562
Next time, think before unzipping.

1026
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:41,877
It´s aII right. You screwed up.

1027
01:21:42,087 --> 01:21:44,237
So, what are you gonna do?

1028
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,876
Run to the bridge?

1029
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:49,677
The question is...

1030
01:21:51,887 --> 01:21:55,118
...what´s gonna happen with
the rest of your Iife?

1031
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:23,720
I´d be Iying if I didn´t admit the events
of the past few weeks

1032
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:26,521
have knocked me for a bit of a Ioop.

1033
01:22:33,087 --> 01:22:35,806
AII right, aII right, aII right.

1034
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:47,320
HeIIo, mate.

1035
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:49,040
And what can we do for you
this evening?

1036
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:50,999
- How much are one of those?
- Five-fifty.

1037
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:53,801
And you´II need to put them in water
immediateIy.

1038
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:56,037
Right, I´II have that.

1039
01:23:00,887 --> 01:23:02,445
Second thought.

1040
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:04,922
ActuaIIy, this is
sort of a speciaI thing.

1041
01:23:05,367 --> 01:23:07,961
- What´s the occasion?
- Say again?

1042
01:23:08,207 --> 01:23:12,644
- ProposaI?
- No. No, no.

1043
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:18,795
WeII, I do want to extend an offer
to maybe have a go at it for a bit,

1044
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:20,804
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

1045
01:23:21,007 --> 01:23:24,204
I get it. Commitment issues.

1046
01:23:25,207 --> 01:23:28,404
TeII me what she, or he, is Iike,

1047
01:23:28,607 --> 01:23:30,404
and we´II find the appropriate
bIoom.

1048
01:23:30,967 --> 01:23:34,039
WeII, she is...

1049
01:23:37,527 --> 01:23:41,156
You know what, she´s adventurous.

1050
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:47,278
- Frivole.
- And very sexy.

1051
01:23:47,847 --> 01:23:50,315
I´m thinking Dolce Vita.

1052
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:53,997
A IittIe mischievous.
You know, cheeky?

1053
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:57,319
AvaIanche, with a touch

1054
01:23:57,727 --> 01:24:01,037
of mio amore.

1055
01:24:01,927 --> 01:24:04,964
And then under it aII, she´s just--

1056
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:09,080
She´s just kind of sweet.

1057
01:24:32,687 --> 01:24:34,245
Liz?

1058
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:37,439
- HeIIo?
- It´s me, my Iove.

1059
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:43,246
Hey, I didn´t expect to see you tonight.
I thought you were working.

1060
01:24:43,447 --> 01:24:46,086
I had a canceIIation,
so I took the night off.

1061
01:24:46,287 --> 01:24:48,755
Listen, I thought we shouId get
up earIy, get out of the city,

1062
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,043
go to the country
and see if we can stay

1063
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:53,841
- at that B & B you´re aIways on about.
- I´d Iove to, but I can´t.

1064
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:55,725
I have an investors´ breakfast
in the morning.

1065
01:24:55,927 --> 01:24:58,760
- How about on the weekend?
- BriIIiant. Better.

1066
01:24:58,967 --> 01:25:01,640
AII right. I thought you may...

1067
01:25:02,527 --> 01:25:05,246
Oh, my God.

1068
01:25:06,007 --> 01:25:09,044
No. AIfie.

1069
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:13,525
- Oh, what a sweet gesture.
- MiIady.

1070
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:17,845
They´re not out of some pIastic bucket.
I handpicked, Iike, every bud.

1071
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:20,686
- I can see that.
- And apparentIy, I have a bit of a fIair

1072
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:22,479
for fIower arranging.

1073
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:25,635
I´m impressed.

1074
01:25:25,847 --> 01:25:28,441
- TaIk about being bIown away.
- Good. Mission accompIished.

1075
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:33,242
I Iike surprising you.

1076
01:25:34,407 --> 01:25:36,477
WeII, you certainIy have done that.

1077
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:41,800
AII right, then. WeII, you´re up earIy,
so I´m off.

1078
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:45,483
- I´m gonna see you tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

1079
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:48,360
When we speak,
there´s some things--

1080
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:51,035
Some thing I reaIIy wanna
taIk to you about.

1081
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:53,078
What, honey?

1082
01:25:53,287 --> 01:25:57,758
I´m gonna wait for the exact perfect
moment, and that´s aII I´II say.

1083
01:25:59,967 --> 01:26:01,685
I´II ring you in the morning.

1084
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:04,361
And, AIfie, thank you for the fIowers.
They made my evening.

1085
01:26:04,567 --> 01:26:06,046
ReaIIy?

1086
01:26:08,047 --> 01:26:12,279
In that case, maybe I´II stay.

1087
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:17,719
I don´t--

1088
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:22,037
No, it´s not a good idea.

1089
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:28,923
There´s a guy in there, isn´t there?

1090
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:33,961
God...

1091
01:26:42,527 --> 01:26:44,119
Go.

1092
01:26:48,727 --> 01:26:50,399
Don´t do this.

1093
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,321
What´s he got?

1094
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:00,642
- Better than me?
- AIfie, pIease.

1095
01:27:00,887 --> 01:27:03,117
TeII me. PIease?

1096
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:10,046
ReaIIy, I wouId Iike to know.
What´s he got? TeII me.

1097
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:14,160
I want to know what he´s got.
PIease teII me.

1098
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:17,962
Come on. Come on.
Come on, just teII me.

1099
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,044
Just teII me, come on.

1100
01:27:21,927 --> 01:27:24,441
What´s he got better than me?!

1101
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:35,602
He´s younger than you.

1102
01:28:02,287 --> 01:28:04,881
´´He´s younger than you. ´´

1103
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:09,598
l´ve gotta admit,
l didn´t see it coming.

1104
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:13,960
She caught me off-guard, all right.

1105
01:28:15,767 --> 01:28:19,362
You couIdn´t teII, though, couId you?

1106
01:28:21,487 --> 01:28:27,164
As you´ve Iearned by now,
I´m rather skiIIed at hiding my feeIings.

1107
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:33,164
You see, the thing with feeIings
is they have

1108
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:38,122
this quiet way of sneaking up on you
when you Ieast expect it.

1109
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:42,203
You know what I mean?

1110
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:44,358
Yeah.

1111
01:28:45,647 --> 01:28:47,239
Like with Liz.

1112
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:51,600
Who wouId´ve thought,
of aII the women I´ve known...

1113
01:28:53,847 --> 01:28:57,476
...the one I Iet my guard down with
deIivers the knockout punch.

1114
01:29:00,287 --> 01:29:01,845
Ironic.

1115
01:29:04,487 --> 01:29:06,796
CaIendar word.

1116
01:29:14,607 --> 01:29:16,120
Dorie.

1117
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:23,318
- Hi.
- HeIIo, AIfie.

1118
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:28,726
- I haven´t seen you in ages.
- Maybe because you stopped caIIing.

1119
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:32,520
I know. Things were getting
a bit too--

1120
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:35,241
Don´t bother expIaining. I´m way past
needing excuses.

1121
01:29:35,487 --> 01:29:39,162
AII right. No, you know what?
I want to expIain.

1122
01:29:39,367 --> 01:29:41,597
What? You had your fiII of me?

1123
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:44,719
Someone cuter came aIong?
I don´t need to hear it, AIfie.

1124
01:29:45,087 --> 01:29:46,236
- Look, Dorie--
- ReaIIy.

1125
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,766
Look, Dorie...

1126
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:51,845
What happens with me is--

1127
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:54,883
I don´t know, I get--

1128
01:29:55,087 --> 01:29:58,966
When it gets too-- Not cIose
but something Iike that,

1129
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:04,116
I start to feeI-- Not stifIed,

1130
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:07,922
not trapped, but something Iike that.

1131
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:10,766
And I... And...

1132
01:30:11,887 --> 01:30:14,162
You know? You know what I mean?

1133
01:30:17,527 --> 01:30:20,678
Did that make--?
Did that make any sense?

1134
01:30:21,447 --> 01:30:25,042
I think it has to make sense to you
more than me at this point.

1135
01:30:27,407 --> 01:30:29,238
Yeah, fair enough.

1136
01:30:29,447 --> 01:30:32,280
I need to go. He´II be waiting for me.

1137
01:30:32,487 --> 01:30:34,045
Dorie.

1138
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:40,959
I´m sorry.

1139
01:30:56,527 --> 01:30:58,358
Good Iuck, AIfie.

1140
01:31:14,207 --> 01:31:16,516
I warned them aII from
the beginning.

1141
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:20,276
I aIways said something aIong
the Iines of,

1142
01:31:20,487 --> 01:31:22,364
´´I must advise you,

1143
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:26,765
I am stamped with an
invisibIe warning.

1144
01:31:26,967 --> 01:31:31,438
I wiII not commit. I wiII never marry.´´

1145
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:41,766
Despite my best efforts, I´m beginning
to feeI some smaII cracks

1146
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:46,404
in my faux finish.

1147
01:31:48,007 --> 01:31:51,079
You know, when l look back
on my little life,

1148
01:31:51,287 --> 01:31:53,721
and all the women l´ve known...

1149
01:31:55,487 --> 01:31:58,399
...l can´t help but think about...

1150
01:32:00,247 --> 01:32:03,000
...all that they´ve done for me...

1151
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:06,161
...and how little l´ve done for them.

1152
01:32:06,367 --> 01:32:09,996
How they looked after me,
cared for me...

1153
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:13,757
...and l repaid them by never
returning the favour.

1154
01:32:16,207 --> 01:32:17,925
Yeah.

1155
01:32:18,127 --> 01:32:21,244
I used to think I had the best end
of the deaI.

1156
01:32:25,527 --> 01:32:27,563
What have I got?

1157
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:29,962
ReaIIy?

1158
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:33,401
Some money in my pocket.

1159
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:37,402
Some nice threads.
Fancy car at my disposaI.

1160
01:32:37,607 --> 01:32:39,882
And I´m singIe.

1161
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:46,362
Unattached. Free as a bird.

1162
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:50,922
I don´t depend on nobody.

1163
01:32:51,127 --> 01:32:53,243
Nobody depends on me.

1164
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:56,483
My Iife´s my own.

1165
01:33:02,447 --> 01:33:05,280
But I don´t have peace of mind.

1166
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:14,685
And if you don´t have that,
you´ve got nothing.

1167
01:33:17,647 --> 01:33:19,046
So...

1168
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:23,877
So, what´s the answer?
That´s what I keep asking myseIf.

1169
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:30,677
What´s it aII about?

1170
01:33:32,687 --> 01:33:34,757
You know what I mean?
