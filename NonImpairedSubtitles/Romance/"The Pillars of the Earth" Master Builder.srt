1
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,800
Where do you want this then?

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,480
- Lay that down here.
- All right.

3
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,720
Steady, Brother Paul.

4
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,000
Afternoon, Brother.

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,600
- I'm looking for the new prior.
- In the church.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Don't be long.
I don't want to stay if there's no work.

7
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,240
What's that?

8
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,680
St. Adolphus. It's his cathedral.

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Is that his real head?

10
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
The Romans cut it off, threw it in the river.

11
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,760
His headless body pulled it out
and carried it here.

12
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,960
Forgive him, Father. He's...
He's just a curious lad.

13
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
Which should be encouraged in the young.
How can I help you?

14
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm Tom Builder. This is my son, Alfred.

15
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,720
- We'd like to repairy our church.
- Well, I'm Prior Philip.

16
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,560
And I want it repaired, but I can't hire you.
We haven't a shilling.

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,640
Sorry.

18
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Martha!

19
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,320
You!

20
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
Get away from me!

21
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,360
That man nearly killed my daughter!

22
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
No!

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
I saw him that night.

24
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,600
What night? What are you talking about?

25
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,800
The night that your woman died.

26
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,560
He took it.

27
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
He took what?

28
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,520
Please, I won't hurt him. I promise.

29
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm no good to you, am I?

30
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,840
I'm no good to anyone.

31
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,720
He's better off here than he is with me,
but I don't want to leave.

32
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,400
I left him once before. I can't do that again.

33
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,920
- You have little choice.
- I know that. You think I don't know that?

34
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm useless. I can't support my family.
I can't stay with my son.

35
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
Why can't God give me work just this once?

36
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
My God!

37
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,000
There's a fire in the roof!

38
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
How could this happen?

39
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,280
What do we do?

40
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,560
St. Adolphus, save your church!

41
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,640
The roof's afire!

42
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,520
- God save us!
- What do we do?

43
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,760
Hurry, hurry!

44
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,320
Quick, quick! The chalices and the vesper!

45
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,480
Quick!

46
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
Quick!

47
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,960
Philip! Philip! Come out!

48
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,120
No, the relic! I must save the relic.

49
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
Philip!

50
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
Philip!

51
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,440
St. Adolphus, save your blessed church!

52
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
This is the Devil's work.

53
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Jack!

54
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
What happened?

55
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,520
We can stay now.

56
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,360
At least no one died.

57
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,400
I prayed for this last night.

58
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,000
God help me.

59
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,840
It was lightning.

60
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,280
Without a storm?

61
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,040
All my life I've waited for work like this.

62
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
Now it's here, they can't afford to pay me.

63
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,160
We could work for free.

64
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
They give us food and lodging,
you could stay with your little boy.

65
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,320
It's gone, smashed.

66
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,080
We're finished.

67
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480
You can't rebuild a cathedral
without its relic.

68
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
A skull's a skull, Philip.

69
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,200
- We don't even know it was his.
- What about the miracles?

70
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,880
I've been praying to that skull for years
to save my poor sister from the street.

71
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,680
- Useless.
- It does take belief, too.

72
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,680
Yes, but what if people
believe another skull is his?

73
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,760
One from the ossuary. There's thousands.

74
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,800
And who's to say the monk
whose head we choose isn't a saint?

75
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,760
Because that would be a lie!

76
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Not a lie, a leavening, a means to an end.

77
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,840
And the end is God's glory.

78
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Well, at least the crypt was spared.

79
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
You can use it for services, can't you?

80
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,800
Until the new church is roofed.

81
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,640
What makes you think
there'll even be a new church?

82
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Because I will build it.

83
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,520
You house us, you feed us,
and I will defer payment.

84
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,440
This may be the Devil's work, but it
was God that sent you a master builder.

85
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,680
<i>My dear Bishop.</i>

86
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
<i>Undoubtedly, you have heard
of our misfortune.</i>

87
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,320
<i>But God has blessed us
with a rough-handed angel</i>

88
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
<i>to help us through this crisis.</i>

89
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
<i>Tom Builder is his name,</i>

90
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,720
<i>and he is determined
to give us a new cathedral.</i>

91
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,960
<i>There is much work to be done
and workmen to be hired,</i>

92
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,680
<i>and, of course,
this brings up the question of money.</i>

93
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
<i>I don't wish to burden you
as you begin your office,</i>

94
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,200
<i>but perhaps, with your permission,
I could approach our new king</i>

95
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,400
<i>and ask his favor in this trying time.</i>

96
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,640
The plans for the expansion
of the palace, Your Eminence.

97
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,680
We're repairing all of the old buildings,
as well as the chapel, of course.

98
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,360
And we're adding
an entire new wing over here.

99
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,720
Did you scratch it?

100
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,480
Yeah.

101
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,040
You shouldn't wear it
picking up heavy rocks.

102
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Is it worth a lot of money?

103
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,840
Hey, Jack, give it here.
I'll put it in a safe place.

104
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,440
Jack...

105
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
May I speak to you for a moment?

106
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
I want you to make a statue of St. Adolphus.

107
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,960
Me?

108
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
I've never worked in stone.

109
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,480
That's not true.

110
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
I saw the carvings you did
in the walls of the cave.

111
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
I think you'll manage.

112
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,920
- I wouldn't know where to start.
- Take your time.

113
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Experiment.

114
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
Listen.

115
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,800
- To what?
- To the stone.

116
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,440
You're a distraction, you are.

117
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,320
I've seen the monks
watching you while they work.

118
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
They don't know what to make of you.

119
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh, I think they do, Tom Builder.

120
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,200
Are you jealous?

121
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,560
No, I'm not jealous.

122
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,840
We'll have a wooden ceiling,
like the old church.

123
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,360
I'd prefer it in stone, but it's far too heavy.

124
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,280
Also, it's hard to find long pieces of timber,

125
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,560
so the nave will have to be only 32-feet wide.

126
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,440
But it'll be high. It'll be very high.

127
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,680
How will the walls support the weight?

128
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,880
Well, have a look at this.

129
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Pointed arches?
I've never seen such a thing.

130
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
It'll bear the weight better.

131
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,160
Which, along with the buttresses,
will allow the windows to be tall.

132
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,200
Tall enough to let in the light.

133
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,560
A cathedral...

134
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
It's God's anteroom.

135
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,000
It's halfway to Heaven.

136
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,440
And the light...

137
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,400
The light is everything.

138
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
How long will this take?

139
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
It depends how many people you employ.

140
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,160
But if you were to hire 30 masons

141
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,520
with enough laborers,
carpenters and smiths to service them,

142
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,360
that's 15 years.

143
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
- Have you done this before?
- No.

144
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,200
- How do you know it'll work?
- It'll work.

145
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,080
What do you think?

146
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,280
I think it's extraordinary.

147
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,760
It's from Bishop Waleran, Prior.

148
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,040
He wants me to meet him at Shiring Castle
on my way to see the King.

149
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
I don't know why.

150
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,840
I shouldn't be long, Remigius,

151
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,320
but until I return, as subprior,
you're in charge.

152
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,560
Safe journeys.

153
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,160
Where's my ring?

154
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,160
Jack! Jack!

155
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,560
I hung it around my neck,
and you stole it in the night!

156
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,640
Why should you care?
You said it was worthless!

157
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,320
Calm down!
You said he took your ring.

158
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
How do you know?
Maybe it fell off during the night.

159
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,720
I looked everywhere.

160
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
- What's wrong?
- He took my ring!

161
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,120
I don't want his bloody ring!

162
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,400
Where is it? Look at me, boy!

163
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,040
You can't witch me!

164
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,760
You killed my ma and you stole my da,
but you can't work your charms on me!

165
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,640
Is anybody here?

166
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,440
- Who are you?
- Philip, Prior of Kingsbridge.

167
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
What is your business here?

168
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,200
I've come to see the Bishop,
on my way to the King.

169
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
Let him go, Matthew.

170
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm Aliena, daughter of the Earl.
I saw you at the harvest service.

171
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
My lady.

172
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,040
And I'm Richard, his son and heir.

173
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,600
Welcome to Shiring Castle.

174
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,480
Does anyone know you're here?

175
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,840
Why should they?

176
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,400
Have you seen our father?

177
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I hear he's in Winchester, in prison.

178
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,640
He's not a traitor, you know.
He loves his kingdom as much as anyone.

179
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,200
Once I learn who libeled him,

180
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,360
I'll have the sheriff give the brute
a public hanging.

181
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
How did you escape, my lady?

182
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
Show him, Richard.

183
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a secret passage.
Would you like to see it?

184
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
No, thank you.

185
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,800
- You're going to see the King, you said?
- Yes.

186
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,560
Then you must demand our father's release.

187
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,440
Tell him to give us back our castle.

188
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,640
I don't think that will be possible, my lady.

189
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,240
- Hello, Philip.
- Good morning, My Lord Bishop.

190
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,680
You really want to rebuild your church?

191
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,440
Yes, Father, I do.

192
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,280
The cathedral is
God's shadow over history, Father.

193
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
We...

194
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,000
We live in a world that is striving for order,

195
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,720
which is art, which is learning,
which is people creating something

196
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,800
that will bring God's heart
into their community,

197
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,600
that will survive wars and famine,
that will survive history.

198
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,040
I thought I was ambitious.

199
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,440
- Father, I only want...
- Philip, Philip, Philip!

200
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,120
Look around you.

201
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,520
This is the smallest earldom in the kingdom,

202
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,560
but it has a huge quarry
which produces first-class limestone,

203
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,920
and its forests, good timber.

204
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,120
If you had this land,
you could rebuild your church.

205
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
Why would the King give me land
instead of money?

206
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
You unmasked the traitor.

207
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,720
Bartholomew confessed.
Maud and Gloucester ran away to France.

208
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,920
Stephen owes you his crown.

209
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,840
Think about it.

210
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,320
Why did Waleran meet
the Prior of Kingsbridge in Shiring Castle?

211
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,440
It's our land, isn't it?
He should have asked permission.

212
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,200
Why do you say it's our land?
You're not earl yet.

213
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
It's a mere formality.

214
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,200
The King will give me the title
within the month.

215
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,480
He owes it to me.

216
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,680
Well then, I think we should
remind the King of what he owes.

217
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,880
And I think we should do it soon.

218
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,040
She is a witch.

219
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
I saw her.

220
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
Doing what? Say it.

221
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,240
Making a potion out of dead frogs.

222
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,720
She gave it to my ma and it killed her.

223
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,160
Then she bewitched my da
and made love to him on my mother's grave.

224
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,840
You swear to that? On your soul?

225
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,720
Yes.

226
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Brothers, the boy speaks true.

227
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,600
I knew this woman years ago,
when I first came here.

228
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,960
She was condemned for witchcraft
and a price put on her head.

229
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
She disappeared with her son,

230
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
and the people said
the Devil had taken them home.

231
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,840
It was she who started the fire.

232
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,440
She must burn.

233
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
Leave the talking to me, Philip.

234
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,920
And if the King does ask you a question,
answer plainly.

235
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Whatever you do, don't beg.

236
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,720
Make room!

237
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
Here comes the traitor, Bartholomew!

238
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,280
- Hey! Shame on you!
- Traitor!

239
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,720
What the devil are they doing here?

240
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Shame on you!

241
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,280
Yeah! String him up!

242
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,040
My Lord Bishop.

243
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,160
It's been a long time
since our paths crossed.

244
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,280
Welcome to Winchester.

245
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,600
Who's this?

246
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,880
Philip, Prior of Kingsbridge, Your Majesty.

247
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
You seem worried.

248
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Why?

249
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,440
I don't have a clean robe to wear.

250
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,760
Well, I like a monk to look like a monk.

251
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,560
I heard about your fire.
How soon will you rebuild?

252
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,160
As soon as I find the money, sire.

253
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,400
I hope you haven't come to beg for it.

254
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,320
We're paupers here.

255
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I think I have found a way to rebuild

256
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,160
without further diminishing your coffers,
Your Majesty.

257
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,840
Give Shiring and all its land
to the diocese of Kingsbridge,

258
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,560
and we will give you a new church.

259
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
What a clever idea.

260
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,760
Unfortunately, I gave Shiring
to Percy Hamleigh

261
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,720
less than an hour ago.

262
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
Well, it's not official.

263
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,560
Well, not yet.

264
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,800
Present a strong argument for your case,
and I might reconsider.

265
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,640
We could rename the church
after a saint of your choosing, Your Majesty.

266
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
St. Stephen, perhaps?

267
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,560
Or St. Elmo,
the patron saint of sailors lost at sea.

268
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,640
Come back tomorrow.
You'll have my answer then.

269
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,800
You're working hard.

270
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,040
I thought you might be thirsty, Tom Builder.

271
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
Thank you.

272
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,400
What are they staring at?

273
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,920
Their turn to be jealous.

274
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,200
You need to send her away.

275
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,520
What's that?

276
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
Remigius says she's a witch.
He sent a letter to the Bishop last night.

277
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,520
Why'd he do that for? It's just gossip.

278
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,240
It's worse than gossip.
It's malicious and it's dangerous!

279
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
He has a witness.

280
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,880
His Majesty will now see Lord Harefield

281
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,360
and the Bishop of Lancaster.

282
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Your Eminence, I'm told
you're seeking an emissary to Rome.

283
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,600
I would be happy to volunteer.

284
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,640
You are too new to the post,
my good Bishop.

285
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,000
Rome demands
a more experienced politician.

286
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Perhaps a visit to my palace
would convince you.

287
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,920
I have worked changes to the diocese.

288
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,920
It's hardly a palace, when I visited years ago.

289
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,960
More like a ruin with a roof.

290
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
Excuse me.

291
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,320
Not a ruin for long.

292
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,600
How could you be so stupid?

293
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,960
Waleran is using you
and your burned down church

294
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,240
to get the earldom for himself.

295
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,120
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

296
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Then why did he tell the King to give Shiring
to the diocese of Kingsbridge

297
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,000
and not the priory?

298
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,680
It was a slip of the tongue.
Besides, he only means...

299
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,800
What it means is that
he will control the purse strings.

300
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
And believe me, monk,

301
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,360
a church is not
where he wants to spend his gold.

302
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,400
He's hired this man
to triple the size of his palace.

303
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,800
Show him.

304
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,200
He'll need Shiring's forests and quarry
to fulfill this design.

305
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,040
Your good Bishop doesn't care a whit
for your precious cathedral.

306
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,440
Thank you, master builder.

307
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,120
William.

308
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,680
Side with us, monk.

309
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,480
We will make a generous contribution
to your building fund.

310
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,840
No.

311
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,800
We go to the King instead
and divide the earldom equally,

312
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,680
with you getting the better half.

313
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,080
What do you mean?

314
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,080
Which is more valuable,
arable land or forest?

315
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,960
- Arable land.
- Then I'll have the forest.

316
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,040
I need the forest to hunt.

317
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,200
You can hunt there, but I want the timber.

318
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,640
And which would you prefer?
The income from the markets or the quarry?

319
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,840
What if I said the quarry?

320
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,040
You won't, though, will you?

321
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
And when Waleran objects?

322
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,840
If he's told the King that he needs Shiring
to finance the cathedral,

323
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,720
how can he object on the grounds that
he wants to build his new castle instead?

324
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,600
You're a keener politician
than I gave you credit for.

325
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,680
Politics is a bargain between beggars,
my lady.

326
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,280
And I have... I have one other request.

327
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,720
I must have protection for the lady Aliena
and her brother Richard.

328
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,920
You've seen them?

329
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,520
They're hiding in the castle,
starving and penniless.

330
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,560
They need to be taken care of.

331
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,320
But of course.

332
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
We'll see to that.

333
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Your Eminence.

334
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,360
<i>Beloved Lord Bishop,
we have a witch among us.</i>

335
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,920
<i>A woman, as you know,
long wanted in these parts.</i>

336
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,360
<i>A witness has come forward.</i>

337
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,080
Why did you say that?

338
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,360
Answer me! Why'd you say that?

339
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
She's been good to me, that woman!
Better than I deserve.

340
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,880
Don't make me choose between you, boy.

341
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,800
Brother Remigius has been claiming
you're a witch.

342
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,000
He's got Alfred here to give proof to the lie.

343
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,960
It's not a lie.

344
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,680
Not entirely.

345
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,120
See that this woman is arrested immediately

346
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,080
and that she speaks to no one.

347
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,640
Jack's father had a secret.

348
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,960
<i>Something to do with the ring he had.</i>

349
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,080
He wouldn't tell me what it was.

350
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,840
<i>He wanted to see the King,
to tell him what he knew.</i>

351
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,440
But I was only a naive novice.

352
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,840
How could I help?

353
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,080
I hid him in a barn on our convent property,

354
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,280
<i>where he asked me for a quill,
paper, sealing wax and ink.</i>

355
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,120
<i>I then went to my priest confessor.</i>

356
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,960
<i>I found him on the beach, Father.</i>

357
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,480
He needs your help, your support.

358
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,240
He has a secret
he will tell no one but the King.

359
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,840
<i>The next day, he was taken from the barn</i>

360
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
<i>and accused of stealing
the Kingsbridge Priory's chalice.</i>

361
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,200
<i>He was tortured, confessed,</i>

362
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,160
and his tongue was cut out.

363
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,680
He was held for nearly three years
before he was brought to trial.

364
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,040
<i>The prior whose chalice was stolen
testified against him.</i>

365
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,400
The Lord of the District served as his judge,
and my priest confessor passed sentence.

366
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Then,

367
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
a remarkable thing happened.

368
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,000
I curse you, all three of you!

369
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,120
- Stay back!
- Touch me and you'll be dead by morning.

370
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,760
Your church, dear Prior,
shall burn to the ground.

371
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Your children, My Lord,
shall die on the gallows.

372
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,760
And you, good Father,
the confessor whom I trusted,

373
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,360
you shall one day climb very high,

374
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,840
only to fall.

375
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,200
...only to fall.

376
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,800
What was the secret
they didn't want him to tell?

377
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
I never learned.

378
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,520
I found his ring,
the one Jack wore, until it was stolen,

379
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,320
but no paper.

380
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,520
So, yes, I'm a wanted woman, Tom.

381
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,440
I'll leave in the morning. No argument.
You're staying here.

382
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
And you are staying with them.

383
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,120
I've made the decision.

384
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,280
My loyal subject, Percy Hamleigh,
today becomes the Earl of Shiring.

385
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,000
He shall have the castle
and all arable lands and low-lying pastures.

386
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,960
All other farmlands, I give to

387
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,200
the Priory of Kingsbridge

388
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,040
for the building of the new cathedral.

389
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,360
- And the quarry?
- Belongs to the Hamleighs.

390
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,280
But you may take what stones you need.

391
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,760
- But... But that's not...
- Enough.

392
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,760
My decision stands.

393
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
You'll pay for this, Philip.
I don't take kindly to priests who steal.

394
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,680
And God doesn't take kindly
to bishops who lie.

395
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,480
I swear by all that's holy,
you'll never build your church.

396
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,480
Open the gates, in the Bishop's name!

397
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,600
I'll show you where the witch is. Follow me.

398
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
No! No!

399
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,280
One, two, three, four,

400
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,440
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

401
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,120
Allie?

402
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm over here!

403
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,240
Allie!

404
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,080
No!

405
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,680
No! No!

406
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,360
No, please! Don't hurt her!

407
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,320
Let me go!

408
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,720
Lie still or the boy dies.

409
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,880
Cut off his ear, Walter!

410
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,960
No!

411
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,440
You see, bitch?

412
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm a better man than you deserve.

413
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,120
Get away from the horse!

414
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,280
Fucking bitch! Come here.

415
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,200
Looks like it's your lucky night.

416
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,560
Look what you've done to me!

417
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,640
Kill him.

418
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
- You fucking bitch!
- Shut him up.

419
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
How?

420
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,240
I don't know how. Just cut off his head.

421
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,440
Kill him before anyone can hear.

422
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,800
Allie, please.

423
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,760
You have to do this, Richard.

424
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,960
Don't!

425
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,160
Where is the woman?

426
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,000
Locked away, Your Eminence.
As you wished.

427
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,840
Good. Prepare for a trial this evening.

428
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,600
But we don't have a witness anymore.

429
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,760
The boy will not testify.

430
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,400
I'll be the witness.

431
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,080
I want this thing ended quickly.

432
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,720
A woman in a monastery
is like a mare in heat.

433
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,880
Even a gelding would misbehave
in her presence.

434
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,880
Monks may be celibate,
but they can still smell cunt.

435
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,640
- Halt, woman!
- You, too, boy.

436
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,480
Richard, listen to me.
You mustn't tell Father what happened.

437
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,480
I'll tell the King then.
He'll have both their heads.

438
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,120
No. You mustn't tell anyone, ever.

439
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,760
Aliena?

440
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,520
Father.

441
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,800
Philip, the Bishop is here.

442
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,320
- And Ellen has been arrested.
- Yes. I received word on the way.

443
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,000
- Where is she?
- In one of the basement cells.

444
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,280
- They won't let anyone see her except...
- Where is Tom?

445
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,520
In his work shed.

446
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,840
Waleran has us building a pyre.

447
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,680
We've come to see the King,
to ask if he will grant mercy.

448
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,440
He will do nothing for me.

449
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,880
Listen,

450
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,160
I hid 50 gold coins in a belt under my shirt.

451
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,440
They're being held for you in safekeeping
by a priest who heard my confession.

452
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,560
We can use it to buy your freedom.

453
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,120
My freedom

454
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,600
is not for sale.

455
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,680
Well, is it true? Is she a witch?

456
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,200
No.

457
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,240
I swear by all that's holy.

458
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,560
She's not the mother of your children,
though, is she?

459
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,640
No.

460
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,720
Are you living in sin?

461
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,240
You can't burn her for that.

462
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,480
If I save her, you must marry her...

463
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,720
- I will.
...and bring her back to the Church.

464
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,160
That's her decision. It's not mine.

465
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,200
It's God's will. It's my condition.

466
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,760
Whatever. Whatever you say.

467
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,000
Beware of the witch, Brother.

468
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,160
I ain't supposed to talk to you.

469
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,920
But Prior Philip told me
to let you hold the baby one last time.

470
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,000
Be careful of his bottom, though.
He's carrying a bit of a load.

471
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,840
This woman here stands accused
of consorting with the Devil.

472
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,040
The Bishop himself
bears witness against her.

473
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,680
Do you want to say anything
before we pass sentence?

474
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,080
- Such witchcraft!
- She's the Devil!

475
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,440
Avert your eyes from the witch.

476
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Piss on you, Lord Bishop!

477
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,520
Don't touch her!
Let the Devil pass out of here.

478
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,200
Your Eminence!

479
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,440
There she is!

480
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,600
Was she a virgin?

481
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,320
Oh, yes.

482
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,960
And did she struggle?

483
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,560
Frightfully.

484
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,280
And you showed her what a fine young man
you are down there, didn't you?

485
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,840
Father,

486
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,680
just as Maud and Gloucester
are raising an army to reclaim the throne,

487
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,520
so too will I claim back what is mine,
what is ours.

488
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,720
I swear by Jesus Christ and all His saints

489
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,960
that I will not rest
until Richard is the Earl of Shiring

490
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,560
and lord of the land that you once ruled.

491
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,600
Do I have your blessing in this?

492
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,800
Always and forever.

493
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,800
I swear,

494
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,000
no matter where your affections fly,

495
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,560
you shall always rule my heart,

496
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,320
sweet William.

497
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,920
We've begun.
