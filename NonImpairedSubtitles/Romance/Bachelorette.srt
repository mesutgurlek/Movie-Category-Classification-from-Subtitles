165
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:13,349
What are you even
doing right now?

166
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:14,342
You're such a competent and

167
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:16,102
calming maid of honor, Regan.

168
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:16,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,693
Easy on the sugar.

170
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:19,175
She still has to fit
in her dress tomorrow.

171
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:20,134
Oh, Chinatown,

172
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,212
I need a limo to JFK.

173
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:23,205
Do you understand that?

174
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,893
And I need um, champagne
sent up to my suite.

175
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,366
Wait,

176
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:28,549
No.

177
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,181
Plans have changed, okay?

178
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:30,852
The bride wants a
bachelorette party now.

179
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:33,572
Oh, okay...Well, why
am I the last to know?

180
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,267
I can't believe you
get paid for this,

181
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,550
and I'm just a good friend.

182
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,460
(Gena)

183
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,262
about blowjobs,

184
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,181
if you want to hear it.

185
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,579
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

186
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,253
Yeah?

187
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:45,253
It's very interesting.

188
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:47,108
All right.

189
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,163
I-I personally think
that blowjobs are

190
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,409
an extremely delicate thing.

191
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,721
You know, like if you're..

192
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:51,841
if you're ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10,

193
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:53,250
1 being I'm blowing it kisses

194
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:56,386
and 10 being I'm, you know,
choking on just semen,

195
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,202
vomit just everywhere.

196
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:03,074
I think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s.

197
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,762
Like just enough so the...
so that you know that

198
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,362
I know exactly what I'm doing,

199
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,123
but with zero enthusiasm.

200
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,073
I'm giving you nothing,

201
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,448
because then you're
gonna be like

202
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,081
all right, fine. I'll
just fuck her, you know?

203
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,001
'Cause if I start off with
a 10, I got nowhere to go.

204
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,921
I mean, why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me?

205
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,136
You just came all over my face.

206
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:19,713
So you start off small, right?

207
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,577
But you build.

208
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,634
I'll give you a 6

209
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,161
after a fight, when
we're making up.

210
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,506
And then an 8

211
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,425
when you spend a
shitload of money on me,

212
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,857
or get me something
that's like a sweet...

213
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,225
gift or whatever,
I'll do full 8.

214
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,465
But then, I circle it back.

215
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,920
Back to the 3s, the 4s, and
the 5s, because that shit,

216
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,266
every time, without fail,

217
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,473
makes the guy's
dick alarm go off.

218
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,682
You know what I mean
when I say dick alarm.

219
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,664
Right?

220
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,007
And you're gonna be like,

221
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:47,650
"Hey, baby.
What's wrong with you?

222
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,897
You're acting funny.

223
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,113
Why so sad?"

224
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:51,999
When really what you're
telling me is, "God dammit,

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,283
just like suck
my dick harder."

226
00:07:55,201 --> 00:08:00,863
So... um... let's just
say um, like, what...

227
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,624
what would merit a 10?

228
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,455
What's an example?

229
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,568
I don't know,
you're like on a...

230
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,015
on an airplane, you're going
to a wedding of this girl

231
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,902
that you went to
high school with.

232
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:12,576
Uh, two more?

233
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,046
(stewardess) Sure.

234
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,959
And your ex-boyfriend uh...
[LAUGH]

235
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:19,711
Your ex-boyfriend who
ruined your fucking life

236
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:20,831
is gonna be there.

237
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,791
That jerk.

238
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,541
All this pent-up
frustration,

239
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,421
sitting next to some dude
you're never gonna see again.

240
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,669
That would warrant a 10.

241
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:35,006
[CLEARS THROAT] Well...
How about this guy?

242
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:38,238
Oh, no. I feel like I'll
definitely see you again.

243
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,414
[GENA LAUGH]

244
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,886
(Gena) Oh, my goodness.

245
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:54,684
Bee!

246
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,645
Look at her!

247
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:56,765
Bee-Face.

248
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:57,980
(Regan) Aw, Bees!

249
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:58,971
(Katie) We're together again!

250
00:08:58,972 --> 00:08:59,327
Everything's okay, you guys.

251
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,309
All right.

252
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,229
How are we gonna get through
the next twelve hours?

253
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,477
Gena brought cocaine!

254
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,054
Oh, my god.

255
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,211
Let's use our indoor voices, about it...
you know...

256
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,203
Here's the deal, though.

257
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,155
We need to do some before
the bachelorette party.

258
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,980
Uh, it's not that
kind of a party.

259
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,452
Hear me out.

260
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,171
We don't want to share our
coke with rando bridesmaids.

261
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,164
It's for us.

262
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,091
It's true.

263
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,052
(Becky)
Bee-yatch-faces!

264
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,187
Ah-hah!

265
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,835
Woo!
[LAUGH]

266
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,843
I'm so excited, I
could buy a gun.

267
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:34,491
You guys are all
here, at my wedding.

268
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,050
Me... Isn't it just crazy?

269
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,513
Did Regan tell you guys
just how excited I am?

270
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,507
Yeah.

271
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:40,541
I see Regan all the time.

272
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sick of her.

273
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,323
Yeah.
Feeling's mutual.

274
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,081
I'm so sick of you.

275
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,332
I'm sick of you, too.

276
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,282
There's my sick, running
down your shoulder.

277
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,106
Yuck!

278
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,188
You are the first
Bee-Face to get married.

279
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,142
Oh.

280
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:57,977
I'm gonna cry.

281
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,569
No, don't cry, 'cause
then I will cry too.

282
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,009
Like when we all watched

283
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,673
Princess Di's funeral
together, you remember that?

284
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,792
Too soon.

285
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,298
That was like fifteen
years ago, pal.

286
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,250
Uh, that was like
four years ago.

287
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,104
It was fifteen
years ago, Katie.

288
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:11,577
It was five years ago.

289
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,187
I think I know
when Lady Diana died.

290
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,513
Did Regan explain to you
about the par-tay tonight?

291
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,817
I was just trying to
tell them that, yes...

292
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,768
Well, okay. It's a little
last-minute,

293
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,153
but... We are having champagne...
(Katie) Ooh!

294
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,591
(Becky)
...and ice cream,

295
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,927
in our suite after
the rehearsal dinner.

296
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,951
(Katie) Great!

297
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,649
And then we're gonna
like, party, right?

298
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,537
Like ah... like woo!

299
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,479
[SNORTS] Like mm... Oh.

300
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,344
I know.

301
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,944
Yeah, boring.

302
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:38,521
(Becky) Right.

303
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:41,367
Old, boring, almost-married
lady right here.

304
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,888
Yeah, it's just that uh,
a lot of the bridesmaids

305
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,135
came from out of town,

306
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,535
so I just had to keep
it really low-key.

307
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,318
And besides, I'm not a
big partier anymore.

308
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,825
Not like some people.

309
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:55,415
These two.

310
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,590
So... all right, well... I
think our car is waiting,

311
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,486
so let's all go.

312
00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,510
Oh. Let's go.

313
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:04,727
Byeee... We're totally gonna
keep it low-key, too.

314
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,005
That's what we
were talking about.

315
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,287
Just keeping
it low-key.

316
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,240
That's the kind
of girls we are.

317
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,415
Let's do some coke.

318
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,502
Yes!

319
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:19,348

320
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:19,349
(Gena) Look at these people,

321
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,934
just desperate,
terrible, all of them.

322
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,300
They want to be like, in
what, legalized slavery?

323
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,517
That's what it is,

324
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,214
it's like a Jane
Austen novel on crack.

325
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,781
That's exactly right.

326
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:30,902
Should we do some more coke?

327
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:31,798
If you do anymore coke,

328
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,452
somebody's dick is
gonna get sucked.

329
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:41,557
Oh...

330
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,125
Here we go.

331
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,043
To you and your
beautiful daughter.

332
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:45,652
Yes, indeed.

333
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,029
(Regan) Victoria,

334
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,274
are you feeling
confident about tomorrow?

335
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,940
Your walk down the aisle
was a little bumpy.

336
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:50,899
Was it bumpy?

337
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:50,965
I don't remember it being bumpy.

338
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:51,924
Are you kidding?
Best man,

339
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:53,650
mother of the bride?

340
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,795
We got this on lockdown,
don't we, Victoria?

341
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,076
He's handsome and funny.

342
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,164
(Victoria)
Are you married, Trevor?

343
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,764
No.

344
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,625
Oh. Yeah. No, no.

345
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:01,585
I'm trying, though.

346
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,642
I'm just, you know...

347
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:03,636
haven't found the
right girl yet.

348
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,946
Hey.

349
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:05,588
You know how Becky
wanted to keep it low-key?

350
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,459
Well... I got a stripper for
the bachelorette party.

351
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,452
Stop your lies.

352
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,011
You don't know any strippers.

353
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,066
I do.

354
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,883
I know a freelance stripper.

355
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:18,358
That sounds amazing.

356
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,866

357
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,699
(Katie) What's going on?

358
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:33,330

359
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:43,287

360
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:50,705
(Katie) I just don't know...
how to do it.

361
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:53,265
Like in a bathtub,
with rope... I just

362
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,129
I gotta go do something.

363
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,184
Okay.

364
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,241
Please don't leave me alone.

365
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,258
Now honey, why can't you
find a nice man like this?

366
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:58,258
Hmm?

367
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:00,144
Oh, come on.

368
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,041
Frank is never
gonna commit to you.

369
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,832
Frank?
Who's Frank?

370
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,823
(Victoria) Her boyfriend.

371
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,943
He's doing his residency.

372
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,063
He'll be here tomorrow.

373
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:06,959
Yeah... Wow.

374
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,887
I bet he's busy a lot.

375
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,102
Tough to commit that way.

376
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:10,065
Let's just say
hi to Aunt Janey, okay?

377
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,759
You don't want to be rude.

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,686
If you get bored,
I'll be right here.

379
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:19,376
(Bartender)
Can I get you anything?

380
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,135
I'm-I'm good, actually.

381
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,325
- Hey. [LAUGH]
- Hey. [LAUGH]

382
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,250
Joe.

383
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,630
Joe... Barnes?

384
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,967
From back in the...
we went to...

385
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:34,797
high school together...
Do you...?

386
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:35,758
Do you have a job?

387
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,909
A job?
Like out- like a...

388
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,604
yeah, I have a job um,
uh, in the world.

389
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,919
computer programming, actually.

390
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,646
Like a Steve Jobs
kind of thing?

391
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:44,365
Uh, hmm, kind- err, no.

392
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,678
Not at all, actually.

393
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,085
I didn't found Apple.

394
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:47,151
You don't remember me, do you?

395
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,380
Ah... The honeymoon
is a total surprise.

396
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,037
I haven't told her yet, but
I'm gonna blow her mind.

397
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,060
Boar hunting?

398
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,055
We're going to central Germany.

399
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,810
It's incredible. We should...
Gena?

400
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:03,310
Hi...

401
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,262
Hi, Clyde.

402
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,717
I haven't seen you since...
...that thing.

403
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:11,565
...since that thing I
grew up next to Becky,

404
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,285
so I was kind of around a lot.

405
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,083
We would hang out
a little bit, and then

406
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,038
into high school, we were
in French class together.

407
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:17,038
Wait.
I took French?

408
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,250
Yes.

409
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,790
You actually used to
copy my homework.

410
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:22,092
But no,
it's-it's good.

411
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,844
I just wanted to say hi, and...
and uh...

412
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,412
say the hellos.

413
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:27,755
I-I sold you pot.

414
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,764
Oh, Joe!

415
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:31,755
That's-that's me.

416
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:32,620
You've got bangs!

417
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,123
Yeah, new bangs.

418
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,531
Do you have some?

419
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:37,389
Remember how I was telling you
about the Bee-Faces,

420
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,635
Becky's friends?

421
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,172
This is Gena Myers,
she's one of them.

422
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:41,258
Oh, hi.

423
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,987
Gena, this is my
sister, Stefanie.

424
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,586
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Myers.

425
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:45,836
Oh, no.
I'm not married.

426
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,970
And um, I'm not an
adult, either, so...

427
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,028
(Dale) Excuse me for a second.

428
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,563
The natives are
getting restless.

429
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:55,658
Oh... You two know each other from...
...high school.

430
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,905
...since I was your age.

431
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,250
All right. I'm gonna go
sit down, but um... Okay.

432
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,178
...will you come
sit next to me?

433
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,771
Uh, well, whatever those
little place-cards say, okay?

434
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,917
Bye...

435
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,435
What?

436
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,481
I didn't say anything.

437
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,977
That is a... dress?

438
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:17,610
No, this is a T-shirt.

439
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:20,169
I'm glad to see you're still
fighting the good fight

440
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,097
against the tyranny of pants.

441
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,216
I also thought maybe

442
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,655
this would help you
get a head-start.

443
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,418
Maybe I'm looking
for a challenge.

444
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,296
Oh... is that why...

445
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:30,696
you're trying to
fuck a small child?

446
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,785
Good one.

447
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:33,064
You know what you should do?

448
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,081
Save the zingers for
the speeches, Genny.

449
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,231
Okay.

450
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,383
Our seventh-grade field trip

451
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,599
to Six Flags is
coming to a close.

452
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,785
We're all piling on
the bus to go home.

453
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,448
Dale lags behind,

454
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,305
'cause he just has
to ride the Freefall

455
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:48,616
at the last minute.

456
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,121
So he's running like
hell to catch up to us,

457
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,783
and he just bites it.

458
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,888
Wipes out completely, spills
what must be two liters

459
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,000
of Dr. Pepper all over his
shorts, [GUEST LAUGHTER]

460
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,087
just epic.

461
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,613
So later, he and I are sitting
in the back of the bus,

462
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:04,647
and I get a whiff of
Dr. Pepper and piss.

463
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,303
And I say, "You know,
it'd be pretty funny

464
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:10,918
if you pissed your
pants riding Freefall,

465
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,616
and then spilled Dr. Pepper
all over yourself

466
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,855
to try, cover it up."

467
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:17,991
And he turns to me, and he
goes, "Yes, it would be.

468
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,718

be kinda genius.

00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:32,707
Joe's never been
to a strip club.

822
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:33,668
(Joe) I have been.

823
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:35,651
Hence why I know
that for a fact,

824
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:37,697
once you get in there.

825
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,721
You never know what
exactly to do.

826
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:39,842
It's weird getting a lap dance

827
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:40,899
in front of other people.

828
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,147
Oh, my god.

829
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:43,106
There's no reason
to get outraged

830
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,034
and use words like "hence."

831
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:44,197
I'm with Joe on this one.

832
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:45,156
Oh. Dale,

833
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,289
I will not let you kill fun
on your own bachelor party.

834
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,508
This is like negative fun.

835
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:50,881
You don't get it.

836
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:52,192
When you meet the right girl,

837
00:27:52,193 --> 00:27:52,995
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

838
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:54,624
You're adorable.

839
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,553
Uh, I beg to differ.

840
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,889
I met the right girl, I did
everything to screw it up.

841
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,777
So why don't you
do something about it?

842
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,995
Like apologize?

843
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:03,234
Well, never got the chance.

844
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:05,857
Oh, I smell a new profile pic.

845
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,777
You know what I want to smell?

846
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:08,196
I want to smell
that burning bush

847
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,489
I want to smell that
fucking red snapper,

848
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,801
what's her name?

849
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:13,376
Is he talking
about Katie again?

850
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:15,425
Katie'd be like shooting
a helpless animal.

851
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,098
Exactly.

852
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,016
Guys... Joe has a decade-long

853
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:19,936
hard-on for the prom
queen, so take it easy.

854
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:20,864
Oh, what about
the maid of honor?

855
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,665
I'll take her down, then.

856
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,417
Mm... It's not a good idea.

857
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:25,376
Why, what do you mean?

858
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:27,553
So you know how there are
like serial killers,

859
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,121
and then there's
Hannibal Lector?

860
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,144
Yeah?

861
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:33,280
There are girls,
and there's Regan.

862
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:35,904
(Gena) Hide it.

863
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,472
Hide it in the bag.

864
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:40,159
After tonight, no more coke.

865
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,632
None.
No more coke.

866
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:42,624
I'm having like one of those

867
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,096
moments of clarity right now.

868
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,151
(Katie) Yeah.

869
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:45,951
(Gena)
You know what I'm saying?

870
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,039
(Katie) Yeah.

871
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,807
Where is this
Melissa chick, Regan?

872
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:48,862
I'm calling her.

873
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:49,983
I've got it
under control, okay?

874
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:51,231
Go back to your
little intervention.

875
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:51,934
(Gena)
It's not an intervention.

876
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:52,767
We're gonna get a dress.

877
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:54,334
A whole new dress!

878
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:55,677
What are you talking about?

879
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:56,575
Why don't we
fix this dreThat's a great idea!

880
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:57,569
Hey, Melissa!

881
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,222
Hi.

882
00:29:00,223 --> 00:29:02,336
Yeah, we're out... we're just
outside the bridal shop.

883
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:03,359
Melissa!

884
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,737
Melissa!

885
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:07,742
Hello.

886
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:08,765
Oh, look. Look.

887
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:09,983
It's the maid of honor from hell

888
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,613
that has landed on my doorstep.

889
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:12,448
No, I'd much rather
be here with you

890
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:14,654
and your skanky friends

891
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,444
than maybe getting
touched by my husband

892
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:17,311
Thanks.
I can't wait.

893
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,294
Chill out.

894
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,567
You're beautiful.

895
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:25,342
Okay. You're being nice,
and it's scaring me. Stop.

896
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:26,495
What do you need?

897
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,413
Well, our lovely bride decided

898
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,981
she didn't want
to wear her dress.

899
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:30,940
I'm sorry.

900
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:32,091
I was just in my brain,

901
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:32,575
and I was just
really hurting you.

902
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:34,908
What did you just say?

903
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,673
(Gena)
Ba-bam!

904
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,597
If I am still working in retail

905
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:44,700
by the time I'm 40,
I will kill myself.

906
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:48,091
I know you guys think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

907
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:51,034
I will take a shotgun,
and I will blow...

908
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:51,836
(Gena)
Woman... chillax.

909
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:51,836
my... head off.

910
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,309
(Gena) Please.

911
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,556
Seriously, you guys.

912
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,643
Okay.

913
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:56,795
All right.

914
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,725
Fun, fun, fun.

915
00:29:57,726 --> 00:29:59,002
(Katie) Oh!

916
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:01,341
This is all I have,

917
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,699
and it's still a
size too small.

918
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,755
Is this pretty?

919
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,650
Or is it ugly?

920
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:07,579
(Katie) It's gorgeous.

921
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,730
It's the dress you wanted

922
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,906
to get married in, ever since
you were a little girl

923
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:11,612
I mean, it would look
so much better on you,

924
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,954
but it's gorgeous!

925
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,012
Everyone wants this cut.

926
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,012
I mean, not in this size,

927
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:15,675
obviously.

928
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:16,347
But this is so popular.

929
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,850
Everybody wants it.

930
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:18,809
(Regan) No.

931
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,034
(Gena)
Okay, we want it. Yeah.

932
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:20,121
(Gen(Regan)
WrapNo. up!

933
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:20,763
(Gena)
Wrap it up. Hang it up.

934
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:20,763
Pigface!

935
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,011
No!

936
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,102
Over my dead body.

937
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,881
Regan!

938
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:26,745
Bee!

939
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,834
What the fuck?

940
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,370
Come on, that was our solution!

941
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,121
This is the problem... Becky
can't wear that dress!

942
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,050
Becky can't wear that dress.

943
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,073
What? Okay,
listen to me.

944
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:35,163
This is clearly like some girl

945
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:36,602
shit that I don't understand,

946
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:38,970
so may I just be very,
very diplomatic

947
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,761
and say let it fucking go?

948
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:41,882
No!

949
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,321
I'm not gonna
watch Becky Archer

950
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:46,041
walk down the aisle
in my dream dress.

951
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,418
I'd rather lick this sidewalk.

952
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:48,472
Great!

953
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,816
Lick the sidewalk,
then, please.

954
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:50,777
I'm gonna lick it, too.

955
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,193
Don't be ridiculous.

956
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:52,154
You don't lick the sidewalk.

957
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,171
You lick the sidewalk,
I'll let it go.

958
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:56,089
A little lick.

959
00:30:56,697 --> 00:30:57,657
Like a cat lick.

960
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,330
Like a cat lick.

961
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:07,864
Ugh.

962
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,495
(Gena) Be encouraging.

963
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:11,097
I'm mentally preparing myself.

964
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,431
(Gena) Just do it fast, please.

965
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:14,425
Like you're ripping
off a Band-Aid

966
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:15,864
(Gena) Like anal sex.

967
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,497
(Katie)
Becky can't wear that dress.

968
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:20,088
A-a biased cut would
look awful on her.

969
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,366
It utilizes the
stretch of the fabric

970
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,609
in a diagonal direction,
accentuating body lines.

971
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,386
It would fit her like a silk
stuffed sausage casing.

972
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,192
Rain man?

973
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,902
How did you know all
that stuff, just now?

974
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:36,346
I spent a semester at F.I.T.

975
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,223
Katie? Katie?

976
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,895
Yes?

977
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,847
Do you know how to sew things?

978
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:42,552
Oh.

979
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,296
Of course I know how to sew.

980
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,917
Oh. Okay.

981
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:50,934
Are you ready to Betsy Ross
the shit out of this dress?

982
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:50,934
Yes.

983
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:52,342
Good.

984
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:52,982
This tastes like gasoline.

985
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,198
Good.

986

the smell of gasoline.

We should get some magic
markers while we're here!

Oh, wait.

that guy a bone.

laid in high school?

What are you doing?

out of the garbage bag?

Uh, it's a wedding dress.

I think maybe it's white.

00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,106
Listen, if I'm not
out in five minutes,

1146
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:55,048
you should probably
claim the body.

1147
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:55,946
I'm serious.

1148
00:35:55,947 --> 00:36:05,385

1149
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:06,217
Hey, can I have some money?

1150
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:07,336
No.

1151
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,231
We're waiting
for Gena and Clyde,

1152
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,184
and then we're leaving
Pull this dress up,

1153
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:11,271
you don't work here!

1154
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,391
Can I have some money, please?

1155
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:13,514
Yeah, definitely.

1156
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:14,888
Thank you.

1157
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,230
They're just all
such beautiful dancers,

1158
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:16,298
I can't pick who
to give money to.

1159
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:18,632
That's so sweet.

1160
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:19,943
I always ask them
their stories, too.

1161
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,609
'Cause you never know
like where they... Oh.

1162
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,432
She's gonna be so happy.

1163
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,742
Her son's gonna
have the gift of sight!

1164
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:25,990
Why don't you ask her
to smoke pot with you?

1165
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:26,857
Why is that
actually a good idea?

1166
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,159
Is that cool to do?

1167
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,309
Please. I need a
break from "that".

1168
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,429
We're not calling her "that".

1169
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,519
We're trying
not to call her "that".

1170
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,901
I called her "that" earlier.

1171
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,949
(Joe)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1172
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,023
Your security guy's- the security's...
Thank you.

1173
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:45,062
That was amazing, but
I'm a little bored now.

1174
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:47,078
Hey, is there
anything you can do

1175
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,998
to help Joe score with Katie?

1176
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,766
No.

1177
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,175
Why?

1178
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,390
I'm a completely
powerless figurehead.

1179
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:54,278
I'm like Truman at Geneva.

1180
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,293
You mean Truman at Potsdam?

1181
00:36:56,294 --> 00:37:01,158
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

1182
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:04,038
Truman inherited the presidency
because Roosevelt died.

1183
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,574
Poor fuck got sworn in,

1184
00:37:05,575 --> 00:37:07,973
flown to Potsdam to deal
with Stalin and Churchill,

1185
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,086
figure out what the fuck to do
with post-war Germany

1186
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,588
and all of Europe.

1187
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,637
Geneva conference is
completely different thing.

1188
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:16,293
So I think you meant
Truman at Potsdam.

1189
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:20,133
Oh. I switched it, 'cause
I'm a little drunk.

1190
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:21,219
It wouldn't have
made sense anyway,

1191
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,325
because Truman had the trump
card, he had the Bomb.

1192
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,018
So really, he was in
control the whole time.

1193
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:34,788
Oh, do you believe in magic?

1194
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,997
Yes, I do.
That's... abso- yes.

1195
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,564
Do you believe in
a magic vagina?

1196
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:38,789
A magic vagina?

1197
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,221
It would bewitch
you with its magic.

1198
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:43,331
I've been bewitched
by vaginas before.

1199
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:45,572
It's scary, actually.

1200
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,139
I think I might be stupid.

1201
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,516
Why would you say
that about yourself?

1202
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,020
I don't understand anything

1203
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:52,066
anyone is talking about,
most of the time.

1204
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:52,198
That has nothing
to do with intelligence.

1205
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:54,755
It's like this...

1206
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:56,163
there's lots of different
kinds of smart,

1207
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:57,508
you know, and you just

1208
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,419
have to discover
which smart you are.

1209
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,724
See, I-I don't understand
what you just said.

1210
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:04,418
That's okay, neither do I.

1211
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:07,139
Be honest, would you
marry a stripper?

1212
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,450
Um... Shh... shh...
shh... shh...

1213
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,019
There's no touching allowed.

1214
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,106
Okay.

1215
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,706
Did you know that?

1216
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:20,131
I... did- hadn't really...
We're not allowed to touch.

1217
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,506
Okay. Well, I'm not...

1218
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,755
I mean, my hands
are down. I'm not...

1219
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:25,377
Mm-mm... But if you
wanted to, you could.

1220
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:28,481
I'm confused. It's not
allowed, but I can?

1221
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:31,073
If you wanted to
touch me, you could.

1222
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:32,704
I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay.

1223
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:33,537
Okay.

1224
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,595
Just... all right.

1225
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:38,082
Mm-hmm.
That's $200.

1226
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,041
That's $200?

1227
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:39,969
Mm-hmm.

1228
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:42,176
That's $200?

1229
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:44,607
Two-zero-zero.

1230
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,914
Okay. Well, I-I mean, I
feel like that's a...

1231
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:51,429
that's a-a pretty good...
deal...

1232
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,483
Oh, Genny.

1233
00:38:58,401 --> 00:38:59,208
(Stripper) These guys suck.

1234
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,606
Hand full of splooge.

1235
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,727
Been there.

1236
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:10,974
Is it your first night?

1237
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,983
No... but pretty rad

1238
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,481
that you think I'm
hot enough to work here.

1239
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,336
You okay?

1240
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,614
No. Because...

1241
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:22,175
my stupid ex-boyfriend's
in the back right now,

1242
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,190
getting humped by some skank.

1243
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,120
No offense.

1244
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,079
We are skanks.

1245
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,208
It's so dumb.

1246
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:28,317
Like honestly,

1247
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:29,950
I don't even know why I'm
freaking out about it.

1248
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,548
I should be fixing the dress,
not obsessing over him,

1249
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,789
Look, the only reason why Romeo
is back there is because

1250
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,391
he knows he's not
getting laid tonight.

1251
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,509
It's true.

1252
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,696
Yeah. I mean, if he thought
he had a chance with you,

1253
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:39,839
he would be all over your ass,

1254
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,198
like a fat kid eating cake.

1255
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,286
Thanks.

1256
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:45,342
Yeah. Men are all
sorts of fucked.

1257
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:47,101
They feel insecure
for one second

1258
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:48,766
and they need
to go feel powerful

1259
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:49,852
for a couple of hours.

1260
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:50,973
Women feel shitty
about themselves

1261
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,667
and they just go
cry in the bathroom.

1262
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,312
Yeah.

1263
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,917
Or they stab each
other in the back.

1264
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,038
Yeah, I guess
there's that, too.

1265
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,477
Yeah.

1266
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:01,725
Oh, that's good.

1267
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,731
Yeah.

1268
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:05,820
I should like,
do this more often,

1269
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,645
come to these
bathrooms, you know.

1270
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,964
So much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist.

1271
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:12,891
Yeah!

1272
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,077
All right!

1273
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,262
That's great. Thank you.

1274
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,845
Regan!

1275
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:21,851
(Trevor) Whoa, we're still having...
What is that?

1276
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:21,852
I need to talk
to her for a second.

1277
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,930
Where's Katie?

1278
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,243
I don't know. This place
is like a fucking maze.

1279
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:25,947
Okay. Well, we gotta
get out of here

1280
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:26,845
if we're ever gonna...
We need to find Clyde...

1281
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,338
No to get the sewing machine.

1282
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,299
No, it's a change of plans.

1283
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,364
Do you think they'd
let me work here,

1284
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,123
if I take my clothes off?

1285
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,913
Oh, my god. You
let her smoke pot?

1286
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,098
I can't control her.

1287
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,123
You can't control her.

1288
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,594
That's hilarious.

1289
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:42,235
Why are you talking about
me like I'm not here?

1290
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:43,611
I'm calling Becky,

1291
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:44,697
and I'm telling her
about the dress,

1292
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:45,881
'cause I can't
handle this anymore.

1293
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:47,065
Hah! So you can be
the big fucking hero?

1294
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,377
No! I'm the only
one doing anything!

1295
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,498
You don't handle shit!

1296
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:50,555
I handle shit.

1297
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,283
(Katie) ...and I handle shit...
What's the plan, Gena?

1298
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,530
It doesn't matter!

1299
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:55,032
I'm just telling her
about the fucking dress.

1300
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:55,640
What happens when all the
fucking responsibility

1301
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:56,506
comes down on you?

1302
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:56,506
You're gonna call me...

1303
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:57,945
No.

1304
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:58,617
Yeah, you are.

1305
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:00,825
You're gonna call me, and
I'll fucking handle it

1306
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:01,976
Just like I handled
your abortion,

1307
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:03,198
because I had to
fucking drive you.

1308
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:12,697
(Katie) You guys had an
abortion without me?

1309
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:12,698
Okay.

1310
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,818
I'm sorry.

1311
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:13,818
No.

1312
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:15,833
Gena, stop.

1313
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,273
What is that shit?

1314
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,683
I-I didn't even get to come?

1315
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:20,951
Clyde, I need you to help me.

1316
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:21,626
Security!

1317
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:23,000
Clyde! Come on.

1318
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:25,305
No, he can't leave.
He owes me $200.

1319
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:26,361
See this?

1320
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,640
It's worth a lot
of money, okay?

1321
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:29,080
So don't blow it
all in one place.

1322
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,560
See you later.

1323
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,520
Whatever.

1324
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:37,624
(Regan) Wait, Gena!

1325
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,935
Fuck you!

1326
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:40,535
(Trevor)
You're a bad-ass.

1327
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:41,560
Wait! No, no, no, no.

1328
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:42,999
Oh, no.

1329
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,142
We're not getting on
the floor tonight. Nope.

1330
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:47,030
We're going... Do I
still look okay?

1331
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:48,153
We're going home now, okay?

1332
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:49,751
She really goes
from 60 to zero.

1333
00:41:49,752 --> 00:41:50,743
No, you're not going home.

1334
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:52,215
You said you needed a break.

1335
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:53,175
(Regan) That was before.

1336
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:53,077
(Trevor) You're not going home.

1337
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,232
Joe, take Katie home.

1338
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:55,734
Whoa. Who is Joe?

1339
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:56,437
He's right behind you.

1340
00:41:56,438 --> 00:41:56,981
I'm Joe.

1341
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,102
(Trevor) Hello.

1342
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:58,998
Here's what's happening.

1343
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,821
You're staying with
me, call your friend,

1344
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,934
as soon as she picks up
I'll take you right to her.

1345
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:03,861
The most efficient
way of handling it.

1346
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:05,750
Wait, wait, wait. Um... Sorry.

1347
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,429
Think I'm gonna be sick...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1348
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,295
(Trevor) She's good!

1349
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:10,295
I'm good.

1350
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:12,437
(Joe) Okay.

1351
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,454
(Trevor)
Aw... Young love.

1352
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:15,255
(Katie)
All right. Okay.

1353
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,277
(Joe) Okay.

1354
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:17,621
(Regan) You wanna throw up?

1355
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,197
Here, let me take
you to throw up.

1356
00:42:18,198 --> 00:42:19,092
Uh-uh, I'm good.

1357
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:19,893
No, come on. Let's go.

1358
00:42:19,894 --> 00:42:21,141
Joe, come here.

1359
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:22,452
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1360
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:23,028
I'm trying to get
you alone with her.

1361
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:23,863
She's GTG, man.

1362
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:25,396
What's GTG again?

1363
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:26,196
Good to go!

1364
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:27,189
She's good to go!

1365
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,853
Take her home and slip it in.

1366
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,133
I'm not gonna slip it in.

1367
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:31,413
She is wasted,
that'd be like rape.

1368
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:32,916
(Joe) Slipping it in to a girl

1369
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,132
that's about to pass out...?

1370
00:42:34,132 --> 00:42:35,414
I'm telling you, take these.

1371
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:37,076
That'll help.

1372
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:38,133
What are these?
Are these...

1373
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:39,989
dude, are these
date rape drugs?

1374
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,854
They're fucking Xanax,
dude, for you.

1375
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:41,814
You're fucking paranoid.

1376
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:43,766
You smoked too much.

1377
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,396
Would you relax?

1378
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:45,845
What am I doing?

1379
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,027
[SLAP]

1380
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,436
[SLAP]

1381
00:42:48,437 --> 00:42:49,333
[SLAP]

1382
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,226
All right.

1383
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:50,933
I like to see you man up.

1384
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:53,461
Now, do you want Regan,
or do you want Katie?

1385
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,381
You can take her.

1386
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:57,330
Katie's hotter.

1387
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:58,133
Yeah. Good call.

1388
00:42:59,092 --> 00:42:59,092
Look, she's throwing
up right now,

1389
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:00,916
that's not so hot.

1390
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,868
What is wrong with you?

1391
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:03,412
I don't know.

1392
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,043

1393
00:43:05,044 --> 00:43:06,004
(Regan) Hey.

1394
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:06,005
(Regan) Thank you, Joe.

1395
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,572
All good?

1396
00:43:07,573 --> 00:43:09,491
All right.
Yeah. Yeah.

1397
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,450
(Trevor)
so Joe's going with Katie...

1398
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,002
(Regan) You're going with Joe.

1399
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:10,802
Great. Yeah.

1400
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:12,851
We're GTG, we're good to go.

1401
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,098
(Trevor)
Okay. Perfect

1402
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:16,467
GTG?

1403
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,425
Yeah, GTG what?

1404
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:18,354
Why you stealin' my shit?

1405
00:43:18,354 --> 00:43:19,347
I didn't hear you say that.

1406
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,658
(Trevor) That's my line.

1407
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,997
This is the best night
of my life, you guys!

1408
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:26,834
How can you not
have a Metro card?

1409
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:29,266
Uh, because I live
in Los Angeles?

1410
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:32,113
Yeah, but you've been
here for like a day.

1411
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,608
Thank you, Gena, for
helping me get out of

1412
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,818
that sticky situation
with that wasted stripper

1413
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:38,449
that I could not pay for.

1414
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,471
Oh, you're so welcome, Clyde.

1415
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:40,623
Are you kidding?

1416
00:43:40,624 --> 00:43:41,682
I could have paid
for the stripper,

1417
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:44,084
if you hadn't taken my wallet.

1418
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:47,027
How long are you gonna

1419
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,136
pretend to be mad at me, Gena?

1420
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,288
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

1421
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:51,218
Listen to me.

1422
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:53,681
I've got like mere hours

1423
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,984
to get this dress
fixed and cleaned,

1424
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,874
and make sure nothing
else happens to it,

1425
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,879
so I am so sorry, Clyde,
that your feelings are

1426
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,873
not at the top of my list

1427
00:44:01,874 --> 00:44:03,727
of things to give a shit about.

1428
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:05,777
Wow, so you're
actually mad at me.

1429
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,637
That's interesting.

1430
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:15,216
You know what You got
pregnant a long time

1431
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,943
- years ago.

1432
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:18,702
And I felt bad
about it ever since.

1433
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:19,633
And you know,
there's this thing,

1434
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:23,343
it's called life, and we
have to get on with it.

1435
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:24,814
We got pregnant.

1436
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,223
I took care of it.

1437
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:27,408
You made mix tapes about it.

1438
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:29,519
I-I was 18.

1439
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,767
I was 15.

1440
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,461
You were 16, and
we were in love.

1441
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,591
Remember Fast Times?

1442
00:44:40,592 --> 00:44:41,327
Fast Times?

1443
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:42,637
You remember that movie?

1444
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,790
Do you remember
who the bad guy was?

1445
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,070
It was Damone.

1446
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:49,293
The asshole didn't show
up for the appointment.

1447
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:49,935
That's you, mother fucker.

1448
00:44:49,936 --> 00:44:52,589
I am not I am not Damone!

1449
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,615
I'm not Damone!

1450
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:56,430
I can't believe you cannot
see that you are Damone.

1451
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:58,066
Don't call me ...dude, don't
call me fucking Damone...

1452
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,124
What do you want me
to do about it now?

1453
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,980
I just want you to
help me fix the dress.

1454
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:05,166
I don't want to
have this conversation.

1455
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,122
I just want to fix the dress.

1456
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,148
And chemo when you're 12 sucks.

1457
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:15,790
Yeah, it's gotta suck.

1458
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,413
I mean, 12 sucks in general,

1459
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:21,868
especially when you're a
girl That's when it happens.

1460
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:23,980
When what, when what happens?

1461
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:26,060
You start hating yourself.

1462

00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:23,259
I mean, I wanted
to see the stripper

1626
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,730
go the full thing.

1627
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:25,722
Yeah.

1628
00:51:25,723 --> 00:51:30,200
It would've been great to
see one more dick before,

1629
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:35,577
before I see Dale's for the
rest of my life, but...

1630
00:51:35,578 --> 00:51:36,792
you've just done so much work

1631
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,810
for this wedding, just
put your own shit

1632
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:42,009
aside in order
to do everything.

1633
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,568
So..

1634
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,108
thank you.

1635
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:50,907
I have to pee.

1636
00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:56,823
Oh, '94 talent show.

1637
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:59,608
Your leotards are phenomenal.

1638
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:00,377
I won that shit
every single year,

1639
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:01,911
right?

1640
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:03,224
Yeah, but '94 was special.

1641
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:04,663
That was the year
you got a bra.

1642
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,519
Which you stole.

1643
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,215
I could find it if
I looked for it.

1644
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:10,457
Please do not do that.

1645

You know what was
great about us?

1646
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,273
What?

1647
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:19,803
We were friends.

1648
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,784
Everyone else, they
had so much ...drama.

1649
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,833

1650
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:29,751
We were friends.

1651
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:31,286
Yeah.

1652
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:32,054
Yeah.

1653
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,477
What happened?

1654
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:40,021
I mean, I kinda needed you
to drive me that day.

1655
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:45,047
I needed you to go with me
and you didn't show up.

1656
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:47,349
I couldn't.

1657
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,828
Why couldn't you?

1658
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:56,257
I was too sad.

1659
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:09,012
This is awesome.

1660
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:12,595
Did I puke on you?

1661
00:53:12,596 --> 00:53:13,940
No. Well, yeah.

1662
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:14,899
Not directly.

1663
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,819
You puked on Regan, though.

1664
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,218
Okay, once, I was so stoned,

1665
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:19,573
I thought I was in an episode

1666
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:21,907
of 90210

1667
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:24,211
and I kept yelling, "Dylan!"

1668
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:25,780
That's fucking awesome.

1669
00:53:25,781 --> 00:53:27,922
I got so fucked up
once off 'shrooms

1670
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:29,907
that I started a
fight club with my cats.

1671
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:31,123
Okay, okay.

1672
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,803
I once got so wrecked
that I woke up naked

1673
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:37,362
next to a hamburger
and I was like,

1674
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:38,708
did I just have
sex with a hamburger?

1675
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:41,297
Good for that hamburger.

1676
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:44,529
Okay, once I slit my wrist
with a broken bottle.

1677
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:44,530
Holy shit.

1678
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:46,257
Yeah.

1679
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:47,024
When did that happen?

1680
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:47,990
Like a year ago.

1681
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:53,651
I sh-shouldn't
have told you that.

1682
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:54,641
No, no.

1683
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:55,155
You can say stuff like that.

1684
00:53:55,155 --> 00:53:57,519
No, no, I, it was an accident.

1685
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,538
I, really, I party too hard.

1686
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:01,456
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

1687
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:11,281
I'm sorry, that, I, I
shouldn't have done that.

1688
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:12,339
No.

1689
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:14,768
So, Genny, I think it's time

1690
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:16,079
we have a serious conversation.

1691
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,044

How many things

1694
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:25,681
do you need to show
me in your closet?

1695
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:27,568
This is getting
a little strange.

1696
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,231
Oh, wait a second.

What is that?

1699
00:54:36,016 --> 00:54:37,433
You are going to find out.

Don't call me that Genny

1715

Don't.

01:15:10,609 --> 01:15:11,792
How, how are you
feeling...I mean,

2275
01:15:11,793 --> 01:15:13,742
you drank quite a bit.

2276
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,536
I really like you a lot.

2277
01:15:15,537 --> 01:15:17,968
Well, I like you too.

2278
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:19,280
But I don't know what to do

2279
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,912
when I'm around
somebody I like,

2280
01:15:20,913 --> 01:15:25,198
except for sleep with
them or get really drunk.

2281
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,662
I-I mean, you can
just be nice to them.

2282
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:29,232
I'll be nice to you,
you be nice to me.

2283
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,191
Really?

2284
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,694
that's what people do, yeah.

2285
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,389
Thank you for letting
me copy your homework.

2286
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:33,520
You're welcome.

2287
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:36,367
Thank you for,
for not dying today.

2288
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:37,519
Mm.

2289
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,415
It's kinda blowing my mind.

2290
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,678
I feel like, like for
the last decade,

2291
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,558
I've been at like, at a concert.
Right? Just kinda...

2292
01:15:44,559 --> 01:15:46,414
Oh please take your
self- actualization

2293
01:15:46,415 --> 01:15:47,821
somewhere else.

2294
01:15:47,822 --> 01:15:49,069
I'm trying to sleep.

2295
01:15:49,869 --> 01:15:51,605
Oh, hey, you guys.

2296
01:15:58,318 --> 01:15:58,892
Hello.

2297
01:15:58,893 --> 01:15:59,918
Is this working?

2298
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:02,124
Uh, testing, testing, testing.

2299
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,461
Sibilance, sibilance.

2300
01:16:04,462 --> 01:16:06,285
Tom Hanks,SNL.

2301
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:09,325
Um, uh, Becky and Dale.

2302
01:16:09,325 --> 01:16:12,332
Such a beautiful wedding.

2303
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:17,515
Yeah. A gorgeous wedding.

2304
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:18,893
I think we all felt
like stars tonight

2305
01:16:18,894 --> 01:16:22,987
in the sky of your love Yeah!

2306
01:16:22,988 --> 01:16:25,771
So, Dale, you said something
to me last night.

2307
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:27,627
You said that when you
find the right girl...

2308
01:16:27,628 --> 01:16:29,004
Did you go out last night?

2309
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:32,491
When you, when
you got it uh, good,

2310
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:36,044
you don't do anything
to screw it up.

2311
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:41,162
But for some people, um,
and I'm one of them,

2312
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,923
I think you have to screw it up

2313
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:46,474
uh, before you realize
that you've got it good.

2314
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:49,162
I-I I'm just excited
because Gena and I,

2315
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:50,539
we had sex last night.

2316
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,627
What the fuck?

2317
01:16:51,628 --> 01:16:53,065
We did, but like
who cares, right?

2318
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:53,675
I-I can say that.

2319
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,210
Can I say that?

2320
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:59,754
But the thing is, is when
we're having sex, it's fine,

2321
01:16:59,755 --> 01:17:05,962
I put my penis uh, into um,
Gena's vagina... Please.

2322
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:07,850
And then I took it out.

2323
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:10,825
And then I, I put it in again.

2324
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,072
And then I took it out.

2325
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:15,497
And then it just kinda went
on like that for a while.

2326
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,682
And I, what I realized

2327
01:17:16,683 --> 01:17:19,177
was I wanted to
just keep doing that

2328
01:17:19,178 --> 01:17:22,089
for the rest of my life.

2329
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:26,121
That's kinda where
I am at right now.

2330
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:27,530
Uh, but that's not the only
reason I'm up here.

2331
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:33,544
I'm also um, here to,
