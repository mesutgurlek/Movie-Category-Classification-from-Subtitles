1
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:36,556
My oracle ... what vision did you dream?

2
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:40,467
Titans ...

3
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:43,343
Titans ... unleashed

4
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,400
By whom?

5
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,299
King Hyperion

6
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:57,101
He seeks the Epirus to rule over mankind.

7
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,196
We must pray.

8
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:34,499
Hyperion is here.

9
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:36,800
He comes for me.

10
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,976
We must go now.

11
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:23,149
My oracle.

12
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,324
You were presented with vision.

13
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,742
What have you seen?

14
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:32,392
The slave by the water

15
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,475
He is touched by the Gods

16
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,498
If he embraces Hyperion

17
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:44,970
all of Greece will be destroyed.

18
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:49,307
Summon the guards.
