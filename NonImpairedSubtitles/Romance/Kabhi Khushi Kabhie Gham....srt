1
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,696
Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...

2
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,034
how much he loves him?

3
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:08,369
He's never able to embrace him
and say`l love you my son'?

4
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,137
And the mother?

5
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:14,784
She keeps repeating it' whether
her son listens to it or not.

6
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,287
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

7
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,054
No one can fathom the amount oflove
that a mother has for her son...

8
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,827
not even the mother.

9
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,064
Because there is no measure
for a mother's love.

10
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,060
lt's an emotion
that can only be felt...

11
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,059
a mother's emotion.

12
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,066
Rahul' my son... my life!

13
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,538
The match between Woodstock
lnternational and Manor House...

14
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,504
is at a very interesting turn.
5 runs and one ball...

15
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,539
Can Woodstock lnternational's 9-year
victory spell be broken in just a ball?

16
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,947
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...

17
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,443
...and the two batsmen
take their positions.

18
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,580
The excitement among the students
is rising.

19
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,386
The tension is mounting.

20
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,556
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball... Will Rohan do it?

21
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,797
lt's up to Rohan to break.

22
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,727
Woodstock lnternational's nine-year
spell ofvictory... Seems impossible.

23
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,798
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.

24
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,869
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

25
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,628
lfyou want to be someone in life'
ifyou want to achieve something...

26
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,632
ifyou want to win'
always listen to your heart.

27
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,774
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers'

28
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,045
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

29
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,714
And then you will cross
all the hurdles...

30
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,448
all your problems will vanish...
victory will be yours.

31
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,519
Only yours.

32
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,423
Hey' Mom and Dad...
l won l won...

33
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,717
l was the Man ofthe match...
Hey Dad'...

34
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,063
l watched you on CNN.
You looked great.

35
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,659
Now l know where l get
my good looks from.

36
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,733
Anyway' l have just completed
my final term and...

37
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:08,504
l'm coming home for Diwali.
Can't wait to see you guys.

38
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,396
Lots of Love' Rohan.

39
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,009
P.s.' P.s... Before l come home
my two favourite girlfriends.

40
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,355
Hardwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Hardwar?

41
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,020
My two grandmothers...
maternal and paternal!

42
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,215
... 8 a.m.

43
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,997
Are you watching the photograph and
crying again?

44
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,996
Where am l crying?

45
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,995
Of course not...
Where are you crying?

46
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,133
That's one truth and the other one is
that you are very young...

47
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,668
Stop joking with me
early in the morning...

48
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,805
What's the matter' Lajoji?

49
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,004
l remember Rahul
very often these days.

50
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,811
Even l remember him.

51
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,409
But in the last few days...

52
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,415
l have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

53
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,814
But why?

54
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,750
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.

55
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,618
Speak for yourself... l have
a long life ahead... Touchwood!

56
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes...
But l have to reach God's abode...

57
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,325
How will l face Him there?

58
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,833
How will l explain the reason' why
l couldn't unite my scattered family?

59
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,033
That l couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

60
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,704
How will l show my face to Him?

61
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,208
Don't worry about it.

62
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,605
You are not going to meet God anyway...
- Why?

63
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,780
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...

64
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,516
God... again your jokes
early in the morning...

65
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:07,985
Hey you sweethearts...

66
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,485
Rohan!

67
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,089
Naani.
- My child.

68
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,991
What's the matter' Naani?
You look very sexy.

69
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,997
l know. Everyone says the same thing.

70
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,738
May you live long.

71
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,675
You have become very weak my son.

72
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,549
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

73
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,418
Oh! Just Shut up now.

74
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,821
What's the matter' Naani?
- What happened? ls she crying?

75
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,123
Then it's fine. l get very worried
when she doesn't weep.

76
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,365
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop it you two...

77
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,368
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.

78
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,716
Your tears will raise a lot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...

79
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,052
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

80
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,055
What do l do Kaur?
What do l do?

81
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:17,056
Whenever l see Rohan'
l think of Rahul even more

82
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,793
Don't you think we should
tell him everything?

83
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,067
How can we tell him' Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

84
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,897
Rohan was not even in town
when Rahul left home...

85
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,066
He doesn't know anything.

86
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,476
l think we should
tell him everything.

87
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,341
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

88
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:41,073
He doesn't even know that Rahul was
not born to Yash and Nandini.

89
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,484
He was adopted.

90
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:03,300
Rahul was two days old when
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

91
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,167
His tiny footsteps made a place
in all our hearts.

92
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:30,727
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.

93
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,371
Nine years later'
when you were born...

94
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:40,070
we felt that
our family was now complete.

95
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,742
l still remember
the astrologer saying that...

96
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,618
you fought destiny to be born.

97
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,089
You would be our strength.

98
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,622
Did Rahul bhaiyya know
that he was...?

99
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,696
Rahul was eight years old
when he got to know.

100
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,059
That was when Yash decided that...

101
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,731
the matter would never be mentioned
again in the house...

102
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,060
Never again...

103
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,507
Rahul was our son.
The eldest son ofthe house.

104
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,070
lt was a truth that could
never be changed.

105
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,076
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.

106
00:12:55,118 --> 00:13:02,820
And that was Rahul's last Diwali with
his family... Last Diwali.

107
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,212
Oh Allah! Rohan baba'
you have become so fat...

108
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,851
that nothing fits you anymore.

109
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,619
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

110
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:45,866
''lt's all your blessings''

111
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,639
whether smiles or tears''

112
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:01,482
''We shall never part'
through smiles or through tears.''

113
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:51,057
''l feel you in every breath
ofmine...''

114
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:56,062
''my life is but under your shadow''

115
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,802
''l feel you in every breath
ofmine...''

116
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:07,008
''my life is but under your shadow''

117
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:12,344
''l pray to thee as long as l live''

118
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:17,823
''lt's all your boons...
Whether smiles or tears''

119
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:24,027
''We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears''

120
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:10,163
''We light the lamps oflove
at your feet''

121
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,807
''We see you everywhere
in everything we see''

122
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:49,907
''Our lips chant no name but yours''

123
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:54,715
''Let our hearts be filled
with nothing but your love''

124
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,186
''lt's all your boons...
whether smiles or tears''

125
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,989
We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears''

126
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,435
Hey maa... How do you always sense
my presence much before l arrive?

127
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,607
Rahul... just tell me one thing...
Emails' letters' faxes...

128
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,082
l sent you all ofthese and you
didn't reply to any... very rude.

129
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,352
MBA is a tough job' Naina!

130
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,719
Was it only MBA that kept you busy?
Or was there something else?

131
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,885
l mean someone else.

132
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,092
Well... lt was more than just
one... you know me...

133
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,901
Ha... You stud you.
- Ya... me stud me.

134
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,634
Tell me Rahul.
- What do you think?

135
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,204
l think...
- What do you think?

136
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,711
l think' Rahul...
- What do you think' Naina?

137
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:12,570
Rahul' l don't think anyone other than
me can waste her time with you.

138
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,917
ln any case what do you know
what to do with a girl.

139
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,047
Oh really?
ls this done with a girl?

140
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,055
Stop it Rahul...
- Tell me...

141
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,621
Did you remember me at all?

142
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:27,562
Should l tell you the truth or lie?
- Lie...

143
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:32,127
lfl have to lie then l'd say l did...
not remember you at all...

144
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,229
How sweet!
- Let's talk about you.

145
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,068
Are you still the same or is
some mad guy interested in you?

146
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:41,838
What do you think?
- l think...

147
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:43,738
What do you think' Rahul?

148
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,081
l think...
- What do you think' Rahul?

149
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:52,417
l think' Naina...
l will beat you to that door.

150
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,091
Really?
- Really.

151
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,857
Don't bet on that.

152
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,838
Yes.... yes....
Don't you have to go to school?

153
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:17,375
Thank you... C'mon'
eat this... What's the score?

154
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:20,847
104 for 6... isn't that great?
- Damn good yaar. How many overs?

155
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,317
God' bhaiyya...l think
lndia is going to kill England.

156
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,819
Anything can happen
at the last minute.

157
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,060
You can't bank on them too much.
You never know with lndia' Rohan.

158
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,792
Here... take this...
Out Out...Whats the big deal?

159
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,531
England was out oflndia in 1947.

160
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,063
DJ... that was a PJ...

161
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,833
Oh Allah...
What are these? Legs or...?

162
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,870
He still hasn't learnt
how to tie his shoe laces?

163
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,508
So what? He's a child yet...
He'll learn...

164
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,805
But ifyou don't allow him to do it
himself' how will he learn? Fatty.

165
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,677
Why did you come back from London?

166
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,875
What's happening here?

167
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,882
Mom you have over fed Rohan and
turned him into a pumpkin.

168
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,885
Yes' yes please laugh at me...
When l go away to...

169
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:05,093
the boarding school you will all
remember me. Nobody loves me.

170
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,825
By the way Fatty...
Mother loves me more than you.

171
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,733
- DJ... Just look at him.
- Calm down. He's jealous ofyou.

172
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,766
Mom' l missed you.
- l missed you too' baby.

173
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:19,803
You won't leave me again
and go' will you?

174
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,045
l won't' but promise me' you will not
feed me the way you' this pumpkin.

175
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,050
Nandini! Nandini!

176
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,216
Yes... Coming.

177
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,488
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

178
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,857
Who will knot this tie?
- Can't you do even that without me?

179
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:53,064
Here... Now you truly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

180
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,037
This's for you my son.

181
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,039
From today' the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

182
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,957
Oops' Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

183
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:13,010
You know Rahul'
Thirty years ago he said...

184
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:17,748
certain things to me in this chamber'
which l will now repeat to you.

185
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,532
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.

186
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,029
You must always choose
the one that is right...

187
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,602
the one where you don't have to
bend... where you don't fall.

188
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,775
Never take a step in life...

189
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,443
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.

190
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:44,043
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup oftea.

191
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,059
l have not forgotten
his words till today.

192
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,361
Even you should not.

193
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,003
Promise me that you will follow
the traditions ofthe family.

194
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,008
Promise me that you'll never compromise
with the self-respect of our family.

195
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:18,877
l promise papa...

196
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,256
that l will always keep
the family name flying high.

197
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,029
l promise you that l will always
keep you happy... always Papa

198
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,036
We have won.

199
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,413
Pooja' Pooja
- What happened?

200
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,544
We have won the match.

201
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,046
God' Sachin played so well...
100 runs not out.

202
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,058
Ok now listen' take care
ofthe shop l will be back.

203
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,849
Haldiraaam!

204
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,329
What a game!
What a game! What a game!

205
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,125
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

206
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,570
lndia has won the match!
- Oh so we have won... How nice.

207
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,668
lfyou didn't know'
what were you dancing for?

208
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,569
l was dancing because
all the laddoos...

209
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,812
that my wife made
have been sold.

210
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,740
Sold out? How come?

211
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,879
There was a customer who told me
he wanted to eat laddoos...

212
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,280
that would drive him crazy.

213
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,922
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane and...

214
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:30,022
those who are normal become...
- Clean bowled!

215
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,251
lt was just a joke...
- Stop it now...

216
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,019
Haven't even started it yet...
- Come on...

217
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:37,832
Rukhsar!
- Stop shouting so loudly...

218
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,194
The groom's side has come to
see Rukhsar for marriage.

219
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,404
Sit down. Salute them.

220
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,836
Grandmom... wake up...
the bride has arrived.

221
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,777
Oh! Masha Allah Masha Allah...

222
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,051
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

223
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,714
She is just what l had imagined.

224
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,422
Well... it's not me... its...
This is my daughter' Rukhsar.

225
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,651
What? Fever?

226
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,792
Not fever... mother'
She's Rukhsar!

227
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,226
Oh Rukhsar!

228
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,768
What happen?
- We have won the match.

229
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,007
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

230
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,402
We have won.
- Allah! What happened?

231
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,202
Quiet and introverted... eh?

232
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:28,016
lncidentally' what is her age?

233
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:30,852
Hundred.
- Grandmom' she says...

234
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,816
- she's hundred years old.
- What? Nine years old?

235
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:37,424
She's going to turn twenty-one soon.
- Well... the blossoming ofyouth.

236
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,824
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk'

237
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,026
l guess... anyway l forgot to
tell you' my son's name is Ashfaque.

238
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,200
Sachin!
- Sachin?

239
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,029
Sachin? ln case there's
someone else in her life....

240
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,403
No! No! Please don't say such things.

241
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:58,376
lt's.... her uncle Sachin...
her late uncle Sachin.

242
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,109
She was very attached to him.

243
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,350
She always remembers
him on happy occassions.

244
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:06,310
Sachin...
Poor Sachin...

245
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:14,992
C'mon you girls...
l'll teach you a lesson...

246
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,996
Oh God' ls everything alright?

247
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,597
Forget about me...
Ask me what she hasn't.

248
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,132
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

249
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,373
What?

250
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,341
180 by 100...
your blood pressure is high.

251
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,173
You mean BP is high-wigh!

252
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,512
Yes' it's high and it's
`why' because ofyou.

253
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,406
l have just increased the dosage.
Please get these medicines.

254
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:40,021
Om Bhai' you must take care ofyourself.
- This won't do...

255
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,482
Yes' Aunty...he just doesn't
take care ofhimself.

256
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,826
You just keep quiet...
l don't want to talk to you...

257
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,824
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

258
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:51,891
Oh! l wasn't serious at all.
l was just joking.

259
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,600
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...

260
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,531
Aren't they like my children too?
Anyway' leave all this aside.

261
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,805
The good news is that
they liked this mad girl...

262
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,046
they have accepted the proposal.
- They have accepted?

263
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,111
Didn't they see you properly?

264
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:10,385
Shut up!

265
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,110
So you will leave us and go...?

266
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,390
Some day all you girls have to leave.

267
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,792
No way am l leaving
my father and going anywhere.

268
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,061
Even l'm not going.
- So then should l leave?

269
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,795
Why do you speak like this' father?

270
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,191
Some day you have to get married'
my child.

271
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,069
The only prayer
l have to the Lord is that...

272
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,401
the man you marry must
love you even more than l do.

273
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,075
C'mon...

274
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,635
l don't think such
a man exists in this world...

275
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,079
Am l not there?

276
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,078
You did not eat' dance or even talk
to anyone at the party tonight.

277
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,350
You didn't even tell me
how beautiful l look tonight.

278
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,077
You look very beautiful' Naina.

279
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,084
Really? How sweet!

280
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,326
l'm sweet and l also lie very well.

281
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,325
Just go...
- No.

282
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,299
Hey Naina' you look very beautiful.

283
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,768
Are you lying or telling the truth?
- What do you think?

284
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,430
l think...
- What do you think?

285
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,296
l think Rahul...
- What do you think?

286
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,233
Rahul' l think you should go now.

287
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,773
ln any case l wasn't planning to come
with you. But thanks for the offer.

288
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,448
Bye... l was lying to you.

289
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,725
What's happening' Mom?

290
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:36,063
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

291
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,970
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.

292
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:43,074
That's because there's already
so much in there.

293
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,807
Rahul' How come you are
back so early?

294
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,584
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.

295
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,884
Really?

296
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,748
ln that case you have not taken
after your father in these matters.

297
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,619
He used to love such parties...

298
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,824
because there used to be
a lot of girls there...

299
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,198
Nandini

300
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,766
He used to get very happy
watching those girls.

301
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,596
Nandiniji...lfl hadn't
watched those beautiful girls...

302
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:13,205
how would l have found you?
- What did you do?

303
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,177
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...

304
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:21,048
When he saw her for the first time
he was very pleased...

305
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,520
And said' he approved ofher.

306
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,789
But he said we would have
to ask for dowry.

307
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,725
He insisted that the girl should
bring from her parents' house...

308
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,223
lots oflove and a long'
long ladder.

309
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,062
lt's a great tradition.

310
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,598
The elders ofthe house choose
their daughter-in-law.

311
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,074
One can't trust these mad children.

312
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,574
No' Mataji... All that was then.

313
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,883
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed' Nandini.

314
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,752
But these days children make
their choices themselves...

315
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,615
Nothing has changed' Nandini.

316
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,756
What l meant was...
- Nothing has changed.

317
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,023
But...
- l said it... didn't l?

318
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,226
That's it!

319
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:23,042
Your beauty is going to steal
his sleep in the nights...

320
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,207
Shut up!
- You shut up!

321
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,880
Where is your Ashfaque?

322
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,614
l haven't even seen him yet.

323
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,852
lntroduce him to me.
Let me see how he looks.

324
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,849
He is arriving from
Lucknow today and...

325
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:35,056
he will come to meet you
as soon as he comes.

326
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,219
Tell me what you thought ofhim.

327
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,049
Stop this coy bride act now...

328
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,861
By the way'
what does he do in Lucknow?

329
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,791
He is a poet.
- A poet?

330
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,861
Then l'll get
along very well with him.

331
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,727
Really? Why?

332
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,729
That's because l write
a bit ofpoetry myself.

333
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,867
A ha... Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

334
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,872
Let me say a few lines...
- Go on... Go on.

335
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,581
What heartache have
l gone through for thee...

336
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:03,284
What heartache have
l gone through for thee...

337
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,846
On one end is Rukhsar and
the other is Aunteee...

338
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,485
Shut up' you brat.

339
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,023
Do you know that the morning papers
have carried a photograph...

340
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:13,627
- ofmy boss and his son?
- Really? Can l see?

341
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,496
Wash your hands first...
- Oh God!

342
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,593
Tomorrow is his fiftieth birthday.

343
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,103
There's going to be a big party.
There will be lot ofpeople.

344
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:25,029
l made it very clear to Bhabhiji
that the desserts will...

345
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,040
come from Chandni Chowk. That too
specially made by dear Anjali.

346
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:31,641
Really? And what did she say?
- She agreed.

347
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,775
But now you make sure that
you don't mess things up.

348
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:36,175
Both Rukhsar and you come to
the party with the kulfi.

349
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:39,215
Yes we will. Oh God' but
tomorrow is Bauji's birthday too.

350
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:41,515
So what? Come a little late.

351
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:43,892
ln any case their party is
not going to start early.

352
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,524
Oh Allah! Oh Allah!
Do l have it?

353
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,564
No!
- You don't know anything.

354
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,059
Please dress appropriately
for tomorrow.

355
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:55,061
Yes Ammi' l will wear my new
shimmering' embroidered outfit.

356
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,869
Of course... You must.

357
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:58,732
After all everyone in the party
will be dying to know...

358
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,341
what Rukhsar is going to wear...
- Really?

359
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,742
C'mon Rukhsar... the gang... Please.
- No... not today.

360
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,209
Rukhsar please.
- No... Ammi is not feeling well.

361
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:18,689
l'll return it.

362
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,021
Your groom is coming
to visit us today' isn't he?

363
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,901
Where have we come now? How tacky!

364
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:31,832
You brat. Mother has sent some
medicines for Daijaan.

365
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,041
l'll back.

366
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:43,045
Ammi... Stop it now and
go to sleep...

367
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,850
Come back.
- Coming' bauji.

368
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:00,992
Where has Bhaiiya gone?

369
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:09,270
The shop's closed for now.
lt will open only at 10.

370
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:11,602
Ashfaque miya.

371
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:27,282
Let me say a couplet.

372
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:33,220
So what ifthe evil wishes harm...
nothing can happen

373
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:40,193
The only will that truimphs
is the will ofthe Lord.

374
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,796
Your turn...

375
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,033
Eh' Look up there.

376
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:51,207
Eh' Laddoo...
You can't enter Chandni Chowk.

377
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,081
Why?
- Just...

378
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:56,050
And ifyou want to enter'
you have to say this:

379
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:58,386
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty on
a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk

380
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,712
in a silver spoon'
some Chatni... Say it fast.

381
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,316
What exactly am l supposed to say?

382
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,787
Never mind... You don't say...
Can l say another one?

383
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:15,167
Love is not an easy path'
understand ye all...

384
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:20,667
lt's a trial by fire
to be crossed bravely.

385
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:28,438
Chandu's... spoon's... uncle...

386
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:34,255
You have come to meet me...
haven't you?

387
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:39,424
Not really...
l came to meet Daijaan.

388
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,758
So you call her
`Daijaan' lovingly... eh?

389
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,030
Of course...
She has brought me up.

390
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:50,598
She has brought you up?

391
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,441
ln that case even l must have been
your played in her lap.

392
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:00,706
Chandu's spoon... silver uncle...
Look up there!

393
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,713
Catch him.

394
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,781
When's the wedding?
- Who's?

395
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:07,384
Of course yours and hers.

396
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,153
How can l marry Daijaan?

397
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,991
You have a great sense ofhumour.
And you are cute too.

398
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,729
Bhaiyya... save me.

399
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,993
l'm going to tell Rukhsar that
l liked her Ashfaque miya.

400
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,666
Who is Ashfaque miya?

401
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,841
You are asking me
who Ashfaque miya is?

402
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,343
You have a great sense ofhumour...
You have a great sense ofhumour...

403
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,386
Do you know where
Sayeeda begum lives? No?

404
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:42,480
Do you know?
- What do l know?

405
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:44,021
You seem to know everything.

406
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:46,556
Do you know my Aunty?
Your would be mother-in-law...

407
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,025
Sayeeda begum... Do you know
where she works?

408
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,024
Big businesses ofthe big people.

409
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,766
Have you heard ofthe Raichands?
How could you have heard ofthem?

410
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,831
Their photo has appeared
in the newspaper today...

411
00:39:58,073 --> 00:39:59,472
Really?
- Yes...

412
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:01,873
Have you seen it?
- No...

413

416
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:14,784
And this is his son... God!

Bhaiyya... l have some
goons running after me.

421
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,345
My younger brother.

422
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:48,485
Listen...You really do have
a great sense ofhumour.

423

Greetings... l'm Ashfaque.
- And l'm the Queen ofJhansi.

424
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:42,307

l had a dream since childhood...
A dream to be like Papa.

427
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,719
To walk like him' speak like
him' sit like him...

428
00:41:56,124 --> 00:41:58,592
To do everything the way he does.

429
00:41:59,794 --> 00:42:02,024
Like the way he is
standing right now...

430
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:09,303
Can't do it.
l know l can't do it.

431
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:13,841
And maybe l will never be able to
do it because...

432
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,435
there's no one in this world
like my Papa.

433
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:25,716
l know that someone up there is
happy with me to have bestowed on...

434
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,048
me the right to say that

''May my love for you
surpass that ofthe lord''

458
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,010
''May the lord forgive me'
may the lord forgive me''

459
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:35,484
''You are my heart'
you are my soul''

460
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,018
''You are my heaven'
you are my earth''

461
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,427
''What will l ever do without you''

462
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:48,029
''Oh lord' what will
l ever do without you''

463
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:04,643
''Say '' shava shava '' friends
say '' shava shava ''

464
00:49:15,363 --> 00:49:19,993
''Your gilded beauty shines through'
and so do your golden anklets''

465
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:24,802
''They tinkle in melody'
to wound the hearts ofmillions''

466
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,808
''Your kohled eyes speak
a mysterious language''

467
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:31,009
''...the immortal language of love''

468
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:36,210
''Say '' shava shava '' friends
say '' shava shava ''

469
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:39,071
That's enough now.
lt's been too much.

470
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:34,057
God... Mad girl...
Come on now...

471
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:43,472
l'm a dead duck...
l'm a dead duck...

472
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:50,677
Rukhsar' This one is...

473
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:06,026
Excuse me Sir!

474
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:13,336
This is our Anjali.
She has come to apologise to you.

475
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:18,768
Apologise?
Oh... That's not necessary.

476
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:20,507
Wait! Wait!

477
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,176
How can you say that Sir? She has
caused such a big loss for us...

478
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:27,443
She must apologise. And to tell you'
she is quite a madcap.

479
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,457
Even in her own house...
- Aunty! Can l speak?

480
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:32,585
Yes... go ahead... apologise.

481
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:41,296
You know sir'
When l listen to film songs...

482
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:43,529
l tend to get a little filmi.

483
00:52:44,238 --> 00:52:47,207
And that Khandala number
is one ofmy favourites.

484
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,403
Shut up!
- What am l saying?

485
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,780
What did you want to say and
what are you saying?

486
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:57,084
Apologise.

487
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,015
You?
Come on leave right now from here.

488
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,759
Me?
- No... no... not you.

489
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:14,498
Oh! Sir' l was responsible for
smashing your big pot.

490
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:16,698
Vase.
- Yes' vase... shaz whatever it was.

491
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:18,834
l'm ready to pay you the
money for it.

492
00:53:19,774 --> 00:53:21,469
By the way how much
was it for?

493
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:24,643
Now... l don't know...
Sayeeda' Why don't you explain.

494
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,380
Shut up!
- Shut up?

495
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:30,045
This is all because ofyou.
- Because of me?

496
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:37,046
No... no... not because of you.
God' everything is going wrong.

497
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:40,621
You see sir...

498
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:45,056
Bauji always says that no one becomes
small by asking for forgiveness.

499
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,661
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart...

500
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:53,072
You have a big heart don't you' Sir?
- Now...

501
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:56,443
So you have forgiven me?
- Yes... l have.

502
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:02,744
Big businesses of big people.
Ok l'll take your leave now.

503
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,746
Please say a big hello to Madam.

504
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,021
May the Lord protect
your family always.

505
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:12,750
Greetings. To you too!

506
00:54:27,074 --> 00:54:28,302
Quiet now...

507
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:34,036
Pot... No' Not a pot... a vase.

508
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:35,872
Sayeeda... Take her now...

509
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:40,210
Come on now... Come on...
- Not a pot... a vase. Sorry.

510
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,062
A pot!

511
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:52,932
lsn't this that Laddoo's school?

512
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:55,065
- C'mon lets go and hit him.
- Yes... C'mon.

513
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:11,745
These are the same goons
l was talking about.

514
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,759
Hey' you speak Hindi' don't you?

515
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:46,514
What? And you didn't do anything?

516
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,779
They were too many of them Didi...
l couldn't do anything.

517
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,458
Here you roam around like a don.
What happened to you there?

518
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,658
Oh! Didi.
- Oh! Didi.

519
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:56,930
But what was the need for
her to go into the school?

520
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:58,859
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

521
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,862
She just entered the school...
not murdered anyone.

522
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:03,999
What was the need for them
to say all those things?

523
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,173
lfl was there l would have caught
each one of them and bashed them up.

524
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,339
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

525
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:11,745
Let me meet that
Laddoo and that Fattoo...

526
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:15,812
l vow on Sachin Tendulkar that
l don't hang them upside down...

527
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,348
in the middle of Chandni Chowk
l won't call myself Bauji's daughter.

528
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:19,553
Anjali!

529
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:22,585
You don't know' Bauji...
Can never find place near the Lord...

530
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,591
That's a good line.
Did you write it yourself?.

531
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:28,829
Yes.

532
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:33,767
Greetings to you.
- Greetings.

533
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,765
Anjali' they have come to
our house for the first time...

534
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:39,039
Get them something to eat.

535
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:41,034
l'm sure they have had
their meals before coming...

536
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:43,039
Haven't you seen the size?

537
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,706
Don't worry sir we have eaten.

538
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:49,049
How can you say that? l'll just
get you something in a minute.

539
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,480
No. No sir'
Please don't take any trouble.

540
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:54,648
And you also... don't bother.

541
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,586
What's the name?
- Rohan!

542
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:00,190
Not yours' hers...
- Pooja...

543
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,860
You are a real Laddoo. Come on.

544
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:10,995
You must never hurt
anyone's feelings.

545
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,402
Specially that of a young girl...
and not...

546
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:16,335
when she's so beautiful.
Come on' say Sorry now.

547
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:21,314
Besides' Someone has told me that...

548
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,176
apologising doesn't make
anyone smaller.

549
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:28,017
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart.

550
00:57:30,224 --> 00:57:31,521
lsn't it?

551
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:37,330
What are you looking at?
C'mon' apologise' Laddoo.

552
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:54,844
lfthose two can become friends'
why can't we?

553
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:56,649
Friends?
- Yes...

554
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,375
l just want to be friends with you...
Do you have a problem?

555
00:58:00,087 --> 00:58:03,784
Really?
Friends' ji? C'mon just do it.

556
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,853
l can't see Bauji...
He went to get some food...

557
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:10,460
Bauji is inside...

558
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:21,096
l'm telling you' Rukhsar...
There's something fishy going on.

559
00:58:22,476 --> 00:58:24,171
Anjali' you think he's...
- What?

560
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,513
He is...
- Yes... even l think the same.

561
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:29,675
Don't you think?
- Correct.

562
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,019
Even you think the same' don't you?
- You are on the mark Rukhsar.

563
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:37,016
He wants to take away
my shop from me.

564
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:38,358
Oh Allah!

565
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:41,822
What do l do with this girl?
l'm saying that he might be in...

566
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:43,620
love with you...
- Love?

567
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,331
Wow' Rukhsar begum'
you are really great!

568
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:48,728
You think all the girls in Delhi
are dead...

569
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:50,233
that he will be in love with me?

570
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:52,539
No one loves me
here in Chandni Chowk...

571
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:55,034
Why would that Yashvardhan's
son be interested in me?

572
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,172
Don't joke it away now'
l'm telling you.

573
00:58:57,444 --> 00:58:59,412
Ya ya...
you keep telling...

574
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,785
Take her away.
- What are you saying?

575
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,719
lt was a joke.
- Stop it.

576
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,993
So you don't want to
buy the sweetmeats?

577
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:18,726
When did it shift?

578
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:20,627
Red Fort shifted to Agra
a long time ago and...

579
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,597
the mental asylum from there
has shifted here.

580
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:25,665
Not a dime in the pocket and wants to
know the whereabouts ofthe Red Fort.

581
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:32,071
Bharat Sweet Shop.
Sweets for all occassions...

582
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:35,006
whether an engagement or wedding.
- Both will happen in due course...

583
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:36,681
what's the hurry?
- Who's that?

584
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:39,182
Who? lt's me' who else?
- Who's me?

585
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,818
What do you mean' who?
lt's me your new friend.

586
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:47,494
You know' the children have made
a plan to go to the fair...

587
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:50,530
l was thinking ifyou could join us'
it would be great fun!

588
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:51,696
What fair?

589
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:53,867
The fair at Chandni Chowk'
which else?

590
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,763
This fair?
Don't you think...

591
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:59,234
its importance would reach too high
ifyou visited this fair?

592
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,304
Actually' my importance will increase
manifold' if you could join me.

593
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,036
Tomorrow at 4 in the evening.

594
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:08,040
- Bye.
- Bye Shye.

595
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:21,561
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in

596
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,763
Chandni Chowk in a silver spoon'
some Chatni. C'mon say it.

597
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,258
Stop it!

598
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:31,598
Wearing a suit and his boots
Kanhaiyya has arrived to play a band.

599
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,067
Wow! You sing very well.

600
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:37,069
Yes... By the way'
do you always wear such clothes?

601
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:39,876
Yes... When l wear clothes'
l wear these.

602
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,911
Otherwise most ofthe time
l'm in the nude...

603
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:44,414
No...no... l asked because
we have a proverb that says'

604
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:46,877
`He who wears a kurta from
Lucknow and Pathani salwar...

605
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:49,382
stands for a true man and the one
who doesn't' who knows?'

606
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:52,886
Very good! By the way your hair
looks beautiful when left loose.

607
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:58,292
lsn't it a coincidence that both
our fathers share the same birthday?

608
01:00:58,565 --> 01:01:01,033
Twins?
- Of course. One with a large heart...

609
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:03,236
the other with a large pocket
to pay the bills.

610
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:12,045
Let them be.
They look nice.

611
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:21,049
Bangles? `Fair are my wrists...
make me wear those green bangles...'

612
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:24,724
`... Make me yours' my beloved...'

613
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:27,924
You... Sorry' l mean Mr...

614
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,460
Ah! Don't be formal...
Say`you'... makes me feel closer.

615
01:01:31,265 --> 01:01:35,497
Closer? This is getting too much...
Now listen to me Mr.Raichand...

616
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:38,230
- l want to say something to you...
- l'm listening...

617
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:43,065
What l want to say is that
l can't give you what you want.

618
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,803
Why not?
- l just can't.

619
01:01:46,113 --> 01:01:47,637
At least give it a try.

620
01:01:47,915 --> 01:01:49,815
l can't give...
Bauji won't allow it...

621
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,584
l'll ask for it from Bauji...

622
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:54,082
Lord save me! Why would
Bauji give you our shop?

623
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:57,685
What's the big....? Shop?
What shop?

624
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:01,293
Our Bharat Sweetmeat shop' which else?
- What shop are you talking about?

625
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:04,360
lt was alright till friendship but
what is all this intimacy about?

626
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:08,193
You sneahed in my house.
Lord save me' even that is over.

627
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,537
After all there's a limit
to friendship' isn't there?

628
01:02:13,073 --> 01:02:14,040
Shut up!

629
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,478
There are many bonds
other than friendship.

630
01:02:19,846 --> 01:02:24,044
Bonds that we don't understand...
that we don't need to understand.

631
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:27,377
l hope it's not hurting you.

632
01:02:28,522 --> 01:02:32,219
Bonds that are nameless...
that are just to be experienced.

633
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:35,855
l hope it's not hurting you.

634
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:39,058
Bonds that don't
have any boundaries...

635
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,058
no limits.
l hope it's not hurting you.

636
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:48,074
Bonds that bind the
hearts together...

637
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:52,306
bonds of passion...
bonds of love.

638
01:02:56,116 --> 01:03:01,349
Hurt you? ...Me too!

639
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,027
And one more thing...

640
01:03:08,428 --> 01:03:12,023
l'm definitely going to
take over your sweetmeat shop!

641

652
01:06:12,112 --> 01:06:17,277
''Savour these beauteous moments'

653
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:22,350
''Our dreams blend into

654
01:06:24,057 --> 01:06:29,427
''l wonder if our love'

655
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:35,024
''has bound us in its silken threads''

656
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:41,430
''Let this season of love
remain eternal''

657
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:47,511

663
01:08:05,025 --> 01:08:11,988
''l can't say which of me is you
and which of you is me''

664
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:20,997
''O beloved' it's the waves
ofthe your love that drown me''

665
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:27,002

''The sun dims into twilight'
moon beams simmer brightly''

673
01:10:18,091 --> 01:10:20,855
She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

674
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:25,060
She makes strange faces'
she talks a lot.

675
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:29,068
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

676
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:33,072
And wherever she goes
she breaks a vase a pot

677
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:35,474
Pot?
- That's what she calls them.

678
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,403
But whenever l'm next to her'
l don't know what happens to me.

679
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:45,818
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

680
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,076
Mad.

681
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:51,886
What's the name
ofthis mad hatter?

682
01:10:56,129 --> 01:10:57,596
l wanted to know your opinion.

683
01:10:57,797 --> 01:11:01,233
l'm very happy with this alliance.
Naina is a very nice girl.

684
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:03,598
Have you spoken to Rahul
about this?

685
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:06,772
What's the need to speak to Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

686
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,040
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
ofthis house... our house!

687
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:18,447
DJ... Who will do all
this for me there?

688
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,074
Dad' Why can't l stay with
all of you here?

689
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,406
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

690
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,881
Traditions' my child...
traditions...

691
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,544
Your grandfather went there'
l did' so did bhaiyya.

692
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,354
You can't break the traditions
ofthe house' can you?

693
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:56,522
No...

694
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,036
Always remember
one more thing...

695
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,298
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

696
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:37,724
You have given me so much already...
l can't take all these.

697
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:41,728
Sayeeda... lf Rahul and Rohan
can be like your sons...

698
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:44,069
then don't have a right
over your daughter?

699
01:12:44,404 --> 01:12:46,872
Of course you have...
But all this is too much...

700
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,843
Just tell me what time
is the actual wedding?

701
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:55,815
Rohan... listen to me carefully.

702
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:00,809
Take care ofyour food and sleep.

703
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,016
Rohan' he has reached
his school.

704
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:05,691
Hey! What's all this?

wedding' he will be there.

710

Please think about it again...

Listen... let me say a couplet.

721

`Kurta from Lucknow or a pathani salwar
does not maketh a man...

722
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:17,685
He who gives away his
heart stands for a true man...

723
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,687

01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:04,036
''Oh lord' this damsel oh my lord''

759
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:08,778
''Oh lord'
this young man oh my lord''

760
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:13,044
''Oh lord' this damsel oh my lord''

761
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,216
Agreed!

762
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:21,326
Agreed!

763
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:42,871
Agreed!
- Even l agree.

764
01:20:47,687 --> 01:20:50,349
You love her don't you?
- Yes' Papa.

765
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:53,084
Didn't l tell you' Nandini?
What did l tell you?

766
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,096
l'm very happy'
today Rahul... very happy.

767
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:00,832
Just promise me that
you will keep her happy too.

768
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:01,895
You will keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

769
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,035
You will keep Naina very happy.

770
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,063
You face has fallen as
ifwe are already married.

771
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:34,763
By the way this expression appears
only after a man gets married.

772
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,071
Eh Rahul' What's the matter?

773
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:44,804
What's her name?

774
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:46,638
Naina!

775
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:50,811
l wish that was the name.
But it isn't.

776
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:57,081
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!

777
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,026
Ever since l can remember
l have loved you...

778
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:07,025
loved you very much.
But it isn't your fault.

779
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:13,937
Just because l dreamt ofmarrying you
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

780
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,836
And ifyou are worried
that l will miserable...

781
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,836
yes l will be.

782
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,808
l will feel very bad...
it will hurt

783
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:27,041
a lot too.
But life doesn't stop' does it Rahul?

784
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,050
Perhaps a few years from now
l can laugh at the fact that...

785
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,785
l loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

786
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:44,730
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

787
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,070
But do me a favour Rahul.

788
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,081
Please complete your love story.

789
01:22:58,184 --> 01:23:00,675
You will' won't you Rahul?
For my sake.

790
01:23:05,057 --> 01:23:09,016
Now say something quickly
before l cry more.

791
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:12,360
Even me.

792
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:36,050
Raichand.

793
01:23:40,226 --> 01:23:44,322
The name and the respect has been
given to us by our ancestors.

794
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:52,401
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.

795
01:23:54,974 --> 01:24:00,742
And l will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming a hurdle...

796
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,014
in performing that duty.

797
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:08,809
You didn't even think once...

798
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:16,424
about the background ofthe girl'
her status... her breeding.

799
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:21,831
You didn't give a thought to whether
the girl will be able to understand...

800
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:23,694
our culture... our traditions.

801
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:27,863
Will the girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?

802
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,835
Will the girl understand our
ethics and principles?

803
01:24:33,812 --> 01:24:35,712
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

804
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:37,040
Will she...?

805
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:43,410
How did you even dare to think
that she can be a part of our family?

806
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:48,291
That she can be a
part ofmy family?

807
01:24:51,263 --> 01:24:53,060
How did you think?

808
01:24:56,669 --> 01:25:01,003
Where did l think' Papa?
l didn't think at all.

809
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:09,345
l just loved...love.

810
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:12,276
Love?

811
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:24,359
lt's such a pity that. l made
a mistake in knowing my own son

812
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,035
l thought he knew me.

813
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,639
That he understands
the traditions ofthis family.

814
01:25:35,074 --> 01:25:37,770
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath ofmine.

815
01:25:43,082 --> 01:25:48,714
l was so wrong... so wrong.

816
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:57,796
l was really proud ofyou.

817
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,990
You were my self-respect.
You were my strength.

818
01:26:05,604 --> 01:26:12,009
You have taken all that away
from me... everything.

819
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,208
You have hurt me'

820
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:25,819
You have hurt me.

821
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,058
l never wanted to hurt you.

822
01:27:03,362 --> 01:27:05,330
l only wanted to bring you happiness.

823
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,001
What have l done?

824
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,674
How could l bring tears to your eyes?

825
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,674
How could l bring tears?

826
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:24,546
Don't ever forgive me.

827
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,820
Please don't say that
l have hurt you.

828
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,754
Don't forgive me.

829
01:27:36,061 --> 01:27:38,689
l will do as you say
just as you say.

830
01:28:28,413 --> 01:28:30,005
Bauji... Bauji...

831
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:33,351
Please don't leave us and go.

832
01:28:35,053 --> 01:28:37,453
Get up Bauji...
Don't leave us' Bauji...

833
01:29:13,692 --> 01:29:15,660
Will the girl be able to understand
our culture' our traditions.

834
01:29:16,495 --> 01:29:18,554
Will the girl ever understand our
rituals... our rites?

835
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:20,992
Will the girl understand
our ethics and principles?

836
01:29:21,366 --> 01:29:23,334
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

837
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:03,432
Today...

838
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:15,536
today you have proved that
you are not my blood.

839
01:31:31,496 --> 01:31:33,464
You are not my blood.

840
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:49,078
You have proved that
you are not mine.

841
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:53,885
Papa!

842
01:31:56,188 --> 01:31:58,315
You have lost the right
to call me that!

843
01:32:06,064 --> 01:32:13,766
Made me a stranger in a moment.
Made me a stranger in just a moment.

844
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,736
Does that mean l have no
place in this house anymore?

845
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,399
l am right... am l not' mother?

846
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:58,076
l'm right' am l not?

847
01:34:04,049 --> 01:34:10,477
Then let me go... Can l go?

848
01:34:17,062 --> 01:34:19,758
''Through smiles or through tears''

849
01:34:20,732 --> 01:34:27,365
''We shall never part'
through smiles nor through tears''

850
01:35:04,843 --> 01:35:10,008
''My blessings live with you...''

851
01:35:10,749 --> 01:35:16,016
''to protect you from evil eyes''

852
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:22,022
''My wishes for you...''

853
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:26,330
''wherever you go''

854
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:34,369
''May happiness and joy'
kiss your feet forever''

855
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,768
''lt's all your blessings''

856
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:43,712
''Whether smiles or tears'
we shall never part''

857
01:35:44,349 --> 01:35:47,716
''through smiles or through tears''

858
01:36:17,716 --> 01:36:25,020
Promise me that you will never let
tears come to his eyes...promise me.

859
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:40,701
Now go!

860
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:47,035
Rahul...we didn't take
blessings from father.

861
01:36:48,413 --> 01:36:53,043
we don't have father's blessings...
Rahul we didn't...

862
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:17,003
Go Sayeeda.
Go with my son.

863
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:20,000
Wherever he goes...

864
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:24,777
l don't want him to miss the warmth
of a mother's affection.

865
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:29,612
lfyou want to be someone in life...
ifyou want to achieve something...

866
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:33,024
lfyou want to win'
always listen to your heart.

867
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,027
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

868
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:43,026
close your eyes and
think ofyour parents.

869
01:37:44,803 --> 01:37:51,641
And then you will cross all the hurdles
all your problems will vanish.

870
01:37:53,078 --> 01:37:55,546
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

871
01:37:59,084 --> 01:38:00,984
You will remember all this'
won't you Rohan?

872
01:38:01,419 --> 01:38:06,186
Why are you going' Bhaiyya?
Why? Please don't go.

873
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,657
Promise me Rohan that after today
you will never ask anyone...

874
01:38:15,033 --> 01:38:17,399
why l left and where l went...
promise me.

875
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,341
Take care ofmother.

876
01:38:34,052 --> 01:38:36,020
Get selected in the cricket team.

877
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:56,774
And thus Yash's ego and
Rahul's stuborn stand broke...

878
01:38:57,809 --> 01:39:02,439
the family into two...
broke the family into two...

879
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:49,085
l will bring you back Bhaiyya.
l will bring you home Bhabhi.

880
01:40:50,121 --> 01:40:52,589
To your home... our home.

881
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:18,478
Nandini...
-Yes?

882
01:41:22,253 --> 01:41:24,551
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

883
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:53,576
Where is Rohan?

884
01:41:54,419 --> 01:41:56,387
l don't know where he
left early this morning.

885
01:41:56,554 --> 01:41:59,853
Greetings for ld.
- Greetings for ld.

886
01:42:00,224 --> 01:42:03,591
Greetings to you too.
Wow... you are glowing.

887
01:42:03,962 --> 01:42:05,862
l feel so happy that you have come.
Greetings for ld.

888
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:08,858
God! How big he has grown.
- Yes... Both have grown quite a lot.

889
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:10,700
Stop it now...
-Just a joke.

890
01:42:11,035 --> 01:42:12,832
What's his name' Haldiram?
-Ghasitaram!

891
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:18,473
Hello! Salutations.

894
01:42:27,885 --> 01:42:29,318
Ok... yes yes.

895
01:42:29,654 --> 01:42:32,384
He's just spinning yarns. He's just
come to have some free drinks.

896
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,554
l don't seem to see your mother.
-That reminds me...

897
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:40,955
What's the news about Anjali?
-They are all very well.

898
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:44,165
l just spoke to them in the morning.
-Please give them lots of our love.

899
01:42:44,535 --> 01:42:47,971
Rukhsar!
-You all chat...l'll be back.

900
01:42:49,407 --> 01:42:53,969
What a life Anjali is leading!
From Chandni Chowk to...

901
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:57,848
Yes. From Chandni Chowk to...?
-To...

902
01:42:58,216 --> 01:42:59,877
To... where?
-What where? Chandni Chowk?

903
01:43:00,218 --> 01:43:02,186
That's in Delhi.
-You said she went somewhere.

904
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:05,954
Where did she go?
- Brother... Where she went?

905
01:43:06,357 --> 01:43:09,986
Where did she go?
-Where did she go? Where she went...

906
01:43:10,662 --> 01:43:12,459
Where did she go?
-Where did she go?

907
01:43:12,864 --> 01:43:15,128
Where- did- they- go?
-Where-did-they-go?

908
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,934
Didn't you say they went somewhere?
Probably America or somewhere...

909
01:43:18,302 --> 01:43:20,793
Oh! Have they gone to America?

910
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:24,466
But they didn't live there earlier.
-Exactly.

911
01:43:24,909 --> 01:43:26,638
Where did they live earlier?
-ln Chandni Chowk.

912
01:43:26,978 --> 01:43:29,640
After that... Where?
-America... Didn't you just say?

913
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,948
And in between?
- ln between whom?

914
01:43:32,316 --> 01:43:34,147
ln between the two...
-What is between the two?

915
01:43:34,519 --> 01:43:36,953
What is between the two?
-The place between the two...

916
01:43:37,321 --> 01:43:39,289
What's the place between the two?
What is he talking about?

917
01:43:39,657 --> 01:43:42,820
Wonder where these people come from.
-l'm trying to tell you' the place...

918
01:43:43,194 --> 01:43:45,321
What place are you talking about?
-What place? Where?

919
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:47,392
Silence! Come here.

920
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,828
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

921
01:43:52,203 --> 01:43:55,172
She has gone to London.
Someday even l will go there.

922
01:44:07,218 --> 01:44:08,981
You have just come back' son.
And you want to go away again?

923
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,778
l feel incomplete here' Dad!

924
01:44:11,155 --> 01:44:15,114
Why don't you study for MBA here?
There are a lot ofuniversities here.

925
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,119
Why do you want to go to London?
-Traditions' Dad... Traditions.

926
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:24,794
Grandfather went there' you did...

927
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:30,402
so did Bhaiyya... So how can l break
the traditions of this house?

928
01:44:48,593 --> 01:44:50,561
So what shall l bring
back for the mother?

929
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:53,959
What does a mother's heart yearn for?

930
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,159
Mother's heart? lt only yearns
for her son's happiness...

931
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:08,502
no matter where he is... no matter
how he is... just happiness...

932
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:26,921
And a son's happiness is in
his mother's laughter... her smile...

933
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,465
something that he
isn't able to see.

934
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,472
l promise' mother.
The laughter will return...

935
01:45:42,246 --> 01:45:47,843
that smile will return.
lt's a son's promise.

936
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,619
And a brother's!

937
01:46:17,348 --> 01:46:21,614
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances' doesn't it?

938
01:46:31,095 --> 01:46:33,325
And when dear ones create distances
in between' it aches even more.

939
01:50:02,073 --> 01:50:05,338
Has your princess woken up?
-Oh yes... Pooja!

940
01:50:06,177 --> 01:50:09,146
No one knows her by that name. Call
her what she is called by everyone...

941
01:50:09,747 --> 01:50:10,873
Poo!

942
01:51:03,437 --> 01:51:07,396
You have no right to
look so beautiful.

943
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:18,018
She has arrived' the cunning vixen'
to drop her daughter.

944
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,721
After seeing your face in the morning
how can l call it a lovely day?

945
01:51:27,861 --> 01:51:30,227
Liar! Liar! Come here...

946
01:51:35,669 --> 01:51:38,229
Who is it' Anjali?
-Your future daughter-in-law.

947
01:51:38,973 --> 01:51:40,941
Come' let me serve you
some cornflakes.

948
01:52:01,295 --> 01:52:03,593
Anjali... Anjali l need to talk to you.
-What?

949
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:06,695
This song that you sing every morning.
-So?

950
01:52:08,302 --> 01:52:09,860
lt feels very nice.

951
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,675
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

952
01:52:16,043 --> 01:52:19,206
l don't sing for them do l? l sing so
that my son learns about our country.

953
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:22,676
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say that you have!

954
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:25,018
Yes... l have learnt everything.
- He has learnt nothing...

955
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:27,550
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion' our traditions...

956
01:52:27,921 --> 01:52:30,719
our heritage... Move out ofmy way.
Our country has...

957
01:52:31,125 --> 01:52:33,025
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

958
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:36,229
Eh! The country best in the world
is our lndia... don't ever forget!

959
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:43,027
OK... l won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

960
01:52:43,404 --> 01:52:45,634
when he turns a full one
don't complain to me.

961
01:52:48,042 --> 01:52:52,570
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

962
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:09,922
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

963
01:53:26,246 --> 01:53:28,510
Let me knot it for you' Jeej!
-Aaaah!

964
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:34,709
What happened?
-What kind of clothes have you worn?

965
01:53:35,255 --> 01:53:37,223
lt's become too long hasn't it?

966
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:41,420
What now?

967
01:53:44,998 --> 01:53:46,556
Where's the back?

968
01:53:47,434 --> 01:53:49,368
Didi' don't wait for me.

969
01:53:58,078 --> 01:54:00,410
Anjali' Daijaan' come here.

970
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:03,909
How do you allow Pooja to
go out wearing such little clothes?

971
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:26,302
By the way even the two ofyou
are looking decent today' l think...

972
01:55:12,986 --> 01:55:15,181
You had worn this even the
day before' hadn't you?

973
01:55:17,224 --> 01:55:18,885
lt suits you a lot!

974
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:41,981
Poo... the whole college
runs after Robbie.

975
01:55:47,054 --> 01:55:48,749
He's not my type!

976
01:55:49,256 --> 01:55:52,225
Who is your type?
And when will you meet him?

977
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:56,226
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

978
01:55:59,967 --> 01:56:02,231
He could be right here somewhere.

979
01:56:05,005 --> 01:56:08,031
Oh God! Who is this... disturbing
Poo so early in the morning!

980
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:43,300
Who is this who hasn't turned to
give me a second look? Who is he?

981
01:57:34,728 --> 01:57:37,390
''He's so cute' he's so sweet''

982
01:57:39,232 --> 01:57:42,258
''Got to be careful'
l don't fall in love''

983
01:57:48,642 --> 01:57:51,372
''He's so cute' he's so sweet''

984
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:56,213
''Got to be careful
of falling in love''

985
01:57:58,251 --> 01:58:02,312
''lfl make him mine'
he'll steal my heart''

986
01:58:02,956 --> 01:58:05,550
''Wonder why l feel this way?''

987
01:58:08,462 --> 01:58:11,158
''Oh tell me who he is ?''

988
01:58:11,932 --> 01:58:15,629
''My heart starts skipping a beat
when l see him''

989
01:58:18,205 --> 01:58:20,696
''Oh tell me who he is ?''

990
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:25,167
''My heart starts skipping a beat
when l see him''

991
01:59:01,815 --> 01:59:03,942
''For the first time
l've seen someone''

992
01:59:06,186 --> 01:59:08,450
''A stranger so familiar''

993
01:59:11,158 --> 01:59:13,149
''For the first time
l've met someone''

994
01:59:13,527 --> 01:59:15,495
''A stranger so familiar''

995
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:24,167
''ln the world' there's
no shortage of friends''

996
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:29,169
''But yet the heart beats faster
for that someone''

997
01:59:30,043 --> 01:59:33,171
''O lord' l don't know how ?
l don't know why ?''

998
01:59:34,481 --> 01:59:38,178
''My heart is beating faster?''

999
01:59:39,319 --> 01:59:42,379
''He's so cute' he's so sweet''

1000
01:59:44,024 --> 01:59:46,993
''Got to be careful
of falling in love''

1001
01:59:48,929 --> 01:59:52,763
''lfl make him mine'
he'll steal my heart''

1002
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:56,997
''Wonder why l feel this way?''

1003
01:59:59,239 --> 02:00:01,867
''Oh tell me who he is ?''

1004
02:00:02,943 --> 02:00:06,344
''My heart starts skipping a beat
when l see him''

1005
02:00:54,394 --> 02:00:57,192
''l want to drown in her eyes''

1006
02:00:59,633 --> 02:01:01,897
''That's what l long for''

1007
02:01:04,037 --> 02:01:08,269
''l'd give it all up for one moment''

1008
02:01:08,808 --> 02:01:11,208
''Just one moment with her''

1009
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:17,339
''For years there has been a face
in my dreams''

1010
02:01:18,185 --> 02:01:21,780
''May be even she is waiting for me?''

1011
02:01:23,156 --> 02:01:26,182
''Oh lord' what do l say'
when she looks at me''

1012
02:01:27,994 --> 02:01:31,225
''With so much love in her eyes''

1013
02:01:32,499 --> 02:01:35,525
''She's so cute' she's so sweet''

1014
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:40,398
''Got to be careful
l don't fall in love''

1015
02:01:42,075 --> 02:01:46,239
''lfl make her mine'
she'll steal my heart''

1016
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:49,376
''Wonder why l feel this way?''

1017
02:02:39,399 --> 02:02:41,390
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

1018
02:02:41,601 --> 02:02:43,398
in a silver spoon'
some Chatni...

1019
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:46,973
some chatni.

1020
02:03:04,491 --> 02:03:08,587
Do you know Rohan' Didi always says
that a married woman is the union of...

1021
02:03:08,962 --> 02:03:10,691
a wife and a daughter-in-law.

1022
02:03:11,698 --> 02:03:15,930
She is a good wife' but she hasn't
managed to be an ideal daughter-in-law

1023
02:03:17,937 --> 02:03:21,202
And your brother?
Not a day passes...

1024
02:03:21,975 --> 02:03:24,205
not a moment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

1025
02:03:25,412 --> 02:03:29,542
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph in the house.

1026
02:03:30,984 --> 02:03:33,009
But not once has he
turned towards it.

1027
02:03:35,255 --> 02:03:38,224
We have made a small world for
ourselves here' Rohan.

1028
02:03:39,259 --> 02:03:42,228
lf you look from afar
it's filled with happiness...

1029
02:03:43,997 --> 02:03:47,524
but the closer you go'
you will find a lot of sorrow.

1030
02:03:51,371 --> 02:03:55,239
Why have you come' Rohan?
Why now?

1031
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:06,713
l had promised bhaiyya that l will
never ask where he went or why he went

1032
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,317
But today l have realised that
he doesn't think ofus as his own.

1033
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:20,859
That is a pain l can't bear...
can't bear.

1034
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:24,530
l have left some broken
bonds back home' Pooja

1035
02:04:26,706 --> 02:04:29,197
that can only attain the status
of a family through my elder brother.

1036
02:04:32,245 --> 02:04:38,013
l have come to take my brother back...
take my sister-in-law back...

1037
02:04:41,254 --> 02:04:43,222
But l can't do this on my own.

1038
02:04:46,059 --> 02:04:47,890
l will need your support Pooja.

1039
02:04:51,264 --> 02:04:54,233
Will you support me?

1040
02:05:01,207 --> 02:05:06,577
No... No... never!
-He is Sonia's brother.

1041
02:05:07,013 --> 02:05:09,413
He's not my brother... And l didn't
even know that Sonia had a brother.

1042
02:05:09,783 --> 02:05:11,683
So Sonia' when was this
brother ofyours born?

1043
02:05:11,918 --> 02:05:13,510
Brother? Who's brother?

1044
02:05:16,222 --> 02:05:18,190
My first brother from lndia
has come.

1045
02:05:18,925 --> 02:05:23,191
l mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

1046
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,200
lt's only a matter of few days.
At least meet him once.

1047
02:05:38,978 --> 02:05:40,946
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

1048
02:05:41,247 --> 02:05:43,215
Daijaan' please explain to her...
-Why are you troubling him? Why?

1049
02:05:43,383 --> 02:05:44,680
Oh stop it Aunty.

1050
02:05:45,785 --> 02:05:47,878
C'mon' ln such a big house can't he...
- Can't stay.

1051
02:05:48,254 --> 02:05:51,018
This big house has you wearing
really small clothes... that's why.

1052
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:54,588
l don't want any young man staring at
you... And l'm the boss ofthis house.

1053
02:05:54,961 --> 02:05:57,020
And l ring all the bells.
Gosh! What is it?

1054
02:05:57,997 --> 02:05:59,965
What is it? l was just
saving you from an evil eye!

1055
02:06:00,333 --> 02:06:03,894
Who's evil eye?
This whole family is mad.

1056
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:07,239
All the mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

1057
02:06:09,943 --> 02:06:14,403
Didi' Sonia's brother has just
arrived' he has no place to stay.

1058
02:06:15,615 --> 02:06:18,846
Can't we give him a
small place in this big house?

1059
02:06:19,919 --> 02:06:21,978
Pooja' You know Rahul' don't you?

02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:35,429
From lndia...
-My great lndia... remember?

Listen to me...

Just listen to me...

1064
02:06:43,376 --> 02:06:45,537
So? Should l make him sit on my head?
Do you know the population oflndia?

1065
02:06:45,912 --> 02:06:47,880

1067
02:06:52,385 --> 02:06:55,013

He is waiting outside and
l'm calling him in...

1070
02:07:08,268 --> 02:07:09,235
Listen...

1071

Excuse me...

''We shall never part'
through smiles nor through tears...''

1073
02:07:29,956 --> 02:07:33,915
''we shall never part'
through smiles nor through tears.''

1074
02:07:52,245 --> 02:07:57,547
''How helpless are we'
what is this trial by fire...''

1075
02:07:58,251 --> 02:08:03,917
''we stand so close
yet we are so far''

1076
02:08:04,591 --> 02:08:08,027
''lfyou are the body'

''l'm your blood...''

1078
02:08:16,803 --> 02:08:19,237
''we meet and yet we don't...''

1079
02:08:19,672 --> 02:08:22,436
''Oh what an illusion.''

1080
02:08:22,976 --> 02:08:28,175
''lt's all your blessings'
whether smiles or tears...''

1081
02:08:28,548 --> 02:08:34,919
''we shall never part'
through smiles or through tears.''

1082
02:08:53,239 --> 02:08:54,729
My name is Rahul.

1083
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:02,675
My name is Yash.

1084
02:09:17,196 --> 02:09:21,223
He will stay with us.
Take his luggage...

1085
02:10:03,743 --> 02:10:06,007
And this is your room!

Dinner at 8 p.m. or starve the night

1092
02:10:50,356 --> 02:10:53,189
And... stay away...

1093
02:10:57,230 --> 02:11:01,189
This is too much... Eh!
What are you staring at?

1094
02:11:02,969 --> 02:11:06,666
Say more' Please... it feels nice.
-Eh! Feels nice? Am l singing a song?

1095
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:09,940
Why do you keep calling me
Eh'? l have a name...

1096
02:11:11,677 --> 02:11:15,204

-Oh!

1098
02:11:19,051 --> 02:11:22,543
So you don't want to take my name
as a sign ofrespect. That's great.

1099
02:11:23,022 --> 02:11:24,990
ln that case l should return
the respect too.

1100
02:11:25,258 --> 02:11:27,783
Can l call you Bhaiyya?
- Call your father that!

1101
02:11:28,161 --> 02:11:32,825
Don't you drag my father into this...
actually you can... you have the right

1102
02:11:36,402 --> 02:11:39,894
He got scared! Poo'

1103
02:11:45,278 --> 02:11:47,371
l'm mad? You wear this jacket.

1104
02:11:56,289 --> 02:11:59,122
Rohan' we were waiting for
your call for such a long time.

1105
02:12:05,431 --> 02:12:08,059
Seems like both ofyou
are right here with me.

1106
02:12:12,371 --> 02:12:13,338
Mad!

1107
02:12:13,806 --> 02:12:15,865
The campus is giving me
an accomodation after a week.

1108
02:12:16,242 --> 02:12:18,335
Right now l'm living with
an lndian family.

1109
02:12:18,978 --> 02:12:21,003
Why' an lndian family?

1110
02:12:21,714 --> 02:12:24,877
They are very nice people.
When l met them l felt like...

1111
02:12:25,251 --> 02:12:27,219
l have known them for years.
A laughing' happy and...

1112
02:12:27,587 --> 02:12:31,216
contented family'

1113
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:49,731
ls he going to pay for the bill?
Go eat your food... even that's free...

1114
02:13:06,292 --> 02:13:08,260
There goes Madonna
early in the morning.

1115
02:13:15,401 --> 02:13:17,869
lfyou are here' who is singing
this prayer in the morning?

1116
02:13:18,905 --> 02:13:21,203
Goddess Saraswati herself
has incarnated in the house?

1117
02:13:27,246 --> 02:13:29,214
What has happened to
Saraswati here?

1118
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:36,210
Look what we have done' Pooja?
We have woken them up so early.

1119
02:14:36,649 --> 02:14:38,014
Come on... take their blessings.

1120
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:43,210
Salutations Didi... Salutations Jeejaji
-Salutations to you too... Who is this?

1121
02:14:44,523 --> 02:14:46,013
You are not able to recognise her
because...

1122
02:14:46,258 --> 02:14:48,226
You are seeing her fully clothed for
the first time. lt's your sister-in-law.

1123
02:14:48,527 --> 02:14:49,824
You mean our Poo?

1124
02:14:53,265 --> 02:14:55,756
Have a laddoo!
Mother has sent them.

1125
02:14:57,003 --> 02:14:58,971
l thought l should
keep them as offerings.

1126
02:14:59,271 --> 02:15:00,898
Let me do the tika for you.

1127
02:15:05,277 --> 02:15:06,904
Won't you get your tika done?

1128
02:15:08,614 --> 02:15:11,174
Back home no one leaves
the house without a tika.

1129
02:15:12,218 --> 02:15:14,186
Mother says it's an auspicious
start for the day.

1130
02:15:16,222 --> 02:15:21,182
Mother says?
So then... do it.

1131
02:15:56,262 --> 02:15:58,025
Now who has done this?
- Me of course.

1132
02:15:58,330 --> 02:16:00,230
l enjoy puncturing tyres.

1133
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:03,568
Was that a joke?
-lt was... so?

1134
02:16:10,276 --> 02:16:11,504
No l don't want...

1135
02:16:11,777 --> 02:16:14,940
A guest is equal to a God. And you
can't refuse a lift offered by God.

1136
02:16:15,214 --> 02:16:16,977
Come on go now.
- l'll take a taxi.

1137
02:16:17,216 --> 02:16:18,945
Give me the money you would have
paid the cab.

1138
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:22,744
That l am.

1139
02:16:23,222 --> 02:16:24,985
Listen... Please come back home
early in the evening.

1140
02:16:25,324 --> 02:16:26,951
Why?
-Just!

1141
02:16:28,694 --> 02:16:30,184
l have finished...
now let's leave.

1142
02:16:50,249 --> 02:16:52,217
By the way are you
interested in cricket?

1143
02:16:52,918 --> 02:16:53,885
Why?

1144
02:16:54,086 --> 02:16:56,554
Because there's a match.
lndia v/s England... at the oval.

1145
02:16:59,692 --> 02:17:01,660
lt must be the last over.

1146
02:17:02,161 --> 02:17:04,129
ls it a stolen car?
- No.

1147
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:06,220
ls it yours?
- Yes.

1148
02:17:06,532 --> 02:17:08,227
Then do what pleases you.

1149
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,184
Don't say anything now. Anything
can happen at the last minute.

1150
02:17:30,556 --> 02:17:31,989
You can never bank on lndia.

1151
02:17:39,732 --> 02:17:44,931
Did you call me `bhaiyya'?
- Why? Should l?

1152
02:17:45,371 --> 02:17:48,204
Why? Just drive the car carefully.

1153
02:17:52,578 --> 02:17:55,445
Hey! We won...
- We will win!

1154
02:18:07,459 --> 02:18:09,427
Like every year
Poo will decide on the boy..

1155
02:18:09,595 --> 02:18:12,496
who will escort her to the prom.

1156
02:18:19,038 --> 02:18:22,667
You will be given marks on ten.
To go to the prom with me...

1157
02:18:22,875 --> 02:18:25,844
you have to be brilliant in
three departments.

1158
02:19:15,194 --> 02:19:16,957
You are not so bad.

1159
02:19:17,429 --> 02:19:20,398
l wasn't talking about myself.
l was giving you points.

1160
02:19:30,476 --> 02:19:32,444
l will go only with
him to the prom.

1161
02:19:34,546 --> 02:19:36,173
Where will he go?

1162
02:20:04,576 --> 02:20:05,770
Just fell.

1163
02:20:15,854 --> 02:20:19,483
l'm leaving... l'm leaving.

1164
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:26,625
Listen...
l want to say something to you.

1165
02:20:28,534 --> 02:20:30,502
Say it fast.
l don't have time.

1166
02:20:31,203 --> 02:20:33,171
Should l say it?
- Say it.

1167
02:20:36,975 --> 02:20:38,943
Should l?
- Please say.

1168
02:20:39,712 --> 02:20:41,680
You have...
- Yes?

1169
02:20:42,214 --> 02:20:44,682
You have...
- Say it please.

1170
02:20:46,218 --> 02:20:48,186
Both...
- Both ofus.

1171
02:20:49,221 --> 02:20:50,984
Both...
- Both...

1172
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:54,191
Both... Both ofyour
shoes are not matched.

1173
02:21:01,233 --> 02:21:03,929
That's the latest fashion.
l don't think you know.

1174
02:21:25,591 --> 02:21:27,559
Please tell Didi
not to wait for me.

1175
02:21:49,281 --> 02:21:50,407
Where are you?

1176
02:22:08,333 --> 02:22:15,535
''From the moment
l set my eyes on you...''

1177
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:21,211
''l marked you to be mine''

1183
02:24:00,379 --> 02:24:04,247
''From the moment l set

1184
02:24:04,983 --> 02:24:08,680

1187
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:13,509
''l'm wounded by your love'
that's what makes me act the way l do''

1188
02:25:15,587 --> 02:25:22,186
''That's a nice line to fool me
But it won't work on me''

1189
02:25:24,563 --> 02:25:28,556
''lt has taken years for us
to meet each other''

1190
02:25:29,201 --> 02:25:33,194
''Hope these moments last forever''

1191

One minute' child...

Pooja' Couldn't you wear
decent clothes at least today?

1205
02:28:20,705 --> 02:28:22,172
You came in these strange
black clothes.

1206
02:28:22,374 --> 02:28:23,966
Do you know everyone was
staring at us in the temple?

1207
02:28:24,209 --> 02:28:27,906
lf everyone was staring at me instead
of God then it's not my problem.

1208
02:28:33,552 --> 02:28:36,521
Did you hear that' Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?

1209
02:28:36,721 --> 02:28:38,348
Today is father's birthday.

1210
02:28:41,593 --> 02:28:43,561
Today is bauji's birthday?

1211
02:28:54,773 --> 02:28:57,003
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happened to you?

1212
02:29:03,248 --> 02:29:05,216
Please take it...
it's the offering from the prayer

1213
02:29:09,254 --> 02:29:11,154
But aren't offerings on
birthday done for the...?

1214
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:14,158
l know. But Bauji
was a very funloving man...

1215
02:29:14,526 --> 02:29:17,495
he said even after l go
always remember me on a happy day.

1216
02:29:18,463 --> 02:29:21,159
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and l've a special prayer for him

1217
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,160
lfhe had to see Pooja like this today'
he would've been unconscious.

1218
02:29:27,205 --> 02:29:30,572
You must feel sad that he
is no longer with you now.

1219
02:29:31,543 --> 02:29:32,976
Yes... we do.

1220
02:29:34,679 --> 02:29:36,977
lt's important to have the warmth of
elders in a house...

1221
02:29:38,583 --> 02:29:42,178
or else a family always feels
incomplete... lsn't it?

1222
02:29:51,563 --> 02:29:53,190
Don't you miss him?

1223
02:29:57,636 --> 02:29:59,194
Don't you miss?

1224
02:30:02,307 --> 02:30:04,002
Don't you miss Bauji?

1225
02:30:07,312 --> 02:30:10,213
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja' Krishi...

1226
02:30:10,515 --> 02:30:12,142
Come on... Please come.

1227
02:30:15,854 --> 02:30:17,412
Even you are coming aren't you?

1228
02:31:04,369 --> 02:31:05,859
l forgot.

1229
02:31:08,673 --> 02:31:11,870
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory and the one...

1230
02:31:13,478 --> 02:31:16,879
who is right here'
l forgot about him.

1231
02:31:19,584 --> 02:31:21,347
What present should l give you?

1232
02:31:23,254 --> 02:31:25,222
Just return my Nandini back to me.

1233
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:33,959
We have lost each other
in this big house.

1234
02:31:37,602 --> 02:31:41,561
Just get back my Nandini for me.

1235
02:31:45,610 --> 02:31:47,578
l want nothing else.

1236
02:31:51,683 --> 02:31:52,809
Nothing else.

1237
02:31:58,523 --> 02:31:59,490
Listen...

1238
02:32:30,722 --> 02:32:33,486
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.

1239
02:32:34,592 --> 02:32:38,028
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...

1240
02:32:38,763 --> 02:32:40,958
what do they call it? `Sexy'.

1241
02:32:46,438 --> 02:32:47,735
Krishi will see.

1242
02:32:49,074 --> 02:32:52,043
By the way' that should have been
my line... Go now.

1243
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:54,578
My bag and my coat.
- l'll just get it.

1244
02:33:00,285 --> 02:33:02,344
Listen' day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...

1245
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:04,053
Wow! So what am l supposed to do?

1246
02:33:04,289 --> 02:33:08,248
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for indians

1247
02:33:12,363 --> 02:33:13,921
You are leaving?

1248
02:33:20,705 --> 02:33:21,865
What is it?

1249
02:33:29,914 --> 02:33:31,211
He keeps popping up everywhere.

1250
02:33:43,561 --> 02:33:46,530
So Karwa Chauth!
- Yes... it's day after tomorrow.

1251
02:33:47,966 --> 02:33:50,935
So you must have received the Sargi.
- Sargi?

1252
02:33:52,270 --> 02:33:57,333
Sargi... Don't you know what sargi is?
lt's a ritual for karwa chauth...

1253
02:33:57,609 --> 02:33:59,577
it's something that every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.

1254
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:04,048
Hasn't your mother-in-law
sent it for you?

1255
02:34:11,289 --> 02:34:14,190
Some elder person ofyour family
must be sending it to you.

1256
02:34:15,226 --> 02:34:16,716
No...

1257
02:34:22,367 --> 02:34:26,201
Don't worry. This year
you will get your sargi.

1258
02:34:31,976 --> 02:34:34,740
My mother... she will
explain everything to you.

1259
02:34:43,254 --> 02:34:45,222
Greetings to you' my child!
- Greetings.

1260
02:34:46,257 --> 02:34:49,021
My son speaks so much about
your family that l feel almost like

1261
02:34:50,261 --> 02:34:52,229
l'm there with all ofyou.

1262
02:34:53,431 --> 02:34:55,626
He has become a part of
our small family.

1263
02:34:57,168 --> 02:34:59,033
l hope he is not
troubling you too much.

1264
02:35:02,273 --> 02:35:04,241
Dear child' Sargi is something that...

1265
02:35:04,409 --> 02:35:06,570
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.

1266
02:35:09,214 --> 02:35:13,173
Some sweets' a few almonds and...

1267
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:22,752
signs ofmarital bliss...
and lots oflove.

1268
02:35:32,237 --> 02:35:34,205
l'll send it to you.

1269
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:37,508
l will think l have sent.
it to my daughter-in-law.

1270
02:35:51,723 --> 02:35:55,557
OK my child l'll hang up now!
- OK.

1271
02:36:28,226 --> 02:36:33,357
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?

1272
02:36:51,983 --> 02:36:54,952
And why is it' at times...

1273
02:36:55,586 --> 02:36:57,554
that even our own people
become strangers?

1274
02:37:04,429 --> 02:37:08,229
Listen... Even l have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.

1275
02:37:12,537 --> 02:37:14,164
For whom?

1276
02:37:16,741 --> 02:37:19,175
What's going on there?
- Something that doesn't happen here.

1277
02:37:21,212 --> 02:37:23,578
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?

1278
02:37:24,615 --> 02:37:27,846
Why? Who am l ofyours?

1279
02:37:33,925 --> 02:37:35,893
You don't have the guts
to tell your brother and bhabhi...

1280
02:37:36,127 --> 02:37:39,187
how you are related to them...
Trying to be a great tiger before me!

1281
02:37:40,365 --> 02:37:41,764
Let go ofmy hand.

1282
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:44,000
Why has he held her hand?
- Let go ofmy hand.

1283
02:37:44,235 --> 02:37:45,532
l let go.

1284
02:37:46,704 --> 02:37:50,663
What ifl tell them?
Today in the presence of everyone...

1285
02:37:52,143 --> 02:37:57,206
what ifl tell them the truth'
what will you do?

1286
02:37:57,615 --> 02:38:00,482
l don't think you will be able to.
You are scared.

1287
02:38:02,587 --> 02:38:04,350
What ifl do?

1288
02:38:04,922 --> 02:38:07,390
Then l will tell
everyone what's in my heart.

1289
02:38:08,393 --> 02:38:12,420
Really? ls that so?
- lt's a bet.

1290
02:38:13,197 --> 02:38:15,427
Don't bet with me'
you might regret.

1291
02:38:17,201 --> 02:38:20,398
Maybe that's what l want.

1292
02:38:23,141 --> 02:38:24,972
But looking at you...

1293
02:38:27,211 --> 02:38:29,179
l wonder if all this is a dream.

1294
02:38:29,614 --> 02:38:30,581
Dream?

1295
02:38:32,517 --> 02:38:34,951
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

1296
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:04,333
Your turn.

1297
02:40:10,515 --> 02:40:15,475
''My trinkets tinkle...
they say l am yours''

1298
02:40:27,198 --> 02:40:32,966
''l can't spend a minute without you'
Oh l am yours''

1299
02:40:38,242 --> 02:40:41,541
''Take me away...
oh darling take me away''

1300
02:41:05,303 --> 02:41:12,539
''My trinkets tinkle...

1301
02:41:14,245 --> 02:41:19,547
''l can't spend a minute without you'
Oh l am yours''

1302
02:41:20,251 --> 02:41:23,743
''Take me away'

1303
02:41:30,227 --> 02:41:36,632
''Your trinkets tinkle...

1304
02:41:39,904 --> 02:41:44,238
''can't spend a moment without you'
Oh l am yours''

1305
02:41:44,809 --> 02:41:48,506
''Take me away' oh darling'
take me away''

1306
02:42:27,251 --> 02:42:30,982
''l can't think of a life
without you'''

1307
02:42:32,256 --> 02:42:36,215
''l spend sleepless nights
counting stars in the sky'''

1308
02:42:36,927 --> 02:42:41,227
''my heart keeps calling out to you'
my bindiya makes a sign'''

1309
02:42:44,201 --> 02:42:51,232
''The shimmering bindiya '
shines like a star next to the moon'''

1310
02:42:56,647 --> 02:43:00,606
''My anklets call out to you'
try to make up to you as you sulk'''

1311
02:43:01,152 --> 02:43:06,055
''Oh my loved' my beloved.
try and understand...''

1312
02:43:06,290 --> 02:43:08,588
''what l'm trying to say''

1313
02:43:09,393 --> 02:43:16,196
''Your trinkets tinkle'
they say l am yours''

1314
02:43:19,437 --> 02:43:23,601
''Can't spend a moment without you'
Oh l am yours.''

1315
02:43:24,241 --> 02:43:27,540
''Take me away' oh darling'
take me away.''

1316
02:43:58,776 --> 02:44:01,244
''May we be in
marital bliss forever...''

1317
02:44:03,714 --> 02:44:06,239
''may our soulmates be
with us forever''

1318
02:44:08,686 --> 02:44:13,180
''Now that you have entered my world'
never leave''

1319
02:44:13,624 --> 02:44:18,186
''Take my hand and ask me
to be yours forever''

1320
02:44:23,701 --> 02:44:30,197
''Oh darling you look so beautiful'
seems like you have been made for me''

1321
02:44:33,244 --> 02:44:37,681
''Your beauty shines so brightly'
that it shames the moon''

1322
02:44:41,018 --> 02:44:45,580
''Go away you liar' l'm not taken in''

1323
02:44:45,956 --> 02:44:50,222
''Don't flatter too much'
your giving yourself away''

1324
02:45:00,538 --> 02:45:04,975
''l wish from the bottom ofmy heart'
may your pair be forever''

1325
02:45:05,276 --> 02:45:12,512
''Oh my love' my beloved' wish
we spent our lives together forever''

1326
02:45:18,255 --> 02:45:25,559
''Your trinkets tinkle'
they say l am yours''

1327
02:45:28,232 --> 02:45:32,760
''Can't spend a moment without you'
Oh l am yours''

1328
02:45:33,237 --> 02:45:36,536
''Take me away' oh darling'
take me away''

1329
02:47:34,224 --> 02:47:35,657
You are mad!

1330
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,993
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.

1331
02:47:38,228 --> 02:47:39,855
No. Not at all.

1332
02:47:40,230 --> 02:47:43,199
Really' Aunty... Sometimes
l wish we were living in lndia.

1333
02:47:44,568 --> 02:47:47,867
And Krishi would sing the
same songs that l grew up singing.

1334
02:47:49,573 --> 02:47:53,942
But we are here and l have become
`mummy' from a mother.

1335
02:47:54,845 --> 02:47:56,938
Why do you think so' Anjali?
the culture is yours' isn't it?

1336
02:47:58,949 --> 02:48:04,012
Still... lt's not the same' Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!

1337
02:48:08,659 --> 02:48:09,626
Mad!

1338
02:48:10,694 --> 02:48:14,494
By the way' D...j... Daijaan'
What are these children doing?

1339
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:19,897
There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.

1340
02:48:20,704 --> 02:48:23,434
All ofus are going for it.
You will come with us' won't you?

1341
02:48:29,346 --> 02:48:30,973
l'll just be back.

1342
02:48:41,592 --> 02:48:43,184
What do l do with this?

1343
02:48:55,039 --> 02:48:57,007
What are you doing?
l'll manage myself.

1344
02:48:57,307 --> 02:48:59,207
Leave it Daijaan'
l'll manage myself.

1345
02:49:00,244 --> 02:49:04,010
l'll do it myself... Daijaan...
Daijaan... DJ!

1346
02:49:11,588 --> 02:49:15,615
My little child! My child!

1347
02:49:18,595 --> 02:49:23,157
l knew it...
My heart kept telling me

1348
02:49:24,535 --> 02:49:30,565
that it was my Baba. Oh Allah!
How big you've grown up to be.

1349
02:49:35,446 --> 02:49:38,904
You hid it from your DJ too?
You didn't even tell me?

1350
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:42,450
Why? My child' why?

1351
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:50,183
Didn't l keep telling you' Anjali?
See' it's my little child!

1352
02:49:51,929 --> 02:49:56,525
lt's my child.
You have come back to me.

1353
02:50:06,243 --> 02:50:07,540
My child!

1354
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,657
Just coming!

1355
02:50:37,207 --> 02:50:38,504
Just coming!

1356
02:51:01,932 --> 02:51:03,365
Oh! Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?

1357
02:51:13,243 --> 02:51:15,006
Oh my God! ls this our table?

1358
02:51:15,245 --> 02:51:17,042
They do this all the time.
Look at this' Aunty'

1359
02:51:17,247 --> 02:51:19,715
They give the front seats to the
shining white army and seat us behind.

1360
02:51:19,917 --> 02:51:22,078
Why do they do it
always?... No... Aunty'

1361
02:51:22,386 --> 02:51:24,217
Where is that silly principle?

1362
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:31,955
She has arrived' the cunning vixen.

1363
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:39,228
ls she the Queen of England that
she's got the table in the front?

1364
02:51:45,275 --> 02:51:48,244
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...

1365
02:51:48,478 --> 02:51:50,036
hope your chair breaks to pieces.

1366
02:51:54,284 --> 02:51:56,047
Should we sit?

1367
02:52:03,293 --> 02:52:05,022
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.

1368
02:52:05,295 --> 02:52:07,525
Even last year at this function
you had created a ruckus!

1369
02:52:07,998 --> 02:52:10,466
Krishi is performing... Very nice...
what's the big deal?

1370
02:52:12,169 --> 02:52:14,399
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act ofyours!

1371
02:52:14,605 --> 02:52:16,197
Anjali' she's right!
- You keep quiet.

1372
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:19,204
My son's on stage...
l will at least whistle once.

1373
02:52:19,576 --> 02:52:21,544
No... No...
-Just one whistle...

1374
02:52:43,066 --> 02:52:47,560
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you' sweetoo!

1375
02:52:52,709 --> 02:52:54,233
God' Please protect my son.

1376
02:52:54,645 --> 02:52:56,977
Eh! Your son is just performing...
not fighting a war on the border.

1377
02:52:57,281 --> 02:52:59,249
Just see!
- Just see!

1378
02:53:04,988 --> 02:53:07,252
My son! My son!
- Even mine.

1379
02:53:10,294 --> 02:53:11,591
Now sing your' `Do Re Mi'.

1380
02:55:39,576 --> 02:55:41,203
Did you do this?

1381
02:56:04,601 --> 02:56:07,832
Now tell me something...
You must have been a little nervous?

1382
02:56:08,171 --> 02:56:10,969
l was a little nervous.
But someone said something to me...

1383
02:56:11,308 --> 02:56:12,969
and everything was alright.

1384
02:56:14,110 --> 02:56:16,169
What did the person say?
- Just a minute.

1385
02:56:18,215 --> 02:56:21,981
lfyou want to be someone in life...
ifyou want to achieve something...

1386
02:56:22,486 --> 02:56:24,920
lfyou want to win'always
listen to your hear.

1387
02:56:25,455 --> 02:56:27,184
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

1388
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:30,689
close your eyes and
think ofyour parents.

1389
02:56:31,628 --> 02:56:34,529
And then you will
cross all the hurdles...

1390
02:56:35,232 --> 02:56:38,201
all your problems will vanish'
victory will be yours...

1391
02:56:39,269 --> 02:56:40,566
only yours.

1392
02:56:44,641 --> 02:56:48,600
Who said this? Papa?
- No. He.

1393
02:57:19,209 --> 02:57:21,177
Did you take care ofmother?

1394
02:57:28,218 --> 02:57:30,186
Did you get selected
in the cricket team?

1395
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:42,892
How did you manage
to lose so much weight?

1396
02:57:51,541 --> 02:57:56,205
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

1397
02:57:56,613 --> 02:58:00,879
Come back home' Bhaiyya.
Please come back home.

1398
02:58:02,252 --> 02:58:04,220
Come back home' Bhaiyya.

1399
02:58:06,189 --> 02:58:08,020
Has Papa sent you?

1400
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:19,760
Rohan' now this is my family.

1401
02:58:21,538 --> 02:58:24,632
These are my people.
This is my world!

1402
02:58:29,946 --> 02:58:34,508
And the home you are talking about
was never mine in the first place...

1403
02:58:38,221 --> 02:58:40,189
and will never be.

1404
02:58:44,227 --> 02:58:46,855
You go back now... just go back.
You...

1405
02:58:49,232 --> 02:58:53,191
l have seen you again'
that's enough for me.

1406
02:58:54,571 --> 02:58:56,198
Go back.

1407
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:09,016
Do you know Bhaiyya'
you often said when l was a child

1408
02:59:11,588 --> 02:59:13,556
That mother loved you more than me.

1409
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:19,152
l never liked it then.

1410
02:59:21,564 --> 02:59:23,156
l used to get angry.

1411
02:59:26,636 --> 02:59:28,968
But today' l would like to tell you'
that you were right.

1412
02:59:32,208 --> 02:59:34,176
Mother loves you more than me.

1413
02:59:37,213 --> 02:59:42,173
She loves you too much.
And she will always.

1414
02:59:45,221 --> 02:59:48,190
She will always
- l know.

1415
02:59:54,330 --> 02:59:56,195
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.

1416
03:00:02,238 --> 03:00:04,001
He will never come back.

1417
03:00:09,245 --> 03:00:13,147
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.

1418
03:00:14,551 --> 03:00:16,519
l know my brother-in-law well.

1419
03:00:18,188 --> 03:00:20,486
Just get him to meet
mother and father.

1420
03:00:26,196 --> 03:00:28,164
Will you be able to do that?

1421
03:00:39,743 --> 03:00:42,576
You know' dad...
l had a strange dream last night.

1422
03:00:43,613 --> 03:00:46,173
l dreamt that you and Mom had come
to London to surprise me.

1423
03:00:47,617 --> 03:00:48,982
Then?
- What then' dad?

1424
03:00:49,219 --> 03:00:51,517
The alarm went off... l mean...

1425
03:00:52,222 --> 03:00:54,190
why would you and Mom come to
London to surprise me?

1426
03:01:00,396 --> 03:01:01,693
l'll speak to you later

1427
03:01:11,574 --> 03:01:13,201
The work's done.

1428
03:01:28,258 --> 03:01:30,089
Guess where we are.
- Where' dad?

1429
03:01:33,997 --> 03:01:37,023
ls it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and l don't turn it true.

1430
03:01:38,535 --> 03:01:40,628
Tell me where you are right now'
we want to meet you just now...

1431
03:01:42,272 --> 03:01:44,035
You are meeting me
after such a long time.

1432
03:01:45,508 --> 03:01:48,841
Present? Now...
at this time... here...

1433
03:01:49,179 --> 03:01:51,147
You meet me at 5 p.m. at
the Blue water Shopping mall.

1434
03:01:51,681 --> 03:01:53,649
But tell me what
you want' my child.

1435
03:01:54,017 --> 03:01:56,986
You will find what
l want right there' Dad.

1436
03:02:14,904 --> 03:02:16,337
What's happening here?
- l'm looking for the receipts.

1437
03:02:16,573 --> 03:02:18,541
What receipts?
- To return the clothes.

1438
03:02:18,908 --> 03:02:20,876
lfyou have to return them' why do you
buy them in the first place?

1439
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:24,007
The country best in the world
is our lndia... Right Mom?

1440
03:02:24,247 --> 03:02:25,214
Mother's stooge!

1441
03:02:30,587 --> 03:02:32,714
Did you tape that? That lndian serial'
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahu thi.

1442
03:02:33,156 --> 03:02:35,021
What a brilliant twist!
The son dies.

1443
03:02:35,258 --> 03:02:38,227
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.

1444
03:02:41,264 --> 03:02:43,232
What are you doing?
- lt's fine till the hugs

1445
03:02:43,499 --> 03:02:45,967
- but he keeps kissing me too.
- You have never kissed me so much.

1446
03:02:46,269 --> 03:02:48,237
Come home' darling... and see.

1447
03:07:20,510 --> 03:07:24,173
Lies! You lied to me.

1448
03:07:25,681 --> 03:07:28,172
Yes... l lied to you' Dad.

1449
03:07:29,552 --> 03:07:31,520
What would l have achieved even if
l had told truth.

1450
03:07:32,555 --> 03:07:34,182
l wouldn't be able to break
your ego.

1451
03:07:35,758 --> 03:07:37,726
What else is it ifnot ego' Dad?

1452
03:07:38,227 --> 03:07:41,287
That separates a mother from her child
that takes away...

1453
03:07:41,564 --> 03:07:44,795
a brother from his sibling...that
throws a father away from his son...?

1454
03:07:45,067 --> 03:07:48,525
He is not my son!
l don't believe that he is my son.

1455
03:07:49,472 --> 03:07:51,440
Has he fulfilled the duties
of a son? He didn't.

1456
03:07:52,575 --> 03:07:55,669
He did' Dad... he did.

1457
03:07:59,048 --> 03:08:00,811
He always fulfilled them.

1458
03:08:02,919 --> 03:08:07,219
He only made one mistake... Love.

1459
03:08:09,258 --> 03:08:11,818
lfthat is a crime according to
your law' so be it.

1460
03:08:13,596 --> 03:08:16,429
But isn't it your duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?

1461
03:08:20,002 --> 03:08:21,970
But you came down to punishing him.

1462
03:08:26,209 --> 03:08:28,177
What kind ofpunishment is this' Dad?

1463
03:08:32,215 --> 03:08:33,978
What punishment is this?

1464
03:08:41,390 --> 03:08:42,982
Just look into my eyes and say that...

1465
03:08:43,226 --> 03:08:45,194
you don't feel the pain
ofparting with him.

1466
03:08:47,129 --> 03:08:48,994
Say that you don't remember him.

1467
03:08:50,499 --> 03:08:52,194
Say that you don't love him.

1468
03:08:54,570 --> 03:08:57,300
Say it' Dad. Say it.

1469
03:08:57,940 --> 03:09:02,536
l don't love him.
l don't love him.

1470
03:09:03,779 --> 03:09:05,474
l said it' didn't l?

1471
03:09:19,462 --> 03:09:24,161
God has blessed you
with everything' Dad... Everything.

1472
03:09:27,803 --> 03:09:29,566
l just wish he had given you a heart!
- Shut up!

1473
03:09:31,107 --> 03:09:32,438
You irreverent child!

1474
03:09:40,216 --> 03:09:41,979
You love him.

1475
03:09:45,655 --> 03:09:49,182
You love him a lot.
You love him a lot.

1476
03:09:52,228 --> 03:09:58,189
l have got my answer.
You really love him.

1477
03:10:01,804 --> 03:10:03,465
Let's go back' Rahul.

1478
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:08,540
lt's too much now...
This is not our country.

1479
03:10:09,178 --> 03:10:13,638
These are not our people.
We have set up a house here...

1480
03:10:14,183 --> 03:10:17,152
but have you ever wondered
what kind of a home is this...

1481
03:10:19,188 --> 03:10:22,157
that doesn't have a mother's
warmth or a father's blessings?

1482
03:10:25,461 --> 03:10:29,158
Let's go back' Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...

1483
03:10:30,199 --> 03:10:35,637
They are right here.
They are elders.

1484
03:10:38,207 --> 03:10:42,769
They are a little angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.

1485
03:10:45,214 --> 03:10:49,173
Rahul... l know
they are as incomplete without us...

1486
03:10:50,219 --> 03:10:52,187
as we are without them.

1487
03:10:53,222 --> 03:10:56,191
We will ask for forgiveness' Rahul.
Let's go back.

1488
03:11:01,630 --> 03:11:03,461
You will never understand.

1489
03:11:07,970 --> 03:11:11,929
To turn a stranger into your own...

1490
03:11:12,575 --> 03:11:14,543
and then to turn him back
to a stranger...

1491
03:11:17,246 --> 03:11:19,214
you can never understand the pain.

1492
03:11:21,417 --> 03:11:24,386
l agree they are elders...

1493
03:11:27,256 --> 03:11:29,554
but even they don't have the right
to break a heart.

1494
03:11:33,262 --> 03:11:35,560
Even they don't have
a right to break a heart.

1495
03:11:58,421 --> 03:12:00,389
l think we should call him back.

1496
03:12:43,365 --> 03:12:48,029
Yash' lt was her last wish
to have Rahul...

1497
03:12:49,271 --> 03:12:52,468
Just wait for a while...l
know he will definitely come.

1498
03:12:54,443 --> 03:12:57,241
We don't need to wait
for anyone... Rohan.

1499
03:14:00,643 --> 03:14:02,611
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.

1500
03:14:06,282 --> 03:14:08,250
They are leaving tomorrow from here.

1501
03:14:10,586 --> 03:14:12,554
They haven't even come home.

1502
03:14:18,294 --> 03:14:19,591
lfyou say to them...

1503
03:14:38,514 --> 03:14:43,542
Do you know mother always
says that...

1504
03:14:45,254 --> 03:14:47,017
a husband is God.

1505
03:14:48,657 --> 03:14:52,616
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...

1506
03:14:53,562 --> 03:14:55,223
he is always right.

1507
03:14:56,932 --> 03:15:00,959
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.

1508
03:15:03,272 --> 03:15:11,179
We gave him lots of love... right.
He became a part of our family.

1509
03:15:14,483 --> 03:15:20,183
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!

1510
03:15:24,093 --> 03:15:28,996
Then... one day he left home
and went away.

1511
03:15:31,634 --> 03:15:32,601
Wrong

1512
03:15:35,237 --> 03:15:39,196
You let him leave... wrong

1513
03:15:42,244 --> 03:15:47,204
You separated a mother from
her child... wrong.

1514
03:15:50,586 --> 03:15:56,547
Our family shattered
to pieces... wrong.

1515
03:16:00,996 --> 03:16:03,226
Then how does a husband become God?

1516
03:16:08,337 --> 03:16:10,498
God can't do any wrong can he?

1517
03:16:16,545 --> 03:16:23,974
My husband is just a husband...
just a husband... Not God.

1518
03:16:29,024 --> 03:16:30,457
Not God.

1519
03:16:33,395 --> 03:16:34,692
Nandini!

1520
03:16:36,231 --> 03:16:41,794
l said it... Didn't l?
That's it!

1521
03:17:22,444 --> 03:17:24,412
Ever since the day you left'
Bhaiyya...

1522
03:17:25,380 --> 03:17:27,177
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.

1523
03:17:30,018 --> 03:17:31,178
He is the one who gave a mother...

1524
03:17:31,353 --> 03:17:33,651
the strength to stay away
from her son.

1525
03:17:36,225 --> 03:17:38,193
Please swear on Him' Bhaiyya...

1526
03:17:40,229 --> 03:17:42,197
that you will come home
at least once.

1527
03:17:44,166 --> 03:17:45,531
Just once' Bhaiyya.

1528
03:17:47,236 --> 03:17:51,730
Even if it is for a moment.
Even if it is for a day.

1529
03:17:54,409 --> 03:17:56,206
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that

1530
03:17:56,411 --> 03:17:58,379
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.

1531
03:18:00,249 --> 03:18:02,217
She is a part ofthe family.

1532
03:18:03,252 --> 03:18:05,345
At least let your shadow fall
on the photograph...

1533
03:18:05,587 --> 03:18:08,215
that has kept your memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.

1534
03:18:14,196 --> 03:18:19,156
Just once' Bhaiyya.
Then you can leave

1535
03:18:21,003 --> 03:18:25,167
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.

1536
03:18:30,312 --> 03:18:32,280
On the strength ofthat one memory...

1537
03:18:32,614 --> 03:18:37,347
that one moment...Mother
can lead her entire life.

1538
03:18:41,390 --> 03:18:43,585
Can't you do just this
much for mother?

1539
03:23:03,618 --> 03:23:05,916
You took my words so much to heart
that you went away.

1540
03:23:08,023 --> 03:23:12,790
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.

1541
03:23:14,663 --> 03:23:16,187
Didn't come back.

1542
03:23:18,033 --> 03:23:20,001
Where did you call
me back' Papa?

1543
03:23:23,638 --> 03:23:25,469
Did l have to call you back?

1544
03:23:26,641 --> 03:23:28,370
Am l not elder?
Do l have to call you back?

1545
03:23:28,610 --> 03:23:30,009
Am l not elder?

1546
03:23:32,314 --> 03:23:34,214
l thought you didn't love me.

1547
03:23:35,250 --> 03:23:37,115
l thought you didn't
think ofme as your son.

1548
03:23:37,419 --> 03:23:40,946
How could you think that?
How could you?

1549
03:23:42,724 --> 03:23:47,218
l brought you into this house for
the first time with these hands.

1550
03:23:49,264 --> 03:23:52,233
You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.

1551
03:23:54,002 --> 03:23:55,162
How did you think...?

1552
03:23:55,403 --> 03:23:59,237
l thought you didn't love me...
didn't love me.

1553
03:24:01,276 --> 03:24:05,576
l love you very much'
my son... love you very much.

1554
03:24:08,350 --> 03:24:14,186
Just...just couldn't say it.

1555
03:24:16,424 --> 03:24:21,191
ln these ten years l have thought
about you every moment every day.

1556
03:24:22,497 --> 03:24:26,456
l thought ofyou so much that'
l felt like embracing you and...

1557
03:24:26,701 --> 03:24:28,669
telling you how much l love you.

1558
03:24:34,242 --> 03:24:36,005
Just couldn't say it.

1559
03:24:40,248 --> 03:24:44,207
Elders' anger is a part of...
their love' my son.

1560
03:24:46,154 --> 03:24:49,954
You took it so much to heart that
you got angry and left home...?

1561
03:24:51,927 --> 03:24:53,895
And l didn't even call you back.

1562
03:24:55,597 --> 03:24:58,964
Why would you call me?
l should have come on my own.

1563
03:24:59,267 --> 03:25:01,633
Yes...
- l should have come on my own.

1564
03:25:03,538 --> 03:25:06,974
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you?

1565
03:25:07,542 --> 03:25:10,568
This is your home...
You are the elder son ofthe family...

1566
03:25:10,946 --> 03:25:12,914
You are my son... my son.

1567
03:25:16,384 --> 03:25:23,517
And now l have grown old my son.

1568
03:25:25,460 --> 03:25:27,189
l have grown old.

1569
03:25:30,332 --> 03:25:31,959
At least forgive me now.

1570
03:25:34,569 --> 03:25:39,700
At least forgive me
now... At least now.

1571
03:26:18,213 --> 03:26:20,181
Come here' son.

1572
03:26:29,557 --> 03:26:30,785
Son...

1573
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:37,190
At times the youngsters
in the house show the right...

1574
03:26:37,565 --> 03:26:39,533
path to the elders in the family.

1575
03:26:42,237 --> 03:26:46,196
l kept you away from your brother
for years.

1576
03:26:51,579 --> 03:26:55,538
Please forgive me if you can.

1577
03:26:56,985 --> 03:26:59,215
Forgive me... forgive me.
