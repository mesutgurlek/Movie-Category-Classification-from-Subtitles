1
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:32,977
Hello, there's--
There's a baby here.

2
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:38,520
There must be a mother. Hello!

3
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:40,994
There's a baby!

4
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,969
Help!

5
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:06,048
Hello? ls anybody here?

6
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,004
Miscarriage-prone female reproductive
system is merely an extension...

7
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:04,138
of the body's natural and necessary
instincts to reject foreign matter.

8
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:08,707
Just two drops. The body mistakenly
identifies the embryo...

9
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,809
as an unwanted foreign substance...

10
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:14,550
and creates antibodies
to fight and reject it.

11
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:18,560
From this equation comes
the idea for the drug, Expectane...

12
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,290
which acts to neutralize
the interfering antibodies...

13
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,992
and promote successful
embryo attachment.

14
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:27,734
Minnie here had
a history of miscarriages.

15
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:29,771
As a result of our treatments...

16
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,138
she's now in her
seventh month of pregnancy.

17
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,306
She takes 10 cc's of Expectane
three times a day.

18
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:56,058
- Hey, Keith.
- Good morning.

19
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:00,434
- Ned.
- Larry. Hey, big day.

20
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:03,199
- Are you nervous?
- F.D.A.? Piece of cake.

21
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:06,503
- Sign those plan documents, will ya?
- All right.

22
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,406
Hello, Louise.
Hello, everybody.

23
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,968
Mrs. Parrish is in one
for a second trimester sonogram.

24
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,174
You have an initial consultation
with the Lanzarottas...

25
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,183
and Mrs. Logan's here
for a final.

26
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,947
Okay. Bagel, please.
Thank you.

27
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,988
- Hello.
- Oh, Doctor.

28
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:23,048
- l'm ready to explode.
- Oh, not here, you're not.

29
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:28,119
- Perfect. Just one more month.
- Yes.

30
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:32,065
- Get new blood and urine samples.
- Blood and urine samples.

31
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:35,661
Dr. Hesse, good luck
with the F.D.A.

32
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,831
Luck is for the ill-prepared.

33
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,603
- Car's waiting out front.
- Thank you.

34
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,144
l had them check
the traffic reports.

35
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,873
And the big dweeb?

36
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,415
He and Mr. Banes will
meet you downtown. Good luck.

37
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:55,884
ln testing the drug on chimpanzees
with a history of miscarriages...

38
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,917
l found conclusively that in every
instance the side effects observed...

39
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:03,989
were consistent with the behavioral
and metabolic changes in subjects...

40
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:07,058
with normal
unmedicated pregnancies:

41
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:11,664
nausea, mood swings, appetite
fluctuation, irritability, morning--

42
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:16,178
Typical lambchop's-got-a-bun-in-the-oven
type behavior.

43
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:18,873
This drug works.

44
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:29,114
Madam Chairperson,
ladies and gentlemen...

45
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,659
we respectfully request
the Board's approval...

46
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:34,355
to carry on into
an invasive human protocol.

47
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,920
Thank you.

48
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,296
You got to let us try this
on real women.

49
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,131
Women in need. Our sisters.

50
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:44,604
- Our daughters--
- Dr. Arbogast.

51
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:46,971
lf you could see the couples
that come into my office.

52
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:50,604
- Their pain and frustration is genuine.
- Dr. Arbogast.

53
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,442
Ma'am?

54
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:56,713
This is an F.D.A. hearing,
not a telethon.

55
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,448
We have all
the information we need.

56
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:02,491
Thank you.

57
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:06,050
As director of Leland University's
Biotechnology Research Program...

58
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:09,962
l thank you on behalf of my esteemed
colleagues for your consideration.

59
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:12,762
Let's go, gentlemen.

60
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,004
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,643
That went pretty good, huh?

62
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,947
l'm sure
you'll be very comfortable here.

63
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,956
We have all the latest videocassettes,
the current magazines.

64
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:39,154
Uh, give it to Louise
when you're finished.

65
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,890
l'm sure you'll be
very comfortable.

66
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:45,832
Just relax and enjoy it.
That's the ticket.

67
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,331
Dr. Arbogast?

68
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:51,669
Your wife-- l'm sorry,
your ex-wife's in your office.

69
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,674
- She says she needs to talk to you.
- What?

70
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,835
- Yeah. ln there.
- ln--

71
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,311
You're doing great.
See you in a month. How ya doin'?

72
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:02,782
- Oh, hi.
- Angela, what are you doin' here?

73
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:07,380
Larry, l've got something
really important to talk to you about.

74
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,549
- You might wanna sit down.
- l'm busy, Angela.

75
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,217
l'm pregnant, Larry.

76
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:16,691
Really? Well, that's--

77
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,559
That's wonderful.

78
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:24,972
How long?

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,668
Oh, seven weeks,
give or take.

80
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:35,845
The Kelman wedding.
The night of the Kelman wedding.

81
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:42,021
- Yeah, that's the only time we did it--
- No.

82
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,059
He was in and out
of my life very quickly.

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,366
Not quickly enough, apparently.

84
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:57,602
- He who?
- lt's not important.

85
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:59,607
You sure it's not mine?

86
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,269
Larry, come on.
After all the years we tried...

87
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:04,835
l don't think it's going
to happen one night by accident.

88
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:08,975
Thought maybe one of mine could have
bribed his way in or something.

89
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,042
So, what do you want
from me, Angela?

90
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,089
l want you to be my doctor.

91
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,590
Thank you very much,
Angela, but l--

92
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,389
Even if l wanted to,
l couldn't. We're related.

93
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,021
- Not since the divorce.
- Dr. Arbogast.

94
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:25,931
- Dr. Arbogast.
- ln a minute!

95
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,231
No. That's final.

96
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:31,603
l'll ask Ned
if he's got any room.

97
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,608
lf there's anybody
better than me, it's Ned.

98
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:37,339
l'm sorry. Noah Banes is on one.
He says it's important.

99
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:40,610
Ned Sneller? Forget it.
He looks at me, Larry.

100
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:41,684
Banes. l'm on my way.

101
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:45,120
Banes. l'm on my way.

102
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,228
All right, gentlemen.
What seems to be the trouble?

103
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:59,460
They've jammed the lock.

104
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:02,629
Dr. Hesse?

105
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:09,338
Dr. Hesse?
This is totally unacceptable behavior.

106
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:12,676
- Open this door, now.
- l will miss you most of all.

107
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,675
Pop the hinges.

108
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:19,346
Banes. What's going on?

109
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:25,693
Dr. Arbogast, good news
and bad news, l'm afraid.

110
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:28,787
F.D.A. decision,
wicked bad news.

111
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,162
- They turned us down?
- l'm afraid so.

112
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,531
And the review board
has terminated your project.

113
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:36,537
l'm sorry, but you know, lab space
is tight, and money's even tighter.

114
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:39,130
- They canceled the project.
- Please, Banes.

115
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,473
l got 300 grand in this drug.
You got to cut me some slack.

116
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:46,173
Would that l could, but it's out
of my hands. Blame the review board.

117
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,273
You're head of the board.

118
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,909
Yes, l am.
Rock and a hard place.

119
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,272
So what's the good news?

120
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,939
Well--
l really hate to dance on your grave.

121
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,814
But l landed Dr. Diana Reddin
and her ovum cryogenics project.

122
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:06,844
l need you to be
extremely careful with this.

123
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:09,585
- Lady, if l hear that one more time--
- They're very fragile.

124
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,028
l've just got to set
the level for the incliners.

125
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,292
- Hey, don't touch that!
- You shouldn't be up there!

126
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,994
Stop! No!

127
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,861
Help me! Help me!
Help me now!

128
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,464
- Oh! My babies!
- Out of the way!

129
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:36,108
Thank you.
Thank you.

130
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,380
That's not necessary--

131
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,382
Get off me.

132
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,652
Sorry.

133
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,464
Thank you so very much.

134
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,023
Leave me alone.

135
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,467
- Dr. Reddin? Are you all right?
- Yes.

136
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,370
l'm fine. Thank you.

137
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,341
- No harm done.
- No.

138
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,312
Are they--

139
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:11,647
Okay, let me just check these.
Thank God.

140
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:15,817
They're all right.
They're all right.

141
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,826
Frozen eggs, huh?

142
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:22,092
Yes. l call it
the dairy section.

143
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:27,330
lf it weren't for
the lightning reflexes of--

144
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,337
Where is he? He's gone.

145
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,670
- Hesse!
- Dr. Hesse has left the building.

146
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:40,045
Wait. lt's his--
lt's his laboratory, isn't it?

147
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,778
- Was.
- You like it?

148
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:47,084
Yes. But l don't want
to displace anybody.

149
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,090
Oh, you won't be,
l promise.

150
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:53,720
Take the chimps back to the primate lab.
We won't be needing them anymore.

151
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,939
Where ya goin'?

152
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,946
l'm going back to Europe
to start over.

153
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,780
You're running out on me? l don't
believe this. What are you doin'?

154
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,342
We're partners.
You can't just up and leave.

155
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,413
We're not partners anymore. l have
no lab, no funding, no future here.

156
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,689
Wait a minute. What about all the people
you'd be leaving behind?

157
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:27,923
What about your girlfriend?
What's her name again?

158
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,125
- l don't have a girlfriend.
- You're better off.

159
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,134
How about your colleagues?

160
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:34,897
l happen to know for a fact...

161
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,134
that your skill and dedication
is an inspiration to everybody.

162
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,198
They'd be lost without you.

163
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,177
They will find someone else
to mimic over coffee in the lounge.

164
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:45,237
That's not true.
They don't do that.

165
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,805
- Come on.
- l'm not well liked.

166
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,682
- l like ya.
- No, you don't.

167
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,621
l talked to my guy at Lyndon
Pharmaceutical, that Canadian firm.

168
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,557
- Larry. Good-bye.
- They'll give us additional funding...

169
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,653
provided we find a volunteer
for an Expectane protocol.

170
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,857
Can't do the protocol
without F.D.A. approval.

171
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,923
We can if we don't
tell the F.D.A.

172
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,435
Are we going to let a bunch
of Washington bureaucrats...

173
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,164
stand in the way of progress?

174
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:12,230
What woman will take an unapproved
drug while she's pregnant?

175
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,299
Who says we need a woman?

176
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,847
What are you talking about?

177
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:22,874
The experiment wouldn't have
to identify the subject's sex.

178
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:26,115
Just the human tissue reactives.

179
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:28,623
Remember Moe?

180
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:31,819
The monkey?
He went five months to term.

181
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,831
- You mean to do the test on a man?
- Why not?

182
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,129
Are you allergic to anything?

183
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:42,535
To me? You're nuts.

184
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,263
Boarding pass.

185
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,866
- Boarding pass?
- l don't have a boarding pass.

186
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,970
Only ticketed passengers
with boarding passes beyond this point.

187
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,015
Hear me out!

188
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,913
Sir, l need your ticket.

189
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,318
- Gate 68B to Paris.
- Quick. Thank you very much.

190
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:08,494
Pardon me. Excuse me.

191
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:12,227
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

192
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:14,863
Oh, my God.

193
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,237
You wouldn't be pregnant pregnant.

194
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,574
Sort of a guest host situation.

195
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,046
We fertilize the egg.

196
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,583
We implant it in
the peritoneal cavity.

197
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,020
Dose it with Expectane.
Tiny thing, grain of rice.

198
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:38,026
You carry it the first trimester.
We get our data. Boom, it's over.

199
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,993
Four ''A.''
To your left.

200
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,297
51 ''F.''
All the way back.

201
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,066
l'm gonna just go--

202
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,575
l guess l was wrong
about you, Hesse.

203
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,077
l took you for a scientist.

204
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,705
- l am a scientist.
- Yeah?

205
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,442
Where's your vision?

206
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,815
Jenner infected himself
with smallpox to test his vaccine.

207
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,047
- That's Jenner.
- So why not you?

208
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,386
ls it possible?

209
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:13,485
Who knows?
Natural? So what?

210
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:17,795
Good science? You bet.

211
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,367
Come and claim your place
in the pantheon.

212
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,499
You're just trying
to manipulate me.

213
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,306
Yes, l am. So what?

214
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,972
Excuse me, sir. l'm gonna have
to ask you to take your seat.

215
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,573
Yeah, all right.
Just a second.

216
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,312
Look, cards on the table.

217
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,219
l don't like you
any more than you like me.

218
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,520
You got all the warmth
and charm of a walleyed pike.

219
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,424
lf we weren't partners--

220
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,895
But the point is,
we are partners.

221
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:55,301
We're on the verge
of something fantastic.

222
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,965
Something important.

223
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,306
l need you to carry it through
with me.

224
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:20,091
- This could really work.
- Yes, it could.

225
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:25,394
- Are you sure you can find an egg?
- No problem.

226
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,872
Okay, who's the lucky one?

227
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,581
''Junior''?

228
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,949
Okay, Junior, let's go for a ride.

229
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,670
God. Dr. Arbogast.

230
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:12,475
- Dr. Reddin, what are you doin' here?
- Where?

231
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:15,175
l don't know-- What?
Where am l?

232
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,913
Oh, the lab. Good. Excellent.

233
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,455
My lab. My lab.

234
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:25,289
So... what brings you here?

235
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,624
lt's like...

236
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,028
when a ball player gets traded...

237
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:34,467
and he goes out
into the ballpark.

238
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,972
He comes back and--
You know, just...

239
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,701
alone with his thoughts.

240
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:44,142
Just to memorize the turf...

241
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,646
the infield...

242
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:49,912
the angles of the light.

243
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,354
What?

244
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:01,228
-You got a piece of cheese.
- lt's from my sandwich.

245
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:05,323
So what are you doing in this lab?

246
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,803
- Oh, l'm-- Here, right over there.
- Oh, thanks.

247
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:13,500
Actually, l'm--
l see you kept Minnie and Moe.

248
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,975
- Oh, yes, Minnie and Moe.
- Kept them.

249
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,979
l could hardly turn out
an expectant mother, could l?

250
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:23,279
- No. Well, Alex will be very happy.
- Good.

251
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:27,583
'Cause l get the feeling that Dr. Hesse
blames me for the loss of his facility.

252
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:30,181
He did take it kind of hard.

253
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:35,423
l'd hate to see his work go unfinished
because of budget constraints.

254
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:39,160
Would you tell him that
l'd be more than happy to help out...

255
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:41,794
with lab time and materials,
even some space...

256
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,206
if-- l don't know what you think--
he might be amenable to sharing.

257
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:51,302
That would be
extremely generous...

258
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:54,439
and more helpful
than you can imagine.

259
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:57,849
So... is there a Mr. Dr. Reddin?

260
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,386
Who?

261
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,921
No.

262
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,853
Sorry.

263
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,434
Maybe we could
have dinner sometime.

264
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,970
- No.
- No.

265
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,771
- Your back?
- Yeah, back.

266
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,073
- So--
- You're off.

267
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,079
- Bye.
- Bye.

268
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:28,138
- Thanks for coming.
- Okay.

269
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:42,619
Way to go.

270
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,675
This is it.

271
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:03,878
Terrific motility.

272
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,217
- Excellent count.
- Let me see.

273
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,327
Strong swimmers. Big load.
Way to go.

274
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:24,267
2:45 a.m. Subject takes
15 cc's Expectane...

275
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:27,900
supplemented with
100 milligrams of progesterone...

276
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,944
two milligrams of estrogen.

277
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,773
Salud.

278
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,384
- So how's the Expectane taste?
- Bitter.

279
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:48,520
Well, we'll add some flavoring
when we market it.

280
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,792
Good idea.

281
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:55,962
All right. Let's find the spot.

282
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,340
All right, let's see.

283
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,274
Peritoneal cavity.

284
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,442
Let's see here.

285
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:16,584
That looks like a good,
clear window right there.

286
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:19,786
There's plenty of room to hold
the embryo through the first trimester.

287
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,557
- A little lower.
- Yeah.

288
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,962
- Right over here.
- That's it.

289
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,365
All right.

290
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,365
Let's put a bun in your oven.

291
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:38,378
Where did you get
the egg, by the way?

292
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,579
The egg?

293
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:46,175
Colleague of mine.
An anonymous harvest.

294
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:49,121
Had a couple of spares.
Just relax.

295
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,762
Here we go. Yeah.

296
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,831
Navigatin'.

297
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,806
Mama.

298
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:36,492
Larry? Larry!

299
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:40,193
What, what, what? Hi.

300
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,862
- Where am l?
- This is my house.

301
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:45,997
You're staying with me
during the protocol, remember?

302
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,008
Let's see how you are.

303
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:51,642
l forgot.

304
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,535
Here. Put that
under your tongue.

305
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:05,999
This your bedroom?

306
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,274
No, it's my ex-wife's bedroom.

307
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,747
Cheery, huh?

308
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:14,546
She decorated it herself.

309
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,452
She had taste. Give her that.

310
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,923
You had separate bedrooms?

311
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:25,687
No. We didn't always
have separate bedrooms.

312
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:32,563
Good. There are many stops
along the road to divorce.

313
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,668
Blood pressure's good.
Let's check this out.

314
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,167
Normal. Very good.

315
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,779
- l have to pee.
- l need that too. Here.

316
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,784
Fill 'er up.

317
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:55,114
We're gonna do the tests at 8:00 a.m.
and again at 10:00 p.m.

318
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,864
l got a prenatal monitor
and a blood screener ordered up.

319
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,199
Do you mind?
Can l have some privacy?

320
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,536
You know, it was really nice
of Dr. Reddin to let us share her lab.

321
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:13,771
l'll go there to analyze
and collate the fluid samples.

322
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:16,642
All right. Sounds good.

323
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,544
That should be enough.

324
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,113
All right now, this watch is set
to go off every four hours...

325
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,522
to remind you to
take the Expectane.

326
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,823
What do you think?
Six times a day should do it.

327
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,056
That should do it.

328
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,530
Let's see how we did.

329
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,845
l must be crazy
to be doing this.

330
00:25:55,853 --> 00:26:00,654
You may be crazy,
but you're also pregnant.

331
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,659
Congratulations.

332
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,666
l'm pregnant.

333
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:18,635
So embryo three is entering
its two-to-four stage.

334
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:22,406
Today we'll be extracting
an eight-cell cluster...

335
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,141
and freezing it...

336
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,180
for induced suspension
and development arrest.

337
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,483
- Dr. Hesse? Can l get you anything?
- l'm looking for any...

338
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:37,323
cryogenic disruption
to the D.N.A. footprints.

339
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:41,957
- He's fine.
- Good. Excellent.

340
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,733
- Let's get on with it, okay?
- What about this?

341
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:51,002
- Here to see the new mama!
- Oh, hi, Dr. Arbogast.

342
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:53,043
- Hi!
- Banana, they'll love it.

343
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,237
Mother and daughter are doing fine.

344
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:00,481
She's a pretty baby.
Oh, looks just like you.

345
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:03,413
Got your ears.

346
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:07,586
You like that?
You can eat it.

347
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,751
Don't you want to eat it? Yeah.

348
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,229
Hey, big guy, how they swingin'?

349
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,995
- What's the matter? You okay?
- Yeah.

350
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:20,226
What, what?

351
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:24,798
Look, my H.C.G. levels
aren't where they should be.

352
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,008
Let's up the hormone supplement
five milliliters.

353
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,140
How you feelin' otherwise?

354
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,647
l just can't keep
anything down.

355
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,521
That's morning sickness.
lt'll pass. Eat crackers.

356
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:43,185
My nipples are very sensitive.

357
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,251
What?

358
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:50,562
My nipples--
They feel like, kind of, tingling.

359
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,966
- Tingling like sore or like itchy?
- You surf?

360
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,264
Surf, 'cause l got that
a lot from paddling out.

361
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:01,539
lt's something about the wax
and the salt water. lt irritates them.

362
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,978
- You get what?
- His nipples are tingling.

363
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:06,881
- l don't surf.
- lt could be your laundry detergent.

364
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,216
l used to get that when
l used a non-biodegradable soap.

365
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:12,619
Thank you very much for your concern.
lt's very nice.

366
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,851
Or it could be
that polyester shirt.

367
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:18,827
l don't know how much more
of this l can handle.

368
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,763
You're doin' great. l talked
to my guy at Lyndon this morning.

369
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:24,596
They saw the initial data.
They are ecstatic.

370
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:28,729
l'm gonna meet with their C.E.O. at the
convention in San Francisco next month.

371
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,297
What? Cramps?

372
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,811
Come on. Get up.
Let's go walk it off. Let's go.

373
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,847
Let's go.

374
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,315
Look, l don't want to cut back
the hormones altogether.

375
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,950
lt'll jeopardize the protocol.
A tingle and tummy ache won't kill ya.

376
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,995
- Okay.
- Dr. Hesse!

377
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:54,030
- Boy, here she comes.
- Excuse me.

378
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:56,498
- Excuse me.
- Just what we need.

379
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,058
l know this is none of my business.

380
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:02,628
l can't help but notice
the lethargy, the nausea...

381
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,539
the little vials you keep
leaving in the wastepaper basket.

382
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,702
Yes?

383
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,440
Do you have
a substance abuse problem?

384
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:12,448
- What?
- No!

385
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:15,610
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
l was involved in a study...

386
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,883
in Oxford where it was categoric--

387
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:22,858
This is serious. l'm very concerned.

388
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:27,261
lt's been going on for nearly a month,
and l think he should see someone.

389
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,601
There is a tragic disease
that afflicts the men...

390
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,605
of his village in Austria.

391
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,234
They even named it after the place.

392
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,246
lt's called,
''Gelandensprung Syndrome.''

393
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,509
- Gelandensprung?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,517
- You've heard of it?
- No.

395
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:53,046
l'm not surprised. lt's endemic
to only a few places in all the world.

396
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:54,954
Well, what is it?

397
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:00,492
lt's a terrible, debilitating...

398
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,758
relentless, you know,
kind of--

399
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:05,490
Fatness.

400
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:07,759
- Fatness.
- Fatness?

401
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:12,566
Striking young men in their prime,
turning them into big...

402
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:16,164
- wheezing--
- Strudelhunds.

403
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,402
- Strudelhunds.
- Strudelhunds?

404
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:22,811
Pastry hounds.
Yeah, that's the...

405
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:24,974
insult that they hurl upon them.

406
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:30,450
l'm gonna go get you
some crackers, because...

407
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:33,548
it'll head off trouble
that's approaching.

408
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,957
He's gonna be all right.

409
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:38,689
- Banes!
- But you're not fat.

410
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:43,525
Oh, because l'm taking
a new formula.

411
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:47,936
l've only nine more weeks
of the protocol.

412
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:50,998
lt's funny how you don't appreciate
somebody until they're gone.

413
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:54,136
l'm not gone. You're gone.
What do you want to talk about?

414
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:56,874
lt's about our contract.
You got a couple of minutes?

415
00:30:56,948 --> 00:30:58,438
Not really.

416
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:00,417
l really need to talk to you.

417
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:05,256
l feel so humiliated.

418
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:09,783
Don't be. People get sick all the time.
There's no need to be ashamed.

419
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:14,122
l feel like l lost control
over my body.

420
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,431
Control's important
to you, isn't it?

421
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,939
What do you mean?

422
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:28,172
Same three shirts,
week in, week out.

423
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,305
Same coat peg,
same wash basin.

424
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:34,978
That odd little ritual with
the liverwurst and apple every day.

425
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,021
l like order.
What's wrong with that?

426
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:40,148
Nothing.
lt's just an observation.

427
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:44,423
And l don't like being sick.
ls there anything wrong with that?

428
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:48,728
No. lt's just that men--

429
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,703
-Men what?
-They're pathetic when it comes to pain.

430
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:57,538
You should try being a woman sometime.
lt's a nightmare.

431
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:01,136
Your body goes peculiar with your period
and doesn't stop until menopause.

432
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:04,306
lt's a lifetime
of leaking and swelling...

433
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,215
and spotting and smears.

434
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,482
Crippling cramps,
raging hormones, yeasts!

435
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,319
And that's if
everything's normal.

436
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,519
- l never wanted to be a woman.
- l'm just saying.

437
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:19,997
That's perfectly normal.
Not to worry.

438
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:24,058
Just stay off your feet. Use an ice pack
for a few minutes every hour...

439
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:26,194
and call me in the morning.

440
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:29,638
- Larry!
- No, it's okay. That's why l'm here.

441
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:32,336
- Lar!
- All right. Bye-bye.

442
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,708
Look at this.

443
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:41,010
Leave 'em alone.

444
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,954
- Don't snap at me.
- Angela, this is my house now.

445
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:49,619
Larry, you may live here. You may die
here, but this will always be my house.

446
00:32:49,694 --> 00:32:53,596
Floral, houndstooth,
then paisley.

447
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,536
Alex, Angela.
Angela, Alex.

448
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,798
Colleague of mine.

449
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:04,239
Nice to meet you--
God, excuse me.

450
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:06,903
Charmed.

451
00:33:06,978 --> 00:33:11,142
- l'm going upstairs to my bedroom.
- Yeah.

452
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,780
He's going through
a confusing time.

453
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:18,652
l'm letting him stay here
for a couple of weeks.

454
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:21,817
- So what do you want?
- l don't like Sneller.

455
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:24,794
Angela, we've been over this.

456
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:27,388
Ned Sneller is a top, top guy.

457
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,434
He's creepy, Larry.
l'm not goin' back to him.

458
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:32,436
- You're bein' ridiculous.
- No, l'm not.

459
00:33:32,504 --> 00:33:35,234
l can't deal with this.
Where's the goddamn father?

460
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,241
- l haven't been able to reach him.
- He disappeared?

461
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:42,268
They're touring. l don't know.
Europe, Asia? l can't remember which.

462
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,009
Who is?

463
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,476
Aerosmith.

464
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,319
One of Aerosmith
knocked you up?

465
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:57,088
What a lovely phrase, Larry.

466
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,824
Oh, excuse me.
l'm a little shocked here.

467
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:02,833
- You're gonna have to deal with it.
- l don't have to deal with it.

468
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:05,495
We're divorced. Remember?

469
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,006
lt's not like l'm asking you
to fix my car.

470
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:14,137
All right. Call Louise in the morning,
and she'll fit you in.

471
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:19,011
- Thank you.
- Angela.

472
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,610
l am happy for ya.

473
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:26,316
Thanks, Lar.

474
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:46,398
- What's the matter?
- She was daddy's little girl.

475
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,406
Don't the pictures of
your lifetime deserve Kodak film?

476
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:53,672
- Now he's giving her away.
- Come on.

477
00:35:53,745 --> 00:35:56,976
- Come on. Get a grip.
- Okay.

478
00:35:57,048 --> 00:36:00,984
Physically, you're in tiptop shape.
Everything's right on track.

479
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:03,612
- All right, one more week. That's it.
- Okay.

480
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,987
l'm sorry. l'm just not myself.

481
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:17,899
- Just relax. All right?
- Yeah.

482
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,301
Don't wait up for me tonight.
l'm gonna be late.

483
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,601
Why? Where are you going?

484
00:36:22,674 --> 00:36:27,236
To the pharmaceutical convention at
the Hyatt. l'm meeting the Lyndon guys.

485
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:31,942
- The convention is tonight?
- Yeah. l told you it was tonight.

486
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:35,144
Oh, Larry, please take me with you.

487
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,053
No. You stay home.

488
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:40,420
Get back in bed
and just take it easy.

489
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,015
You don't understand.

490
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:45,756
- l do understand. No!
- Please, listen to me.

491
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,095
- No. lt's bad for business.
- l'm pregnant and all alone.

492
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,358
Will you stop saying that?

493
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:53,768
You're not pregnant pregnant.

494
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,102
You got to think of this
as an experiment.

495
00:36:56,174 --> 00:37:00,702
Think of it like you swallowed
a piece of gum. A tiny piece. Dentyne.

496
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:03,645
Look, l won't be in your way.

497
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:08,652
l'll take walks. l'll disappear.
Please, l feel so isolated.

498
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:12,951
Oh, all right.
Okay, you can come.

499
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:15,557
But don't do that thing
with your eyes.

500
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,487
- l can come?
- Yeah.

501
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,188
Oh, Larry.
But l have nothing to wear.

502
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:25,825
Oh, l'm starting
to get a little headache over here.

503
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:45,179
l feel we could make
a definite contribution here.

504
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,187
Sounds good.

505
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:49,985
Excellent. And you got
to remember that we're talking...

506
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:54,154
about five million prescriptions a year
in the United States minimum.

507
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,220
What's the window on
these human experiments results?

508
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:59,825
Between you and l, l would say,
definite results within a week.

509
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:01,960
- That fast?
- Yes.

510
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:04,767
- We are very impressed. Keep us posted.
- Thank you.

511
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:08,741
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Yes!

512
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,576
- lnteresting pitch, Larry.
- Banes. What are you doing here?

513
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:15,844
You know me. l like to keep
my ear to the ground.

514
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,977
You know, of course,
that human experimentation...

515
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:22,717
is against university
and F.D.A. guidelines.

516
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,726
l'm just trying to raise
a little awareness and some new money...

517
00:38:25,794 --> 00:38:28,160
telling people we're further along
than we really are.

518
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:30,493
ls there a woman out there
taking Expectane?

519
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:33,090
Absolutely not.

520
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,068
Larry! Noah! Hi!

521
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:39,197
- Where have you been?
- l had so much fun.

522
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:42,471
l had a walk and then the most
wonderful massage in a health club.

523
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:46,071
l had a great time. Then l took
a nap right there on the table.

524
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:49,548
Franks in blankets?
Oh, these are my favorites.

525
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,086
Alex, you look...

526
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:55,345
radiant.

527
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:58,153
- Thank you.
- We should be going. Let's go.

528
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:00,091
- Want some franks in the blankets?
- No.

529
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,896
- l'm so sorry.
- No, no, l'm sorry.

530
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:09,903
lt's a wonder
the woman is still alive.

531
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:13,907
She looks so beautiful tonight,
don't you think so?

532
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:16,808
l got it. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

533
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:19,972
- Where have you been?
- Hello, Dr. Arbogast.

534
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:22,448
- Long line for the loo.
- Hors d'oeuvres?

535
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:25,577
Sausage rolls.
Thank you. l love these.

536
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,815
These are my favorites.

537
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:34,457
You look so--

538
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,955
l don't know. Enthusiastic.

539
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:42,003
Yes, you do. You look positively lit up.
What's the good news?

540
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,200
- No good news!
- Life, music and friends.

541
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:48,970
- Franks in the blankets. l love it.
- l think we should be going.

542
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:51,205
Let's go.
We should go.

543
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:54,544
Going, going, always going...

544
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:56,584
and one day, gone.

545
00:39:56,651 --> 00:40:00,712
Poof... just like that.

546
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:06,318
When we should be pausing to hear
the joyful melody of life itself.

547
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:12,194
He doesn't get out much.

548
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:17,499
Neither do l.

549
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:22,305
l've got you

550
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:25,039
Under my skin

551
00:40:26,614 --> 00:40:29,082
- l always loved this song.
- Oh, no.

552
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,710
Would you like to dance?

553
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:36,613
l don't know how.

554
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:39,216
l've never danced before either.

555
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:42,195
- Then, l think we should give it a try.
- Good.

556
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:46,529
- Could you hold this? Thank you.
- Thank you.

557
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,967
Where you goin'?

558
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:52,495
l've got you

559
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:57,011
Under my skin

560
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:02,946
l tried so

561
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:07,954
Not to give in

562
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:11,082
l said to myself

563
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,061
This affair never will go

564
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,725
So well

565
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,100
But why should l try to resist

566
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:28,575
When, darling l know so well

567
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:31,578
l've got you

568
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:33,739
Okay?

569
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:36,079
- All right.
- Under my skin

570
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:43,856
l'd sacrifice anything
come what might

571
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:47,656
For the sake of having you near

572
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,324
ln spite of a warning voice

573
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,959
That comes in the night

574
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:58,404
And repeats and repeats in my ear

575
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:02,637
Don't you know, little fool

576
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,113
You never can win

577
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:13,844
Use your mentality

578
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:18,359
Wake up to reality

579
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:23,864
But each time l do
just the thought of you

580
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:25,957
Makes me stop

581
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:32,801
Before l begin

582
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:37,641
- Excuse me. l found it.
- 'Cause l've got you

583
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:42,979
- Under my skin
- Thank you.

584
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:47,852
Under my skin

585
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:52,825
Under my skin

586
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,203
Prince Charming,
the coach is leaving.

587
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:10,273
Right. Yes.

588
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:12,973
Thank you.
l enjoyed that very much.

589
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:17,541
l loved it. Let's do it again.
Good night.

590
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:20,588
Now, what is takin' so long?
They lost it, l know.

591
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:22,646
What good is havin' a ticket?

592
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:30,263
What are you doin'?
What are you-- Come over here.

593
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:33,732
- What are you doing?
- Feel how soft my skin is.

594
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:37,965
lt's time.
We're closin' out the experiment.

595
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:39,734
Banes is sniffin' around...

596
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:42,776
and your hormone surges
are gettin' out of control.

597
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:45,472
But there's still a week left
until the trimester is over.

598
00:43:45,546 --> 00:43:48,242
We have plenty of data.
The Lyndon guys are poised.

599
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:50,580
l don't wanna risk
anything goin' wrong.

600
00:43:52,453 --> 00:43:54,250
Come on.

601
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:01,118
What?

602
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:06,381
l can't help but wonder
what it would be like.

603
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,392
What what would be like?

604
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,951
To have my baby.

605
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:15,260
That's it. We're closin' out
the experiment tonight.

606
00:44:15,332 --> 00:44:19,029
Now. Get in the car. Come on.

607
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:22,664
''To have my baby.''
''Feel how soft my skin is.''

608
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:26,072
Where'd you go, to France
to get the car or somethin'?

609
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:30,477
- l never realized how lonely l was.
- Get a dog!

610
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,621
What are you so gloomy about?
Come on. The experiment worked.

611
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:02,335
With Moe, l tapered off
the dosage gradually.

612
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:05,870
To aid his system
with the hormonal rebalancing.

613
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:08,474
No. You go cold turkey.

614
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:12,420
You may have a couple of rocky days, but
l don't want to risk any complications.

615
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,017
Just stop taking the Expectane.
The embryo will break down...

616
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:20,154
and be reabsorbed
naturally into your body.

617
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,494
Home sweet home.

618
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:39,647
So, l'll get all the data
over to the guys at Lyndon.

619
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:44,983
And l'll be in touch with you
as soon as l hear anything, okay?

620
00:45:45,055 --> 00:45:46,989
Okay.

621
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:53,495
- lf you have any reaction, call me.
- Sure.

622
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,431
All right. So--

623
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:52,648
l don't know if
you're a boy or a girl...

624
00:46:52,723 --> 00:46:55,453
so l'll call you Junior.

625
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:44,271
Happy birthday to you

626
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:47,276
Happy birthday to you

627
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:50,472
Happy birthday
dear Alex

628
00:47:50,547 --> 00:47:53,846
Happy birthday to you

629
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:59,055
What a surprise.
How did you know?

630
00:47:59,122 --> 00:48:01,784
- We looked it up in your file.
- Did you bake this?

631
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:04,850
- Stop that. Really.
- Did you bake this yourself?

632
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:07,453
- The ingredients mutated a bit.
- Happy birthday, big guy.

633
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:12,059
All right!

634
00:48:12,135 --> 00:48:15,730
Alex, you're sweating like
a racehorse. You all right?

635
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,104
- lt's hot in here.
- No, it's not.

636
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,202
- l'm really hot.
- What? You got a fever?

637
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,804
l did not forget the ice cream.

638
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:34,246
You think you're the first clown
who ever woke up one day and said...

639
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:35,985
''l'm bored.
l think l'll have a kid.''

640
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:39,051
l didn't say that.
Why are you being so negative?

641
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:42,724
Hello? Anybody home?
You're a guy, Alex.

642
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:46,462
This is totally against the
natural order. Guys do not have babies.

643
00:48:46,536 --> 00:48:49,596
We leave that to the women. That's part
of the beauty of bein' a guy.

644
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:51,903
Didn't your father
ever have this talk with you?

645
00:48:51,975 --> 00:48:55,103
lf you don't want to help me, say so.
l don't need a lecture.

646
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:56,805
The hell you don't.

647
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,678
lf you could feel for one minute the
sense of absolute joy and connection...

648
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,378
that carrying your baby brings,
you would understand.

649
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:06,616
Listen to you. Have you lost it
completely? Now, come inside.

650
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,420
lf l carry this baby to term,
it will be a miracle.

651
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:10,653
Shut up!

652
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:13,560
l would love, protect and nurture
that miracle with everything l've got.

653
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,791
- Stop it!
- No! l want my baby!

654
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:25,264
Sorry l'm late.

655
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:28,004
We'll just be a couple of minutes,
then l'm ready.

656
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:31,013
Dr. Arbogast, your ex-wife's inside.
You're late for her appointment.

657
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:33,515
- Hello, Dr. Hesse.
- Come here, sit down.

658
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:36,381
- l don't want to sit around here.
- Sit down!

659
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,080
Right here.

660
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,783
There's nothin' to be afraid of.

661
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,988
He thinks he's pregnant.
lt's a very fascinating case.

662
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:50,055
l'm workin' in conjunction with
the university's psychiatric center.

663
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:53,330
Auto-physiological suggestion.

664
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,337
- What's goin' on?
- Get in here.

665
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:09,748
- How ya doin'?
- How are ya? Nice to see ya.

666
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,845
- Oh, you're lookin' good.
- Thanks.

667
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:13,947
- Okay, you can go.
- That's it?

668
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:16,151
That's it.
Something very important came up.

669
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:19,855
- Larry, l'm important.
- You are. Very.

670
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,195
But this is urgent. Just get dressed
and we'll reschedule. Sorry.

671
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:25,757
So, how far along are you?

672
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:27,895
Twenty-one weeks.

673
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,701
- ls this your first?
- Yes.

674
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:36,603
Have you thought
of any names?

675
00:50:38,315 --> 00:50:40,545
Junior if it is a boy.

676
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:47,046
And if it's a girl... Junior.

677
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:49,353
Oh, those are nice.

678
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:53,556
- So, how about you?
- Alex.

679
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:56,689
Excuse me.

680
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:00,065
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

681
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:06,610
- Junior would be good.
- Junior's good.

682
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:11,138
There's the feet... and the hands.

683
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:13,548
This can't be happening.

684
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,417
But it is.

685
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:19,651
Oh, look, that
little string of pearls.

686
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:22,694
- That's the spine.
- That's the spine, yeah.

687
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:28,464
There's the head.

688
00:51:33,972 --> 00:51:36,133
My baby.

689
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,676
Listen to this.

690
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:45,883
That's the heartbeat.

691
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:50,786
- That's very fast.
- 140 beats a minute.

692
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,687
Perfectly normal.

693
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:59,957
ln fact, everything's
perfectly normal.

694
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:03,968
Except for the fact that
the mom is also the dad.

695
00:52:06,872 --> 00:52:10,364
lf this gets out, your life is over.
You're a freak.

696
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:13,172
My license?
Kiss it good-bye.

697
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:18,046
lt's not gonna get out.
l know this is unfair to you.

698
00:52:18,116 --> 00:52:22,576
And it's dangerous for both of us,
but l want my baby.

699
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:26,780
And l need your help.

700
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:32,121
Okay, but you got to move
back in with me.

701
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:34,392
l want you off your feet
as much as possible.

702
00:52:34,466 --> 00:52:36,957
- And no goin' to the lab.
- But--

703
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:40,471
No buts about it.
You're in for a lot of sacrifices.

704
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:44,737
- You better get used to that.
- Okay.

705
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,301
Okay.

706
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:52,311
So, otherwise, how you feelin'?

707
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:57,287
Anything unusual? Jesus,
what the heck am l talkin' about?

708
00:52:57,356 --> 00:52:59,483
''Anything unusual?''

709
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:02,459
l've noticed that the side effects
of pregnancy are greatly amplified...

710
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,519
with the dosage of Expectane
that l've required.

711
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:09,124
The morning sickness,
the mood swings.

712
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:12,261
- Sleepiness, sexual appetite.
- Sexual appetite?

713
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:18,535
Yesterday, just scooping the middle
out of a honeydew melon gave me a--

714
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,670
- A steifen.
- A what?

715
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:26,582
Oh. That's normal.
l get 'em all the time.

716
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:32,118
- Here we go.
- lt's nice to be back.

717
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:36,718
Yeah. lt's going
to be a lot of fun.

718
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:39,696
- Do l have the same room again?
- You betcha.

719
00:53:39,765 --> 00:53:43,667
What do you want to do tonight?
Should we stay in or go out for dinner?

720
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:49,070
Didn't l close down
the Expectane project six months ago?

721
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:51,075
Yes, sir.

722
00:53:51,143 --> 00:53:53,907
Then why would Diana Reddin's account
show continuing requisitions...

723
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:56,675
for Expectane components?

724
00:53:56,748 --> 00:54:00,377
ls she up to something
with Arbogast and Hesse?

725
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:03,886
l don't know, sir.

726
00:54:05,257 --> 00:54:07,191
Larry, l'm not whining.

727
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:12,193
lt's just that you said
you'd be home no later than 6:00.

728
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:17,930
lt's 6:45. The pasta is ready.
ln five minutes, they'll be soft.

729
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:19,994
Well, fine, then come home
whenever you want!

730
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:23,434
Selfish.

731
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:33,841
- Diana. Hi.
- Yes, it's me. Hello.

732
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:38,652
Someone gave me these papers
for you from the lab.

733
00:54:38,724 --> 00:54:41,090
Thank you. Who?

734
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:45,696
Who?

735
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:55,705
l'm lying. l'm--

736
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:59,308
l just-- Actually,
l just wanted to see you.

737
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:01,208
You did?

738
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,540
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

739
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:06,607
l'm sorry l lied.

740
00:55:06,685 --> 00:55:09,176
Oh, what a lovely room!

741
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:14,618
Very nice of Dr. Arbogast
to put you up.

742
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:19,591
- lt is.
- Nice man.

743
00:55:20,899 --> 00:55:23,299
How are you?
How are you feeling?

744
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:25,666
Good. Thank you. And you?

745
00:55:27,372 --> 00:55:29,806
Good. Cooking?

746
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:33,811
- Yes.
- Smells very nice.

747
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,741
You want to sit down?

748
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,646
Please.

749
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:42,447
Alex, do you believe
in reincarnation...

750
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:45,888
past lives or...
anything like that?

751
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:49,993
- No.
- No, neither do l, so it can't be that.

752
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:51,551
Can't be what?

753
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,566
l have this strong
recurring feeling that l know you.

754
00:55:55,634 --> 00:55:59,934
- You do know me.
- Yes. l know.

755
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:02,701
No, but l mean...

756
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:06,335
l mean from before,
somehow, from earlier.

757
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:09,869
l can't--
l was born in Jakarta.

758
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:14,351
And raised in England,
from the age of five in Kent...

759
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:17,445
and summers in Cornwall.

760
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:20,514
What are you looking at?

761
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:27,230
l was-- l was born in Austria
in Gelandensprung.

762
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:29,267
- Home to the strudelhunds.
- Yes.

763
00:56:30,769 --> 00:56:33,329
Well, l've never--

764
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:37,239
l've never actually
been to Gelandensprung.

765
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:40,107
Salzburg, once.

766
00:56:40,178 --> 00:56:43,079
Delicious chocolates.

767
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,343
Good-looking waiters.

768
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:49,951
- Alex.
- Yes?

769
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:51,682
You're twitching.

770
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:54,989
What's the matter?

771
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:03,734
- Does my body disgust you?
- What?

772
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:07,795
My body.
ls it disgusting?

773
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:11,309
No. No.

774
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,435
No. What wou-- Oh!

775
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:16,639
No! No, l mean,
l-l-l like...

776
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:19,115
upholstery on a man.

777
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:22,551
ln fact, l was madly in love
with my cousin, Trevor, for years...

778
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:25,454
and he was very portly.

779
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:28,117
Maybe it's physical.

780
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:33,420
- This connection.
- Yes. No, it is, definitely physical.

781
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:37,730
Out of the blue, l get these sudden,
these pangs of concern for your--

782
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:39,463
for your well--

783
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:46,473
You mean... sex?

784
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:48,512
Yes.

785
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:53,407
l hadn't thought of that.

786
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:55,749
l have.

787
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:58,680
Have you?

788
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:01,487
Yes.

789
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,426
Well, then, that's, uh--

790
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:07,431
- That's probably it then, isn't it?
- Yes.

791
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:11,315
Yes.

792
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:17,614
No, wait.
Wait. lf l--

793
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:21,081
Hello? Lar?

794
00:58:21,158 --> 00:58:24,150
l let myself in.

795
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:31,730
- Where's Larry?
- He's out.

796
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:34,100
Found it. Found it.
There we go. lt's in.

797
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:38,301
Contact lens.
Just flipped out, right over the sofa.

798
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:41,833
- Who's that?
- Dr. Diana Reddin. Nice to meet you.

799
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:44,210
Going now. Bye.
Good, you were right.

800
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:46,772
- Very good. Bye.
- Wait, Diana.

801
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,784
- Yes?
- l have my own bedroom.

802
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:51,320
l'd love to see it sometime.

803
00:58:51,388 --> 00:58:54,323
l can't stay.
l have to go.

804
00:58:58,228 --> 00:59:00,526
Sorry.
Got it. Got it.

805
00:59:10,507 --> 00:59:12,998
Do you ever think about
calling before you come over?

806
00:59:13,077 --> 00:59:15,272
l'm sorry if l interrupted.

807
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,448
Man, what is that great smell?

808
00:59:20,517 --> 00:59:22,451
l'm cooking.

809
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,419
You're cooking?

810
00:59:24,488 --> 00:59:26,979
- What?
- Pasta.

811
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:30,254
- You want some more Rocky Road?
- Oh, yeah.

812
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:34,757
So, Diana. She seems
like a very nice person.

813
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:38,461
Definitely a little nervous, but nice.

814
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:41,197
You think it's serious?

815
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:45,367
Well, l'm in a particularly
vulnerable stage in my life right now...

816
00:59:45,442 --> 00:59:48,605
- so l'm taking it slowly.
- That's very smart.

817
00:59:51,248 --> 00:59:53,216
Can l have more
of those ribs?

818
00:59:53,283 --> 00:59:55,717
How about you and the father?

819
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:58,118
l haven't heard from him
since it happened.

820
00:59:58,188 --> 00:59:59,348
Bastard.

821
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:03,223
l never expected to hear from him.

822
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:06,160
l'm happy.
l love being pregnant.

823
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,722
lt's just that l'm not 21 anymore.
l'm single.

824
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,530
- lt's a little bit scary.
- Tell me about it.

825
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:16,836
l love those pickles.

826
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,032
There's a couple of chicken wings left.

827
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:29,419
What?

828
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:34,287
Anybody ever tell you
that you eat like a pregnant woman?

829
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:40,993
l just like mixing cuisines.

830
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:49,072
Baby pushed.

831
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:51,073
Yes.

832
01:00:52,743 --> 01:00:55,803
What's wrong with you?

833
01:00:55,879 --> 01:00:57,540
Sympathy pains.

834
01:00:57,614 --> 01:01:02,642
l hardly know you.
You must be a very sympathetic guy.

835
01:01:04,354 --> 01:01:06,584
Lately, yes.

836
01:01:09,693 --> 01:01:12,491
- l think she really likes me.
- Oh, yeah?

837
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:14,554
What makes you say that?

838
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:18,465
Well, she said she likes
a little upholstery on a guy.

839
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:22,266
And she kissed me.

840
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:25,672
You're kissing?
Wait a minute, Alex.

841
01:01:25,742 --> 01:01:28,336
You're in no condition
to start a relationship.

842
01:01:28,412 --> 01:01:31,745
- Don't be so negative.
- What do you mean, negative?

843
01:01:31,815 --> 01:01:35,307
Wait a minute.
l'm not negative.

844
01:01:36,086 --> 01:01:38,919
So, what do ya think?

845
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:42,049
Couldn't find one
with a parrot on it?

846
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:44,685
lt's nice. lt's nice.

847
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:48,891
You know, Larry,
l'm starting to believe in fate.

848
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,233
My baby,
finding a compatible woman.

849
01:01:53,303 --> 01:01:55,897
l think it's all part of a design.

850
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:58,669
Maybe l should
see a psychic.

851
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:01,472
Psychiatrist.
We should both see him.

852
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,414
l hate my body.

853
01:02:05,482 --> 01:02:08,747
Looking prosperous there.

854
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:12,346
- The pants are loose in the waist.
- l could take them in.

855
01:02:12,422 --> 01:02:15,357
Better leave room to grow.

856
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:17,950
- That's a good idea.
- That's the spirit!

857
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:20,053
- l'll cuff 'em for you.
- Okay.

858
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,026
- What?
- Junior kicked again.

859
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:29,201
- Junior?
- Yeah.

860
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:33,073
- Why Junior?
- The book says to talk to the baby.

861
01:02:33,143 --> 01:02:36,909
l didn't know if it's going to be a boy
or a girl, so l just called it Junior.

862
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,470
Why?

863
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:42,883
- Well, nothing. l was--
- lt's something. You have that look.

864
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:46,445
No, the guy l got the egg from,
he called it Junior.

865
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:49,822
He was makin' a joke, you know,
just a funny coincidence.

866
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:53,727
Who is that guy? You said a colleague
of yours had an anonymous harvest.

867
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:55,890
- Yeah, a colleague of mine.
- Do l know him?

868
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:58,059
Nah, you don't know him.

869
01:02:58,135 --> 01:03:01,434
- Do we know about the donor egg?
- No, it's anonymous.

870
01:03:01,505 --> 01:03:03,496
Well, well, how very domestic.

871
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:06,771
All that's missing is the
pitter-patter of little feet.

872
01:03:06,843 --> 01:03:09,812
Banes. Forgotten, but not gone.

873
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,577
- What the hell do you want?
- l couldn't help overhearing you.

874
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,709
Something about a donor egg?

875
01:03:15,786 --> 01:03:18,983
- l don't know what you mean.
- Come on, guys, it's me, Noah.

876
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:21,149
l'm nobody's fool.

877
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:23,055
l checked with the primate lab.

878
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:25,287
They told me the chimps
haven't been tested on...

879
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:28,058
since the project
was terminated.

880
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:31,623
But you're still
producing Expectane.

881
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:36,696
Well, the truth is that...

882
01:03:36,773 --> 01:03:40,641
- we had a surplus of the steroid base.
- Surplus.

883
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:43,305
Rather than
let it go to waste...

884
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,712
- we decided to--
- We decided to...

885
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:48,580
- finish off the production run,
- That's it.

886
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:53,885
stockpile the Expectane for when
the F.D.A. does approve clinical trials.

887
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:58,826
We were unaware of the university
policy, so that's why the little fib.

888
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:02,422
lf there are any budget overruns,
we're more than happy--

889
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:05,468
- Absolutely. Cover them.
- Excuse me.

890
01:04:09,606 --> 01:04:11,801
Yeah.

891
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:14,605
- What's that all about?
- l don't know.

892
01:04:14,678 --> 01:04:17,408
- What are you doin', writin' a book?
- You know what l think?

893
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:19,142
l think you two cowboys have...

894
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:22,447
an Expectane-assisted pregnancy
underway here in this house.

895
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:26,387
- Sorry, you're wrong.
- Oh, that hardly ever happens.

896
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:28,481
Listen, Larry, l'm on your side.

897
01:04:28,558 --> 01:04:31,994
lf you guys are coloring
outside the lines, l can help.

898
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:35,657
Look, Banes,
l'm speaking English.

899
01:04:35,732 --> 01:04:38,565
There's nothin' goin' on!

900
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:41,570
How can l help you if you
leave me outside the loop?

901
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:45,464
Thanks for stoppin' by.

902
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,803
Okay.

903
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:52,178
Listen, could l use
your bathroom before l go?

904
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:57,543
Yeah. lt's down the hall.
Make a right. Pick up the seat.

905
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:17,267
- ls he gone?
- No, he's in the can.

906
01:05:25,682 --> 01:05:30,676
Where are you? Come out, little mother.

907
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:52,331
- You think he believed us?
- l don't know.

908
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:56,345
This guy's dangerous.
Stay away from him.

909
01:05:57,781 --> 01:05:59,442
l will. Here.

910
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:09,692
- l'm taking Diana out to dinner.
- Great.

911
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,955
Who is that?

912
01:06:12,028 --> 01:06:14,724
Aerosmith.

913
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:16,425
You don't like their music?

914
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:20,569
Seven years,
l tried everything.

915
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:23,231
l couldn't get Angela pregnant.

916
01:06:23,306 --> 01:06:28,801
One of these clowns, one night,
one shot, mission accomplished.

917
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:34,983
Just ain't fair.

918
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,713
- Which one?
- l don't know.

919
01:06:39,456 --> 01:06:41,651
Doesn't matter.

920
01:06:43,994 --> 01:06:46,326
You still love her.

921
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:49,160
Ah, no, it's good it's over.

922
01:06:49,232 --> 01:06:52,690
lt's just this baby thing
has got me a little, you know--

923
01:06:52,769 --> 01:06:55,067
l'm having some feelings,
you know. That's all.

924
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:01,569
- l'm sorry, Larry.
- Yeah. Thanks.

925
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:05,638
- Well, you look... good.
- Thank you.

926
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,358
Hi, Angela.

927
01:07:18,261 --> 01:07:20,729
Hey, Alex.
ls he home?

928
01:07:20,797 --> 01:07:22,492
- Yes.
- ls he alone?

929
01:07:22,566 --> 01:07:26,400
-Very. He will be very happy to see you.
-Yeah, l'll bet.

930
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,309
l'm really very sorry.

931
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:39,911
l'm just a bit confused
about this strudelhund thing.

932
01:07:39,987 --> 01:07:42,979
- Excuse me. l believe this is yours.
- Yes?

933
01:07:43,057 --> 01:07:45,617
Oh, it is. Thank you.

934
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:50,130
Sorry. Thanks very much.
Got it. Safe and sound.

935
01:07:50,198 --> 01:07:54,032
Yes, the strudelhund thing.
No one's ever heard of it...

936
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,696
and then l looked up Gelandensprung
in my atlas and it wasn't there.

937
01:07:57,772 --> 01:07:59,330
So--

938
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,738
You're right.

939
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:09,749
There's no Gelandensprung.
There's no strudelhunds.

940
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:13,150
l'm sorry l had
to deceive you.

941
01:08:13,221 --> 01:08:15,155
Well, what's goin' on?

942
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:20,183
l want you to know
everything about me.

943
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:23,923
Likewise.

944
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:27,092
Can you keep an open mind?
l mean, really wide open?

945
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:30,262
l think so, yes.

946
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:33,398
l have a most
extraordinary condition.

947
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:38,844
Thank you. You familiar
with the works of Edward Jenner?

948
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:41,507
The vaccination chap
who experimented on himself?

949
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:42,742
That's right.

950
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:46,947
Now, probably you would never...
experiment on yourself--

951
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:51,617
No, l have actually. l mean, nothing
so extraordinary as Jenner, obviously...

952
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:53,523
but l--

953
01:08:54,295 --> 01:08:59,858
l used my cryogenic technique
to freeze one of my own eggs.

954
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:02,993
You did? Why?

955
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:05,732
Well...

956
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:09,071
l've always wanted children
and l--

957
01:09:09,143 --> 01:09:12,374
l never found the person
that l want to--

958
01:09:12,446 --> 01:09:15,244
you know--

959
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:20,185
l'm not getting younger, so l thought,
well, l'll just save one, just in case.

960
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:23,314
lt's in the dairy section
under ''Junior.''

961
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:26,417
What did you say?

962
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:32,399
- My egg is in the freezer at the lab.
- You call it Junior?

963
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:37,665
Yes. l know. Well, l couldn't put my own
name because everybody would know.

964
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:41,868
And you can't tell if it's a boy
or a girl, so l thought Junior would--

965
01:09:41,943 --> 01:09:46,505
- Junior.
- l know. l've shocked you, haven't l?

966
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:51,017
l suppose it is a bit perverse,
having your own eggs on display...

967
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:55,522
but some people keep their tonsils,
their adenoids and appendixes and--

968
01:09:55,589 --> 01:09:59,081
Anyway, enough, sorry.
l'm embarrassing you. So, what--

969
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,856
- l'm sorry. l have to go.
- Alex?

970
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:04,727
Alex. What's the matter?

971
01:10:10,271 --> 01:10:12,865
Not a roll, not a kick,
not in two days.

972
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,841
Oh, l know
something's wrong.

973
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,902
There's something wrong.
ls that what you want to hear?

974
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,140
No!

975
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:23,012
All the drugs the father took
probably messed her up good.

976
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:26,281
- What drugs?
- l read up on Aerosmith.

977
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:30,882
Wasted for a decade.
Coke, booze, pills.

978
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,519
- What are you talking about?
- Which one is he?

979
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:41,725
Did you think it was someone
in the band? ls that what you thought?

980
01:10:41,802 --> 01:10:44,464
Well, that's what you said.

981
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:46,369
No, that he was on tour
with them.

982
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,704
He's not in the band.
He's their personal trainer.

983
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:51,176
For God--

984
01:10:51,245 --> 01:10:53,736
- Oh! She kicked.
- She kicked.

985
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:57,181
- She just kicked.
- All right, Larry, come with me now.

986
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,981
- What?
- Where did you get Junior?

987
01:11:00,054 --> 01:11:03,080
-l told you.
-The truth! We're talking about my baby.

988
01:11:03,157 --> 01:11:05,284
Keep your voice down.

989
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,522
All right.
l got it from Reddin's lab. So?

990
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:10,655
Well, it's Diana's.

991
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:12,961
- You mean, hers, personally?
- Yes!

992
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:15,696
You're supposed to get
an anonymous egg.

993
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,967
l tried.
Everybody was all out.

994
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,702
- Can you do anything right?
- Wait, don't start with me.

995
01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:25,041
lf you'd have stopped
taking the Expectane...

996
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:27,273
none of this would be an issue.

997
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:30,840
- What a horrible thing to say.
- Well, it's the truth.

998
01:11:30,918 --> 01:11:34,046
Keepin' it goin' was your idea,
not mine.

999
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:37,022
Women have such convenient memories
when they're pregnant.

1000
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,753
Now take that back.

1001
01:11:39,827 --> 01:11:43,627
All right, that was a Freudian slip.
l know you're not a woman.

1002
01:11:43,697 --> 01:11:47,428
No. The part about l should
have ended it. Junior heard that.

1003
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:50,470
- Now take it back.
- For cryin' out loud. l take it back.

1004
01:11:50,538 --> 01:11:52,005
No, mean it.

1005
01:11:54,475 --> 01:11:57,808
All right, Junior, l'm sorry.
l take it back.

1006
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:02,611
l just felt a kick.

1007
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,543
Come. Feel it.

1008
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:10,318
- No, l don't think so.
- Come on. Just feel it.

1009
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:14,157
- Come. We need a healing experience.
- Give me a break, will ya?

1010
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:15,627
Just do it!

1011
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,562
Here.

1012
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:23,432
Just watch. Be patient.

1013
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:26,905
- Did you see that? Right there.
- Yeah.

1014
01:12:26,974 --> 01:12:30,205
- Oh, see his little feet go.
- Right there!

1015
01:12:30,277 --> 01:12:32,541
Oh, it feels so good.
Can you believe this?

1016
01:12:35,549 --> 01:12:38,677
- What's goin' on?
- What? Nothin'.

1017
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:43,018
- What?
- You were touching him.

1018
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,955
Oh, God.

1019
01:12:45,726 --> 01:12:47,921
Oh, no.
l can't deal with this.

1020
01:12:47,995 --> 01:12:50,225
Can't deal with what?

1021
01:12:50,297 --> 01:12:54,700
What are you? What are you two,
like a-- What are you, a twosome?

1022
01:12:54,768 --> 01:12:56,827
What? No.

1023
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:59,134
What is goin' on around here?

1024
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:05,078
He's--

1025
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:07,837
He's pregnant.

1026
01:13:11,051 --> 01:13:13,747
l'm gonna be a mama too.

1027
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:30,294
- You're sure it's the Expectane?
- Absolutely.

1028
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:35,206
We compared what you gave us with
the sample we had on file in the lab.

1029
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:37,608
Who do they think
they're dealing with?

1030
01:13:37,678 --> 01:13:41,273
That's what really hurts. Well,
we're gonna have to find out who she is.

1031
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:43,373
- And there's something else.
- What?

1032
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:48,649
The sample that you gave us, it was
part Expectane and part female hormones.

1033
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:51,623
Estrogens and progesterone,
to be exact.

1034
01:13:51,692 --> 01:13:55,093
Wouldn't that be consistent
with an assisted pregnancy?

1035
01:13:55,162 --> 01:13:59,098
Not a dosage of this size. This is
more like the amount you'd take, say...

1036
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:03,000
preparing for a sex change operation.

1037
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:16,349
Oh, my God!

1038
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:26,252
You're doing some more charting.
We'll have to do the whole thing again.

1039
01:14:26,327 --> 01:14:29,854
- Diana.
- We're busy.

1040
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,490
Please, l need
to talk to you.

1041
01:14:32,566 --> 01:14:35,126
You need to apologize
to me, don't you?

1042
01:14:35,202 --> 01:14:37,363
About last night,
l'm sorry, Diana.

1043
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:41,306
- Please let me explain.
- All right, then go on, explain.

1044
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:46,373
Guys, would you mind?

1045
01:14:50,818 --> 01:14:52,752
What?

1046
01:15:01,462 --> 01:15:03,453
l'm pregnant.

1047
01:15:04,531 --> 01:15:07,261
Good explanation.

1048
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:10,167
l really am pregnant.

1049
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,949
What?

1050
01:15:16,317 --> 01:15:18,877
l tested the Expectane
on myself.

1051
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:25,352
We fertilized an egg and
implanted it into my abdomen.

1052
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:30,363
With drug and hormone supplements,
l'm now seven months to term.

1053
01:15:36,237 --> 01:15:37,727
Oh, my God!

1054
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,936
There's more.

1055
01:15:45,012 --> 01:15:47,412
More?

1056
01:15:47,481 --> 01:15:51,975
Larry was supposed to find
an anonymous egg...

1057
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:53,987
and he couldn't.

1058
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:58,583
So he borrowed one
from your dairy section.

1059
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:01,753
- lt's Junior.
- My Junior?

1060
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,628
Our Junior now.

1061
01:16:08,936 --> 01:16:11,962
Our Junior?
Our Junior!

1062
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:15,805
- Diana, please, don't be angry.
- Why should l be angry?

1063
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:19,812
You've lied to me,
you steal from me...

1064
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,145
you engage in
an utterly immoral...

1065
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:28,154
selfish, arrogant stunt without
any regard for my feelings whatsoever.

1066
01:16:28,222 --> 01:16:30,747
What-- What am l
supposed to be, grateful?

1067
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:33,953
This is just... so male!

1068
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:36,019
- l'm sorry, Diana.
- Just don't come near me!

1069
01:16:36,097 --> 01:16:38,998
- l never wanted to hurt you.
- What did you think you were doing?

1070
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:42,866
You think men don't have enough?
You have to take this away as well?

1071
01:16:42,937 --> 01:16:45,599
You-- lt's-- lt's pitiful!

1072
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:49,700
Let me shake hands
with the Man Who Would Be Mom.

1073
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:53,440
-What are you talking about?
-The greatest scientific breakthrough...

1074
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:55,880
in the history of this university.
Bravo, Doctor.

1075
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,408
You know, we're in this together, now.
We have a contract.

1076
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:04,288
And l quote, ''Exploitation of results
from university-funded research...

1077
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:07,225
shall be at the sole discretion
of the university.''

1078
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:10,263
- Come on. l've ordered some tests.
- Leave me alone.

1079
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:14,028
- He said to leave him alone.
- Escort Dr. Hesse to the ambulance.

1080
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:17,400
Can't allow it!
He's in a very delicate condition.

1081
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:20,634
l'm really disappointed in you, Diana.

1082
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,643
You and your baby
are university property now.

1083
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,076
No, l'm not.

1084
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:32,678
My body, my choice.

1085
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:34,721
Yes!

1086
01:17:47,435 --> 01:17:51,269
Come on, Alex.

1087
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,431
Go!

1088
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,450
Just easy, easy. Breathe. Breathe.

1089
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:13,789
- That was really scary.
- Relax. l gotta hide you.

1090
01:18:13,861 --> 01:18:16,261
- That ought to be easy.
- Yeah.

1091
01:18:18,466 --> 01:18:22,835
- So what did Diana say?
- She said l was selfish and arrogant.

1092
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:26,634
That we'd taken away her dignity
and the sacred role of womanhood.

1093
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:31,610
Typical. l can't tell you how many times
l've heard pregnant women complain...

1094
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,546
''l just wish a man
could go through this.''

1095
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:38,551
You finally do it, and what do you get?
Attitude and insults.

1096
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:41,349
- Yeah, you're right.
- Oh, l'm tellin' ya.

1097
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:50,163
Alex, are you sure you're gonna
be able to go through with this?

1098
01:18:50,231 --> 01:18:53,530
l think so.
l don't have a lot of choice.

1099
01:18:57,605 --> 01:18:59,698
- Hello.
- Hello.

1100
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:04,467
Whoa, it's nice. Hello.

1101
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:07,173
- How are you?
- Hi.

1102
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,910
- lt's quite a place. Hi.
- Hello.

1103
01:19:09,984 --> 01:19:13,112
- You must be Mr. and Mrs. Hesse?
- Yes.

1104
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,052
Welcome.

1105
01:19:15,122 --> 01:19:18,785
Welcome to Casitas Madres.

1106
01:19:18,859 --> 01:19:23,091
l think of Casitas Madres as
a health resort for expectant mothers.

1107
01:19:23,164 --> 01:19:25,928
We want you to completely relax
while you're here.

1108
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,369
That's really good news because
that's exactly what Alexandra needs...

1109
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,462
to just totally relax.

1110
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:36,874
Would you have some lemonade,
Larry, Alexandra?

1111
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,879
l'll have a little
if it's okay.

1112
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:46,552
l realize that my appearance
might be a bit startling.

1113
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:50,215
lt is sometimes difficult
for people to take.

1114
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:52,623
lf l may speak
to your concerns?

1115
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:55,218
Yes, by all means.

1116
01:19:58,766 --> 01:20:03,863
When l was a sportswoman in the East
German Olympic track-and-field team...

1117
01:20:03,938 --> 01:20:06,839
they dispensed anabolic steroids
as freely...

1118
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:09,603
as here in America
they dole out Gatorade.

1119
01:20:09,677 --> 01:20:12,805
They pushed it on them.
l mean, just--

1120
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,906
Nothing was mentioned
of the side effects...

1121
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:19,248
that are now so obviously,
painfully apparent.

1122
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,686
But l'm all woman.

1123
01:20:21,755 --> 01:20:25,350
- Believe you me.
- Of course.

1124
01:20:25,426 --> 01:20:28,987
l'm almost eight months pregnant,
and my Larry has to travel on business.

1125
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:32,328
l dread the thought
of leaving her helpless and alone.

1126
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,367
That's why we're here.

1127
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:38,769
Alexandra...
you've come to the right place.

1128
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:43,402
And... may l say
something else?

1129
01:20:43,477 --> 01:20:48,437
- What?
- You are beautiful.

1130
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:53,179
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, you are.

1131
01:20:53,254 --> 01:20:55,848
And you'll love your room.
lt's got a great big tub.

1132
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:59,518
Oh. Big tub.
That'll come in handy.

1133
01:20:59,593 --> 01:21:02,118
Anyway, so tomorrow...

1134
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:05,632
l catch the first flight out to
Vancouver to meet with the Lyndon guys.

1135
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:10,261
Shouldn't take more than three, four
days, tops. You okay, honey? Come on.

1136
01:21:10,337 --> 01:21:13,170
Okay, right this way.

1137
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,232
You have your temperature
control and your call button.

1138
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:20,479
lt's a very nice room, huh?

1139
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:24,779
And extra blankets in the drawer.

1140
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:27,787
- Here's your key.
- l want you to take good care of her.

1141
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:30,221
- Oh, of course we will.
- Yeah.

1142
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:32,657
- No.
- All right. Bye.

1143
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:38,558
Big.

1144
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:40,691
lt's nice.

1145
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:46,795
Larry. You really think
the baby's gonna be born?

1146
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,605
l wanna say, ''Of course,''

1147
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:59,845
but there's no precedent for this.

1148
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,801
- Gods knows what's goin' on in there.
- But everything's gonna be all right?

1149
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:04,861
- Gods knows what's goin' on in there.
- But everything's gonna be all right?

1150
01:22:04,937 --> 01:22:09,135
lt better be.
lt's my baby too, you know.

1151
01:22:11,711 --> 01:22:14,339
Take it easy.

1152
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:21,052
Thanks for everything, Larry.

1153
01:22:56,622 --> 01:23:00,023
Diana? lt's Alex.

1154
01:23:00,092 --> 01:23:03,152
ln case you're there, please pick up.

1155
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:07,928
l really need
to talk to you. Please.

1156
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:25,742
Push, push, push, okay.

1157
01:23:37,864 --> 01:23:40,196
A little more
gentle with babies.

1158
01:23:47,173 --> 01:23:49,300
l love you.

1159
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:12,024
Oh, that's marvelous!

1160
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,541
l guess so.

1161
01:24:49,936 --> 01:24:53,872
And remember, no names.
This isn't a test.

1162
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:58,502
Thanks. Well, this
should be very interesting.

1163
01:24:58,577 --> 01:25:00,545
Let's see.

1164
01:25:00,646 --> 01:25:04,082
She writes...

1165
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,584
''My biggest fear is that
l'm not exactly...

1166
01:25:06,652 --> 01:25:09,416
what you would call
a natural born mother.

1167
01:25:09,488 --> 01:25:13,219
How will l ever cope?''
You know...

1168
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:15,453
l think we have to dispense
with the myth...

1169
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,792
that some are born
with the maternal instinct...

1170
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,956
and others are not.

1171
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:22,933
The little girl tending
her doll collection is...

1172
01:25:23,002 --> 01:25:27,769
no more a natural born mother
than the tomboy down the street.

1173
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,434
There is no standard.
There are no naturals.

1174
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,173
Hello, Diana.

1175
01:26:05,878 --> 01:26:07,709
Very fetching.

1176
01:26:08,848 --> 01:26:13,012
You might want
to rethink the earrings.

1177
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,384
l'm glad you came. l started
to wonder if l'd ever see you again.

1178
01:26:16,455 --> 01:26:20,357
- Well, l needed some time to think.
- And?

1179
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:24,795
lt's so unfair what you've done.
This is t-- Monumentally unfair.

1180
01:26:24,864 --> 01:26:26,354
Will you forgive me?

1181
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,798
l wouldn't be asking anything
of me at the moment.

1182
01:26:28,868 --> 01:26:32,099
l totally understand if you
never want to see me again.

1183
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:35,538
- l take responsibility for the baby.
- Wait!

1184
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:39,009
Can we just get one thing
straight here? This is my baby too.

1185
01:26:39,078 --> 01:26:41,478
- Don't you ever forget that!
- l won't.

1186
01:26:41,547 --> 01:26:44,482
- l'm the mother. You're the father.
- Yes. Yes.

1187
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:46,575
- ls that clear?
- Yes.

1188
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:50,713
We'll have to find an intelligent way
of sharing the responsibilities.

1189
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:54,851
-Yes. Yes.
-Of creating security and a home life...

1190
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:58,192
- Yes.
- and a normal upbringing!

1191
01:26:58,264 --> 01:27:02,064
- Yes.
- l mean, all this is very complicated.

1192
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,796
l know it is.

1193
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:08,067
And l thought that l would be--

1194
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,439
That l would be--

1195
01:27:12,945 --> 01:27:14,913
You are.

1196
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:21,582
l want us to do this together.

1197
01:27:45,778 --> 01:27:48,747
Do you have a private room?

1198
01:27:49,782 --> 01:27:51,443
Yes. Why?

1199
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,849
Call me old-fashioned,
but l'll be damned...

1200
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,286
if l'm having a child
with a man l never slept with.

1201
01:28:00,493 --> 01:28:02,723
So, where--
where is it?

1202
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,961
You coming?

1203
01:28:53,612 --> 01:28:56,240
Bye.

1204
01:28:56,315 --> 01:28:59,216
l'd better get out of here
before anyone sees me.

1205
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,346
lf everything is satisfactory,
please sign all copies where tagged.

1206
01:29:03,346 --> 01:29:06,941
lf everything is satisfactory,
please sign all copies where tagged.

1207
01:29:07,016 --> 01:29:11,919
Once we have European approval,
the F.D.A. will agree to testing.

1208
01:29:11,988 --> 01:29:16,687
- Leave it to us.
- Potential for your drug is remarkable.

1209
01:29:16,759 --> 01:29:19,159
- We'll be rich.
- Loaded.

1210
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:23,460
That's got a nice ring to it. Loaded.

1211
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,312
What's the matter?

1212
01:29:45,388 --> 01:29:48,653
Would you put this call
through to California?

1213
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:50,818
Sure, Dr. Arbogast.

1214
01:29:50,893 --> 01:29:53,293
Over there.

1215
01:29:53,363 --> 01:29:54,853
Oh, yeah.

1216
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:59,734
l should call the doctor
just to be sure.

1217
01:29:59,802 --> 01:30:01,633
l just need to lie down.

1218
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:06,541
Oh, damn it.

1219
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:08,577
Come on.

1220
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:16,475
Lyndon's coming in as partners.
This is gonna push us through the F.D.A.

1221
01:30:19,422 --> 01:30:22,050
Alex, are you okay?

1222
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,634
Yeah, Ned. Set up an emergency
C-section for tonight.

1223
01:30:34,704 --> 01:30:36,934
l want everybody out
of the building except you and Louise.

1224
01:30:37,006 --> 01:30:40,373
You wanna do an operation
with just the two of us?

1225
01:30:40,443 --> 01:30:42,434
Just us.
We're the whole team.

1226
01:30:42,512 --> 01:30:45,845
You can't do an emergency C-section
without an anesthesiologist.

1227
01:30:45,915 --> 01:30:48,008
We can handle it. Bye.

1228
01:30:48,084 --> 01:30:51,178
She didn't come down for lunch.

1229
01:30:51,254 --> 01:30:54,189
- You better call Dr. Talbot.
- Right.

1230
01:30:54,257 --> 01:30:57,454
Diana, please, hurry. l need you.

1231
01:30:57,527 --> 01:31:01,224
l'm coming! Okay?
l'm coming! l'm coming!

1232
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,959
- l need the car. l need the keys.
- On the desk.

1233
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:06,467
- Here.
- Thank you.

1234
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:10,028
You said to let you know
if something was going on here.

1235
01:31:10,106 --> 01:31:13,769
Something's definitely goin' on.
They're sendin' everybody home.

1236
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,472
An emergency C-something.
Does that mean anything to you?

1237
01:31:17,547 --> 01:31:20,812
- Open the door, please.
- l want my Larry.

1238
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:23,875
ln the meantime, let's have
our doctor take a look at you.

1239
01:31:23,953 --> 01:31:28,788
There is nothing to worry about.
l think it's important that l see you.

1240
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:30,883
l don't wanna see you!

1241
01:31:37,567 --> 01:31:40,331
- Where is he?
- He? Who?

1242
01:31:40,403 --> 01:31:42,701
He, my-- She, my wife!

1243
01:31:42,772 --> 01:31:45,206
Oh, Alexandra.
She's upstairs.

1244
01:31:45,274 --> 01:31:47,799
Thank God you're here.

1245
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:50,869
Pumpkin?

1246
01:31:50,947 --> 01:31:55,179
- Back! Excuse me! Pardon me!
- Thank God you're here.

1247
01:31:59,655 --> 01:32:00,587
Larry.

1248
01:32:00,656 --> 01:32:02,055
Pumpkin!

1249
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,990
All right.

1250
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,691
l can take care of her.

1251
01:32:09,765 --> 01:32:12,632
- Okay, okay. Just breathe.
- Oh, my God! Here it comes!

1252
01:32:12,702 --> 01:32:17,002
Here it comes! Oh, l feel
the baby. The baby! The baby!

1253
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,839
Oh, shit!

1254
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:30,815
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

1255
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:34,414
What the hell are you doin' here?

1256
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:38,153
What am l doing here?
lt's my baby, not yours!

1257
01:32:38,227 --> 01:32:40,058
- l put it in there.
- My egg.

1258
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:43,530
- Your egg doesn't make you the mother.
- Shut up!

1259
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,829
- Go ahead.
- Take me outta here!

1260
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:51,338
Do we have to bounce so much?

1261
01:32:51,407 --> 01:32:54,535
Just a couple of miles like this.
You okay, Alex?

1262
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,670
Oh, l feel like Junior kicked
a hole through something.

1263
01:32:57,747 --> 01:33:00,045
Louise, l wanna talk to Sneller.

1264
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:02,584
- Oh, l want to die!
- Breathe. Breathe.

1265
01:33:02,652 --> 01:33:05,883
- Stop blowing at me!
- Sorry.

1266
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:08,219
- l'm about a half hour away.
- Larry.

1267
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,781
What is goin' on?

1268
01:33:09,859 --> 01:33:13,158
Somebody from the university has got
a whole bunch of media out front.

1269
01:33:13,229 --> 01:33:15,857
Banes. Damn it!
Can you get rid of 'em?

1270
01:33:15,932 --> 01:33:18,264
l don't think so.
Larry, what is this?

1271
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:21,531
l don't wanna talk on the cellular.
Just meet us outside!

1272
01:33:21,604 --> 01:33:23,902
- What's goin' on?
- Somebody tipped the press.

1273
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:28,205
- Oh, what are we gonna do?
- l don't know. l'm thinkin'.

1274
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,981
Better be big.

1275
01:33:36,052 --> 01:33:39,510
You pulled me away from dinner with
the university's largest benefactor.

1276
01:33:39,589 --> 01:33:42,752
This is big, Edward,
literally and figuratively.

1277
01:33:48,264 --> 01:33:51,256
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention, please?

1278
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:53,564
Thank you for waiting.

1279
01:33:54,637 --> 01:33:56,400
l'm Noah Banes...

1280
01:33:56,472 --> 01:33:59,771
director of Lufkin's
Biotechnology Research Center.

1281
01:33:59,842 --> 01:34:04,745
This is Edward Sawyer,
president of Leland University.

1282
01:34:04,814 --> 01:34:09,547
We are here to announce a momentous
breakthrough in medical science.

1283
01:34:09,619 --> 01:34:12,452
Under my personal guidance
and supervision...

1284
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,718
and with the aid
of a new wonder drug, Expectane...

1285
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:20,626
Dr. Alexander Hesse of my staff
will be arriving shortly...

1286
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:24,826
to give birth to a child
he has himself carried to term.

1287
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,460
- Are you saying he's pregnant?
- Yes.

1288
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:29,561
l am saying he's pregnant.

1289
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:31,573
l see him!

1290
01:34:31,641 --> 01:34:34,804
And what perfect timing.
Here he is now, ladies and gentlemen.

1291
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:38,313
l give you the world's
first pregnant man.

1292
01:34:48,924 --> 01:34:51,654
What is it?

1293
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:55,185
What are you doin' here?
This is my building.

1294
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:59,132
Get outta here.
l got a medical emergency.

1295
01:34:59,201 --> 01:35:02,261
Go on. Back off.

1296
01:35:05,975 --> 01:35:08,205
Hi, Mom.

1297
01:35:08,277 --> 01:35:10,472
What is this?

1298
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:14,880
- lt's just a woman.
- That's my wife you're talkin' about.

1299
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:18,147
Hey, Ned. Thank you.
All right, okay, baby.

1300
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:21,280
Watch your step.

1301
01:35:21,357 --> 01:35:23,325
- Okay.
- Up here.

1302
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,622
- Okay.
- Okay.

1303
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:31,465
Up! Upsa-daisie.

1304
01:35:31,534 --> 01:35:34,799
Upsa-daisie.
l've got you. l've got you.

1305
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:37,395
Come on, give me room.
Ned, let's get her in there.

1306
01:35:37,473 --> 01:35:41,807
- You told us there was a pregnant man.
- There is... a pregnant man.

1307
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:51,886
He's having a baby, Edward.
l swear it.

1308
01:35:54,223 --> 01:35:57,158
You're fired.

1309
01:36:00,563 --> 01:36:03,589
- Why are we stopping on two?
- lt's a surprise.

1310
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:06,999
- l prepped the operating room upstairs.
- Good. You did good.

1311
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:10,536
- Are they here yet?
- Oh, thank God. Not yet.

1312
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:12,235
Who's here?

1313
01:36:12,304 --> 01:36:16,035
Angela, enough with the huffin'.
We're all alone.

1314
01:36:16,108 --> 01:36:18,303
lmagine a tranquil--

1315
01:36:18,377 --> 01:36:20,436
Little birdies.

1316
01:36:20,513 --> 01:36:22,981
- ln here! ln here!
- Cheep, cheep.

1317
01:36:23,048 --> 01:36:26,449
- Forget the birdies.
- Thank God! Are you okay?

1318
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:28,987
- Up, Angela, out of there.
- Larry, what is this?

1319
01:36:29,054 --> 01:36:31,079
- lt's our patient.
- What's the matter with him?

1320
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:34,148
My best guess, his baby's
tangled in the large intestine.

1321
01:36:34,226 --> 01:36:36,353
- His baby? His ba--
- Hurry!

1322
01:36:36,428 --> 01:36:38,419
- His baby? Oh, God!
- Yes.

1323
01:36:38,497 --> 01:36:41,364
- ls the room prepped?
- Yeah, it's prepped.

1324
01:36:41,433 --> 01:36:44,596
Go on, Louise,
open the door!

1325
01:36:47,273 --> 01:36:50,436
Relax. Just relax.

1326
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:53,774
Get him undressed!

1327
01:36:56,549 --> 01:36:59,245
Look at the belly on that guy!

1328
01:37:02,388 --> 01:37:06,119
- Please, let me do something!
- Look, look.

1329
01:37:06,191 --> 01:37:09,592
This is dangerous,
both for Alex and the baby.

1330
01:37:09,662 --> 01:37:13,393
l don't know what's gonna happen.
There's nothin' you can do.

1331
01:37:13,465 --> 01:37:16,798
Just go outside with Angela, okay?
Keep her company.

1332
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:19,064
All right.

1333
01:37:19,138 --> 01:37:21,231
All right?

1334
01:37:25,945 --> 01:37:28,641
What?

1335
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:34,109
- Not you? Not now? No.
- Yes, yes.

1336
01:37:34,186 --> 01:37:37,553
- l'll get someone.
- l want Larry! l want Larry!

1337
01:37:37,623 --> 01:37:40,057
Be--

1338
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:42,355
Easy, easy.

1339
01:37:42,428 --> 01:37:45,488
Okay, look, um--

1340
01:37:45,564 --> 01:37:50,433
Let's imagine a garden with trees and
birds cheeping. Cheep, cheep, cheep--

1341
01:37:51,904 --> 01:37:54,702
Let's imagine drugs.

1342
01:37:57,109 --> 01:38:01,842
- What can l do?
- Have the baby for me.

1343
01:38:11,156 --> 01:38:13,556
- Feel that?
- What?

1344
01:38:13,626 --> 01:38:16,356
- Feel that? No?
- No.

1345
01:38:16,428 --> 01:38:18,658
Well, the drugs are working.

1346
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:21,325
We gave you an epidural.

1347
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,665
You're gonna be awake through this,
Alex. lt's safer that way.

1348
01:38:24,737 --> 01:38:27,103
Just try and stay calm.

1349
01:38:27,172 --> 01:38:29,163
Okay.

1350
01:38:29,241 --> 01:38:31,175
Here we go.

1351
01:38:31,243 --> 01:38:34,076
Just relax.
Think about the baby. Okay?

1352
01:38:34,146 --> 01:38:36,080
- Blot, blot.
- Blot.

1353
01:38:36,148 --> 01:38:38,878
- l'm gonna cut right here.
- That's good. Very good.

1354
01:38:41,654 --> 01:38:43,679
That's good. l'm not leaving you.

1355
01:38:43,756 --> 01:38:48,125
- l'm not leaving. Hold on. l'm gonna...
- Oh, God!

1356
01:38:48,193 --> 01:38:51,959
- check.
- Oh, this is hard. Oh, this is hard.

1357
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:55,262
- Where are you?
- l'm here. l'm here.

1358
01:39:02,307 --> 01:39:06,368
Do you think he's all right?

1359
01:39:09,415 --> 01:39:11,349
Okay.

1360
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:13,612
That's good.

1361
01:39:15,087 --> 01:39:18,215
lt's all tangled up
in the intestines.

1362
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:20,588
Transverse colon's got it.

1363
01:39:20,659 --> 01:39:24,288
There's a lot of fluid.
lt's clear.

1364
01:39:24,363 --> 01:39:26,831
Suck it down there.

1365
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:29,766
- Okay, here.
- All right.

1366
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:39,109
All right. Now push here.
Ready? Push.

1367
01:39:39,178 --> 01:39:41,703
Push it. Push it.

1368
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,430
That's your baby, Alex.

1369
01:40:05,804 --> 01:40:09,570
lt's a girl! Seven pounds, six ounces.
She's got her mother's looks.

1370
01:40:09,641 --> 01:40:13,304
- Father and daughter are doing fine--
- l have a girl?

1371
01:40:13,378 --> 01:40:15,403
- What?
- Another delivery.

1372
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:18,314
Go in there!
Angela. Angela. Talk to me.

1373
01:40:18,383 --> 01:40:21,011
- He's comin', honey.
- So soon?

1374
01:40:21,086 --> 01:40:23,816
- Louise, wheelchair!
- What?

1375
01:40:23,889 --> 01:40:26,187
- Why didn't you tell somebody?
- l wanted you.

1376
01:40:26,258 --> 01:40:29,159
Oh, well, you got me.
You got me.

1377
01:40:29,228 --> 01:40:32,459
- lt hurts.
- lt won't be long now.

1378
01:40:32,531 --> 01:40:36,592
Do you want Louise
to call the father?

1379
01:40:36,668 --> 01:40:39,728
What's the point?
He's long gone.

1380
01:40:39,805 --> 01:40:42,638
- Does he know it?
- Oh, yeah.

1381
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:47,873
He sent me a dozen roses and
an autographed picture with the band!

1382
01:40:47,946 --> 01:40:51,109
All right, breathe, honey.
Just breathe.

1383
01:40:51,183 --> 01:40:53,651
- Prepare number two.
- You want an epidural?

1384
01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:56,950
- You want natural childbirth?
- l want drugs! l want drugs!

1385
01:41:14,173 --> 01:41:17,438
We've got a little baby girl.

You're supposed to eat with your hands,
