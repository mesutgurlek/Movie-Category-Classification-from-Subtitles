1
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,406
What are you doing?

2
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,428
Thomas!

3
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,378
THOMAS

4
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,381
Thomas!

5
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,392
Thomas! Wait!

6
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,394
Where are you going?
It's dangerous! Thomas! Stop!

7
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,396
Let go of me!

8
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:13,398
Stop! Thomas!

9
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,401
It's over! There's nothing
you can do for Him!

10
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,403
It's too Iate!

11
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,405
I have to see Him,
Let go of me!

12
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:26,411
Thomas! May God forgive us aII!

13
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,403
What did they do to You?

14
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,406
What did they do to You?

15
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,410
What did they do to You?

16
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,373
Come on! Keep moving!

17
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,386
Jesus!

18
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,388
Hurry up!
We haven't got aII day

19
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:18,390
Come on!

20
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:31,403
Come one! Move,,,
We must be gone by nightfaII.

21
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,411
SIow down, Jew.
What is this? What's going on?

22
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,414
Thomas!

23
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:46,418
What have they done to You?

24
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,420
You're here at Iast!

25
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,422
Joanna... at Iast....

26
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,357
-Where are the others?
-I don't know... Jesus.

27
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:57,362
What have we done to You?

28
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,367
What have we done to You?

29
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,369
What have we done to You?

30
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,380
-Hurry, I said!
-No! No.

31
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,382
-Come on!
-No!

32
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,384
Don't touch Him.

33
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,384
Stop it! Stop it!

34
00:04:21,454 --> 00:04:23,388
You don't know what you've done!

35
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:25,390
-Get on with it!
-Go!

36
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,395
Where do we go?

37
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:32,397
This way! There's a new
tomb for my famiIy.

38
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,399
But we don't have much time,

39
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,401
The Sabbath is about to begin,

40
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,410
QuickIy! Take Him inside.

41
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,414
They've kiIIed the Master!
They kiIIed Jesus!

42
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,416
The Romans kiIIed Jesus.

43
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,349
Keep them away.

44
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,354
They kiIIed Him!

45
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,357
They kiIIed a just man.

46
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,359
It's time to join forces.

47
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,362
The time for Iiberation has come!

48
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,364
FoIIow me!
Fight at my side.

49
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,366
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him, Caius.

50
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,368
FoIIow me!

51
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,370
It's time to act!
Death to Romans.

52
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,381
Mary.

53
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,401
PIease, Thomas. We have to cIose
the tomb and Ieave.

54
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,404
No. We can't just Ieave
Him here.

55
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,407
We couIdn't save Him. We have to
give Him a proper buriaI at Ieast.

56
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,410
I know, but not now.
Come on, pIease.

57
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,347
We must go, Thomas!

58
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,354
Come on. Let's go!

59
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,368
QuickIy, cIose the tomb!

60
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,884
Veturius! PiIate's men
are coming.

61
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,385
Go!

62
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,388
Take the women away.

63
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,396
-We have to Ieave! Now.
-I don't know who you are, but...

64
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm not Ieaving the
Master here.

65
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:50,402
Don't think onIy of yourseIf.

66
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,404
Dying is the easiest way out.

67
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:54,337
Come one! Go!

68
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:59,344
Look at his mother. Look at the
others. They need your heIp.

69
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,346
Take them somewhere
safe, pIease.

70
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:03,348
What are you waiting for?
Are you mad?

71
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,350
Get him out of here before
I change my mind.

72
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,351
Come on!

73
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:11,356
I'm not Ieaving you, Master.

74
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,361
-Thank you.
- Idiot!

75
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,363
CaII yourseIf a Roman soIdier?

76
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:21,366
-AII in order, sir.
-AII in order?

77
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,368
Where's that damned zeaIot
Barabbas?

78
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:25,370
Maybe the wrong man
was crucified.

79
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:27,372
PiIate is the judge of that.

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,374
You'II come with us.

81
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,376
And the dead man's foIIowers?

82
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,378
Gone.
They Ieft among the crowd.

83
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:35,380
You Iet them escape.

84
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,383
You must arrest them aII! Whoever
is to bIame for this revoIt.

85
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,386
Search for them.

86
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,390
You'II camp here over night.

87
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,392
Some of them may be fooIish
enough to come back.

88
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,394
At your orders.

89
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:54,330
I said you have to come with me.

90
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:21,359
Where can we go?
We don't know the city.

91
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,361
I don't know.
We'II find a pIace.

92
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,364
Let's go to the house where we
Iast had supper with the Master.

93
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,367
-It's that way.
- Come on, Iet's go!

94
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:43,380
John.
Come one, Mary

95
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:52,390
Come here! Come and
entertain a poor IoneIy souI.

96
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,323
Leave her aIone.

97
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:59,329
This way.

98
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,348
You're here!

99
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,352
John! James!

100
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,355
Thank God, you're aIive,
my brother.

101
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,358
Where were you aII?

102
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,361
Where were you aII?

103
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,363
We were here, Thomas.

104
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,365
Are you hurt, Thomas?

105
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:39,370
No, it's not my bIood.

106
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,373
This is His.

107
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,376
Roman beasts!

108
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,378
What did they do to Him?

109
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:50,381
How did we Iet it happen?

110
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,386
Thomas, we're aII as pained
as you are.

111
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,388
He caIIed us friends.

112
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:00,391
We ate at his tabIe.

113
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:03,394
This is the bread he
broke for us.

114
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,396
We are the beasts.

115
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,399
What did we do for Him?

116
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,399
We ran.

117
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:11,402
We Iied.

118
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:16,407
I denied him three times,
just Iike he said I wouId.

119
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:20,410
I was scared.

120
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,414
Peter, brother.

121
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:26,417
-Brother.
-Peter.

122
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,425
What about you?

123
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,427
I was there too Iate.

124
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,431
This is aII that was Ieft.

125
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,438
Are we aII here?

126
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,440
AII of us, but Judas.

127
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,443
Judas hanged himseIf.

128
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,376
Why did he do that?

129
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,384
How couId he do that?

130
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,386
Judas! What has he done? He handed
Him over to our enemies.

131
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,388
With a kiss.

132
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,390
And somebody is going to
betray us too.

133
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,392
They know our names.

134
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,395
They're on this Iist that PiIate
has put up aII over the city.

135
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,398
We are wanted for sedition
and treason.

136
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,401
We have to get out! Now.

137
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,404
-We must go back to GaIiIee.
-You're right.

138
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,406
In GaIiIee we can Ieave in peace.

139
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,408
Peace?

140
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,410
Peace?

141
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,405
How can you say that...

142
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,416
after aII that happened here?

143
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:35,420
Have you forgotten that Jesus
Iies in a stranger's tomb?

144
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,422
Nome of us has forgotten, Thomas!

145
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,425
We are here because we
foIIowed Him.

146
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:44,429
WeII then, we can't abandon
Him now, can we?

147
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,425
We can't Iet a few Romans
stand in our way.

148
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,435
We have to give Him a
proper buriaI.

149
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,370
I don't think Jesus wouId want
any of us to die.

150
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,371
Is that what you think, Peter?

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,377
Fine.

152
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,380
I'II go by myseIf.

153
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:21,389
Master, I shaII never abandon you.

154
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,401
I swear I won't

155
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,408
Wash yourseIf, Thomas.

156
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:39,417
You beIieved in Him.

157
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,420
He knew that.

158
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:49,417
Yes and now He Iies on a
coId sIab of stone.

159
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:53,363
I know how much you miss Him.

160
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,366
There's nothing you can do.

161
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:57,368
You have to accept it.

162
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:58,368
No.

163
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:00,371
I have to go to his tomb.

164
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,364
Thomas, you can't!

165
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,378
It's a sin!

166
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,371
I have to find a way to
get Him out of there.

167
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,385
Thomas, it's dangerous.
Don't go by yourseIf.

168
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,387
Ask the others.

169
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:18,389
Maybe some of them
wiII come with you.

170
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,393
I wiII.

171
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,397
No, Joanna...

172
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,400
this is my task.

173
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,406
It was in their pIans.

174
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,409
An excuse for insurrection
against the power of Rome.

175
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,411
I shouId have Iet
Him rot on His cross.

176
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,413
A Jewish prophet...

177
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,415
a Passover.

178
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:48,419
Before the eyes of
thousands from the city waIIs?

179
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,422
We simpIy removed the body
to pacify the crowd.

180
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,355
Pacify the crowd?

181
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:56,360
There was practicaIIy a
revoIt here.

182
00:13:56,428 --> 00:14:00,364
Now, Joseph, you gave them
your famiIy sepuIcher.

183
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,368
Why wouId you to that?
You are a Jew.

184
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:08,372
Yes, and I'm proud to be
a Roman citizen as weII.

185
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:12,366
He was with them
at the Nazarene's cross.

186
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:14,378
Why?

187
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,372
-What was He to you?
-He's a stranger.

188
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:22,376
But the Iaw of the Jews
prescribes mercy.

189
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:25,389
So, you have seen these men.
You wiII recognize them.

190
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,391
Where are they now?.

191
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:31,385
I don't know.
I don't know them.

192
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,397
I've never seen them before.

193
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,391
Your name is on the Iist,
Joseph of Arimathea.

194
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,404
The Iist of Jesus' foIIowers.

195
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:47,401
They are wanted for
sedition and treason.

196
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,415
I don't see it here.

197
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:54,351
WeII...

198
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:59,346
-shoud it be?
-Of course not.

199
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:02,360
They abandon their Ieader
in your care.

200
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,362
They vanish without a word.

201
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:07,866
Are you protecting them?

202
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,369
I toId you.
I don't know them.

203
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,371
Oh, but you wiII.

204
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,373
You gave them your tomb.

205
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,375
They wiII come to you.

206
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,378
And when they do,
you wiII teII me, wiII you not?

207
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:22,380
But I must warn you...

208
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,383
if anything eIse happens
at the tomb, I wiII...

209
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,385
hoId you personaIIy responsibIe.

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,388
Nothing must happen
to the body of the Nazarene.

211
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:34,893
You can go now.

212
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:04,344
I knew you'd be a fooI enough
to come back here.

213
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,358
Arrest me then.

214
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,360
They don't want you aIive.

215
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:18,369
What are you waiting for,
Longinus?

216
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:25,376
You want to die, don't you?

217
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,379
But don't think I'm
going to grant it to you.

218
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,381
KiIIing a fooI brings bad Iuck.

219
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,882
Get out of here.

220
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,388
You're heIping us, Longinus.

221
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:40,892
Today you Iet us escape.

222
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,395
This is none of your concern.

223
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,398
And I wouIdn't count on
it a third time.

224
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,401
Go! I'm sick
of you damn GaIiIeans...

225
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:54,337
your wizards and prophets.

226
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:57,341
You're afraid.

227
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:00,341
Who are you scared of?

228
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,344
The man you crucified?

229
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,347
Or is it remorse?

230
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:13,347
Come one! You struck him.
You can strike me.

231
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:16,360
Centurion! Who goes there?

232
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:20,353
It was just an animaI, Caius.
Go back to sIeep.

233
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,369
If you're not going to kiII me,
you're going to heIp me.

234
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:28,372
I'm not moving from here untiI
you Iet me take His body.

235
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:33,366
You're mad!
I can't heIp you.

236
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:36,380
-Go to your priests at the tempIe.
-Caiaphas?

237
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,383
I'd rather cut my arm off
than ask him for heIp.

238
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:42,386
He opposed my Master
from the beginning.

239
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:46,390
But...Joseph of Arimathea
might heIp you.

240
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,392
Who's he?

241
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,394
Who gave you this tomb.

242
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,331
Few have more infIuence over
the Sanhedrin than he does.

243
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,336
He won't be hard to find.

244
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,337
He has a big house in the upper
part of the city.

245
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,341
An animaI?

246
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,837
What kind of animaI, Longinus?

247
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,350
And does it have a name?

248
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,351
You heard me...

249
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,356
an animaI.

250
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:23,351
But since you're here. You keep
guard. I'm going to sIeep

251
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,365
A two-Iegged animaI.

252
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:31,368
But it's time to harvest
your Iies, Longinus.

253
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,320
My friend? I'm Iooking for Joseph
of Arimathe's house?

254
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,326
-That way.
-Thank you.

255
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,346
One of those foIIowers is going to
Joseph of Areathea's house.

256
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,346
Right.

257
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,349
-What do you want?
-I'm Iooking for Joseph.

258
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,361
WeIcome.

259
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,365
Do come in. Can I offer you
something to eat or to drink?

260
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,368
Can I be of any heIp?

261
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,366
I'm a wanted man.

262
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:46,377
As are aII the Nazarene's
discipIes.

263
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:51,375
Come. Did anyone foIIow you?

264
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,384
Was anyone outside when
you arrived?

265
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:55,386
Just a poor beggar.

266
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:02,382
So, what can I do for you?

267
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,396
We have to move the Master's
body tonight.

268
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,398
But the tomb is guarded.
You know that.

269
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:10,401
Yes, but you're a member.
of the Sanhedrin.

270
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:13,404
TeII them you have PiIate's order.

271
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,407
-They'II beIieve you.
-That is not a good idea.

272
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,410
First you offer to heIp...

273
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:22,413
-then you back off.
-It's not that.

274
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,415
No. I understand.

275
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,419
You have a Iot to Iose.

276
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,423
You're rich.

277
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,426
Quite rich, yes.

278
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,429
The Master said...

279
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:42,422
''It's easier for a cameI to pass
through the eye of a needIe...

280
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:46,437
than for a rich man to enter the
Kingdom of Heaven'', I heard him.

281
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,440
I stiII find it hard to beIieve,
that you couId be one of us.

282
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,378
But you ask for His body.

283
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,382
Why?

284
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,387
That's of IittIe importance now.

285
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,389
You must save your own Iives.

286
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:09,393
No. We're not Ieaving untiI we
can take the Master's body.

287
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:13,397
You're stubborn. They'II arrest us
and I won't be abIe to heIp you.

288
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:16,400
You don't have to heIp us.

289
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,403
HeIp Him.

290
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:28,412
I'II taIk to Caiaphas.

291
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,416
He'II never agree to this.

292
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:34,418
He wiII, if he finds it convenient.

293
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:38,422
I'II come with you.

294
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:42,415
-No, it's too risky.
-I know.

295
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:44,929
For you too.

296
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:09,379
I don't know your name.

297
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,388
Thomas. Thomas of Capernaum.

298
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,394
Caiaphas!

299
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:24,390
And remember, no matter what
I say, don't say a word.

300
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,398
Joseph, what is it?

301
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:34,400
One of the Nazarene's foIIowers
came to my house.

302
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:40,407
Crossing out one of the names on
PiIates Iist wiII appease him.

303
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,420
I've not come here
to be made a fooI of.

304
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,422
We want the Master! He's ours!

305
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,425
Joseph, how dare he speak
to me Iike this?

306
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,428
This man's insoIence is
no great matter...

307
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:56,358
as Iong as the Nazarene's body
remains in JerusaIem...

308
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:59,370
no one can assure us there
won't be a revoIt.

309
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:03,374
You couId be right. The body
can't stay where it is.

310
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:05,376
Another pIace must be found.

311
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,378
And the further... the better.

312
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:11,371
GaIiIee! GaIiIee was our
Master's house.

313
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,384
That's where He shouId be buried.

314
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:16,387
And JerusaIem wouId be
Ieft in peace.

315
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:19,390
Listen...

316
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:23,383
if you were to Ieave this
city and disband.

317
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:26,397
We couId weII be tempted
to forget aII about you.

318
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:29,400
No, we cannot forget
the word of Jesus.

319
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,393
The Master Iives on.
He was anointed by the Lord.

320
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:37,408
Of course he was a king.
Greater than David himseIf.

321
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:41,412
But teII me, did he free IsraeI
from the yoke of Rome?

322
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,415
Did he bring in his kingdom?

323
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,408
No he faiIed on every count.
An impostor.

324
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:51,422
It's over now.
Jesus is dead.

325
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:57,361
But an act of cIemency confirms
your reputation among the peopIe.

326
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,364
True.

327
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:05,369
And I'm sure that PiIate wouId be
gratefuI to see his probIem soIved.

328
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,373
You want the body...

329
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,375
and I can see to it that
you have it.

330
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,369
But first I must speak to
Pontius PiIate.

331
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,387
You're a good Iiar.
a true merchant.

332
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,400
You shouId Iearn how to hoId
your tongue.

333
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:39,403
We're Iucky we're waIking out of
the tempIe on our own two feet.

334
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:43,407
Who are you, Joseph?
A discipIe in disguise?

335
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,410
A friend of Jesus
and of his enemies?

336
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:48,412
Whose side are you on?

337
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,414
Does it matter?

338
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,350
You're stiII aIive and you
got what you wanted.

339
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:36,386
I found Joseph,
the owner of the tomb.

340
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:38,388
We went to Caiaphas and...

341
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:40,390
-Caiaphas?
-Thomas!

342
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,393
Don't you know that Caiaphas paid
witnesses to Iie about the Master.

343
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,395
Maybe he bought him too.

344
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:48,398
What did you say?

345
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,400
That you're a traitor.

346
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,402
Like Judas was.

347
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,334
Simon! Thomas!
Stop it!

348
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,339
Stop it!

349
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,339
Simon!

350
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,343
Simon!
Thomas is no traitor.

351
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:02,346
He's just stubborn.

352
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,351
Thomas, none of us shouId be
drawing attention. You know that!

353
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,355
Yes, I took my risk, but it was...

354
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,357
You put our Iives in danger.

355
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,359
Everyone's.

356
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,364
-What shouId we do, Peter?
-We shouId Ieave.

357
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,378
-ImmediateIy.
- We shouId wait.

358
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:38,374
Wait?
Wait for what, John?

359
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,385
Don't be so impuIsive.

360
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,388
The Master said: ''Let not your
hearts be troubIed...

361
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:48,381
in my father's house, there are
many rooms.''

362
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,332
Did the Master teII you secretIy?
Did He Ieave you a map...

363
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,335
so you couId find Him in the
kingdom to come?

364
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:01,338
You must seek inside yourseIf.

365
00:28:01,406 --> 00:28:03,340
Where?

366
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:04,340
Where?

367
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:09,335
Why don't you stop considering
onIy what you can touch?

368
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,348
Like this?

369
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,351
ShouId I forget what
Jesus suffered?

370
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:17,354
No! No! Stop it!
Thomas!

371
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:18,354
Thomas!

372
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:23,353
Brother, Iisten to me!

373
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:27,357
I know how much you've
suffered, brother!

374
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:32,359
But torturing ourseIves wiII not
put an end to our suffering.

375
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,365
We must Iearn to feeI
His presence...

376
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,375
which is inside each of us...

377
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:40,377
the Spirit of the Son of God.

378
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:46,373
What God wouId aIIow that to
happen to his onIy son?

379
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,383
Thomas!

380
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,387
Mary.

381
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,323
Why don't you understand me?

382
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,322
I Ioved our Master
as much as you did.

383
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,332
We have to honor His memory.

384
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,334
That's why I went to Caiaphas.

385
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:07,337
Caiaphas is wiIIing to Iet us
take the body back to GaIiIee.

386
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,339
We're going to get him back home!

387
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,341
How can this be?

388
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,343
It's a trap!

389
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,345
To bring us out into the open.

390
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,347
They'II arrest us at the tomb.

391
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:18,347
The women...

392
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:21,351
the women have aIready gone to
the tomb, to embaIm him.

393
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,354
Are we cowards?
Leaving the women go.

394
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,357
CaIm down!
! Nothing can happen to them.

395
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:28,858
They're not on the Iist.

396
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,354
Mary!

397
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,363
What's happened?
Where are the others?

398
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:34,864
Were you attacked?

399
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,360
The Master...

400
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:39,369
Speak Mary! Speak!

401
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:40,870
He's gone!

402
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,373
-What go you mean He's gone?
-He's gone.

403
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,369
His body is no Ionger there.

404
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:48,378
They've stoIen our Master's body?

405
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:51,381
-Who has?
-I don't know.

406
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,377
The tomb was forced open.

407
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:57,387
-What about the guards?
-There was no sign of them.

408
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:59,389
You see how much their
word was worth?

409
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:02,392
-You've been tricked!
-Where are the others?

410
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,394
They're stiII there.

411
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:05,895
Let's go!

412
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:08,398
Wait here.

413
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,401
If we don't come back
Ieave tonight!

414
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,403
Don't Iook for us.

415
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,407
Thomas!

416
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,410
You can't stop me
from going with them.

417
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,438
Joanna!

418
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:56,873
Joanna, are you aII right?

419
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,876
Did you see anyone?

420
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,885
No one.

421
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:04,387
Are you sure?
You must have seen someone.

422
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:07,390
The priests? The Romans?
The ZeaIots?

423
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:10,394
No one Thomas.

424
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:11,894
No one.

425
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:14,390
Come on.

426
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:21,405
It's true.
He's not here.

427
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:25,409
Can't you feeI the peace?

428
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:28,411
It is as if death was gone
from this pIace.

429
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,393
It took some strength
to do this.

430
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,404
They wanted to humiIiate Him...

431
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,397
to destroy Him,
even in death.

432
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,410
There's no bIood.

433
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:36,413
No sign of a struggIe.
Nothing.

434
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:40,406
And the guards? They just run off.

435
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,419
So it seems.

436
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:47,417
They take His body,
but Ieave the shroud.

437
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,427
-Graves-robbers!
-No!

438
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:53,354
There was nothing to steaI.

439
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:57,367
The Master was here. He was
worth more than anything.

440
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:58,367
Yes.

441
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,371
That's why we must
Iook for Him.

442
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,373
AII that troubIe, Thomas...

443
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,375
At Ieast I'm trying to
do something, John!

444
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,378
Maybe we shouId just
remember His words.

445
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,380
He never Iied to us.

446
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,382
I'm not doubting His word.

447
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,384
Are you sure, Thomas?

448
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:17,387
The Romans might come back.
We shouId go.

449
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:21,391
He thinks he aIways
knows everything.

450
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,394
Each of us wiII remember the
Master in his own way.

451
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:27,397
They couId be watching us now!.

452
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,399
Let's go!
Let's go, John!

453
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,399
Let's go!

454
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:38,398
The Sanhedrin and the Romans are
afraid that He wiII be remembered.

455
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:42,412
Without His body, who can
say He ever existed?

456
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,416
When we speak of Him
who's going to beIieve us?

457
00:33:47,118 --> 00:33:49,416
''FooIish, but determined''.

458
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,422
That's what Joseph of Arimathea
said of us.

459
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,355
Did you teII him where we
are hiding?

460
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,359
No.

461
00:33:57,895 --> 00:34:00,363
I'm sorry, Thomas.

462
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:03,366
You trusted a friend of
the Romans.

463
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:19,371
-Where's Joseph?
-Joseph is not here.

464
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,385
He's been caIIed to the paIace
by Pontius PiIate.

465
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:31,394
A traitor.

466
00:34:51,482 --> 00:34:54,349
HeIp me, sir. PIease!
I've nothing to eat.

467
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,359
Here.

468
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:04,360
Thank you.
You're a generous man.

469
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,377
So you stiII haven't had enough?

470
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,381
The Iight...

471
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:29,385
I've never seen so much...

472
00:35:29,453 --> 00:35:32,388
-Iight.
-You're keeping us waiting!

473
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,396
Everywhere.

474
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,903
Take him away.

475
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,404
Make sure he speaks to no one.

476
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,406
He's mad. And dangerous.

477
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:56,346
You say you had no contact with
the group of foIIowers.

478
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,348
And no knowledge of Iast night.

479
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:01,351
I aIready toId you
I know nothing about it.

480
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:03,353
You've Iying.

481
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,355
We had you foIIowed.

482
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:11,351
And you? Are you wiIIing to
teII me the truth?

483
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,365
Yes. Procurator. Yes!

484
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,358
Good.
We shaII go to the tomb.

485
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:20,369
Take them both.

486
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:45,395
Woman.

487
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:55,338
Master.

488
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:02,345
Why are you crying?

489
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:06,342
Who are you Iooking for?

490
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:07,349
Master.

491
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:10,353
Mary.

492
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:33,369
Did you break your Ieg?

493
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:36,379
Go away!
Leave me aIone.

494
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,392
I'm sure I was foIIowed.

495
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,395
-So they know we are here?
-I managed to Ioose him.

496
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:59,324
Mary!
What's happened to you?

497
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:03,336
I've seen him.

498
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,341
Who did you see?

499
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,343
The Master.

500
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,345
You saw His body?

501
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,348
He's aIive,
and spoke to me.

502
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,351
-He spoke to you?
-Are you sure?

503
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,353
-Where was it?
-I went back to the tomb.

504
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:21,357
I was desperate.

505
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,363
It was Him...

506
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:32,358
He asked me to bring back
the news to His brother.

507
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:36,372
He has risen.

508
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,374
Come back from the
kingdom of death.

509
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,376
Like Lazarus.
He couId be?

510
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:43,379
-Did you touch Him?
-I embraced His feet.

511
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:46,382
But He toId me to come
back to you.

512
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:56,326
Peter, this can't be true.

513
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:58,328
Wait, Simon, wait!

514
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:02,332
You don't beIieve me?

515
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,328
It wasn't a dream! I saw Him.
He caIIed my name!

516
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:12,342
Maybe it was a man
who knew you and...

517
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,344
wanted to make a fooI out of you.

518
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:16,346
It was the Master.

519
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:22,345
-You know He promise to return.
-Yes.

520
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,355
I aIso know how much
we aII Iong for it.

521
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:28,358
But Mary, if He came back
He wouId come back...

522
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:31,361
to Peter or to John, or Simon,
or to His mother.

523
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:35,365
Or even to me.

524
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:42,362
Mary, why wouId the Master
come back to you first?

525
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,378
Brother, where is your heart?

526
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:50,380
Has it Ieft with your faith?

527
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:54,384
AII of this, has been
prophesied.

528
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:22,412
Master!

529
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:42,424
Master! Is that you?

530
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,428
Speak to me!

531
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,430
Master!

532
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:52,977
Master!

533
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:56,378
Master!
PIease don't Ieave me again!

534
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,384
Joanna!

535
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:03,386
Why were you foIIowing me?

536
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:06,048
-You were Iistening.
-Yes.

537
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,392
But now I know...

538
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,388
you beIieve.

539
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,398
You beIieve He's stiII with us.

540
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,395
I wish it was so easy.
But I can't.

541
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,404
I can't untiI He answers me.

542
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,406
Then you shouId confide in Him.

543
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,409
You don't know how much
I miss Him.

544
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:29,412
You can't imagine how much
I miss Him, Joanna.

545
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:34,407
He'II comfort you, Thomas
I know He wiII.

546
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:38,421
This way.
It's just here.

547
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,366
Come on! Move!

548
00:42:01,245 --> 00:42:02,371
It's Joseph.

549
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:11,381
Come on, Caius, speak up!
What happened?

550
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:13,389
He ordered us, to rest.

551
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:16,385
WhiIe he stood, first guard.

552
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,399
We were sIeeping by the fire when
we were overwheImed by a band.

553
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:23,398
Who were they?

554
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,402
WeII, the dead man's foIIIowers.

555
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,402
Us?

556
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:29,405
CouId you recognize them?

557
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:33,409
It was dark, but I saw Longinus
speaking to one of them.

558
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:36,412
And I recognized him
as a foIIower.

559
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,414
Then when they took the
Nazarene's body out of the tomb.

560
00:42:38,482 --> 00:42:42,418
I heard them shout His name
Iike a war cry

561
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,421
-''Jesus! Jesus!''
-That's outrageous!

562
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:47,423
You feII asIeep on duty!

563
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:50,426
You'II be Iucky if we won't
have you crucified.

564
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:52,428
Get out of my sight!

565
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:54,362
Move!

566
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:01,370
Are you read to taIk to
taIk to me now?.

567
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:03,372
I've answered your questions.
It's aII I know.

568
00:43:03,907 --> 00:43:08,367
You dare speak to the Procurator
of Rome Iike that, Jew?.

569
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,380
If you acted out of compassion,
you made a big mistake.

570
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,383
These peopIe haven't rapaid
your trust.

571
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:16,385
Why wouId they steaI the body?

572
00:43:16,453 --> 00:43:18,387
A caII for rebeIIion.

573
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:21,390
They want to create a martyr here.

574
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,393
-And you are one of them.
-I am not. This is absurd!

575
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:25,393
ReaIIy?

576
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:29,398
Why does Caiapahas teII me that you
came to him with one of them...

577
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:31,400
and asked him for permission
to remove the body?

578
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:32,400
That is true.

579
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:36,394
It's important to know what's
on these peopIe's minds.

580
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:38,407
You haven't understood their
purpose yet yourseIf.

581
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:41,410
ApparentIy you have very weII.

582
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:44,413
TeII me where they are and what
they've done with the body.

583
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,415
I have no idea.

584
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:49,418
When we Ieft the tempIe, the man
ran away and I've never seen him.

585
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:52,421
You are stiII Iying to me.

586
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:57,358
A few more days in a Roman dungeon
and you'II beg us to hear you out.

587
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:59,362
Right.

588
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:02,365
Come on!

589
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:08,363
It's aII Iies.
Why?

590
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:12,364
That's what I'm going to
find out. Come!

591
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:22,385
Why wouId they
invent aII that?

592
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:25,388
First they hide the body,
then they give us the bIame.

593
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:28,391
To make us Iook Iike bandits,
Iike ZeaIots.

594
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,394
The others were right.
We've been fooI.

595
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,396
Caiaphas Iaid a trap.

596
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:35,398
I have to speak with
Joseph of Arimathea...

597
00:44:35,466 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm sure he knows much
more than he admits.

598
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:39,402
But he's Iocked in PiIate's
dungeons.

599
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,406
You work in the paIace, don't you?
You can heIp me.

600
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:47,410
What's the matter Joanna?

601
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:50,413
I have been thinking about
what Mary said...

602
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:52,415
I beIieve her.

603
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,350
As you Iike, It doesn't matter.

604
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:57,353
I'II get in there with
or without you.

605
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,355
Thomas, aII right,
I'II heIp you.

606
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:01,357
Come tonight.

607
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:04,360
No. Tomorrow morning.

608
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:07,356
I'm going to the tempIe
to pray...

609
00:45:07,431 --> 00:45:10,366
teII my brothers I won't Iet
them down.

610
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:13,369
And beIieve me I'm going to
bring back the Master...

611
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:15,371
or I'II die Iooking for him.

612
00:45:16,907 --> 00:45:19,375
And what if He risen?

613
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,378
Then I'II have no fear of dying.

614
00:45:38,095 --> 00:45:41,394
Give thanks IsraeI...

615
00:45:41,465 --> 00:45:45,401
for our Iiberation from heresy...

616
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:49,394
from the heresy of the Nazarene.

617
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:51,407
And pray...

618
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:53,340
pray IsraeI!

619
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,345
That His foIIowers be judged.

620
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:59,348
They stoIe His body.

621
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,342
They wish to perpetuate
His memory.

622
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:07,356
His infamous memory....

623
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,359
for generations to come.

624
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:12,361
That's a Iie Caiaphas!

625
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,357
We didn't take Him.

626
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:17,366
He was our Master.

627
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:21,370
You know who took Him. You soId
Him to the Romans.

628
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:23,372
How much did PiIate give you?

629
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,374
How many insuIts can you take
JerusaIem?

630
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:28,377
How many curses can you
put up with?

631
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:31,380
We Ioved our Master.
Look! Look!

632
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:34,383
This is the shroud we Iaid Him in.

633
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:36,385
We didn't take His body!

634
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:38,387
You don't have to take my
word for it.

635
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:41,390
You can come and see for
yourseIves. Come and have a Iook!

636
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:44,393
The tomb was vioIated Iast night
by vandaIs.

637
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:46,395
No! Stop him!
Stop him!

638
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:49,398
Come on!
Come to with me!

639
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:51,400
Stop him!

640
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:53,333
Stop him!

641
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:01,336
Where are you going?

642
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:03,345
Attack them?

643
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:24,367
Brave taIk, friend!

644
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:26,368
AImost as rousing as ours.

645
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:28,370
-Barabbas.
-So, you remember me?

646
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:31,373
How couId I forget?
I have nothing to do with you.

647
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:35,377
If you'd fought at our side, your
Master wouId stiII be aIive.

648
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:38,380
My Master couId have saved
HimseIf. He dind't want to.

649
00:47:38,448 --> 00:47:40,382
He chose to die, you say?

650
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,384
Maybe He chose weII.

651
00:47:42,452 --> 00:47:45,387
He's certainIy more usefuI
to cause dead than aIive.

652
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:48,390
You don't know it yet, but you're
dead too as dead as your Master.

653
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:52,394
My Master was a prophet. You
refused to Iisten to the word.

654
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:54,327
IsraeI has too many prophets!

655
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:56,332
We need warriors!

656
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,335
Your Nazarene said he was
preparing a new kingdom.

657
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:01,337
We were armed and ready for
the oppressor but...

658
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:03,339
He dind't want to fight.

659
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:04,840
And that's why He died.

660
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,338
You shouId have been crucified
instead is Him.

661
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:13,349
A brave man!
I respect you!

662
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:15,351
You'd better than Him!
You're one of us!

663
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:18,354
The struggIe continues and
the time is ripe.

664
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:22,358
His body is gone and
the peopIe are up in arms.

665
00:48:22,426 --> 00:48:24,360
You took His body, dind't you?

666
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:27,363
-We're warriors, not vuItures.
-Who did it then?

667
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:29,365
The crows, the worms, who cares?

668
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,367
I do!

669
00:48:31,435 --> 00:48:35,371
I've Iost many friends,
I know how you feII.

670
00:48:35,439 --> 00:48:38,374
But the dream is over.
It's time to act.

671
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:40,376
The peopIe Iove me.

672
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:44,380
JerusaIem wiII soon be ours.
Join us!

673
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,382
You and the others.

674
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,385
It's your onIy chance to survive.

675
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:10,332
Jesus, PIease!

676
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,335
Give me a sign!

677
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,344
Give me a sign!

678
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:31,360
I need a sign.

679
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:01,390
Thomas, here you are!

680
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:05,383
-Take this!
-What about the guards?

681
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,397
Don't you worry, they don't pay
any attention to the servants.

682
00:50:19,943 --> 00:50:22,411
We must keep our eyes open!

683
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:24,413
Be vigiIant!

684
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:46,435
-Bejamin?
-Yes?

685
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:49,438
Thomas this is Benjamin.
He's a friend.

686
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:51,440
He can heIp you get
into the prison.

687
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,878
Come!

688
00:50:58,915 --> 00:51:00,382
This way.

689
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:08,383
Quiet!

690
00:51:15,265 --> 00:51:16,892
This is the pIace.

691
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:23,906
He's in here.

692
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:27,910
Joseph!

693
00:51:29,279 --> 00:51:30,405
Thomas!

694
00:51:33,116 --> 00:51:34,913
What are you doing here?

695
00:51:34,985 --> 00:51:37,419
That doesn't matter!
I know why you're here.

696
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:39,421
I've come to ask you something.

697
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:41,923
Why did you take me to Caiaphas?

698
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:45,428
You stiII don't trust me, do you?

699
00:51:45,495 --> 00:51:49,431
If I were on their side
I wouIdn't be here, wouId I?

700
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:53,367
I thought Caiaphas had some degree
of independence. I was wrong.

701
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:55,370
You took us straight into a trap.

702
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:56,370
I didn't.

703
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:58,373
Caiaphas was with us at first.

704
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:01,376
Are you trying to teII me they
fooIed you too?

705
00:52:01,444 --> 00:52:02,376
Yes.

706
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:07,372
Do you beIieve what the soIdiers
said at the tomb?

707
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:11,386
-How do you know about that?
- I was there, I heard.

708
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:15,391
They were just saying what
they'd been toId to say.

709
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,392
-By whom?
-PiIatos is conceaIing something.

710
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,394
The story of the centurion...

711
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:23,398
Longinus didn't pIease him.

712
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:26,401
Do you think Romans
took Jesus's body?

713
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:29,405
I don't think so.

714
00:52:29,472 --> 00:52:31,406
Why wouId they fIog
their own men?

715
00:52:31,474 --> 00:52:33,408
But it wasn't Barabbas,
I spoke to him.

716
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:35,410
You have to come with us!

717
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:50,426
Come on! Hurry up!

718
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,358
WeII, Caiaphas? Another
provocation from the discipIe...

719
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:02,371
of the Nazarene and Barabbas.

720
00:53:02,439 --> 00:53:04,373
-And what do your men do?
-NobIe PiIate!

721
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:06,375
They wait for us to arrive.

722
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:09,378
It's a deIicate moment, and
at the tempIe I...

723
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:12,381
I shouId have crucified Barabbas
aIong with the Nazarene.

724
00:53:12,449 --> 00:53:14,383
Hasty action in JerusaIem wouId
have gone up in fIames!

725
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,385
Give me peace, Caiaphas!

726
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:18,387
Or this city may stiII burn
to the ground.

727
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:23,392
The body's gone and the peopIe
are restIess.

728
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,394
We'II soon have another
insurrection on our hands.

729
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:27,389
Now...

730
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:30,399
where is the body?

731
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:32,401
I think you know where.

732
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,402
Vetutius.

733
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:38,407
I had nothing to do with it,
nor did His discipIes.

734
00:53:38,475 --> 00:53:41,410
So you are one of them.
You admit it?

735
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,407
Yes.

736
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:48,417
I'm one of them.

737
00:53:48,485 --> 00:53:49,417
WeII...

738
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:54,355
and we've got you right where
you beIong, haven't we?

739
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:59,361
Back to his ceII,
where he may rot.

740
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:00,361
Go!

741
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:12,363
But I shouId warn you that
Nazarene's foIIowers have...

742
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:14,376
begun to spread a rumor.

743
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:16,378
That we stoIe the body ourseIves?

744
00:54:16,446 --> 00:54:18,380
No.

745
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:21,383
That their so-caIIed Messiah
has risen from the dead.

746
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:23,385
Risen from the dead!

747
00:54:26,456 --> 00:54:28,390
These peopIe wiII
beIieve anything.

748
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:34,397
We advise you to send your
centurion away from JerusaIem.

749
00:54:35,265 --> 00:54:39,395
If these stories shouId spread,
we'II see no end of them.

750
00:54:39,469 --> 00:54:41,403
You deaI with your own peopIe,
Caiaphas!

751
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:44,907
Longinus is in no position
to harm anyone.

752
00:54:47,277 --> 00:54:49,404
I've done my duty.

753
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:01,349
Forgive me, Joseph!

754
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,358
It's aII my fauIt.

755
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,360
I'm going to get you out of here.

756
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,362
Don't think about me.

757
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,365
-They're going to torture you.
-Be patient, Thomas.

758
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:13,368
A IittIe whiIe Ionger,
and aII wiII be cIear.

759
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:17,372
WiII it? Jesus is dead.
We've Iost.

760
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,374
We can't wait for a miracIe.

761
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,376
You don't beIieve in miracIes?

762
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:25,369
I beIieve Jesus couId have
conquered the worId...

763
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:27,382
I don't beIieve He can
conquer death.

764
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:31,386
Conquer death...?

765
00:55:32,922 --> 00:55:35,390
A woman says...

766
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,392
she saw Him by His tomb.

767
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,394
Is she teIIing the truth?

768
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:42,390
We're aII distraught.

769
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,399
I think she thinks she saw Him.

770
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:48,396
Trust me Thomas,
this isn't over.

771
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:50,405
There's more to come.

772
00:55:51,941 --> 00:55:54,341
QuickIy! This way!

773
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:07,356
No.

774
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:10,359
-There he is! That's him!
-Don't Iet him scape!

775
00:56:10,427 --> 00:56:12,361
The soIdiers are coming.

776
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:14,363
Get out of the way!

777
00:56:18,902 --> 00:56:21,370
Don't Iet him get away!

778
00:56:21,905 --> 00:56:24,373
This way.

779
00:56:24,908 --> 00:56:27,376
-Did you speak with Joseph?
-Yes.

780
00:56:27,444 --> 00:56:31,380
I have to get to Longinus,
before he gets kiIIed.

781
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:33,382
Be carefuI, Thomas.

782
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,384
Don't Iet them catch you.

783
00:56:35,452 --> 00:56:37,386
I'II do my best.

784
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:41,883
May the Lord heIp you
find yourseIf.

785
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:04,335
Do you want to come with me?
I'II give you a good price.

786
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:09,351
No one wants me anymore.
AII they ask is girIs of 1 2 or 1 3.

787
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,372
Keep it.

788
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,375
Listen, what's this
strange story...

789
00:57:33,443 --> 00:57:35,377
about a disappearing body?

790
00:57:35,445 --> 00:57:38,380
Are you joking? It's aII they
are taIking about in the city.

791
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:44,380
Now they say they've tortured
Longinus, PiIate's centurion.

792
00:57:44,454 --> 00:57:45,386
Longinus.

793
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:49,384
-Do you know him?
-Of course I know him.

794
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:52,394
The Romans say he's gone out of
his mind, but I don't beIieve it.

795
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:55,329
And where is the centurion now?.

796
00:57:56,199 --> 00:57:59,327
No one knows, friend.
No one knows.

797
00:58:00,203 --> 00:58:03,331
What about the other soIdiers
that were there at the tomb?

798
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:06,341
There's Caius,he's first officer.

799
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:08,343
They've fIogged him too.

800
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,346
I bet you couId find him in
the baths after that.

801
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:45,380
By the gods!

802
00:58:45,448 --> 00:58:50,385
I swear I'II kiII someone
if I'm not seen to now.

803
00:59:06,202 --> 00:59:09,330
Easy.
Easy.

804
00:59:09,872 --> 00:59:14,332
Bastard.
Pontius pighead PiIate!

805
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:20,337
Twenty-five years service
and what did he get me?

806
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:22,350
The bastards couId have
kiIIed me.

807
00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:29,358
AII right, Caius is going to Iook
out for his own interests now.

808
00:59:29,425 --> 00:59:31,359
There's no justice in this worId.

809
00:59:33,229 --> 00:59:35,356
Jesus of Nazareth...

810
00:59:35,431 --> 00:59:39,367
They tire you out whipping Him,
two hours fIogging.

811
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:41,369
That's work, hard Iabor, you know?.

812
00:59:41,437 --> 00:59:44,372
And then they put you
on crucifixion detaiI.

813
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,375
With no food in your beIIy.
I'm not Iying.

814
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:49,377
Look at me,
I'm skin and bones.

815
00:59:49,445 --> 00:59:52,380
And then they make you
guard His tomb aII night.

816
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:55,383
And if you doze off...

817
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:57,385
then they whip you just for
good measure!

818
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:01,382
It's not fair!
Why me?

819
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:06,384
The Gods must have an end
for poor oId Caius.

820
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:10,398
Maybe it was His God.
You whipped Him?

821
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:15,392
I'm a Roman soIdier
he's a Jewish criminaI.

822
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:16,403
A criminaI.

823
01:00:16,472 --> 01:00:18,406
Even worse than
the rest of them...

824
01:00:18,474 --> 01:00:20,408
one who wants to be pitied.

825
01:00:22,278 --> 01:00:24,405
Like Longinus...

826
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:27,408
he got his...

827
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:30,418
for being a sympathizer.

828
01:00:30,486 --> 01:00:32,420
Longinus.

829
01:00:32,488 --> 01:00:34,422
What happened to Longinus?

830
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,424
-Curious, aren't we?
-It's just that...

831
01:00:36,492 --> 01:00:41,429
everybody says that he knows where
Jesus's body disappeared to.

832
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:46,428
Too curious for this not
to be personaI.

833
01:00:47,303 --> 01:00:50,431
You! I saw you at the tomb.

834
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:53,373
You're one of the
Nazarene's foIIowers.

835
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:55,377
Don't!

836
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,379
It's just a matter of business.

837
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,381
There's a Iot in it
for you if...

838
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:02,384
you give me the right information.

839
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:05,387
WeII, I'II even seII you the body,
if that's what you want.

840
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:09,391
I'II give you whatever
you ask for.

841
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:12,394
WeII, don't exaggerate.
It's just a corpse.

842
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:16,387
This evening
in front of the catacombs...

843
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,401
bring goId!

844
01:01:30,947 --> 01:01:33,415
Fresh vegetabIes! Look at these.

845
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:35,417
Let me see those.

846
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:41,415
My price is generous!

847
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:44,426
-Brothers!
-Thomas! You're back!

848
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:47,429
-Where have you been?
-Mary, I've found Him.

849
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:49,431
I'm going to get
Him tonight.

850
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,433
-Thomas!
-Joanna! I've found Him!

851
01:01:51,968 --> 01:01:54,368
I'm going to get
Him tonight.

852
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:55,369
Thomas...

853
01:01:55,438 --> 01:01:57,372
we've seen Him.

854
01:01:57,907 --> 01:01:59,374
Right here...

855
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:02,377
He's aIive.

856
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:03,377
He's returned.

857
01:02:03,913 --> 01:02:06,381
The master has risen as
He promised.

858
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:08,383
He's truIy the Son of God.

859
01:02:08,451 --> 01:02:10,385
-No, wait! I was...
-We aII saw him!

860
01:02:10,453 --> 01:02:12,387
And He spoke to us.

861
01:02:14,924 --> 01:02:16,391
Why?

862
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:19,387
Where?

863
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:21,396
When?

864
01:02:21,464 --> 01:02:25,400
In this room, at dusk, just after
you Ieft as we were...

865
01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:31,396
breaking bread, exactIy as we did
on the night before He died.

866
01:02:31,474 --> 01:02:33,408
He came to us, Thomas...

867
01:02:33,476 --> 01:02:35,410
as He said He wouId.

868
01:02:38,948 --> 01:02:41,416
And why did He come...

869
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:44,419
after I'd gone?

870
01:02:44,487 --> 01:02:47,422
Joanna, you saw Him too?

871
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:49,424
I was with you.

872
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,363
I was searching for Him,
risking my Iife to find Him.

873
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:58,366
And when I'm gone
He appears to you.

874
01:02:58,434 --> 01:03:02,370
He said, ''Go in peace. As my
Father sent me...

875
01:03:02,438 --> 01:03:06,374
I shaII send you to baptize
and to spread the word.''

876
01:03:06,442 --> 01:03:09,377
''In my name you shaII
cast out deviIs...

877
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:11,379
and heaI the sick.''

878
01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:13,381
''The sins you forgive...

879
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:18,386
shaII be forgiven.''

880
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:20,388
And who are you, Simon...

881
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:22,390
to forgive what they did
to our Master?

882
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,393
You're aIIowed to speak in
Jesus' name, just because...

883
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:28,396
you waited?
Does searching mean nothing?

884
01:03:28,464 --> 01:03:30,398
Thomas, you need to rest.

885
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:32,400
Be mercifuI to yourseIf.

886
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,404
You wish to forgive
me too, Peter?

887
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:40,397
So you can do the same
for others.

888
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:43,411
You're such a kind man.

889
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,417
AII right.
I accept it.

890
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,417
-You saw Him.
-Yes!

891
01:03:52,488 --> 01:03:56,356
He stood before you,
but I didn't see Him!

892
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:59,353
I was in the wrong pIace.

893
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,358
I aIways seem to be
in the wrong pIace.

894
01:04:05,234 --> 01:04:07,361
Then take our word for it!

895
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:09,370
I can't.

896
01:04:09,906 --> 01:04:12,374
You're just dreamers...

897
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:14,375
or cowards.

898
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:22,384
I beIieve them.
Why won't you?

899
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,378
You're Iooking for something
that does not exist.

900
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,388
Why don't you see that?

901
01:04:30,459 --> 01:04:32,393
I can't

902
01:04:34,263 --> 01:04:38,393
I won't beIieve untiI
I put my finger...

903
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:42,403
into the naiI hoIes in His hands
and put my hand into His side.

904
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:47,401
Then I wiII beIieve.

905
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:53,339
Tonight I'm going to
bring back His body.

906
01:04:54,216 --> 01:04:57,344
-Then you'II see.
-Thomas! Thomas!

907
01:04:57,887 --> 01:05:01,345
Why are you searching
eIsewhere...

908
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:04,359
for what you have aIready?

909
01:05:24,914 --> 01:05:28,372
Fine, put him with the others.

910
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:30,385
Caius?

911
01:05:30,453 --> 01:05:32,387
At your service.

912
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:35,382
No, the body first.

913
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:38,393
First the truth.
Who's paying you?

914
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:40,395
The owner of the tomb.

915
01:05:40,463 --> 01:05:43,398
If you're Iying, I'II kiII you.

916
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:47,402
Show me the way.

917
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:19,356
-Who brought Him here?
-You ask too many questions!

918
01:06:21,237 --> 01:06:23,364
Why?
Why here?

919
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:25,373
He's dead, isn't He?

920
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:28,376
They're aII dead!
New arrivaIs!

921
01:06:29,245 --> 01:06:31,372
Barrabbas!

922
01:06:31,447 --> 01:06:33,381
You finaIIy got yours,
my friend.

923
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:35,383
You Iook better dead!

924
01:06:52,935 --> 01:06:55,335
This is heII.

925
01:06:57,206 --> 01:06:59,333
A weak stomach?

926
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,337
Here He is.

927
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,368
-It's not Him!
-You're mistaken!

928
01:07:27,436 --> 01:07:29,370
This is not the
Master's body!

929
01:07:29,438 --> 01:07:32,373
This the man!
Now you pay me!

930
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:35,376
Take his body or you'II
wind up in PiIate's hands!

931
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:45,386
HeIp!
HeIp me!

932
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:47,388
HeIp!
HeIp me!

933
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,327
Come!

934
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:25,360
Why did you saved my Iife?

935
01:08:25,427 --> 01:08:28,362
You know I wouId have returned you
in to PiIate anyway, don't you?

936
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:35,359
Jesus taught me to
Iove my enemies.

937
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:38,365
Wait!

938
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:41,375
What can I do for you?

939
01:08:42,912 --> 01:08:45,380
HeIp me find Longinus.

940
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:51,376
He's been exiIed across the desert
where they send the mad peopIe.

941
01:08:51,453 --> 01:08:54,320
Hurry if you want to find
him aIive.

942
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,322
Now go!

943
01:08:59,862 --> 01:09:02,330
Go!

944
01:09:43,072 --> 01:09:44,369
Master!

945
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,374
Master!

946
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,392
Get away from there!

947
01:11:22,938 --> 01:11:25,406
Get back there!

948
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:42,417
I suppose you don't want to spend
the day with these animaIs.

949
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:44,425
Why don't you come over with us
to have some wine?

950
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:46,427
What about the prisoner?

951
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:49,430
He's a beast Iike the others!

952
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:52,433
Come on!
He's not going anywhere!

953
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:54,366
AII right, we'II come.

954
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,378
Here!

955
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:06,380
Give me some too!

956
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:08,382
Over here!

957
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:22,396
I want some bread too!

958
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:42,416
-I'm starving!

959
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:49,423
Bread?

960
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:51,425
Bread?

961
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:55,355
You know Longinus?

962
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:57,365
-Longinus.
-Longinus?

963
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:11,379
Do you know Longinus?

964
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:14,374
Who's Iooking for me?

965
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:18,386
Longinus!

966
01:13:18,454 --> 01:13:21,389
Longinus!
Look at me!

967
01:13:21,924 --> 01:13:23,391
You know me?

968
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:27,387
Who stoIe the Nazarene's body?

969
01:13:31,934 --> 01:13:33,401
I know...

970
01:13:34,269 --> 01:13:36,396
I was there...

971
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:39,399
no... body.

972
01:13:44,947 --> 01:13:48,405
Come on.
Come with me.

973
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:07,361
It's you...

974
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,366
the mad Jew who wanted
to take the body.

975
01:14:12,441 --> 01:14:14,375
Yes.

976
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,377
Who took him?

977
01:14:23,919 --> 01:14:25,386
The Iight.

978
01:14:27,256 --> 01:14:29,383
What do you mean by the Iight?

979
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:32,386
Light.
Sky.

980
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:34,395
AbIaze

981
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:35,395
At midnight.

982
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:41,396
The stone over the tomb,
it roIIed away.

983
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,407
Then what happened?

984
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:50,400
I went to the tomb...

985
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:52,413
on my knees.

986
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:58,352
-And?
-He...

987
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:01,355
-was gone.
-Gone?

988
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:05,348
The tomb was empty.

989
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:10,357
Water pIease!

990
01:15:10,432 --> 01:15:11,364
Water!

991
01:15:18,907 --> 01:15:20,374
Here.

992
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:36,383
So much Iight...

993
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:43,397
the searing...

994
01:15:43,465 --> 01:15:44,397
Iight.

995
01:15:54,409 --> 01:15:55,341
BIind.

996
01:16:57,873 --> 01:16:59,340
Where am I?

997
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:04,337
With the Essenes.

998
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:09,342
They'd hide a Roman soIdier?

999
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:15,356
Jesus said that
aII men are brothers.

1000
01:17:20,896 --> 01:17:23,364
But I naiIed him to the cross...

1001
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:28,361
with my own hands...

1002
01:17:35,911 --> 01:17:38,379
The way,he cried...

1003
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:41,374
''Father...

1004
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,378
into Your hands...

1005
01:17:46,254 --> 01:17:49,382
I commit my spirit.''

1006
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:56,329
TruIy this man was...

1007
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,326
the son of God.

1008
01:18:03,872 --> 01:18:05,339
And I...

1009
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:08,335
pierced him with my spear

1010
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:11,338
His bIood went aII over me!

1011
01:18:18,887 --> 01:18:21,355
I kept spear head...

1012
01:18:29,898 --> 01:18:32,366
-at the tomb.
-Yes.

1013
01:18:34,069 --> 01:18:37,368
You asked me If I knew.

1014
01:18:43,078 --> 01:18:45,376
I found Him.

1015
01:18:52,087 --> 01:18:54,317
I haven't...

1016
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,317
I'm stiII searching.

1017
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:07,323
-We'II take care of him.
-Don't worry.

1018
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:15,402
Across the desert...

1019
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:20,400
to find a bIind man.

1020
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:36,416
Why?

1021
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:38,425
Why?

1022
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,428
I don't understand you Lord.

1023
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:47,434
Why?

1024
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:49,429
Why?

1025
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:03,377
I know you feeI sorrow now,
but I wiII see you again,,,

1026
01:21:03,919 --> 01:21:07,377
and our hearts wiII rejoice,,,

1027
01:21:07,455 --> 01:21:10,390
and no one wiII take
our joy from us,

1028
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:25,398
What do you want
from me, Lord?

1029
01:21:26,274 --> 01:21:28,401
HeIp me to accept it.

1030
01:22:04,913 --> 01:22:06,380
HeIp me!

1031
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:09,383
HeIp!

1032
01:22:17,258 --> 01:22:18,384
Thomas.

1033
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:21,395
Thomas.

1034
01:22:24,265 --> 01:22:26,392
Thomas.

1035
01:22:27,268 --> 01:22:29,395
I prayed for you!

1036
01:22:29,471 --> 01:22:32,406
How I prayed that the Lord
wouId bring you back safeIy!

1037
01:22:32,474 --> 01:22:35,409
Come inside! The others wiII be
so happy see you!

1038
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:37,411
No I can't!

1039
01:22:37,946 --> 01:22:39,413
I can't.

1040
01:22:42,484 --> 01:22:46,420
Joanna, I'm Ieaving JerusaIem.

1041
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:51,417
PIease, come with me.

1042
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,358
The discipIe must
stay together now.

1043
01:23:00,235 --> 01:23:02,362
-You know that.
-Yes.

1044
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:04,371
Why won't you
see your friends?

1045
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:06,373
Friends?

1046
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:09,376
-What have they done to you?
-Friends?

1047
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:13,369
My friends? What have I
done to my friends?

1048
01:23:14,249 --> 01:23:15,375
My friends.

1049
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:18,385
-Thomas.
-I can't face them.

1050
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,387
I can't!

1051
01:23:20,455 --> 01:23:23,390
Thomas,I don't understand.

1052
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,392
What happened to you?

1053
01:23:26,261 --> 01:23:28,388
What happened to you down there?

1054
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:31,391
Did you find Longinus?

1055
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:33,400
Longinus.

1056
01:23:33,468 --> 01:23:35,402
Longinus...

1057
01:23:37,272 --> 01:23:39,399
he toId me...

1058
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:42,409
how he naiIed our Master
to the cross...

1059
01:23:42,944 --> 01:23:45,412
how he whipped Him...

1060
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,412
kiIIed Him.

1061
01:23:46,948 --> 01:23:50,406
But he's not the one who
caused our Master...

1062
01:23:50,485 --> 01:23:53,352
the most suffering,
I'm the one.

1063
01:23:53,421 --> 01:23:55,355
I'm the one.

1064
01:23:55,423 --> 01:23:57,357
Longinus beIieves in Jesus...

1065
01:23:58,226 --> 01:24:02,356
but I doubt. I doubt Him.
I doubt myseIf.

1066
01:24:03,231 --> 01:24:06,359
I doubt you.
I doubt everyone.

1067
01:24:06,434 --> 01:24:08,368
Even my brothers.

1068
01:24:10,905 --> 01:24:14,363
That's why you won't see them?

1069
01:24:19,914 --> 01:24:22,382
I don't deserve...

1070
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:25,385
their forgiveness.
How con they forgive me?

1071
01:24:26,254 --> 01:24:29,382
There's no pIace for me
amonstg Jesus' friends!

1072
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:32,392
That's not true.

1073
01:24:32,927 --> 01:24:34,394
Thomas.

1074
01:24:37,265 --> 01:24:39,392
Who are you to say that?

1075
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:42,395
You're onIy ashamed...

1076
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,404
about what you did.

1077
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:50,410
You know what
you have to do now.

1078
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:31,385
Come.
Don't be afraid.

1079
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,398
Come.

1080
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:52,398
Peter!

1081
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,342
Thomas!

1082
01:25:56,211 --> 01:25:57,337
Thomas!

1083
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,347
You're back!

1084
01:26:08,223 --> 01:26:10,350
Forgive me.

1085
01:26:10,425 --> 01:26:12,359
Forgive me, Peter.

1086
01:26:13,228 --> 01:26:15,355
Forgive me.

1087
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:18,358
You're back!

1088
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:22,369
Forgive me, brothers!

1089
01:26:24,906 --> 01:26:27,374
I was fiIIed with doubt.

1090
01:26:27,442 --> 01:26:29,376
We aII were.

1091
01:26:29,444 --> 01:26:30,376
Yes, but...

1092
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,380
I was without faith.

1093
01:26:34,249 --> 01:26:36,376
I was searching for something...

1094
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:38,385
I couId never find...

1095
01:26:38,453 --> 01:26:40,387
because there was nothing
to be found...

1096
01:26:41,256 --> 01:26:43,383
We must Iook for him
amongst the Iiving.

1097
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,393
Thomas!

1098
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:51,391
Joseph! You're free!

1099
01:26:52,934 --> 01:26:55,334
The prison gates
suddenIy burst open.

1100
01:26:56,204 --> 01:26:57,330
He was there.

1101
01:27:03,211 --> 01:27:05,338
You've seen Him too?

1102
01:27:06,214 --> 01:27:08,341
You trust us now?.

1103
01:27:10,218 --> 01:27:12,345
TeII me what to do.

1104
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,354
You're aII I have Ieft now.

1105
01:27:14,889 --> 01:27:17,357

Peace be with you!

1111
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,377
Thomas.

1112
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:46,379
Thomas!

1113
01:27:49,257 --> 01:27:52,385
You've been caIIing me
for so Iong...

1114
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:56,328
and now I'm here
you won't speak with me?

1115
01:27:58,866 --> 01:28:00,333
My Lord...

1116
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:02,335
pIease forgive me.

1117
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:06,332
My faith had Ieft me.
Forgive me.

1118
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:09,342
Then I shaII give you proof.
Come cIoser.

1119
01:28:11,045 --> 01:28:12,342
No, Master!

1120
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:14,347
I need no proof!

1121
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:16,349
-I need no proof!

1123
01:28:19,887 --> 01:28:21,354

1129
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:48,381
My God.

1130
01:28:54,856 --> 01:28:58,314

1131

1132
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:11,330

01:29:11,406 --> 01:29:14,341

01:30:29,484 --> 01:30:32,419

1140
01:30:37,959 --> 01:30:41,417
-I hope to see you again soon.
-Goodbye, James.

1141
01:30:43,965 --> 01:30:46,433
-Joseph.
-Thomas.

1142
01:30:47,935 --> 01:30:49,425
You keep these.

1143
01:30:52,507 --> 01:30:54,372
No, they're yours.
You keep them.

1144
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:57,370
No, I don't need them anymore.

1145
01:31:01,249 --> 01:31:02,876
Have a safe journey.

1146
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:05,552
May God be with you.

1147
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:08,381
God bIess you.

1148
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:11,225
We shouId be going.

1149
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:21,401
Joanna...

1150
01:31:21,936 --> 01:31:24,404
thank you.

1151
01:31:35,283 --> 01:31:37,410
Mother Mary...

1152
01:31:37,485 --> 01:31:39,419
give me your bIessing.

1153
01:31:40,288 --> 01:31:42,415
Go! Thomas, go...

1154
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:45,418
go and teII the word
what you have seen...

1155
01:31:46,294 --> 01:31:48,421
Jesus has risen.

1156
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:12,385
And now our hope...

1157
01:32:12,453 --> 01:32:14,387
is greater than our fear...

1158
01:32:15,256 --> 01:32:17,383
Take a smaII grain of wheat...

1159
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:19,392
when it dies into the soiI...

1160
01:32:19,927 --> 01:32:22,395
a newer wheat is to be born...

1161
01:32:22,463 --> 01:32:24,397
and it grows and ripens.

1162
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:27,400
Therefore we must not Iay our eyes
onIy on what we can see...

1163
01:32:27,935 --> 01:32:33,396
but have faith instead in what
we're not yet abIe to see...

1164
01:32:34,942 --> 01:32:39,402
because visibIe things Iast
just for one moment...

1165
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:44,417
whiIe what we are yet
to behoId wiII Iast forever.
