1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,660
Gossip girl here,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,900
Your one and only source

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,260
Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,830
Say those three words, and I'm yours.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,360
I... will never say those words to you.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,900
We were just playing chess, and she was another piece

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,630
That you needed to knock over on your way to take the queen.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm really glad you're nate's friend.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,160
He really needs someone like you right now.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,660
Hope you don't mind, but we've got a lodger.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
That's not my dress!  it's my dress.

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,030
You can't make me give up my job with eleanor.  watch me.

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,960
Your dad asked me to bring over all my stuff on homeschooling.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,900
Every girl fantasizes about finding her prince charming.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,060
But if that prince refuses to come...

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,100
You are late. time for breakfast. I'll be down in a minute.

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,460
I just have to finish something.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,460
A girl has to take matters into her own hands.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,030
Don't forget--god always watching, miss blair.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,830
Wait, no.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,430
What do you mean the herringbone won't arrive until tomorrow?

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,160
The meeting with the buyers from bloomingdale's is today.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
No, I don't care about italian customs. if the electricity goes out,

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,900
I think we found a new energy source. she's making me dizzy.

25
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,760
Fine, then you can be the one to tell eleanor that yourself.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
Stupid! stupid italians.

27
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,130
Oh, oh, I know, with their pizza and pasta and... michelangelo.

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,460
But apparently not their herringbone. dad, you don't understand.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,100
Eleanor put me in charge, and it's a really big deal. honey, breathe.

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,460
No, no time for oxygen. I am late.

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh, and I forgot my homework.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,430
Seriously, she's making me feel like a slacker.

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,430
Maybe I can help you fix that.

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,430
Tomorrow night's the aaron rose opening at the gallery.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,440
Vanessa and I could really use your help setting things up.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
Aaron rose is that artist

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,660
You--you discovered up at r.i.s.d., right? yeah, the kid's amazing.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,600
Homework, headset, handbag, check, check, check.

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,400
I have to pee. guys, have you seen my sketchbook?

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,530
Oh, no, no, nate! whoa, sorry! oh, my gosh.

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,930
Jenny-- sorry, uh...

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,130
You--did you do something with your hair?

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,600
Uh, yeah. shorter, blonder. I was--i was bored.

44
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,600
I like it. it looks-- it looks good.

45
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,760
Oh, go ahead and use the bathroom. I'm sorry. oh, no.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
I didn't mean to-- no, no, no. I'm gonna go. it's fine. I'll just...

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,700
No, no, no, no. no, no, no, it's fine. bye.

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,330
Okay.

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Want to get in?

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,830
I'd love to give you a ride.

51
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,800
Oh, I'm sure you would.

52
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,830
Too bad you've made the terms of that arrangement impossible.

53
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,960
About that--maybe I was a little too hasty.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Come on. get in.

55
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,030
Maybe I don't want you anymore.

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,830
Don't torture me.

57
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,630
I'm dying.

58
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,000
All you have to do is say those three magic words.

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,300
I hate you.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,230
Eleanor waldorf.

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,460
Dude, I love that dress.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,230
Thanks.

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,560
I mean, thanks on behalf of eleanor waldorf designs.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,100
I'm agnes, by the way. I think we've worked together,

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,160
'cause I kind of recognize the top of your head. jenny, and yeah,

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,500
'cause I think I recognize your feet.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Um, excuse me a minute. okay.

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,860
Eleanor, I think the buyer from bloomingdale's is here.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,060
Should--should I take notes, or what do you...

70
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,860
Uh, you said I could be in the meeting today, remember?

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,760
Well, not today.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,200
I need you to finish that.

73
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,400
Robert?

74
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,360
Darling.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I am so glad they sent you. come. you are going to love it.

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,230
Jenny?

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,930
Nate? what are you doing here?

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,430
I found this when you left, and I thought

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
You might need it, so... oh, my gosh, I do. thank you. thank you so much.

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
Sure. that was really nice of you.

81
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,730
Well, I'll let you-- let you get back to work. yeah, I'll see you later.

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,100
Bye. bye.

83
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,000
That guy is totally into you.

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,300
Uh, no, he's not. he thinks of me like a little sister.

85
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah, a little sister he'd like to do.

86
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,330
No. no, he doesn't. yeah, yes, yes.

87
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,030
How's the--how's a.p. economics treating you?

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,430
Um, well, today there was a rousing debate

89
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,360
About inflation versus liquidity,

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,560
Which isabelle settled by calling warren buffett.

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,130
Apparently, he's her godfather.

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Hey, um, so the other night,

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Seeing you was really nice.

94
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,430
I know the first leg

95
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Of the dan/serena "let's be friends" tour

96
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,660
Was a disaster, but, uh... well, we were young and stupid then.

97
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,300
Now we're older and wiser.

98
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,260
You have to help me destroy chuck bass. ooh.

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,460
All right, I'll take that as my cue to leave. oh, you're very perceptive.

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,200
Dan, wait. if you're having a problem with chuck,

101
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,900
Then a man's perspective could be helpful.

102
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,930
Just because you two are making a doomed attempt

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,200
At being friends doesn't mean I have to play the enabler. blair, come on.

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,600
Well, if you're plotting against chuck bass,

105
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,760
Then i--i'm sure I can think of something.

106
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,530
Fine.

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,530
I have an itch that only chuck can scratch,

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,400
And he won't oblige unless I tell him I love him. ugh.

109
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,830
You--you need help getting chuck to sleep with you? really?

110
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,060
You hear the judgment in his voice right now, right?

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,500
He--he's working on that.

112
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,560
Yeah. you're right. I'm sorry. uh, no--no judgment, only help.

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,330
So do you love him? no! no, of course not.

114
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,200
Then why don't you just say it to get what you want?

115
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,100
Frat guys have been doing that since forever. I can't.

116
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,200
If I say it, then chuck wins.

117
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,030
Right, but if you say it, then you get him, and you win.

118
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,200
No, I lose. see? this is totally pointless.

119
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,760
I was thinking I would just disappear for a while

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,830
And give him a taste of life without me. no, no, no.

121
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,830
That's a terrible idea.

122
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,660
Don't disappear. become unavoidable.

123
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
Chuck may be a deviant, but he's still a man.

124
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,200
So just, you know, drive him crazy,

125
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,330
Wear him down. you should be good at that.

126
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,310
Look who finally got a little interesting.

127
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm sure it's a fluke.

128
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,330
See? isn't this nice?

129
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,960
Ugh. even broken up, you guys make me nauseous.

130
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,630
Jenny!

131
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,830
I am so sorry about today with robert.

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,300
I know you wanted to be at that meeting.

133
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,430
It's okay. I've just been so on edge,

134
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,400
Because these meetings with these buyers

135
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,650
Have not been going the way that I had expected.

136
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,860
I don't understand.

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,930
The--the runway show went so well.

138
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,700
That's this season. they want to know about next season.

139
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,460
Fortunately, robert did see one dress that he was very fond of.

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,560
I didn't know you started anything for next season.

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,360
I haven't. he--he loved the dress that you are wearing.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,030
Barneys and bendel's are coming tomorrow.

143
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,530
I have to have something to show them.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,300
Um, you could show them this dress.

145
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, if you're offering.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,560
I do think that it would be good for both of us.

147
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,900
Right, 'cause then I could be in those meetings?

148
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,900
Absolutely. when those buyers leave here,

149
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,100
They will know the name jenny humphrey.

150
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,560
So you are going to have to remake that dress

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
In my fabrics, of course.

152
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,100
Um, um, eleanor, the meeting's tomorrow.

153
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,530
I-i don't even have a pattern for this dress.

154
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,300
I'd have to take the whole thing apart

155
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,360
And completely make a new one.

156
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,930
You expect me to reschedule barneys and bendel's?

157
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,130
Okay. I guess i... better get to it.

158
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,230
Yeah.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,060
Want to get a drink?

160
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,700
Want to say those three little words?

161
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,960
No.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Then no drink.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,700
Why? scared you won't be able to handle it?

164
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,960
Spotted-- upper east side beauty

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Laying down the gauntlet for her favorite beast.

166
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,030
But careful, princess. it's gonna take more

167
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,900
Than a little leg to get this prince to ravish you.

168
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
I'll have one drink with you,

169
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,200
Unless you can convince me why I should stay, of course.

170
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,800
Well, just because we've reached an impasse

171
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,460
On a certain issue doesn't mean we can't be friends.

172
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,360
So ever since charlize theron became the face of dior,

173
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,660
I've wanted to change my signature scent.

174
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,710
I've been trying out a new one.

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,730
I can't decide if I like it.

176
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,260
Would you mind?

177
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,160
It smells a little like desperation.

178
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,660
Yeah, well, I'll just keep on looking. thank you.

179
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,960
You've been very helpful.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,660
To friendship.

181
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,500
Oops! I am so sorry.

182
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,200
Let me help you with that.

183
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,760
I gave you a shot.

184
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,900
And while your efforts were admirable,

185
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm bored, and you ruined my pants.

186
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,430
Good night, blair.

187
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,300
Hi. um, I'm looking for dan humphrey.

188
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,530
Uh, yeah, he's here with vanessa somewhere.

189
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,700
Cafe? maybe?

190
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,360
Uh, wait.

191
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,360
What do you think? if no one comes to the show,

192
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
You might be the only one who ever reads it.

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,830
Um, well, I don't know much about art.

194
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,760
But I do know a lot about spelling, so...

195
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,930
Oh, no.

196
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,930
I think maybe you--you should have had someone proofread it

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,850
Before you stuck it to the wall.

198
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,730
Are you kidding me? where did I mess up?

199
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,460
-I-i went over it a hundred times! -I'm kidding.

200
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,460
Wow. you haven't even said your name.

201
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,830
-You're already humiliating¡£-sorry about that.

202
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,060
Good, so you'll stop abusing me then?

203
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,460
No, but I will introduce myself. I am serena.

204
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
Uh, aaron.

205
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,830
Oh! aaron. then--then-- then you're the artist.

206
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah.

207
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,300
I have to meet rufus at the storage space.

208
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,600
He is stressing. if his right eye starts to twitch,

209
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,060
-That's when you have to break out the valium. -too late.

210
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,860
He's been winking nonstop since lunch.

211
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,800
The caterer thought he was hitting on him.

212
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,920
-Hey, could you, uh, get that for me? -it's, uh, blair.

213
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Since when does she call you?

214
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,060
Oh, uh... I'm--i'm helping her with this thing.

215
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
-Um, I gotta take this. sorry. -All right.

216
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,300
Hello?

217
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,300
I just wanted to thank you

218
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,500
For encouraging me to throw myself at chuck.

219
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,500
I can skip dinner now that I'm so full on humiliation.

220
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,800
-Chuck was completely unmoved. -well, are you--are you sure

221
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,620
He wasn't just acting like it didn't work?

222
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,900
Unfortunately, there was no hard evidence of that,

223
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,160
Literally.

224
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,830
I didn't even get the chance to show him my necklace

225
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,700
Tangled up in my hair.

226
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,500
The nape of the neck is chuck's kryptonite.

227
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,260
oh, that's good to know.

228
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,400
-So he just got up abruptly,and he,he left? -like a bass outta hell.

229
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,500
Well, then you got him right where you want him. trust me.

230
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,500
He's headed home. intercept him.

231
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,900
I'll let you know what happens.

232
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh, please don't.

233
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,430
So I don't get it. where--where's the mike?

234
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,300
Oh, they're hidden. there's a bunch all around the gallery.

235
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,200
Well, I hope people only have nice things to say

236
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,930
About you and your show, because you're gonna hear 'em.

237
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Well, I guess you'll have to come and find out.

238
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,860
Serena?

239
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,660
-Hey. you been here long? -no, uh, not that long.

240
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,400
Okay, well, you hungry? 'cause we should get going.

241
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,060
See you later, aaron. yeah, you,

242
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,700
uh, you two have fun on your date.

243
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, no, it's-- it's not a date. yeah, no, we're, uh, we're just fr--

244
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,200
We--we used to date, but we're friends now.

245
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,560
I should get back. dude, eleanor is a slave driver.

246
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,930
But don't worry. I'll get you home in time

247
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,330
-I'll get u home To get all your work done. -ladies.

248
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,060
By the way, I love your dress.

249
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,060
I mean, I've been coveting it all day.

250
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Who makes it? I mean, it's definitely not eleanor waldorf. .

251
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,760
not yet Um, no, I made it, actually.

252
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
No way. okay, no, now I am wearing it. come on.

253
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,430
What am I gonna wear?

254
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Uh, jenny, this is max. max, jenny.

255
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,930
Hi. hey, what's happening?

256
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,830
I cannot believe you told blair to go to my house to seduce chuck.

257
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,860
well, I would have sent her to my place, but I thought

258
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,520
It might be awkward a little bit with nate on the couch, so... yeah.

259
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,330
How's that been with nate?

260
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Oh, it's been good, actually. it's been really good.

261
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,430
I don't think I ever realized how much he--

262
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,910
Oh! is this the third time blair's texted me?

263
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,630
Uh, fifth, actually, I think.

264
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, she wants to know if I have candles.

265
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,630
Ew. no. I'm--i'm sorry.Um, go on.

266
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,860
no, I was just saying I don't think I ever realized how nate--

267
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,660
Is this driving you crazy, too?

268
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,930
-No. no, it's--it's fine. -oh, she's getting cocky now.

269
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,260
What are you doing, blair?

270
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,200
Serena knew how upset I was.

271
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,830
She didn't want me to be alone,

272
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,900
So she invited me to sleep over.

273
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,300
Go away, chuck.

274
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,760
It's pointless. I'm not gonna say it.

275
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,100
I don't care.

276
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Ignore it.

277
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,200
Give it!

278
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,930
You almost had me, blair.

279
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,200
Almost.

280
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,100
Hey, you bitch.

281
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,930
No, no, no. you are a bitch.

282
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,460
You must've taken, like, a million pictures tonight.

283
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,760
It's what I do.

284
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,600
I like photographing you, though.

285
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,960
Okay, wait, wait. that was trish and saskia,

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
And, uh, they just got off wor so they want to meet up now.

287
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,200
Uh, no, agnes, I gotta go.

288
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,760
I-i have so much work to do, it's not even funny.

289
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,130
No, sweetie, this is work.

290
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,600
I mean, trish and saskia are, like, the hottest stylists.

291
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,860
She's right. you should meet these girls.

292
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,500
They do editorial for "nylon" and "paper" all the time.

293
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,100
-I mean, it sounds awesome, but i -no, no, no. listen, sweetie,

294
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,830
Just come and say hi for, like, five minutes.

295
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,530
That's nothing. you can sleep when you're dead, baby.

296
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,900
Which is gonna be tomorrow when eleanor kills me.

297
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm sorry. i-i am gonna have to pull an all-nighter as it is.

298
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,660
-I have--i have to go. -all right, suit yourself.

299
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,030
Agnes!

300
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,830
Agnes, you have my dress!

301
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,160
Excuse me. I need--excuse me.

302
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,760
Excuse me. agnes!

303
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,800
This is agnes. you know what to do, bitches.

304
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,800
Sorry, j., but in the real world,

305
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,160
You can't take a note to the principal

306
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,260
When a drunken model eats your homework.

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
Agnes, I'm gonna kill you.

308
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,730
No, dude, no, no, no, trust me. i-i'm sorry.

309
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,730
I just got all of your messages.

310
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,430
Look, here, take the dress, and I don't think that

311
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,160
You should give this to eleanor, by the way.

312
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,000
-I mean, my friends,they freaked over it last night. -great. I don't care.

313
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay, seriously, you work your ass off, and for what?

314
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,250
So eleanor can rip off your ideas?

315
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,700
No, eleanor promised that I could be in the meetings

316
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,060
With the buyers from bendel's and barneys today.

317
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,230
Just like she introduced you to the guy from bloomingdale's.

318
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,300
Look, come here, okay? no. stop.

319
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,600
Jenny, come here. agnes! oh, my god, I don't have time for this. what?

320
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,830
Just look at this, okay?

321
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,200
I mean seriously, this can be an ad campaign.

322
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,230
Yeah, that does look pretty cool.

323
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,000
I mean, right? and look, you can do whatever you want to do,

324
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,200
But, I mean, what do you think people will say when they see

325
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,060
That jenny humphrey's finally gone on her own?

326
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,230
I don't know. "jenny humphrey's so young to have her own line"?

327
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,430
Or "too bad jenny humphrey's stuff

328
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,900
Looks exactly like eleanor waldorf's."

329
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,580
Blair waldorf in brooklyn.

330
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,500
-You two,are you two lost? -will you talk to her, please?

331
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,750
I--there's nothing to talk about. I told you it's over.

332
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,130
She stopped listening to me. maybe she'll listen to you.

333
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,600
Um, sure.

334
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,760
I'm gonna go check out the art in the art gallery.

335
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Talk.

336
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,530
Oh, she's back.

337
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,630
Wow, this is looking complicated.

338
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,100
Don't worry.

339
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,060
You walk in on surgery halfway through, it looks like murder.

340
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,060
-Can I help? -you know how to weld?

341
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,560
Um, I've seen "flashdance" several times.

342
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,630
You and chuck have been toying with each other forever.

343
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,560
So you didn't win this one. you ever think maybe you

344
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
-Should just, I don't know, let it go? -this is different.

345
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,860
Why?

346
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,560
Do you--do you love him?

347
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,430
Wow. someone loves chuck bass.

348
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,930
I don't know. I just...

349
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,030
I... I don't understand how it got to this place.

350
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,400
You know, the first time that I told serena I loved her,

351
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,760
Uh, it was terrifying. I've never felt so exposed.

352
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,660
But the feeling that I got when she said it back to me

353
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,760
Uh, was probably the single greatest moment of my life.

354
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,630
But you broke up.

355
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,200
Doesn't mean I wouldn't do it all over again.

356
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,000
If I say it, he wins, and if he wins,

357
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,300
Then I'll just be another girl to him.

358
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,530
You don't know that that's true.

359
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,800
You have to decide what's most important to you--

360
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,360
Keeping your pride and getting nothing or taking a risk

361
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,530
And--and maybe, maybe, having everything.

362
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,660
Well, I almost lost a finger in the process,

363
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,130
I might be permanently cross-eyed, but I did it.

364
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you. you look like hell.

365
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,060
You should go home.

366
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,330
Uh, the buyers are gonna be here any minute.

367
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,530
Yeah, I know. that's why I'm gonna need every moment alone

368
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,630
To figure out what the hell am I gonna do? this dress is a mess!

369
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,530
It's not my finest work, but I wouldn't call it a mess.

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,300
The seams aren't finished, the zipper gapes,

371
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,530
And--and you finished the hem on the machine.

372
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,500
I told you that once the machine ate my fabric,

373
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,330
-I had to start all over.  -Stop lying to me.

374
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,330
I know where you were last night.

375
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,630
Laurel caught the interns looking at pictures

376
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,700
Of you and agnes out at some trashy bar.

377
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,660
Look, I'm sorry.

378
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
I thought I could still get it done in time.

379
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,730
You want to be a grown-up and have a real job?

380
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,600
You have to accept real responsibility

381
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,030
And the consequences for your actions

382
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,030
When you don't come through.

383
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,500
I should've known better than to give so much responsibility

384
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,230
To a child.

385
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,760
A-a child?

386
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,660
I'm sorry, but this child seems to be the only one

387
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,860
That can design anything that the buyers are remotely interested in.

388
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,860
This is not about that dress. you are using that dress

389
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,860
As an excuse because you are scared

390
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,530
That if I am in that meeting and meet someone important

391
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,630
That they will want to be in business with me and not you.

392
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,260
You are lucky I don't fire you this minute.

393
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,400
Oh, you are lucky that I don't just quit,

394
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,100
Because then what would you do?

395
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,460
Go on home. I'll see you monday.

396
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,960
Can I at least have my dress back?

397
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Sure. it's of no use to me anyway. here.

398
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,260
I don't mean this one.

399
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,230
You touch this dress, you will never set foot in here again.

400
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,600
Sometimes the most important thing to know

401
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,130
Is when to get out...

402
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,730
And when to give in.

403
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,010
So i-i'd say this was a success.

404
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,280
Makes me realize what a bust all my other openings were.

405
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,510
Well, I'm gonna let you bask in your glory,

406
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,680
Because serena's here, and...

407
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,010
And she brought blair... again.

408
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,010
That's the second time that girl was here today.

409
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,850
You're not...

410
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,480
I'm not what? oh, no. oh, no, no, no, no. no, no.

411
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,210
I'm not--no. I mean, serena wants us to get along,

412
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,680
But not like that. no, that would, uh, that would be sick.

413
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,150
Why don't we just tell serena you're not interested

414
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,150
In being friends with blair?

415
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,110
oh, we just started hanging out again.

416
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,980
I don't want to rock the boat. hey.

417
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,310
This is a huge turnout. Aaron must be so thrilled.

418
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,810
And your dad.

419
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,980
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty exciting.

420
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,550
Uh, so I thought you were gonna be with chuck tonight.

421
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,610
-What happened?  -oh, she is, um, but she told him to meet her here.

422
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,480
She needed some moral support.

423
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,680
Yes. she is freaking out. she needs a drink.

424
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,950
Let me see what I can do about that for her.

425
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,380
So first nate's a part of the family,

426
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,580
And then I see you've invited blair to my opening? seriously?

427
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm sorry. i-i know. I know. I didn't invite her,

428
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,650
But serena and blair tend to be a package deal.

429
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,580
And I don't know. I've--i've recently

430
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,750
Sort of seen another side to her, and...

431
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,220
I mean, she's not that bad.

432
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,210
Are you kidding? you're talking about blair waldorf.

433
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,980
She and chuck just used me as catnip

434
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,050
For one of their twisted little games,

435
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,340
-And what they did was really messed up. -i-i had no idea.

436
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Why didn't you tell me that?

437
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,510
Truthfully, i-i was embarrassed.

438
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,210
And the weird part is

439
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,780
That chuck wound up being the more human of the two.

440
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,410
At least he felt a little bad about it. not her.

441
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,510
-What?  -no, it's just--i can't believe that I allowed myself

442
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,850
To be sucked in by blair waldorf.

443
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,010
What do you think?

444
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,050
Um, I think that you are officially a successful artist.

445
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,050
Well, thank you. you know what they say--

446
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,250
"success is nothing without someone to share it with."

447
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
They do say that.

448
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,110
So who are you planning to share it with?

449
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,280
Uh, my dad,

450
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,450
My nana, my dog mookie, named by nana.

451
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,450
She's a huge mets fan.

452
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,180
And, uh, and you.

453
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,710
Uh, uh, you. I was hoping you.

454
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,280
Maybe dinner?

455
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,480
Uh, sorry. i, um, I'm not really dating right now.

456
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,980
The vague and unsatisfying "i'm not dating right now" response.

457
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,810
I know it well.

458
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,150
-Usually I'm giving it, not getting it.  -sorry.

459
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,650
Yeah, I can tell,

460
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,750
Which is why I'm gonna give you a second chance.

461
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,750
If you can tell me the fate of cecil the caterpillar,

462
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,250
I will go out with you.

463
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,250
Okay, I don't really date crazy people who speak in riddles.

464
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,750
Just think about it,

465
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,210
And when you figure it out, I'm yours.

466
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,180
Chuck just texted me. he wants to meet me on the roof.

467
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,180
The roof? well, this way, if he doesn't say it back,

468
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,450
Then I can just jump. then he'll be really sorry.

469
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,450
Oh, no. don't do it, b.

470
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,980
You don't want your obit to say you died in brooklyn.

471
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,480
Wish me luck.

472
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,910
Good luck.

473
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,280
Hey. stay there.

474
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,280
Blair, I need to talk to you.

475
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,210
-I can't. chuck's waiting for me.  -I know. it's about that.

476
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,880
Just, um, you know, be--be careful.

477
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,810
Well, why? you said to be the opposite of careful.

478
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,070
-You told me to take a risk.  -Right. I know. I know.

479
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,480
But i--it--it was bad advice,

480
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,280
'cause when I said that,

481
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,280
I was thinking of how things were for--for serena and me.

482
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,280
I mean, we're talking about chuck here.

483
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,080
-It's not the same thing. yes, it is, and it's gonna be okay.

484
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,480
Sure, well, maybe. just before you say anything,

485
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,150
Make sure he's done playing games.

486
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,650
He is. now if you'll excuse me...

487
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,380
Hey. I didn't know you guys were coming.

488
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,790
-Hey. I'm gonna go say hey to aaron, okay?  -okay.

489
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,750
Yeah, max knows aaron from r.i.s.d.,

490
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,070
So he wanted to come and say hi

491
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,550
and I wanted to see you

492
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,610
After hearing about your crazy stunt with eleanor.

493
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,610
Yeah. I'm actually just about

494
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,180
To go tell my dad about that one.

495
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,180
Before you do, guess what?

496
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,180
The editor from "nylon" saw the photos from last night.

497
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,250
He wants to do a feature on you as a designer to watch.

498
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,250
Agnes, since I quit eleanor's,

499
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,710
I am an unemployed, homeschooled 15-year-old.

500
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,130
I'm not even an intern to watch. dude, relax.

501
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,250
Max and I were just talking about it.

502
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,250
You should do your own clothing line.

503
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,710
Yeah, sure. with no money, no contacts, nobody knows who I am.

504
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,450
That sounds like a fast track to success.

505
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,250
Stop coming up with reasons not to do it

506
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,410
And just make some more dresses.

507
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,610
I can model them. max will do some photos.

508
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,910
I mean, you can totally do this. you really think so?

509
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,380
Yes. now you're gonna come with me to this party,

510
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,410
And you're gonna meet this editor,

511
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,580
'cause he's dying to meet you.

512
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,810
So are you my bitch or what?

513
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,710
I am. I am totally your bitch. good.

514
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,480
Jenny, hey. hey, wait up.

515
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,480
Hey, are you taking off already?

516
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,550
Uh, yeah. me and my friends are going to a party. oh, I didn't know.

517
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,390
I-i was hoping we could hang out tonight, but...

518
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,080
Well, there's always tomorrow at the loft.

519
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,310
Really? I mean, I kind of doubt that.

520
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,950
You're always working now, like last night,

521
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,090
And the night before, and the, you know...

522
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,180
Yeah, well, I actually quit eleanor's.

523
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,650
Wait. you quit eleanor's?

524
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,410
That job was-- was everything to you.

525
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,410
I know. um, it might sound crazy,

526
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,280
But I'm actually thinking of starting my own line.

527
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,110
Really? what does your dad think about that?

528
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,110
Okay. um, I was hoping for a--

529
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,650
More of like a, "congratulations, jenny"

530
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,180
Or at least a monosyllabic "wow," but...

531
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,180
No, look. I mean, come on, jenny.

532
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,060
You really think you can start your own business right now?

533
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,950
You coming, jen?

534
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,580
Uh, yeah. be right there.

535
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,350
Hey. how old is that guy? okay, that guy's name is max,

536
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,350
And he went to r.i.s.d. with aaron,

537
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,510
And he's an amazing photographer.

538
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,850
He's gonna shoot my line. look, I gotta go.

539
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,450
Um, my friends are waiting for me,

540
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,750
So I guess if my dad asks, just tell him I'm at eleanor's. wait.

541
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,050
Brooklyn?

542
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,510
At least it will be memorable.

543
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,250
I'm sorry, but don't you have something

544
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,450
you want to say to me?

545
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,250
Yes.

546
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,380
This is so silly. what does it matter who says it first?

547
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,380
Why don't we just say it together?

548
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,680
Because that wasn't the deal.

549
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,380
Why does everything have to be a deal?

550
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,780
Because we made it one.

551
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,750
What's going on, blair?

552
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,750
You told me you had something to say to me.

553
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,080
Say it.

554
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,910
Why do I have to be the one to go first?

555
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,880
I was the one who waited on that helipad for you.

556
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,410
I went to tuscany alone. it's ancient history.

557
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,610
I was the one who asked you to say it first. at the white party?

558
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,580
When you were on your way out with the count?

559
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,580
Did you really think I was going to say it then?

560
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,950
Yes, and when you didn't, I wanted to die.

561
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,480
Don't tell me you brought me

562
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,050
all the way to brooklyn for this

563
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,050
I thought you were ready to tell me how you really felt.

564
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,780
Obviously it was just another one of your games.

565
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,510
My games? you're the one who started this.

566
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,750
And you're the one who finished it.

567
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,850
E me. I don't think we've met yet.

568
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,180
Nate. aaron.

569
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,580
Nice to meet you. yeah, a pleasure.

570
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,750
That guy max that was here earlier?

571
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,110
Is he a friend of yours? yeah, yeah, I know him from school.

572
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,480
Yeah? what's his deal. max's deal? uh, he's a--he's a great guy,

573
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,610
As long as he's not dating your little sister.

574
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,610
Yeah. uh, listen, I gotta say hello to somebody...

575
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,750
Oh. but, uh, thank you for stopping by.

576
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,750
I reallyppreciate it. cool. great work.

577
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,410
Yeah, thanks.

578
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,280
Excuse me.

579
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,480
Hey, b., what happened? it was a disaster, okay?

580
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,380
I'm leaving. no, I'll come with you.

581
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,210
No, it's fine. you stay. I just have to get out of here now.

582
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,580
Hey. hey. do you know what happened? why is blair so upset?

583
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,650
Uh, yeah. look, look, blair and chuck

584
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,650
Were gonna self-destruct at some point,

585
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,910
So I just-- I may have helped it along.

586
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,950
Wait. you intentionally sabotaged blair? I know you're upset,

587
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,480
And that--that was not my intention,

588
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,760
But I just found out they completely

589
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,860
screwed over vanessa. no.

590
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,650
Whatever they did to vanessa, that's different.

591
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,580
This is about two people who love each other. blair and chuck? c-come on.

592
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,510
I don't understand. I thought you wanted to help blair.

593
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,580
No, I did this for you, 'cause you wanted me to help her.

594
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,580
I don't care about blair waldorf.

595
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,570
All of this is a-- it's--it's all a game to her.

596
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,780
No, in this case, it's not.

597
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,810
Blair loves chuck. she's just been too scared to admit it.

598
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,310
I told her to talk to you

599
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,750
Because I genuinely thought that you would help her be brave.

600
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,080
These are amazing.

601
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,580
Thank you.

602
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,510
Good thing you like 'em, 'cause soon it'll be shots

603
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,180
Of you and your clothes up there.

604
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,710
Um... if you guys want to be alone,

605
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,910
That's cool. I can just call later. why would we want to be alone?

606
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,210
I don't know. you just--you said we were gonna go to a party,

607
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,210
And it's getting kind of late, so...

608
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,910
Well, nobody goes until midnight anyway. right.

609
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,210
Oh! I love this song.

610
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,980
Yeah. come on.

611
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,910
Yeah. come on.

612
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,550
Okay.

613
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,380
Hey, chuck. hey. wait a second.

614
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,880
Come on. don't act like you didn't hear me.

615
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,010
I heard you. I was just choosing to ignore you.

616
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,510
Well, don't,

617
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,040
Because what just happened with you

618
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,780
And blair-- it's none of your business.

619
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,780
No, it is, actually.

620
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,110
Look, I don't know how you feel about her,

621
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,550
But I do know how she feels about you,

622
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,210
And she was going to tell you until I stopped her.

623
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,410
Oh, my god, agnes.

624
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,650
Oh, come on. now it's your turn.

625
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,410
Uh, yeah. no way.

626
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,250
Oh, why not? because of max?

627
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,650
No. I don't know. it's just weird.

628
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,980
Well, no, it's not. he doesn't care.

629
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,280
He's a photographer. come on.

630
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,710
Are you afraid that eleanor waldorf

631
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,850
Is gonna find out and get mad at you?

632
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,280
Fine.

633
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,580
Yeah, do it for eleanor.

634
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,710
Um, who's at the door? I don't know.

635
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,210
Wait. agnes, are you crazy? don't answer it.

636
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,150
What have we here?

637
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
Jenny humphrey caught in her knickers

638
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,680
By nate, her knight in shining armani.

639
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,180
Nate, what are you doing here? no, jenny, what are you doing here?

640
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,650
Come on. get your stuff. let's go. no.

641
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,150
That's so sweet. sweetie, I told you he liked you.

642
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,510
I totally called that one. yeah. dude, relax. nothing's going on here.

643
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,950
Take a picture. yeah, I'm not-- I'm not leaving with you.

644
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,480
Then I can wait.

645
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,450
Fine.

646
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,990
-sorry  -come on

647
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,110
Serena, hey. serena, hey. look, I'm--i'm--i'm sorry, okay?

648
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,110
I'm sorry. I was out of line. yeah, you were.

649
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,110
Look, I'm sorry that blair and chuck messed with vanessa.

650
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,150
She doesn't deserve that, but instead of hurting blair,

651
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,150
You should have been honest with me. i-i know. it's just--

652
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,550
Look, it's about what happened last time with amanda.

653
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,550
I was worried what would happen if we fought,

654
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,930
'cause i-i really want this to work

655
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,550
with us. yeah, me, too,

656
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,950
But it's not going to if we can't talk to each other

657
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,710
yeah. you're right.

658
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,010
Okay, so--so let's--let's talk. let's be friends. let's...

659
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,180
There was something I wanted to tell you.

660
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,210
Um... aaron asked me out.

661
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,050
But I said no, because i-i wasn't sure how you would feel.

662
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,080
But I kinda want to say yes.

663
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,680
Wow. look at that,

664
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,910
Just diving into the deep end of honesty.

665
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,550
Headfirst.

666
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,050
Look, I like aaron.

667
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,710
He's a good guy, so, uh, you have my blessing,

668
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,610
If that's what you're looking for.

669
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,880
Well, he--he does seem nice,

670
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,580
And even though we just met,

671
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,650
I feel like I've--i've known him my...

672
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
Oh, my god.

673
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,480
What?

674
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,580
"cecil the caterpillar." camp suisse.

675
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,750
Uh, did you just-- are you having a seizure,

676
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,840
'cause you're speaking in tongues. no, I'm sorry.

677
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,950
I just--i just realized that i-i do know aaron.

678
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,780
We went to summer camp together,

679
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,410
And there was this song about cecil the caterpillar.

680
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,780
I-i can't believe I didn't recognize him.

681
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,910
Oh, wow. you--you went to--you went to camp in europe together.

682
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,410
Uh, that's cute.

683
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,250
No, it was--it was much more than just camp. we got married.

684
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Uh, there was a small ceremony with licorice rings

685
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,180
On the banks of lake geneva. it was tasteful. mm. what happened?

686
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,680
Well, I took a bite out of my ring, so he asked for a divorce.

687
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,110
But we were happy for a time.

688
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,210
I can't believe-- I have to go find him.

689
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,950
D-do you mind?

690
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Oh. no, of course not. no.

691
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,510
I, uh, I have to find vanessa anyway.

692
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,250
Look, he's the-- he's the ex-husband.

693
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,950
I'm just the ex-boyfriend.

694
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,310
The problem with fairy tales is

695
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,150
That they set a girl up for disappointment.

696
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,510
In real life,

697
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,180
The prince goes off with the wrong princess...

698
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,510
Or the spell wears off

699
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,350
And two lovers realize they are better off as...

700
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,710
Well, whatever they are.

701
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,650
Are you here to gloat? over what?

702
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,410
Well, you won. pop the champagne. I didn't win.

703
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,650
Then why does it feel like I lost?

704
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,180
The reason we can't say those three words to each other

705
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,850
Isn't because they aren't true.

706
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,810
Then why?

707
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I think we both know

708
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,550
That the moment we do,

709
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,550
It won't be the start of something. it'll be the end.

710
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,950
Think about it.

711
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,080
Chuck and blair going to the movies.

712
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,950
Chuck and blair holding hands.

713
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,650
We don't have to do those things.

714
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,050
We can do the things that we like.

715
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,210
What we like is this...

716
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,710
The game.

717
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,480
Without it, I'm not sure how long we'd last.

718
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,410
It'd just be a matter of time before we messed it all up.

719
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,750
Look, I'd rather wait.

720
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,610
Maybe in the future...

721
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,280
I suppose there could be some excruciating pleasure in that.

722
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,550
How could you do that to me? what are you talking about?

723
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,380
You're lucky I showed up when I did. what?

724
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,050
That was a bad scene, jenny. no, it wasn't, okay?

725
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,610
We were dancing around in our underwear, not making a porno.

726
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,380
Not yet, anyway.

727
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,710
No, not ever! I would never let myself

728
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,380
Get in a situation like that.

729
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,380
All right? I know what I'm doing, nate. no, I know you think you do,

730
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,790
But that guy was taking advantage of you.

731
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,750
Okay, you are not my father and you are not my brother,

732
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,780
So why do you care so much?

733
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,650
Because...

734
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,150
But I'll confess.

735
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,150
Every once in a while, a girl craves her fairy-tale ending.

736
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,110
So sleep tight, kiddies.

737
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,950
It seems like little j. got her happily ever after.
