00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,948
<i>A story like mine should never be told.</i>

3
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:51,864
<i>For my world is as
forbidden as it is fragile.</i>

4
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:59,671
<i>Without its mysteries it cannot survive.</i>

5
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:04,052
<i>I certainly wasn't born
to the life of a Geisha.</i>

6
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,813
<i>Like so much in my strange life</i>

7
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,796
<i>I was carried there by the current.</i>

8
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,754
<i>The first time I knew
my mother was sick,</i>

9
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:23,849
<i>was when my father threw
the fish back into the sea.</i>

10
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:29,733
<i>That night we went hungry, to
understand emptiness he told us.</i>

11
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,510
<i>Mother always said that my
sister Satsu was like wood.</i>

12
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,548
<i>As rooted to the earth as a Sagura
tree. But she told me I was like water.</i>

13
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:50,797
<i>Water can carve its
way, even through stone.</i>

14
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:56,989
<i>And when trapped,
water makes a new path.</i>

15
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,839
-These are the girls from Tanaka?
-Sisters, yes, from Yurida.

16
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,098
This one maybe, the other one no.

17
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:33,922
Show your respect for mother. You
must not speak, I will answer for you.

18
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:48,965
Kneel, and head down,
never look her in the face.

19
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:10,535
-How old are you?
-She’s year of the rooster.

20
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,897
Only nine...

21
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,320
Where is my sister?

22
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,720
Let me see those eyes.

23
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,928
Look at me.

24
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:55,703
-Too much water.
- But mother, a little water is good to guard against fire.

25
00:07:55,703 --> 00:08:00,707
You wouldn't have to worry about the
okea burning, losing all your people, no....

26
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:05,916
These country girls! Too
late to send her back now.

27
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,122
Go.

28
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:26,505
Pumpkin, keep her quiet,
mother is downstairs

29
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,444
Let me go!

30
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,908
Let me go! Let me go!

31
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,968
-Mother will hear you! She's got a bamboo stick.
-I want my sister. Satsu!

32
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,230
I cried too at first.

33
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:01,367
You know it is easier if you just forget
everything that happened before you came to the okea.

34
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,681
If you impress mother,
and do exactly as she says,

35
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,784
She will send you to
school to be a Geisha.

36
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,619
-A what?
-A Geisha, like Hatsumomo.

37
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:22,724
You will get to drink
sake, and sleep until noon.

38
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:27,831
-Where is my sister?
-Probably in another okea in Hanonoke.

39
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,233
Your family sold you to this
house, you live here now.

40
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,925
Outside you wear these, inside these.

41
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:04,934
We don't display our
naked feet like monkeys.

42
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,783
It's not flesh we're selling here,

43
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:13,997
This is a Geisha house.

44
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:18,346
Remember to always honour this okea.

45
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:24,794
You listen, you learn, now get to work.

46
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:28,389
Be quiet Hatsumomo is sleeping.

47
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:37,978
-Pumpkin, when can I go outside?
-Outside the okea? You can't.

48
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,938
It’s not allowed.

49
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:43,104
How will I find Satsu?

50
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:47,252
You can't just walk out to
every house in Hanamachi.

51
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:52,184
Do you know how many there are?

52
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,535
Look.

53
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,499
Tighter!

54
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,102
Chiyo, Chiyo-chan

55
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:54,347
Come.

56
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,896
Two nights ago, Hatsumomo had to
stay at the Tea-house until dawn,

57
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,424
thats what she told mother.

58
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,987
But she was really here
with a man, the whole...

59
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:07,223
Why can't you be quiet?!

60
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:16,625
So, this is the new arrival.

61
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:45,859
A pity she still stinks of fish.

62
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,425
Stay out of my room.

63
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:58,270
Your fingers smell .I can't
have you touching my things!

64
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:17,628
Only reason mother tolerates Hatsumomo
is because she brings in good money.

65
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:23,134
Never forget it is Hatsumomo
who pays for your supper,

66
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,093
the clothes on your back.

67
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:32,741
By the time she was twenty, she had
already earned back her purchase price.

68
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:40,646
She has been the talk of
the Hanamachi ever since.

69
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:47,257
-These are all hers?
-Certainly not, they belong to the okea.

70
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:59,101
A Geisha needs an elegant wardrobe,
just like an artist needs ink.

71
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:03,436
If she's not properly dressed
then she is not a true Geisha.

72
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:08,407
-Nobody told me what a Geisha is.
-You will find out soon enough.

73
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:15,718
I have news for you child, mother has determined
that it is off to school with you.

74
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:21,021
You are to become Geisha!

75
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:28,350
Chiyo, Pumpkin!

76
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:36,632
Quick quick, don't be
late, and you will be late.

77
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,379
Go,go.

78
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,640
This way.

79
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,895
Pumpkin, Pumpkin…

80
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,106
I'm going to run, I'm
going to find Satsu.

81
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,001
Not yet you don't.

82
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,412
You will ruin your own
chances, and mine too.

83
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,594
Please,stay with me.

84
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,365
Squid!

85
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,638
Look for your sister's name later!

86
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,125
You are late!

87
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,726
Chiyo, where is granny's food?

88
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,124
Where have you
been? It’s freezing cold!.

89
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,266
Close the window. Hai! (yes).

90
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,190
Chiyo, Chiyo, come quickly.

91
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,107
Hatsumomo is at the bath-house

92
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:15,892
-Here tidy up.
-But she told me to stay ... !

93
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:20,701
Hatsumomo does not run this okea.

94
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:38,484
Look who's in my room...

95
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,072
Did you touch this?

96
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:12,714
I can just hear the General now why
Hatsumomo, you used to smell of jasmine,

97
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:17,087
What’s this new perfume? Blowfish?

98
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:21,993
I told you to never to touch my
things. Can’t you understand why?

99
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:30,986
Because your general will
say, Hatsumomo you stink!

100
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:41,249
At least you don't smell as bad as
your sister.You know, she was here...

101
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,332
She came by looking for you.

102
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,070
What?

103
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,837
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

104
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,727
Please, tell me where she is.

105
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:58,665
Only if you swear yourself
to me first.Yes? Huh?

106
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,582
Now get out!

107
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:37,201
Hatsumomo you'll wake the entire
house. Your big sister is thirsty, so am I,

108
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,515
go and get us some beer.

109
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:43,646
-I'm not in the mood for beer.
-I know what you're in the mood for.

110
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:49,586
And his name is Koichi

111
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:52,881
What did you say Korin?

112
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:57,891
I'm sorry.I forgot.

113
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:07,429
You're just jealous
someone cares for me!

114
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:15,673
Guess who this belongs to? A Geisha as desired as
she is ought to keep a closer eye on her clothes.

115
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,948
It’s Mameha's?!

116
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,850
How did you get it? Bribed her maid.

117
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:38,160
We can't, give it to her.

118
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,799
Chiyo, come, come.

119
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:50,379
Now then little Chiyo, it is
time to practice your calligraphy.

120
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,421
There.

121
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:12,334
Remember, you swore yourself to me. Yes.

122
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:44,231
Don't let anybody see you.

123
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,516
Go, go!

124
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:57,847
This will teach the great Mameha.

125
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,813
Thieving rat!.

126
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:33,341
-That kimono was worth more than you.
-Careful, you will hurt yourself more than her.

127
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,778
Let me.

128
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:54,963
Kneel. What have you done to Hatsumomo?

129
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:02,438
-I haven't done anything, I promise you.
-Her little trick with than kimono will cost  you.

130
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:08,684
Whatever you have done to anger
her, you'd be wise to stop, now!

131
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:12,583
Lie down. I will beat you hard,

132
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:17,262
So mother does not beat you harder.

133
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,653
I told you not to let anybody see you.

134
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:56,760
I have kept my promise,
so tell me, where is she?

135
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:06,307
She is in the next ...
in the house called Tatsuyo.

136
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:09,255
In the pleasure district.

137
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,207
Trust me little Chiyo,
you will find her.

138
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:12,298
Tatsuyo? Satsu, Satsu, Satsu…

139
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,040
Satsu, Satsu, no! Satsu! Satsu!

140
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,371
Satsu, Satsu!

141
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,084
Chiyo, what took you so
long? But Satsu, I tried...

142
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:06,114
I went to your okea weeks ago,
they laughed and turned me away.

143
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:10,586
Please, I did not know
I’ve missed you so much.

144
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,691
Let’s leave, tonight.
But we need money too.

145
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,204
I know I can steal some, first
thing tomorrow… No, please, tonight!

146
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:27,409
No, tomorrow, meet me at the
Saturn-May bridge, as soon as it's dark.

147
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:34,066
Now I have to go.Quickly
before someone catches you.

148
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,415
What if I cannot get away?

149
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:38,772
Be there Chiyo, we only have one chance.

150
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:46,314
Once I’ve left I can't go
back.I’ve waited as long as I can.Now go.

151
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:36,404
What is she doing here? She’s seen us!

152
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:45,141
Stupid girl, why have you come
back? You’re probably trying to escape!

153
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:48,754
Get in!

154
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:53,429
- Koichi please!
-Look at this, we're sneaking around like criminals!

155
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:56,226
-Koichi don't!
-It's degrading!

156
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,171
-What's going on?
-Koichi…

157
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:03,650
Who's there?

158
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,835
Go.

159
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,892
Show your face!

160
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:25,139
Look mother, I caught her stealing.

161
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,234
She was running away
with her sister,the whore!

162
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,794
-You little thief!
-No, she's lying.

163
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,605
After all we've done for her!

164
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:40,730
I saw her with a man, right
there! His name is Koichi!

165
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,045
Shut up! We should kick her out.

166
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,513
Take her arms.

167
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:16,542
You are never to see him again, huh?

168
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:22,328
What do you think? A
Geisha is free to love?

169
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:29,651
Never! Bolt the gate.No
one is leaving this okea!

170
00:33:55,067 --> 00:34:03,099
Doctor Ohura is very expensive. You
seem to be racking up quite a debt, huh?

171
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:16,604
Kimono destroyed, Geisha school, rice and
pickles, train ticket,Mr. Bekku, ... all this...

172
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:20,982
… on top of the money I paid Mr. Tanaka?

173
00:34:20,982 --> 00:34:29,267
And for what? And now I hear
that your sister has run away.

174
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:35,021
She didn't wait for you and
now she can never come back.

175
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:39,243
You must forget you
ever had a sister, huh?

176
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:52,165
We are your only family now.

177
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:28,445
Dear Satsu and little Chiyo, as one
who was once an orphan child myself,

178
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:36,143
this humble person is sorry to inform you,that six
weeks after you left for your new life in Myoko…

179
00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:41,087
… the suffering of your honoured
mother came to it's end …

180
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:48,194
And only a few weeks afterwards your
honoured father departed this world as well.

181
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:55,838
This humble person feels confident that both your honoured
parents have found their places in paradise.

182
00:35:56,997 --> 00:36:04,219
<i>At the temple there is a poem
called "loss",carved into the stone.</i>

183
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:10,195
<i>It has three words, but the
poet has scratched them out.</i>

184
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:14,502
<i>You cannot read loss, only feel it.</i>

185
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:24,949
<i>My father and mother had left this
life, my sister I never heard from again.</i>

186
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:32,033
<i>I had dishonoured the okea,so
mother had other plans for me.</i>

187
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:37,894
<i>I would pay back my debt,
year,after year,after year.</i>

188
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:44,289
<i>Not as a Geisha, as her slave.</i>

189
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:01,977
It is too pretty a day to be
so unhappy. Did you fall down?

190
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:09,891
Why so shy? Nothing to be ashamed of.

191
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,528
We all stumble from time to time.

192
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,328
You see that enchanting lady in green?

193
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:23,030
Once, when she was just a miko (an apprentice
Geisha), she fell clean off her wooden shoes.

194
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:28,430
-It's true, I did.
-And now look at her, so elegant!

195
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,255
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?We
will miss the beginning.

196
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:38,222
We see the Spring dances
every year.We can spare a moment.

197
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:51,671
What's your name? Don't
be afraid to look at me.

198
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:55,669
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?

199
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:58,332
You mean to eat?

200
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:01,016
I like sweet plum myself.

201
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,017
Come.

202
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:08,512
None of us find much kindness
in this life, as we should.

203
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,980
Both kinds please.

204
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,626
My children wait for these every Spring.

205
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:39,811
-Now I am a Geisha too.
-So you are.

206
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,047
How did you come by
such surprising eyes?

207
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:50,225
-My mother gave them to me.
-Generous of her wasn't it?

208
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:54,728
As you have been to me.

209
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:59,077
Smile for me won't you?

210
00:38:59,077 --> 00:39:03,772
There now, that is your gift to me.

211
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:11,613
This will buy your
supper. Now promise me one thing.

212
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:16,784
Next time you take a tumble, no frowns.

213
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,983
That's better.

214
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:35,806
In that moment I changed from a
girl, facing nothing but emptiness

215
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:43,514
to someone with purpose.I saw that to
be a Geisha could be a stepping stone

216
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:49,012
to something else: a place in his world.

217
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:24,171
The money the chairman had given me,
could have bought fish and rice for a month,

218
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:30,760
but I gave it back in prayer,
keeping only his handkerchief.

219
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:44,964
I asked one day to become a Geisha,
and then somehow, to meet him again.

220
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:32,385
-Chiyo
-chan? I can't find my coat, did you found it yet?

221
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:34,354
Pumpkin it's time to go.

222
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:36,224
I found it.

223
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:42,666
I couldn't sleep last night I was
so worried about my stupid hair.

224
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:47,302
Am I lopsided? You look beautiful.

225
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:52,066
With your hair like that you look
more like a pumpkin than ever.

226
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,299
Don't fold your neck
forward like a tortoise.

227
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:59,255
She's not ready? We will be late.

228
00:41:59,255 --> 00:42:03,210
Poor pumpkin, her debut and
everybody will be staring at you.

229
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:16,968
Hurry up. This time, do your ... before you play, when
you make a fool of yourself your big sister gets the blame

230
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:20,434
Stop crying, your face will run.

231
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:23,350
Pumpkin!

232
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:37,484
The winter I turned fifteen
I saw the chairman again,

233
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:42,444
But that wasn't the only surprise
fate brought me that season.

234
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:47,644
Along with the snow came
a most unexpected  visitor.

235
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:56,159
Why is she here?

236
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:00,492
Chiyo, Chiyo, open the gate!

237
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:31,858
Now that your beloved granny has
gone you have no need for a maid.

238
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:41,297
I would never question the great Mameha,
but you could choose anyone in the Hanamachi.

239
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,499
You flatter me, truly.

240
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:47,944
I would give you my pumpkin if she
weren't already tied to Hatsumomo.

241
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:55,752
Please I would never dream of asking. Besides,
I can always sell Chiyo to Mrs. Tetsuyo.

242
00:45:56,688 --> 00:46:00,642
With your eye for beauty
and nose for talent,

243
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:04,067
surely you can see what a
terrible waste that would be.

244
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:09,587
If you were not the kind hearted
Geisha I know you to be,

245
00:46:09,588 --> 00:46:16,806
then I might think that you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

246
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:22,099
Then I'm grateful Mrs. Nita that
you don't have a suspicious mind.

247
00:46:22,134 --> 00:46:24,939
Perhaps you can
pique my interest with...

248
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:30,164
-Your offer.

249
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:35,823
I will cover Chiyo's schooling, all
her expenses, until after her debut.

250
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:40,804
Now I am confident that you are teasing.

251
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:43,441
I could not be more sincere.

252
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:47,485
If Chiyo has not repaid her debt
within six months after her debut.

253
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,469
-Impossible, too little time!
- Then I will pay you twice over.

254
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:57,044
What... ?

255
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:02,914
-No Geisha could ever...
- I am certain you will not object to one trivial condition.

256
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:11,093
-Uh yes...?
-If Chiyo erases her debt in the time allowed,

257
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:15,093
You will not have any part
in her future earnings.

258
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:21,926
It's too good to be true,
Mameha is up to something.

259
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:25,955
She isn't in it for the money,
that much is for certain.

260
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:29,647
Rumour has it, ever since the Prime
Minister bought her misuage(virginity)

261
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,830
-She's been rich.

262
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,513
Absurd hard to think
that she noticed Chiyo.

263
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:43,504
-It's that kimono, she remembers how you
destroyed it, now she wants to get even.

264
00:47:43,504 --> 00:47:45,803
An odd picture isn't it?

265
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:54,736
Hatsumomo sweeping into tea-house after
tea-house with our Pumpkin, and Mameha with our maid.

266
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:58,141
I'm so far behind, I will
never catch up to you.

267
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:04,775
-Don’t worry, I will help you.
-Pumpkin!

268
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:13,418
You are never to speak to her
again, now you  are rivals!

269
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:38,908
This is how it was, this
tiny world of women,

270
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:43,333
friend turned against friend.

271
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:48,139
And now the two greatest
Geisha in Myoko at war over me.

272
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:51,987
Hatsumomo at my back, Mameha calling,

273
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:58,386
offering me the chance to become one of
those elegant women I had seen on the bridge.

274
00:48:58,386 --> 00:49:04,406
floating in a silk
kimono, the chairman at my side.

275
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:12,480
-Chiyo is my new protoge.
-As lovely as her big sister.

276
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:17,483
And with eyes the colour of rain.

277
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,960
The baron is a very special
man to me, my “Danina,”

278
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:30,384
someday if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.

279
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:35,897
Don't kneel, you aren't
a servant girl anymore.

280
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,745
Step into the light.

281
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:51,917
-I see water in you.
-Does that displease you?

282
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:58,944
Water is powerful. It can wash away
earth, put out fire, and even destroy iron.

283
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:02,271
But you have not drawn on
those strengths have you?

284
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:05,304
-About your kimono...

285
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:08,391
You may apologise if you wish.

286
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:13,973
Why that is a perfect
bow, for a pig farmer...

287
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:20,786
Don't drop your head, fingertips together,
elbows in, no weight on the hands.

288
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,884
-Yes.

289
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:26,432
As for the kimono, I’m no fool Chiyo.

290
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:31,155
-Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition
-She is jealous of you...

291
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:38,540
Not me I'm afraid,
someone closer to home.

292
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,235
Rise.

293
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:45,754
Not like a horse.

294
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:52,827
Slide your foot forward.

295
00:50:52,827 --> 00:50:59,501
That's it. Now walk. You
are a magnificent Geisha.

296
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:04,085
Tell me Chiyo, does Mrs.
Nita ever speak of the future?

297
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:06,031
Not to me.

298
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:08,570
Well someday soon she will
have to name an heir.

299
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,363
One of her own Geisha to succeed her.

300
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:14,825
Strange isn't it that she
hasn't adopted Hatsumomo?

301
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:18,516
That would be like releasing
a tiger from it's cage.

302
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:21,539
You have a gift for expression.

303
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:27,477
And if Mrs. Nita adopts
Pumpkin that is hardly a threat…

304
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:30,818
… but a young girl
with eyes like rain...

305
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:33,523
But Mrs. Nita would never choose me.

306
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:38,323
-On the contrary, that is our goal.
-It is?

307
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:43,357
Of course. If you do not inherit the
okea, then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.

308
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:53,376
Water is always in such a
hurry, perhaps that is just as well.

309
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:56,411
We have no time to lose.

310
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,062
We must transform you.

311
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:09,470
And what takes years,you
must learn in months.

312
00:52:14,854 --> 00:52:17,043
Say I’m entertaining the baron.

313
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:20,984
Like so many clients he's trapped
in an arranged marriage.

314
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:24,820
So in the tea-house when he's
seeking my company instead,

315
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:30,257
I reward him like this with
a glimpse of my wrist.

316
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:39,038
Seeing this demure little trace of
naked skin, well it gives him pleasure.

317
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:44,722
Or when you're sitting down, for the
briefest moment, press your leg against his.

318
00:52:44,722 --> 00:52:47,962
Always by accident,of course.

319
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:08,232
Mameha, when does a
Geisha choose her patron?

320
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:15,024
I'm afraid it's the other way around, focus on
your studies Chiyo, music, the art of conversation,

321
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:20,356
That's the surest way to attract a
patron on your feet, not off them!

322
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:02,762
Remember Chiyo, Geisha are not
courtesans, and we're not wives.

323
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:06,840
We sell our skills, not our bodies.

324
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:14,136
We create another secret
world, a place only of beauty.

325
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:19,347
The very word Geisha means
artist, and to be a Geisha …

326
00:54:19,347 --> 00:54:24,347
… is to be judged as
a moving work of art.

327
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:35,559
Agony and beauty, for
us, live side by side.

328
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:40,061
Your feet will suffer,
your fingers will bleed.

329
00:55:40,061 --> 00:55:44,067
Even sitting and
sleeping will be painful.

330
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:59,079
You cannot call yourself a true Geisha until you
can stop a man in his tracks with a single look.

331
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,981
-No one can do that.
-Choose someone for me.

332
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:07,696
The grey hat...

333
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,875
You are ready.

334
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:44,219
Hurry up, you're not making money.
Standing there gawking at yourself.

335
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,627
For luck.

336
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,734
This binds us together
forever as sisters.

337
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:19,838
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

338
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:27,202
From this day forward you
will be known as Sayuri.

339
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,056
When Mameha granted me my new name,

340
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:40,670
I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.

341
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:46,105
I was a miko now, an apprentice Geisha.

342
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:58,168
From that moment I told myself when I make tea,
when I pour sake, when I dance, when I tie my kimono…

343
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:03,549
… it will be for the
chairman, until he finds me...

344
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:06,770
… until I am his.

345
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,990
-Ready?
-Big sister?

346
00:59:24,482 --> 00:59:28,026
Thank you.

347
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:40,802
Friends, we have the pleasure to witness the
debut of another apprentice Geisha, cheers!

348
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:55,557
I remember those eyes what was her name?

349
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,758
Sayuri.

350
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:24,948
Determined isn't she? If there had been a drop of tea in
that tea-pot I believe Sayuri would have gotten it out!

351
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:28,957
I told you Mr. Baron, it
is her very first time.

352
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,546
What a beautiful dance, yes Pumpkin?

353
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:37,992
her fans are so hypnotic, that
you may not even notice her feet!

354
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:46,365
What's her name? Her name is Sayuri.

355
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,672
A name as sweet as she is. I'm afraid
that these days even a common chambermaid…

356
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:59,509
… can call herself a Geisha. So it's nice to
see such a sincere young apprentice, isn't it?

357
01:02:02,058 --> 01:02:07,220
-Oh yes.
- Surely you would like to thank Hatsumomo for her gracious compliment.

358
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,053
There is so much I would
like to say to Hatsumomo.

359
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:15,530
Sometimes the smartest
remark is silence.

360
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:20,626
What better advice to follow
you than your own? Sayuri!

361
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:29,316
-I was a miko myself once.
- Of course! But it's been such a very long,

362
01:02:29,316 --> 01:02:34,846
long, long... long, long, time.

363
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:46,763
I shall destroy you.

364
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,777
She can destroy you. She
would spread rumours.

365
01:02:53,777 --> 01:02:55,751
Stalk you from
tea-house to tea-house.

366
01:02:55,751 --> 01:03:00,592
Then steal your clients, all in the hope that
Mrs. Nita adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

367
01:03:00,592 --> 01:03:03,002
-What can we do?
-We've got to outwit her,

368
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:08,744
to find a place somewhere beyond her reach, where
you can practice your skills without any interference.

369
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:12,046
-Your first sumo match.
-What?

370
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:14,423
Today you will meet (Chairman) Iwamura.

371
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:20,036
He is head of the Iwamura electric
company in Osaka. My client for years.

372
01:03:20,036 --> 01:03:26,246
We will entertain him and his partner
Nobu. You may find Nobu quite a challenge.

373
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:28,330
He does not like Geisha.

374
01:03:37,973 --> 01:03:41,245
Be attentive, I will do the rest.

375
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:49,448
Chairman Iwamura, President Nobu, this
is my new younger sister Sayuri.

376
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,180
Injured in Manchuria, war hero.

377
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,062
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

378
01:04:07,062 --> 01:04:11,134
Nobu-san will have to educate you, I
cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

379
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:14,606
That is the Chairman's diplomatic
way of saying he hates sumo.

380
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:23,256
Did you notice our contribution?

381
01:04:23,256 --> 01:04:28,225
We are harnessing the power of water to
bring electricity to some of the smaller villages.

382
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:30,204
It was in the newspaper wasn't it?

383
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:35,769
Ah, the Chairman's picture, yes, you
compensate for all my shortcomings don't you?

384
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:40,439
May I ask, How does someone
harness the power of water?

385
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:46,043
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing because he will!

386
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:51,287
Let the girl watch sumo.

387
01:04:57,094 --> 01:05:01,030
Hatsumomo, that snake! Quick,
turn your attention to Nobu.

388
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:03,961
But Mameha-san...

389
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:07,260
Hatsumomo finds him repulsive,
she would never steal him away.

390
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,897
Mislead her, go.

391
01:05:27,354 --> 01:05:31,951
Perhaps Nobu-san would be kind
enough to explain the rules of the match.

392
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:39,063
Three things matter in
life... … sumo, business, and war,

393
01:05:39,863 --> 01:05:44,203
Understand one, you know them
all. But why should a Geisha care?

394
01:05:44,203 --> 01:05:50,162
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.

395
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:52,411
I humbly beg to differ.

396
01:05:52,411 --> 01:05:54,845
What is sumo but a dance between giants?

397
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:58,450
What is business but a
dance between companies?

398
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:03,087
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.

399
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:09,993
They are throwing salt
to purify the ring.

400
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:23,311
That man is Miyagi, the
greatest fighter in Japan.

401
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:28,908
But he's so tiny! Only
compared to his opponent.

402
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,821
Miyagi may use...

403
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:37,416
Are you listening? Yes.

404
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:48,437
Hataki-comi is a movement a smaller
opponent uses to throw a larger opponent off balance.

405
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:52,264
Victory does not always
belong to the powerful!

406
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,537
Look, there, in his eyes!

407
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,975
I'm afraid our time has come
to a close. Going so soon?

408
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:06,312
Not yet! I want her to see.

409
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:29,809
Now that is Hataki-comi! I
see now why you like sumo.

410
01:07:30,113 --> 01:07:33,014
You can never judge a man's
power by his appearance alone.

411
01:07:39,048 --> 01:07:43,997
Mameha! You may bring her again.

412
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:04,703
<i>I scoured the newspaper for
the Chairman's photograph.</i>

413
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,179
<i>Anything to preserve
our moment together.</i>

414
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:15,488
<i>A moment, stolen, when I was
forced to turn my attention to Nobu.</i>

415
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:20,989
<i>In that instant I
felt the world shift...</i>

416
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:25,947
<i>But not my own determination</i>

417
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:26,399
<i>I made a secret promise.</i>

418
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:38,811
<i>Along with his picture, I would lock
away my heart, and save it for him.</i>

419
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,075
-Big sister.
-Come here.

420
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:50,509
Tonight we will deliver a quick
blow to Hatsumomo - Hataki-comi.

421
01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:54,294
-How? -We will meet
Nobu-san at the Sunashima restaurant.

422
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:57,722
-But first a visit to Dr. Crab.
-Dr. Crab?

423
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,623
It's a little nickname
he's earned over the years.

424
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:04,955
-Sister!
- Hold still!

425
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:08,128
I have something in mind, a plan.

426
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,947
Now cut your leg where I've marked it.

427
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,616
-What?!
-Or I will do it for you.

428
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:20,410
-Have you gone mad?
-Do you trust me or don't you?

429
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,689
Well?

430
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:33,026
Go ahead, do it!.

431
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:43,945
Careless with the
sowing scissors were you?

432
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:47,112
Right through your beautiful
kimono. Such a pity.

433
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:53,058
It won't leave a scar will
it? Sayuri is a special girl…

434
01:09:53,058 --> 01:09:58,325
… at a very special time in her life.

435
01:09:58,325 --> 01:10:03,827
Yes, with those eyes! You
must be quite a commodity.

436
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:15,836
Clean cut, won't leave
a mark, I promise.

437
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:23,850
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.

438
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:40,770
Your honourable sister says
cut your leg? You cut your leg.

439
01:10:41,772 --> 01:10:47,209
She says follow me? You follow
her. My life had turned into a game…

440
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,974
… and only she knew the rules.

441
01:10:54,106 --> 01:11:01,219
At the right moment slip
it to Nobu – discreetly.

442
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:03,747
He will know what it means.

443
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,958
-You have kept us waiting.
-Please forgive us Nobu-san.

444
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:19,859
The Chairman thinks I should take more
pleasure in life, music and the theatre.

445
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:23,457
What is your impression?

446
01:11:23,457 --> 01:11:28,003
It is useless to push
your cart sideways,

447
01:11:28,003 --> 01:11:32,181
one could not wish Nobu-san to
be anyone other than Nobu-san.

448
01:11:32,181 --> 01:11:36,502
I could not agree more. I
owe this man everything.

449
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:39,178
He gives me too much credit as usual.

450
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:41,389
Probably, cheers! Cheers!

451
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:55,308
It is a trinket, I found
it a few days ago...

452
01:11:55,578 --> 01:12:01,312
Nobu-san, I had no idea you were so
sentimental. Call it my “new leaf.”

453
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:09,918
My mother... my mother, she
used to wear something similar.

454
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:17,862
You do not like it?

455
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:27,040
Forgive me, I've never
received a present before.

456
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:32,213
What a beautiful comb.

457
01:12:32,213 --> 01:12:35,263
Such a joyous moment Sayuri.

458
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:38,575
You're finally getting what you deserve.

459
01:12:38,576 --> 01:12:41,764
How lovely.

460
01:12:41,764 --> 01:12:51,877
And now will you excuse us please, we
have another engagement, many in fact.

461
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:52,878
Pumpkin?

462
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:10,848
You are most kind.

463
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,833
-Now give this one to Dr. Crab.
-Mameha please...

464
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:28,804
-You're upset?
-I want to trust you I do…

465
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,682
… but you have to tell
me what's going on.

466
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:34,542
-I am ensuring your future.
-But tell me how, I beg you.

467
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:37,778
-I am trying to orchestrate a bidding war.
-What for?

468
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:41,044
-Your most precious attribute.
-And what is that?

469
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:43,546
Your misuage (virginity).

470
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:48,456
Did mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

471
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:54,560
Well, every once in a while, a man's
eel likes to visit a woman's cave.

472
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:57,594
Yes I know. You do?

473
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,199
I live with Hatsumomo.

474
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:05,817
Well, your cave is untouched... men
like that. We call this misuage (virginity).

475
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:09,502
And to become a full Geisha we must
sell this to the highest bidder.

476
01:14:09,502 --> 01:14:11,284
Did you sell yours?

477
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:12,608
It was the largest sum ever paid
- Ten thousand yen.

478
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:18,118
I freed myself from
debt, and so will you.

479
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:25,254
When you slip the rice-cake to Dr. Crab it is a sign
that says your misuage (virginity),is ripe for sale.

480
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:33,728
The Dr. has no desire to see
you tonight... or any night.

481
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:45,662
-Pumpkin! Hatsumomo went to see Dr.
Crab, yes? -I have to go Chiyo-chan.

482
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:48,019
-Didn't she?
-I do not know.

483
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:50,183
Of course you know! You
shadow her every step.

484
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:54,048
-You expect me to betray my big sister.
-Has she made you cruel as well?

485
01:14:54,457 --> 01:15:00,692
-No.
-My Pumpkin always told the truth.

486
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,296
The truth…

487
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:14,708
Tonight, we went to the tea-house to see Dr. Crab. I
sat outside but I could still hear through the screen...

488
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:22,151
... and Hatsumomo then said to him “I live in the same Okea as
Sayuri, and did you know that she brings men back to her room?”

489
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:28,448
“No” he said, “they come in, sailors, and fishermen too.” And
the Dr. looked queezy like he didn't want to hear any more,

490
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:34,129
But she kept going. And Hatsumomo
said to him “what's the matter?”

491
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:41,030
“have I told you more than you wanted to
know?” I'm so sorry, I wanted to say something…

492
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,863
… but how could I Chiyo-chan? … how?

493
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,843
Am I really like her?

494
01:15:48,843 --> 01:15:54,148
-Am I?
-Of course not.

495
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:59,151
-Is Mameha-san cruel to you
too? -No, she's so kind to me...

496
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:03,822
... but sometimes I worry she's taken
me further from the things I want.
