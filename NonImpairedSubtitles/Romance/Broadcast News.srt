Excuse me

170

All of you know
what I'm talking about

171
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,792
We're all trying to act
tougher than we are

172
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,295
but we care, so

173
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,527
we're all secretly terrified
by what's happening

174
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,193
aren't we?

175
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,100
Ah-choo!

176
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,209
Catch you later

177

I was going to talk
about other trends, but

the historic influence
of Entertainment Tonight

180
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,222
the danger, the hope

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,281
the dream, the question

182
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,726
Oh! I was going
to show you a tape

183
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,731
a story carried by all networks
on the same night

184
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,232
the same night

185
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,634
that not one network noted
a major policy change

186
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,229
in SALT II
nuclear disarmament talks

187
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,241
Here's what they ran instead

[Speaking Foreign Language]

190
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,562
I know it's good film

191
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,695
I know it's fun

192
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,706
I like fun

193
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,765
It's just not news

194
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,750
Well, you're lucky you love it

195

Thank you

I don't think
there'll be any Q and A

Hi

202
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,862
Hello

203
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,772
I just wanted to tell you

204
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,715
how great you were

205
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,548
My name's Tom Grunick

206
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,884
Thank you

207
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,223
Yeah

208
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,239
They hated me

209
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,242
I don't hate them

210
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,178
Well, they say
if you can reach

211
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,681
even one person,
it means something

212
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,048
And you did that

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,181
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

214
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,194
Sure

215
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,192
Another thing
I can't stand...

216
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,699
Is this dull?

217
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,702
No! No, no No No

218
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,704
Another thing
I can't stand

219
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,707
is when White House reporters
bullshit with each other

220
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,211
after a briefing,
and one of them has a theory

221
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,247
and the other quotes it
in his story as

222
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,215
"White House sources say"

223
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,251
That actually goes on?

224
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,718
Yes!

225
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,220
I am not tired

226
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,382
You want to talk in my room?

227
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,584
Sure

228
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,223
Aw, come on

229
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,235
Even I'm not that hard
on myself

230
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,736
No, really

231
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,171
I got this job
on a fluke

232
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,174
and wait till you hear

233
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,176
how it ends up

234
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,073
I was doing sports
at this station

235
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,175
The newspaper ran
this untrue story

236
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,186
that I was leaving

237
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,190
and they got
these tons of protest mail

238
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,691
Ha ha ha!

239
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,523
So...

240
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,995
So they made me anchor

241
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,624
So, great Right?

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,167
Except I'm no good

243
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,170
at what I'm being
a success at

244
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,672
How are you at back rubs?

245
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,690
It's normal,
the way you feel

246
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,693
In graduate school,
everyone thought

247
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,161
the admissions committee
made a mistake

248
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,198
in letting them in

249
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,130
You think I lack confidence

250
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,633
That's not it

251
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,136
I know I can talk well enough

252
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,139
and I can make contact
with people

253
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,641
but I don't
like the feeling

254
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,645
that I'm pretending
to be a reporter

255
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,146
And half the time

256
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,183
I don't get the news
I'm talking about

257
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,153
It's not that
I'm down on myself

258
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,654
Trust me

259
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,657
I stink!

260
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,590
I trust you

261
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,185
I didn't even
have a chance

262
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,697
to become really good
at sports

263
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,198
I wasn't bad

264
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,201
What about
the obvious remedy...

265
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,238
reversing things,
maybe working at a newspaper

266
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,739
I don't write
Ha ha!

267
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,038
But that didn't stop me

268
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,205
from sending
my audition tapes

269
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,215
to the bigger stations

270
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,046
and the networks

271
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,881
Well, come on

272
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,386
It is your life

273
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,913
Nobody is tying you
to the fast track

274
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,662
Did you go to college?

275
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,166
So you're not
well-educated

276
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,168
you have almost
no experience

277
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,760
and you can't write

278
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,669
Yeah, and I'm

279
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,003
and I'm making a fortune

280
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,182
It's hard for me
to advise you

281
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,184
since you
personify something

282
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,413
that I truly think
is dangerous

283
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,012
Uh-huh

284
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,557
I agree that you're
not qualified

285
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,183
so get qualified

286
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,194
Insist on being
better prepared

287
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,628
Don't just leave it
with, " Uh

288
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,565
I don't write,
I'm not schooled

289
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,693
I don't understand the news

290
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,704
but at least
I'm upset about it"

291

Whoa

292
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,201
What do you want from me

293
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,212
permission to be a fake?

294
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,713
Stop whining

295
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,373
Do something about it!

296
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,449

you don't have to
start right now

298
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,166
I hated the way you
talked to me just now

299
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,601
and it wasn't just because
you were right

300
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,178
Oh, God Ha ha ha!

301
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,684
Oh, God

302
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,856
Oh, God

303
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,730
Oh!

00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,195
No, no, no

305
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,200
It wasn't just the speech

306
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,701
The same thing happened

307
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,203
with this guy

308
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,705
I have passed
some line someplace

309
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,208
I am beginning
to repel people

310

I'm trying to seduce

311

He must've been great-looking

312
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,646
Why?

313
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,377
Nobody invites
a bad-looking idiot

314
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,078
to their bedroom

315
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,848
OK, let's do me

316
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,151
I feel like I'm slipping

317
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,659
but do people
who are slipping feel that way

318
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,163
or do the good people
who are moving up

319
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,822
invariably think
they're slipping

320
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,890
because their standards
are so high?

321

is not worthy of you

if insecurity
and desperation

326
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,177
made us more attractive?

it was our shortest
phone conversation ever

671
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,062
Tomorrow you'll see
a mob of me here

672
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,266
If you have
anything to say, sir

673
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,242
say it now,
the way you want

674
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,576
It's great you left in
what you said

675
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,581
Yes, please,
let's never forget

676
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,310
we're the real story

677
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:48,908
not them

678
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,817
Yeah, I know

679
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,288
I couldn't decide about it

680
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,552
He's not afraid
of being human

681
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,923
Shh!

682
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,792
Before the House
Armed Services Committee

683
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,525
Tom Grunick, the Pentagon

684
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,430
As if the Pentagon

685
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,025
didn't have enough problems

686
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,535
Thanks, Jane

687
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,629
Sure

688
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:12,369
Tom? My youngest
wanted to meet you

689
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,206
This is Elli

690
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,939
Hi, Elli

691
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,947
You should be honored

692
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,041
She never wanted to
meet anyone here before

693
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,551
Dad

694
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,554
But she said
she loved you

695
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,556
on television just now

696
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,057
Hi, Elli

697
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,558
Remember me?

698
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,891
L-I'm not sure
I'm sorry

699
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,453
I've been to your house

700
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:38,628
Aaron was on that
14-day raft trip

701
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:40,226
with us last year

702
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,498
Oh, yeah

703
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,306
I wore a big
yellow raincoat

704
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,311
Oh, yeah

705
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,575
It had a hood

706
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,082
Yeah! Hi!

707
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,981
Your hair's different

708
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,076
Yeah

709
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,245
Hi!

710
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,414
Hi, Elli She knows me

711
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,024
[Tom]
Hi, Dad

712
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,185
Did you see it?

713
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,191
Great
I'll send you a tape

714
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,535
I'm sorry
I haven't called

715
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,537
Things got a

716
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,540
little bumpy for a while

717
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,542
No, it's not important

718
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,043
I'm fine

719
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,544
Hey, Dad

720
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,548
I think I just may be able

721
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,550
to do this job

722
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,546
Ha ha ha!

723
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,557
Well, I'm glad
you were sure!

724
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,260
Ah

725
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,762
Our host!

726
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,263
Come on in

727
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,766
Sorry we're late
It's Jane’s fault

728
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,823
Smells good

729
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,960
It is good

730
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,469
Anne worked all weekend

731
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,006
Why should we feel
defensive about it?

732
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,067
Newspapers are in business
to make money Why not us?

733
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,840
They criticize us
for pandering

734
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,213
while they run
Wingo games

735
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,717
Exactly right

736
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:04,345
Excuse me
I'm paid to mix

737
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:06,719
Ha ha!
Good-bye, Paul

738
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,724
Take care, Paul

739
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,229
It takes courage
to say that

740
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,697
to the news division
president

741
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,031
You think anyone
who's proud of our work

742
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,570
is an ass kisser

743
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,900
No

744
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,907
I think anyone who
puckers their lips

745
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:26,966
and smooches
their boss's buttocks

746
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,739
is an ass kisser

747
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,245
My gosh!

748
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:35,013
For a while there,
I was attracted to you

749
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,677
Well, wait a minute

750
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,244
That changes everything

751
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,756
They wouldn't renew
my magazine subscription

752
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,257
because of money

753
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,759
I can't believe it

754
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,260
Ha ha ha!

755
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,765
Martin, would you
excuse us for a minute?

756
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,265
No

757
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,767
Go away

758
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,773
Well, you know,

759
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,207
I've been meaning
to ask you

760
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,371
Ah, forget it

761
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:07,515
This is very awkward

762
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:16,219
I see Tom around you a lot

763
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:20,093
I'd like to see him
outside of work

764
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,721
unless there's some reason

765
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,231
for you to mind

766
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,734
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Do I mind?

767
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:27,736
Why would I mind? No

768
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,238
Wait

769
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,247
I do mind

770
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:42,251
I think about him

771
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,253
outside of work sometimes

772
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:47,256
but I know
I don't respect him

773
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,592
What am I talking about?

774
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,150
What am I saying?

775
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,595
You're saying,
"Stay away from him"

776
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,427
I can't be

777
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,936
We don't have to
settle this right now

778
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:02,335
Wait a minute

779
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,246
This is slippery

780
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,556
I will call you

781
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,061
I'll call you
from the other room right now

782
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,720
I've studied these things

783
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,230
Tell me one person

784
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:30,232
who ever left television news

785
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,234
to work on a newspaper

786
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:33,234
Right

787
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:35,362
It sure looks good

788
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,736
[Clunk]

789
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,742
After all these years

790
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,506
we have a life

791
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,069
See you

792
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,012
See you

793
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,254
Hey

794
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:53,755
Hi, Tom

795
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,916
Hi

796
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:56,424
It's the first time

797
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:59,087
I've seen you
dressed like this

798
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:02,598
You look so clean
and pretty

799
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,429
What do you mean?

800
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:05,866
Clean?

801
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,426
At the office

802
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:09,995
you have this film over you

803
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,277
I've got to find someone

804
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,778
It's important

805
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,280
Excuse me

806
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:29,286
Jennifer

807
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,792
Hey!

808
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,123
Jennifer!

809
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:33,628
Forget what I said

810
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,791
Do whatever you
want to with Tom

811
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,165
There's nothing
I'm going to do

812
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,965
right this second

813
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:42,766
It's your day off

814
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,466
You're entitled

815
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,312
You weren't
really leaving

816
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,813
Yes

817
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,315
You were?

818
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:54,816
Yes

819
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,318
No!

820
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,320
He thought it was funny

821
00:40:58,388 --> 00:40:59,821
Hi!

822
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:09,094
A plane shot up
an air base in Sicily

823
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,532
This could be very, very...

824
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,091
That's it!

825
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,271
OK, right away

826
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,141
Ernie?

827
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:23,779
Tom? Tom

828
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah

829
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:26,781
What is it?

830
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,284
A Libyan plane
just shot up

831
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,786
one of our bases in Sicily

832
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:33,789
We should tap our source

833
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:35,449
Jennifer, we need you

834
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,799
Jane, we want you
to exec produce

835
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,391
a special report

836
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,459
A Libyan plane shot up

837
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:49,732
an American base in Sicily

838
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,296
Since Paul is here

839
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,308
he's made the assignments...

840
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,503
Jennifer at the White House

841

1009
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,678
What's it like
being executive producer?

1010
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:51,117
I got to go

1011
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,712
Me, too Got to go

1012
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,554
Got to go
We're very busy

1013
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,720
Stand by, camera 1
Center up

1014
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,855
We're going to remote 3

1015
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:04,729
It's the Gulf of Sidra

1016
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,702
The US commander
is Nathan Benchley

1017
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,829
In 1981,
two Libyan jets

1018
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,737
attacked two American F-14s

1019
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:16,245
- Jane] They got an SU-22
- flying over the Gulf of Sidra

1020
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:21,750
- Today they got a MIG-21,
a better plane
- Qaddafi claimed that the gulf

1021
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,252
is part of Libya's
territorial waters

1022
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,254
Both Libyan jets were downed

1023
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:28,256
by the American fighters

1024
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:32,761
- He is Nathan Benchley
- The commander
of one of those planes

1025
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,262
Nathan Benchley, joins us

1026
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,764
Commander, it must
have been tougher

1027
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,266
shooting down the MIG-21

1028
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:39,767
You got an SU-22

1029
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,770
Jane]
What's it like at confrontation?

1030
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,772
What is a dogfight like?

1031
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,775
Jane]
After this, we'll do a wrap-up

1032
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,779
Ask him how he knows
when he has a hit

1033
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,816
Do you know
you have a hit

1034
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:56,408
from a screen
inside your cockpit

1035
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,455
or can you see
your missiles strike?

1036
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:00,887
That's good

1037
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,221
[Benchley]
The equipment is sophisticated

1038
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,761
but you like to see it
to confirm it

1039
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,252
but you like to see it
to confirm it

1040
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,560
It's considered
an outlaw nation

1041
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,226
but some who have
interviewed Qaddafi

1042
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,236
find him,
to use an American phrase

1043
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:17,067
very presidential

1044
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,437
Nice, Jane

1045
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,306
We'll go to Martin Klein

1046
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,641
then to the carrier pilot

1047
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,681
from the Sidra... What!

1048
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:27,306
No! You missed him?

1049
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:29,317
There's only
10 minutes left!

1050
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:33,048
How can you talk to me
about parking problems?

1051
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:34,749
No, not "you'll try"!

1052
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:38,316
Do it, or I'll fry
your fat ass!

1053
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:41,955
I had no idea
she was this good

1054
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:43,430
Tom

1055
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:44,761
Tom

1056
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,563
Fill for a second

1057
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,797
Tom?

1058
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:50,270
Go

1059
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:52,773
The latest message
seems to indicate

1060
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:56,642
that the Libyan pilot
was acting on his own

1061
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:59,442
without authority
from anyone else

1062
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:02,382
In other words,
I think we're all OK

1063
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,386
Who the hell cares
what you think?

1064
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,388
The Libyan government
has disavowed

1065
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:09,390
prior knowledge of the attack

1066
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,892
I'm Tom Grunick
reporting from Washington

1067
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:13,394
Good afternoon

1068
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:14,895
Animation

1069
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:16,727
Thanks, everybody

1070
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,699
We are out

1071
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,235
Nice job, Tom

1072
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,739
Everybody on the floor,
thank you so much

1073
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:25,239
Good job, buddy

1074
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,734
Hey

1075
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:30,244
Thanks

1076
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,746
Man!

1077
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,304
You're great

1078
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:36,749
Never so proud
of one of my decisions

1079
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:38,753
Thank you, Ernie

1080
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:40,584
Jane, great work

1081
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:42,146
Really You know?

1082
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,750
There were
no major gaffes, anyway

1083
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,260
Oh!

1084
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,762
No major gaffes

1085
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,764
Ha ha!
You were brilliant!

1086
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,926
Josh, great stuff

1087
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:54,765
Thank you

1088
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,270
Congratulations, Jane

1089
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,274
You guys were so good
You guys!

1090
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,139
Thanks, Jane

1091
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,700
Thanks, Ernie

1092
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:05,713
You know, this was
important for Tom

1093
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:08,306
There's that bonding thing
that happens

1094
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:11,114
I'm watching Paul
address the troops

1095
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,212
It's not
the conventions anymore

1096
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:15,723
It's this kind of moment

1097
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,258
Oh, hi

1098
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,725
Wow!

1099
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:21,729
Hey, Mr. Ice Man!
You were great

1100
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,230
You, too

1101
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:24,823
Great job

1102
00:53:29,805 --> 00:53:31,238
Good work, Tom

1103
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:33,002
Thanks

1104
00:53:33,075 --> 00:53:35,236
What a baptism, Tom!
Congratulations

1105
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:38,246
With all this help,
it's easier than local

1106
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:39,747
Where's Jane?

1107
00:53:39,815 --> 00:53:41,248
She's back there

1108
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:42,750
Can I help you?

1109
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:45,753
We're here to play
the new news theme

1110
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:53,361
You're an amazing woman!

1111
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:55,329
What a feeling

1112
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,764
having you inside my head!

1113
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,323
Yeah It was

1114
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,802
an unusual place to be

1115
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,771
It's, like, indescribable!

1116
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,775
You knew just when
to feed me the next line

1117
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:11,244
You knew the second
before I needed it

1118
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,283
There was a rhythm
we got into

1119
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,614
It was like great sex!

1120
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,119
Ha ha ha!

1121
00:54:18,187 --> 00:54:20,781
You have to celebrate with me

1122
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:24,292
Everybody's going
to the bar down the street

1123
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,294
I'm going over to Aaron's

1124
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:29,798
Maybe I'll hook up
with all of you later

1125
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:31,799
How long do you think

1126
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,801
you'll be there?

1127
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:39,602
It starts off

1128
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:42,166
with this very high-tech thing

1129
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:43,802
like this

1130
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:45,141
(music) Bom bom (music)

1131
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:46,806
That's the news

1132
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,315
(music) Bom bom bom (music)

1133
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,318
The strings take the melody

1134
00:54:50,386 --> 00:54:54,083
(music) Bah dah dah dah dah
dah dah (music)

1135
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:55,817
(music) A-bom bom
bom bom (music)

1136
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:57,324
(music) Dah dah dah (music)

1137
00:54:57,393 --> 00:54:59,759
(music) Dah dah dah bah (music)

1138
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,763
Al does the countermelody

1139
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,732
(music) Dah dah dah dah (music)

1140
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,496
(music) Dah dah dah dah (music)

1141
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,595
(music) Dah dah dah (music)

1142
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:12,266
(music) Dah dah dah dah dah (music)

1143
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:13,774
- Big finish!
- Big finish!

1144
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,105
(music) Bah bah bah dah (music)

1145
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:17,270
I got chills

1146
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,611
Wasn't Tom great?

1147
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:22,275
Well, it worked

1148
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:24,444
It worked

1149
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:38,699
Really?

1150
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,201
Ha ha!

1151
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:42,203
It was good?

1152
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:45,707
Your calling in
that information...

1153
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,710
You are
the classiest guy I know!

1154
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,542
Here Have a beer

1155
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,206
Celebrate

1156
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,250
God

1157
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,547
it was so strange
watching him

1158
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,383
What's next...
lip-synching?

1159
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:00,888
OK, OK, OK

1160
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:04,221
I've been doing some of
the most important thinking

1161
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,885
of my life today

1162
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:08,930
I wonder if I
should tell you now

1163
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,727
Whatever you think

1164
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,564
I figured out
why I'm so hung up

1165
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,264
on getting a chance
at weekend anchor

1166
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:19,774
If I do it well,
they'll pay me more

1167
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:22,106
and they'll treat me better

1168
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,612
You may be on to something

1169
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,875
Which means I'm at their mercy

1170
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:28,712
and who wants that?

1171
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:32,720
I won't tell you where
this thought has led me

1172
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:34,153
Why not?

1173
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:36,384
In the middle of this

1174
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,893
I started thinking
about the one thing

1175
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:41,987
that makes me feel good
and makes immediate sense

1176
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:43,497
and it's you

1177
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:46,658
Oh, bubba

1178
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,238
I'm going to stop right now

1179
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:56,139
Except I wish
you were two people

1180
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,578
I'd tell the one
who's my friend

1181
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:02,208
about the one
that I like so much

1182
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:11,258
All right
I'm... I'm...

1183
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,818
I'm not going to say any more

1184
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:18,731
primarily because
I'm about to pass out

1185
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,099
I'll walk you
to the corner

1186
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,603
You get some sleep

1187
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:23,603
Right now?

1188
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:25,697
After I walk you
to the corner

1189
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:27,537
Come on, buddy

1190
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:32,872
You were stunning today

1191
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,883
You have someplace
to go now, right?

1192
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,213
Yeah, yeah

1193
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:41,217
Good night

1194
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,552
Good night

1195
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,728
Well, I felt something

1196
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:49,889
Hee hee hee!

1197
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:03,244
Hey, we're going to Cap's Bar
on 17th and Vermont

1198
00:58:03,312 --> 00:58:07,248
Connecticut's clear on Sunday,
so take that over to 15th

1199
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:09,910
and then straight down Vermont

1200
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:12,920
and we should bypass
Thomas Circle that way

1201
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:17,425
If you don't go over 40,
we'll catch mostly green lights

1202
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,867
We tried...

1203
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,372
I didn't think
you'd make it

1204
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,376
I thought I'd see if all of you
were still here

1205
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:37,878
I'll go join the gang

1206
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,380
The gang is gone

1207
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:41,882
We were the last ones

1208
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,147
Oh

1209
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,748
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll go have a burger

1210
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,689
You want another burger?

1211
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,056
Yeah

1212
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:56,063
Hey, I know how to have
a burger by myself

1213
00:58:56,131 --> 00:58:58,429
I feel like
a little solitude

1214
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,900
I sure know that feeling

1215
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,530
Hey, terrific work today

1216
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,198
Right back to you

1217
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:07,071
Thanks

1218
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,411
Good night

1219
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,912
Good night

1220
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:24,686
Ha ha!

1221
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,022
I feel great

1222
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:29,531
You sure I shouldn't
get a taxi?

1223
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:31,031
What for?

1224
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,533
Oh, I don't know

1225
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,829
Why?

1226
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:37,929
You have the greatest car
and the greatest driver

1227
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,702
in all of Washington

1228
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:41,367
You look confused

1229
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:42,876
I'm not

1230
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,581
Ohh

1231
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,242
Ohh

1232
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,116
Ha ha!

1233
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:00,993
Oh

1234
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,773
Give me some of that

1235
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,775
Where's the bathroom?

1236
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,777
Oh, through the closet

1237
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,115
Wow!

1238
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,053
I'm so tired
of defending my closet

1239
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,114
I always had
a problem with space

1240
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,218
It was getting so I
couldn't find anything

1241
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,729
so I converted
a bedroom

1242
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,233
Wait till you've been
doing it for 16 years

1243
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,893
It's a great solution

1244
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,561
Not only the storage

1245
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,573
but you can see
everything you have

1246
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,610
Do you do bunny rabbits?

1247
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,581
Jennifer!

1248
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,620
Isn't this a great date?

1249
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:05,588
[Crying]

1250
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,768
Good morning

1251
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,770
Good morning

1252
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,772
Yeah, we are

1253
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,434
God help me

1254
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:33,388
Well, they've been looking
at just about everything...

1255
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,390
foreign bureaus,
domestic bureaus,

1256
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,552
all kinds of personnel,
even equipment

1257
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:43,361
Anyway, they seem
to be very, very serious

1258
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:48,564
about making me cut
24 million from the budget

1259
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:52,267
Now, this is going to mean
massive firings

1260
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:57,245
Uh l'm doing
whatever I can

1261
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:00,942
but I did want you
to be aware

1262
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,111
of this very serious situation

1263
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,247
Now, we're going to
also be covering

1264
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,191
the Alaskan
serial killer trial

1265
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,092
on a continuing basis

1266
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,256
I'd like it to be
assigned out of Washington

1267
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,824
We have to put someone
on a plane to Anchorage

1268
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,834
Jane?

1269
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,736
Who do you think

1270
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,671
George Weln
or Jennifer?

1271
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,209
Jennifer

1272
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:30,639
Jennifer

1273
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:34,875
Um Jennifer

1274
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,379
Hire the Hoover group
tomorrow

1275
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,224
Good night, Emily

1276
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:44,726
Good night, Jane

1277
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,729
Come on
I'll buy you a drink

1278
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:50,732
There's a big thing
at the Italian embassy

1279
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,392
I'm not sure

1280
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:55,062
I'd be good company
tonight

1281
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,073
Ahh, I'll be
the judge of that

1282
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,743
I'll get my coat

1283
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,412
Two, please

1284
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,249
Tom?

1285
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,755
Tom?

1286
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,091
[Stumbles]

1287
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,256
Ha ha ha!

1288
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:24,266
I'm all right

1289
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,527
Heavy hitters

1290
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,195
Yeah

1291
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,864
How are you doing?

1292
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,532
Great

1293
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,372
Network news,
Washington

1294
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,379
I love it

1295
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:43,848
What do you do when your real life
exceeds your dreams?

1296
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,013
Keep it to yourself

1297
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:50,219
You know, yesterday, I really
wanted to know your reaction

1298
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,990
to how we did
with the Libyan report

1299
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,555
I was going to ask

1300
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,794
but I think I'm

1301
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,803
I'm a little intimidated
with you

1302
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,738
Stop it! You can't talk
about feeling intimidated

1303
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:08,174
when you're
on top of the world

1304
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,735
I'm not buying into that

1305
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,008
I have a load to learn...

1306
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,174
You have your job

1307
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,182
Shut up

1308
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,412
OK

1309
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:24,090
Pretty peppy party,
isn't it, pal?

1310
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,687
I made one rule for myself
when this started

1311
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:32,201
and I realized I would take
a lot from you people

1312
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,702
because of being
from sports

1313
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,204
And that rule was?

1314
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,639
Never to pretend to know
more than I did

1315
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,839
Can you name all the members
of the Cabinet?

1316
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,011
OK, let's drop it

1317
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,053
I'm not taking
a test for you

1318
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,486
If that came up
in conversation...

1319
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,887
We're conversing

1320
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,017
The names of the Cabinet
have slipped my mind

1321
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:01,257
Say, do you know them?

1322
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,854
OK, don't name them

1323
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,400
Just tell me if you know

1324
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,732
Yes, Aaron, I know them

1325
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:09,396
OK

1326
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,064
All 12?

1327
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,233
Yes!

1328
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,243
There's only 10

1329
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:20,078
You're feeling good,
aren't you?

1330
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,083
I'm starting to, yeah

1331
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,086
Hey, we may do
state capitals next

1332
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,746
50, right?

1333
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,988

Hi There you are

1334
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,278
Is this it?

1335
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,938
Yes

1336
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:55,450
I am so exhausted

1337
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,782

sick tired

1339
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:03,121
I can't think,
and I can't move

1340
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:10,689
I'm just a dead lump
of poured-out flesh

1341
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,757
Would you like to come up?

1342
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:16,601
Maybe we could just sit here,
talk a little

1343
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,037
OK

1344
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,108
I'll have to do
a whole story on my own

1345
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,279
Eventually

1346
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,483
I have an idea
for something

1347
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,257
What?

1348
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,422
If I tell you

1349
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,934
can you manage
not to put it down

1350
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,096
or tell me why it won't work

1351
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,106
or is in bad
journalistic taste?

1352
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,268
Yes, Tom,
I think I can manage

1353
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,446
OK

01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,479
Ugh

1357
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:09,684
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it

1358
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,956
Well, keep it that way

1359
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,462
Wait a minute!

1360
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,293
I didn't say anything!

1361
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,798
Stand

1362
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,300
I'm innocent before I'm...

1363
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,801
Ooh!

1364
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,303
Innocent

1365
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:26,102

you can be innocent

According to the FBI

1400
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:11,302
there were more than 87,000 rapes
reported last year

1401
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,043
Most people think of a rapist
as a violent stranger

1402
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:18,280
but today, an attack may be
what's called date rape...

1403
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:21,721
being forced to have sex
with someone you know

1404
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,783
You want to find
a nice guy

1405
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,727

- Shh!
- Shh!
- Shh!

1409
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:38,069
I was lonely

1410
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,802
So

1411
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,572
we went to a movie

1412
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:46,080
and when he
brought me home

1413
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,675
he asked for a beer
and said he'd go

1414
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,244
So how do you
say no to that?

1415

1416
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,757
Really?

1417
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:59,260
So first, um

1418
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:03,264
it was kind of like
this wrestling match

1419
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,768
which was awful enough
because

1420
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,464
it got very violent

1421
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,768
What is this?

1422
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,436
And I'm a modest person

1423
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,284
And he ripped my clothes off

1424
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:26,219
And he forced me to

1425
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,226
make love

1426
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,854
And then he stayed

1427
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,160
in my apartment

1428
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,566
and forced me more times

I wasn't going to cry

have been my choice

a lot of the time

You have Saturday's news handy?

1499
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:19,754
It's a long while
since you've read the news

1500
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,256
I'll have somebody
work with you

1501
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,258
just on superficial
performance things

1502
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,691
OK

1503
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,696
I think I better
be alone for a while

1504
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,198
I understand
I'll go with you

1505
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:32,198
Thanks

1506
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,705
This is very uncomfortable
for me

1507
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:42,210
because, and I don't
mean this as a knock

1508
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,212
but we approach
these things so differently

1509
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,214
We sure do

1510
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,718
and I don't mean that
as a knock, either

1511
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,720
OK, go ahead

1512
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,723
I'll just tell you
what I think

1513
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:58,726
You can disregard it
if you want

1514
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,729
I don't know how effective
this will be

1515
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:04,231
because of
our different approaches

1516
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,732
OK

1517
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,236
Reports tonight...

1518
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,740
Wait Your coat jacket
is rising up in back

1519
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:13,740
OK

1520
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:16,744
When you sit,
sit on your jacket

1521
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,747
That will give you
a good line

1522
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,248
Reports tonight...

1523
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:23,250
Look at the monitor

1524
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,752
OK

1525
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,755
Reports tonight
from far down

1526
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:30,257
on the Arabian peninsula

1527
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,418
indicate that heavy fighting...

1528
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,086
Your jacket, Aaron

1529
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:36,996
What are you doing?
Don't touch me

1530
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,760
Sit on it

1531
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,768
But just don't handle me

1532
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,701
I'm sitting on it!

1533
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,762
Look

1534
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,172
Fantastic tip!

1535
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:49,267
That's great

1536
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,782
Continues for a second day

1537
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,478
between government
and rebel forces in pro-Soviet...

1538
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,485
No

1539
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,613
Don't let your eyes move

1540
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,657
from the beginning to end

1541
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,784
You don't want to
look shifty, do you?

1542
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,953
No

1543
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:10,795
The right side of your face
is the good one

1544
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,324
They'll let me
do the news like this?

1545
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,805
Heavy fighting
continues for...

1546
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,810
Try to punch
one word or phrase

1547
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,743
in every sentence

1548
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,247
One idea per story

1549
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,977
Punch

1550
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,254
You were smoking there
toward the end

1551
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:36,257
The pointers were great
I'll study the tape

1552
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:39,260
Remember you're not
just reading the news

1553
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,262
you're narrating it

1554
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,265
You're selling them
this idea of you

1555
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,767
You're saying,
"Trust me I'm credible"

1556
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,929
So when you
feel yourself just reading

1557
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,267
stop!

1558
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,774
And start selling a little

1559
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,278
OK So long

1560

01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,106
[Ring]

1562
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,411
You look like
this porcelain thing

1563
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,615
You look beautiful
You look beautiful

1564
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,248
That's gorgeous!

1565
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,258
What's that?

1566
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,524
I spilled rum
on my jacket

1567
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,759
Help me pick
something out

1568
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,765
OK

1569
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,272
I'm thinking the gray suit

[Dials]

1571
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,278
Tom, why don't
I meet you there?

1572
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:07,281
I got some stuff
to take care of

1573
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,284
Did you rent the tux
or buy it?

1574
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,286
I knew it

1575
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,787
How much?

1576
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,288
Wow!

1577
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,291
OK, I'll see you there

1578
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,293
You're going with him?

1579
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,794
Don't wear that shirt

1580
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,159
No, blue

1581
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,721
Let me look at the gray

1582
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,234
Not bad, right?

1583
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:28,735
Looks nice

1584
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,238
So help me pick a tie

1585
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,570
OK You brought
all of them

1586
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,576
How much was the tux?

1587
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:36,804
1,140 bucks

1588
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,038
No

1589
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,546
Yeah Try this one

1590
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,253
Not bad

1591
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:56,092
I read about it
in a magazine

1592
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:59,099
That way you don't
put on too much

1593
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,761
Could you at least pretend
it's awkward

1594
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,498
me showing up

1595
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,767
while you're getting ready
for this date?

1596
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,274
It's not a date!

1597
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,776
It's coworkers going
to a professional conclave

1598
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:21,049
I hate missing it

1599
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,057
I wish I could be there

1600
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,057
Me, too

1601
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,026
If it gets dull
before 11:00

1602
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,028
you'll drop by the studio

1603
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,859
I'm not sure I can

1604
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,297
I'll have the tape

1605
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:35,359
I'll wait for you afterwards
at my house

1606
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,870
OK, great

1607
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,931
Good luck

1608
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,534
Thanks
Have a good time tonight

1609
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,045

The Marriott

1611
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,214
What is it?

1612
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,379
What's the matter?

1613
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,391
What are you doing?

1614
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,386
Oh, no

My little tailor!

1616
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,395
You were all wrinkled
and schmutzy

1617
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,460
I've got shoulders

1618
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,465
Good?

1619
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,412
Thanks

1620
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,415
Maybe I'll just stand here

1621
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,417
and guard your corner

1622
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,352

I want you to go

1626
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,873
All right

1627
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,877
I'm going to go get
a cellular

1628
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:55,882
Hey, Nick

1629
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,886
Read this over
See what you think

1630
01:20:58,954 --> 01:20:59,886

What are you doing here?

1634
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,394
Anchoring the weekend news

1635
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,396
I'm going to anchor it

1636
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,897
Hey!

1637
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,332
Way to go

1638
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,028
This is terrific

1639
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,901
This is a pleasure
to read, really

1640
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:20,806
Is there water on the set?

1641
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,106
Yeah, sure
You'll be fine

1642
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:27,380
Yes, I know what you mean

1643
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:30,384
The LA Times
is a great outfit

He was lecturing me

1646
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:38,892
I said, "I refuse
to look at it as a negative

1647
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,396
I'm young My news
appeals to people my age"

1648
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,399
He just hired
a 26-year-old producer

1649
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,401
No kidding? 26?

1650
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,919
Well, hello, Tom

1651
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,618
He moves and smiles

1652
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,422
and moves and smiles

1653
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,922
If he doesn't
see me soon

1654
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,490
we're not supposed to
be together

1655
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,972
It's for me?

1656
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,394
Hi, Jane

Hey, Arlene

1658
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,403
It's incredible who's here!

1659
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:57,904
Who?

1660
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:58,905
Me

1661
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,908
That's an outlaw dress

1662
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,375

01:30:39,032 --> 01:30:41,364
What do you mean,
flop sweat?

1828
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:44,962
I bet you were
the only one who knew

1829
01:30:45,038 --> 01:30:46,699
People phoned in

1830
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:48,104
Stop kidding!

1831
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:49,267
I'm not!

1832
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,776
There were complaining calls

1833
01:30:50,844 --> 01:30:52,869
because you were sweating?

1834
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:56,143
Nice ones worried
I was having a heart attack

1835
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:58,377
If all that happened

1836
01:30:58,452 --> 01:31:00,784
how come you're so chipper?

At some point, it was so bad,
it just got funny

1839
01:31:07,961 --> 01:31:10,896
My central nervous system
was telling me something

1840
01:31:10,964 --> 01:31:12,829
Sweat pouring down my face

1841
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,391

into my eyes

1842

this fusillade
of blow dryers...

1844
01:31:18,972 --> 01:31:21,406
all so I could
read introductions

covering the stories

which is what
I like to do anyway

1847

And I'm chipper
because you finally showed up

1848
01:31:31,818 --> 01:31:34,514
I'm going to cook for us

You can't end up with Tom

1882

I've never seen you

A guy with a pointy tail?

"Aah! Aah!"

No

You're serious...

1899
01:34:48,415 --> 01:34:51,350
He will be attractive,
nice and helpful

1900
01:34:51,418 --> 01:34:55,354
He'll work where he influences
a great God-fearing nation

1901
01:34:55,422 --> 01:34:59,791
He'll never do an evil thing
or hurt a living thing

1902
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:02,192
He'll just bit by little bit

just a tiny little bit

1907
01:35:11,438 --> 01:35:16,034
And he'll talk about all of us
really being salesmen

1908
01:35:19,379 --> 01:35:22,212
And he'll get

Hey, Aaron!

How?

1913

Because I think we have
the kind of friendship

where if I were the devil

1915

you'd be the only one
I'd tell!

Yes!

I taped it

It wasn't as bad
as he thinks, was it?

[Door Closes]

1992
01:40:17,476 --> 01:40:19,535
He's on assignment right now

1993
01:40:24,116 --> 01:40:25,606
Hi

1994
01:40:25,685 --> 01:40:29,086
I kept trying to call you
You never called me!

1995
01:40:29,155 --> 01:40:30,986
Were you just diddling me?

1996
01:40:31,057 --> 01:40:32,991
When I'm a woman

1997
01:40:33,059 --> 01:40:35,823
I get fucked around by you?

1998
01:40:35,895 --> 01:40:37,692
Jane, this is my dad

1999
01:40:42,568 --> 01:40:45,503
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir

2000
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:47,505
Please forgive what I said

2001
01:40:47,573 --> 01:40:48,767
Sorry

2002
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,607
Just light up a room
and leave, huh?

2003
01:41:00,586 --> 01:41:02,520
You want my opinion?

2004
01:41:02,588 --> 01:41:05,022
What's easy to miss
about Jane...

2005
01:41:05,091 --> 01:41:07,025
You want my opinion?

2006
01:41:07,093 --> 01:41:09,027
Yes, I would

2007
01:41:09,095 --> 01:41:11,029
The way she just acted

2008
01:41:11,097 --> 01:41:15,056
is not the way
an affectionate person acts

2009
01:41:15,134 --> 01:41:17,659
Yes, it would be my pleasure

2010
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,331
Rorish

2011
01:41:21,407 --> 01:41:23,671
When do you start
telling people?

2012
01:41:23,743 --> 01:41:25,608
Almost immediately, Bill

2013
01:41:25,678 --> 01:41:29,114
I'd like to take
everybody out after the show

2014
01:41:29,181 --> 01:41:30,113
Fantastic

2015
01:41:30,182 --> 01:41:31,615
Hello, Donny

2016
01:41:31,684 --> 01:41:33,618
Bill, what a surprise

2017
01:41:33,686 --> 01:41:35,620
Hi, Mr. Rorish

2018
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:41,626
Bill, this is hard on all of us

2019
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:44,128
It's no time for compliments

2020
01:41:44,196 --> 01:41:47,131
but I think
it's extraordinary of you

2021
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:49,633
to come down here for this

2022
01:41:49,702 --> 01:41:52,637
If we're not here
during the tough times

2023
01:41:52,705 --> 01:41:54,400
we're not a news organization

2024
01:41:54,473 --> 01:41:55,405
Bill!

2025
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,872
Welcome back to Washington

2026
01:42:00,946 --> 01:42:03,141
Bill

2027
01:42:03,215 --> 01:42:05,149
Thank you
Thank you

2028
01:42:06,218 --> 01:42:07,549
Thank you

2029
01:42:10,222 --> 01:42:13,157
I forget
Is she on the list?

2030
01:42:14,727 --> 01:42:17,161
This is a brutal layoff

2031
01:42:17,229 --> 01:42:21,393
And all because they couldn't
program Wednesday nights

2032
01:42:21,467 --> 01:42:24,994
You can make it less brutal

2033
01:42:25,071 --> 01:42:28,598
by knocking a million or so
off your salary

2034
01:42:32,678 --> 01:42:34,612
A bad joke
I'm sorry

2035
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,614
Awful It's a miserable day

2036
01:42:36,682 --> 01:42:40,618
That was just some kind
of sick joke defense mechanism

2037
01:42:40,686 --> 01:42:43,621
It just doesn't indicate
any of my feelings

2038
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:45,122
not one

2039
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:48,126
It just shows
the kind of stress

2040
01:42:48,194 --> 01:42:50,628
this represents for all of us

2041
01:42:50,696 --> 01:42:52,630
No excuse for it, though

2042
01:42:52,698 --> 01:42:53,630
Bill

2043
01:42:55,701 --> 01:42:56,895
Tom

2044
01:42:56,969 --> 01:42:58,630
It's about time

2045
01:42:58,704 --> 01:43:00,638
Good to see you

2046
01:43:12,218 --> 01:43:15,051
I feel terrible
about what happened

2047
01:43:17,223 --> 01:43:19,157
What did he say?

2048
01:43:20,726 --> 01:43:22,660
He said, um

2049
01:43:26,665 --> 01:43:28,792
that he liked you

2050
01:43:34,173 --> 01:43:39,201
Because you looked like
you had fire and honesty

2051
01:43:39,278 --> 01:43:41,109
No

2052
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:43,171
Did he really?

2053
01:43:43,249 --> 01:43:44,580
Yes

2054
01:43:55,194 --> 01:43:56,627
What?

2055
01:43:56,695 --> 01:43:58,629
Come here
Come here

2056
01:43:58,697 --> 01:44:00,631
Uh

2057
01:44:03,202 --> 01:44:05,136
Paul canned me

2058
01:44:08,207 --> 01:44:10,641
Well, my brother
will feel great

2059
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,678
Now he's not
the only screw-up

2060
01:44:13,746 --> 01:44:16,271
Tom, Paul wants to see you

2061
01:44:26,659 --> 01:44:28,593
Bob, I just found out

2062
01:44:28,661 --> 01:44:30,652
Sons of bitches!

2063
01:44:38,671 --> 01:44:40,605
Ernie, they're calling from work

2064
01:44:40,673 --> 01:44:43,608
Tell them I'm on my way in

2065
01:44:43,676 --> 01:44:45,109
It's Paul

2066
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:11,135
He'll just be a minute

2067
01:45:11,203 --> 01:45:13,637
I hate this so much

2068
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:21,145
You know, I'm just old enough

2069
01:45:21,213 --> 01:45:24,649
to be flattered by the term
"early retirement"

2070
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:27,151
That's wonderful
What a lovely line

2071
01:45:27,219 --> 01:45:31,155
Now, if there's anything
I can do for you...

2072
01:45:32,725 --> 01:45:35,159
I certainly hope
you'll die soon

2073
01:45:40,232 --> 01:45:41,164
Tom

2074
01:45:54,747 --> 01:45:57,181
This is
a severe cutback, Tom

2075
01:45:57,249 --> 01:45:59,513
27 people
in this bureau alone

2076
01:45:59,585 --> 01:46:01,678
including technical personnel

2077
01:46:01,754 --> 01:46:04,723
We're going to reorganize
at the same time

2078
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:08,282
We're dropping you from Washington
and assigning you to London

2079
01:46:11,764 --> 01:46:15,200
You knew they were
going to offer me this

2080
01:46:15,267 --> 01:46:17,201
before I went in there

2081
01:46:17,269 --> 01:46:19,203
I can't stand this!

2082
01:46:19,271 --> 01:46:22,206
We care for each other
too much

2083
01:46:22,274 --> 01:46:24,208
to be dishonest

2084
01:46:24,276 --> 01:46:25,641
I'm leaving

2085
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:27,645
No matter who they
replace me with

2086
01:46:27,713 --> 01:46:30,147
they were making me
leave anyway

2087
01:46:30,215 --> 01:46:32,149
The fact that it's you

2088
01:46:32,217 --> 01:46:35,152
takes some of the sting
out of it

2089
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:39,156
And I don't think
you're any better than I am

2090
01:46:39,224 --> 01:46:42,022
Goddamn!
No, I'm not!

2091
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:49,166
Are you out of your mind?

2092
01:46:49,234 --> 01:46:51,361
Have you guys seen Jane?

2093
01:46:51,437 --> 01:46:53,667
She's back there

2094
01:46:53,739 --> 01:46:55,673
getting my job

2095
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:59,040
The first woman bureau chief
we've ever had here

2096
01:47:01,347 --> 01:47:03,076
What happened to you?

2097
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,946
They booted me
out of Washington

2098
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:08,952
Impossible!

2099
01:47:09,021 --> 01:47:11,182
There isn't a system
in the world

2100
01:47:11,256 --> 01:47:13,690
that wouldn't value
one of us

2101
01:47:13,759 --> 01:47:16,353
What did they do to you?

2102
01:47:16,428 --> 01:47:19,192
It's what he did
I'm proud of him

2103
01:47:19,264 --> 01:47:21,698
They told me
they'd keep me

2104
01:47:21,767 --> 01:47:24,634
because they could plug me
into any story

2105
01:47:24,703 --> 01:47:27,137
and my salary was in line

2106
01:47:27,206 --> 01:47:28,798
so I quit

2107
01:47:31,343 --> 01:47:33,641
Jane, I got
to tell you something

2108
01:47:33,712 --> 01:47:34,644
Yeah?

2109
01:47:34,713 --> 01:47:36,647
Except for socially

2110
01:47:36,715 --> 01:47:38,649
you're my role model

2111
01:47:43,722 --> 01:47:46,589
Hope I can get him back

2112
01:47:52,731 --> 01:47:54,665
You packing up tonight?

2113
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:57,668
Mm-hmm I'm sorry
they're sending you down

2114
01:47:57,736 --> 01:48:00,170
I'm sure you'll make it back

2115
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,173
Where are they sending you?

2116
01:48:02,241 --> 01:48:03,443
London

2117
01:48:03,576 --> 01:48:05,009
London?

2118
01:48:05,077 --> 01:48:06,908
Yeah

2119
01:48:06,979 --> 01:48:08,503
That's a promotion

2120
01:48:08,581 --> 01:48:10,105
I don't think so

2121
01:48:10,183 --> 01:48:12,674
Yes! That's where
they sent Rorish

2122
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:14,686
before they made him anchor

2123
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:16,688
I can't believe you!

2124
01:48:16,756 --> 01:48:19,190
They're grooming you
for it all!

2125
01:48:19,258 --> 01:48:21,692
You don't even know it!

2126
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,695
Keep it down, will you?

2127
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:25,594
Let me ask you something

2128
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:28,793
You had one camera crew
on that daybreak piece?

2129
01:48:28,868 --> 01:48:31,132
Yeah

2130
01:48:32,472 --> 01:48:35,134
Sticking around
for the farewell party?

2131
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:37,642
No, it won't be much fun

2132
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:39,644
watching Martin Klein
and Ernie

2133
01:48:39,712 --> 01:48:42,647
turn in their credentials
to the security guard

2134
01:48:42,715 --> 01:48:43,909
Hi, Hank

2135
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:46,645
Can I speak with my wife?

2136
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:49,654
No message
I'll see her at home

2137
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:55,490
This is one story
they're not going to cover

2138
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:58,155
If the network
doesn't cover it

2139
01:48:58,231 --> 01:49:00,631
it's not important,
so why worry?

2140
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:03,760
I'm going to miss you

2141
01:49:05,505 --> 01:49:08,997
You're a prick
in a great way

2142
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:10,667
Ha ha ha!

2143
01:49:10,743 --> 01:49:12,677
You know what I mean

2144
01:49:12,745 --> 01:49:15,680
I like the way
it made me sound

2145
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:17,682
OK Be good

2146
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:26,384
We'll figure out
who's hiring, OK?

2147
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:29,121
Nobody knows
what they'll do now

2148
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:31,129
It's not fair, Donny

2149
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:32,630
Thank you, Jane

2150
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:34,131
Good luck

2151
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:36,634
Oh, sorry

2152
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:44,472
You know, what I always wanted
to tell you is that

2153
01:49:45,711 --> 01:49:48,646
Jane, Martin would like
to see you

2154
01:49:48,714 --> 01:49:50,648
if you get a chance

2155
01:50:10,169 --> 01:50:13,161
This is the third cutback
in four years

2156
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:19,677
These people

2157
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:23,681
It's all so awful

2158
01:50:23,749 --> 01:50:25,614
It just hurts

2159
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:27,619
physically, doesn't it?

2160
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:31,123
Like something's wrong
with your bones

2161
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:33,124
Like your

2162
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:38,630
organs are shifting
inside your body

2163
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:45,637
Maybe I haven't
been here long enough

2164
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:49,641
Hey, congratulations
on the promotion

2165
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:52,143
Congratulations?
How can you say that

2166
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,644
to me?

2167
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:56,648
I'm sorry
I can't stand here feeling bad

2168
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:58,650
because I don't feel worse

2169
01:50:58,718 --> 01:51:02,654
This has happened at every station
I've ever been to

2170
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:11,663
Do they owe you
any time off?

2171
01:51:16,235 --> 01:51:17,668
14 weeks

2172
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:21,673
I think it's crazy for you
to come here tomorrow

2173
01:51:21,741 --> 01:51:23,675
and start a new job

2174
01:51:23,743 --> 01:51:25,608
I have a week

2175
01:51:25,678 --> 01:51:29,114
before I have to get
to my new job

2176
01:51:29,181 --> 01:51:33,117
Let's get the hell away
to some island fast and

2177
01:51:35,187 --> 01:51:39,123
and find out how we are together
away from this

2178
01:51:46,699 --> 01:51:48,633
Well

2179
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:50,635
I just think

2180
01:51:52,204 --> 01:51:56,140
that's an extraordinary
proposal

2181
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:58,142
That's yes?

2182
01:52:00,713 --> 01:52:02,647
That's more than yes

2183
01:52:07,219 --> 01:52:09,153
That's "you bet"

2184
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:20,831
[Ring]

2185
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:21,832
Hello

2186
01:52:21,901 --> 01:52:24,165
Bastard! Sneak! Quitter!

2187
01:52:24,236 --> 01:52:25,100
Speaking

2188
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:27,105
I just found out

2189
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:29,607
You didn't
say anything to me

2190
01:52:29,675 --> 01:52:30,972
Will you meet me?

2191
01:52:31,043 --> 01:52:33,876
No, I can't
Maybe next week

2192
01:52:33,946 --> 01:52:36,039
No I'm going away tomorrow

2193
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:39,050
I'll meet you at the place
near the thing

2194
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:40,107
OK

2195
01:52:44,723 --> 01:52:46,088
Anyway, my agent says

2196
01:52:46,157 --> 01:52:48,091
he has a very hot prospect...

2197
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,127
the number two station
in Portland

2198
01:52:50,195 --> 01:52:53,221
They want to be
as good as the networks

2199
01:52:53,298 --> 01:52:56,495
Personally, I think
he should aim higher

2200
01:52:56,568 --> 01:52:58,968
Tell me the god's
honest truth

2201
01:52:59,037 --> 01:53:01,505
Are you leaving
because of me?

2202
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:03,063
Ernie said

2203
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:05,507
you're lucky
if you get out

2204
01:53:05,577 --> 01:53:07,511
while you can still cry

2205
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:11,015
I should have quit
three years ago

2206
01:53:11,082 --> 01:53:14,017
You're just trying
to say great stuff

2207
01:53:14,085 --> 01:53:18,522
so I'll feel even worse
that you're not around

2208
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:21,820
Let's go

2209
01:53:24,095 --> 01:53:27,030
I just want
to s-sit here

2210
01:53:34,105 --> 01:53:37,040
I mean, the feeling
to stay here

2211
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,043
is powerful

2212
01:53:42,781 --> 01:53:44,408
Why is that?

2213
01:53:44,482 --> 01:53:48,282
Maybe the best part
of your life is over

2214
01:53:48,353 --> 01:53:51,982
and you don't want
to start the bad part

2215
01:53:52,057 --> 01:53:57,256
You are now required
to sit here with me!

2216
01:53:57,329 --> 01:53:58,990
Come on!

2217
01:53:59,064 --> 01:54:00,998
Be smart for a second

2218
01:54:01,066 --> 01:54:02,499
What do you

2219
01:54:04,903 --> 01:54:06,837
think will happen to us?

2220
01:54:06,905 --> 01:54:08,497
What will happen?

2221
01:54:08,573 --> 01:54:10,006
That's very easy

2222
01:54:10,075 --> 01:54:12,009
Five, six years from now

2223
01:54:12,077 --> 01:54:15,012
I'll be back
to collect an award

2224
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,981
representing the surge
in foreign coverage

2225
01:54:18,049 --> 01:54:19,516
by local stations

2226
01:54:19,584 --> 01:54:22,144
What will they
call the award?

2227
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,152
The Euchy

2228
01:54:23,221 --> 01:54:25,781
Yes

2229
01:54:25,857 --> 01:54:27,449
Anyway, I'll be walking

2230
01:54:27,525 --> 01:54:29,186
with my wife and children

2231
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:30,488
We'll bump into you

2232
01:54:30,562 --> 01:54:32,257
My son will say something

2233
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:35,527
and I will say,
"It's not nice

2234
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,125
to make fun
of single fat ladies"

2235
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:48,168
You won't be able to stay
mad at me, right?

2236
01:54:49,547 --> 01:54:51,174
I hope so

2237
01:54:53,752 --> 01:54:56,482
No, I'm not really mad

2238
01:54:56,554 --> 01:54:58,613
I'll miss you,
we'll talk

2239
01:54:58,690 --> 01:54:59,987
we'll always be friends

2240
01:55:00,058 --> 01:55:01,992
we'll get hot
for each other

2241
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:04,927
and we'll never
act on it OK?

2242
01:55:08,266 --> 01:55:10,496
I got to go

2243
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:26,607
Jane?

2244
01:55:26,684 --> 01:55:30,017
You know how Tom
had tears in his eyes

2245
01:55:30,088 --> 01:55:32,386
in that interview
with that girl?

2246
01:55:32,457 --> 01:55:35,392
Ask yourself how we
were able to see that

2247
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:37,394
when he only had
one camera

2248
01:55:37,462 --> 01:55:39,828
and it was pointed
at the girl

2249
01:55:39,898 --> 01:55:41,832
during the entire interview

2250
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:45,336
I'm fairly sure
I was right to tell you

2251
01:56:12,564 --> 01:56:13,997
It was just

2252
01:56:16,568 --> 01:56:18,001
this whole thing

2253
01:56:18,069 --> 01:56:20,003
has just messed me up

2254
01:56:22,574 --> 01:56:25,008
maybe more than
it should have

2255
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:28,511
I'm sorry

2256
01:56:31,116 --> 01:56:32,515
Are you OK?

2257
01:56:32,584 --> 01:56:34,017
Yes, I'm sorry

2258
01:56:34,085 --> 01:56:35,518
Don't be silly

2259
01:56:35,587 --> 01:56:37,521
What are you sorry about?

2260
01:56:37,589 --> 01:56:39,022
I just went

2261
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:40,921
Oh, we just need a...

2262
01:56:44,028 --> 01:56:47,464
We just need a minute
more of your time

2263
01:56:47,532 --> 01:56:50,399
So he can shoot
from behind you

2264
01:56:50,468 --> 01:56:51,833
toward me, and, uh

2265
01:56:51,903 --> 01:56:55,464
we'll have some place to go
when we cut

2266
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:58,475
I sit here,
I nod my head

2267
01:56:58,543 --> 01:56:59,976
and I look nerdy

2268
01:57:00,044 --> 01:57:01,477
Tom, that kills me

2269
01:57:01,546 --> 01:57:03,980
we didn't get you on camera

2270
01:57:04,048 --> 01:57:06,915
So powerful...
seeing your reaction

2271
01:57:06,985 --> 01:57:09,977
I thought you were
going to cry yourself

2272
01:57:10,054 --> 01:57:12,215
That would have
been something

2273
01:57:14,225 --> 01:57:15,988
Give me a minute

2274
01:57:20,565 --> 01:57:21,998
Fuckin'...

2275
01:57:32,076 --> 01:57:34,510
Oh, it's amazing

[Click]

2277
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:24,994
Pardon me, please

2278
01:58:25,063 --> 01:58:27,497
Where would we catch a bus

2279
01:58:27,565 --> 01:58:28,998
to Washington?

2280
01:58:29,067 --> 01:58:31,501
Turn right

2281
01:58:31,569 --> 01:58:33,230
Thank you very much

2282
01:58:33,304 --> 01:58:34,999
See? I told you

2283
01:58:41,079 --> 01:58:43,013
Look who's
the organized one

2284
01:58:43,081 --> 01:58:45,515
I got everything!

2285
01:58:45,583 --> 01:58:46,948
I'm not going

01:58:53,024 --> 01:58:54,958
[Sighs]

2287
01:58:55,026 --> 01:58:56,891
Why?

2288
01:58:56,961 --> 01:58:58,952
I saw the taped outtakes

2289
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:01,464
of the interview
with the girl

2290
01:59:01,532 --> 01:59:03,932
I know you...

2291
01:59:04,002 --> 01:59:07,460
acted your reaction
after the interview

2292
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:21,985
It's verboten, huh?

2293
01:59:24,555 --> 01:59:27,490
I thought since I almost

2294
01:59:27,558 --> 01:59:30,527
did it the first time, but

2295
01:59:30,595 --> 01:59:32,995
but I get you

2296
01:59:33,064 --> 01:59:34,998
That's not the reason

2297
01:59:35,066 --> 01:59:36,624
you're not coming

2298
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:39,192
Of course it's the reason
It's terrible

2299
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,500
Come with me
We'll disagree

2300
01:59:41,572 --> 01:59:44,439
and get a tan
at the same time

2301
01:59:44,509 --> 01:59:46,943
If you're going to be glib

2302
01:59:47,011 --> 01:59:48,842
I'm going to lose it!

2303
01:59:48,913 --> 01:59:50,437
Jane, keep it down

2304
01:59:50,515 --> 01:59:53,143
I was up all night, and

2305
01:59:53,217 --> 01:59:54,149
Jane

2306
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,988
it made me ill

2307
01:59:58,056 --> 02:00:00,251
That's better

2308
02:00:00,325 --> 02:00:03,123
You could get fired
for that

2309
02:00:03,194 --> 02:00:04,718
I got promoted for that

2310
02:00:04,796 --> 02:00:07,458
Working up tears
for a news piece cutaway?

2311
02:00:07,532 --> 02:00:09,227
You crossed the line...

2312
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,790
It's hard not to

2313
02:00:10,868 --> 02:00:13,336
They keep moving
the little sucker!

2314
02:00:13,404 --> 02:00:14,962
It...

2315
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:17,439
It proves that
the differences we...

2316
02:00:17,508 --> 02:00:19,476
This is a one-way argument

2317
02:00:19,544 --> 02:00:20,977
We have six days

2318
02:00:21,045 --> 02:00:23,479
If we fight,
we'll come home

2319
02:00:23,548 --> 02:00:25,072
If you don't go

2320
02:00:25,149 --> 02:00:27,640
I leave for London
after that

2321
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:30,483
So it would be
a very big deal...

2322
02:00:32,523 --> 02:00:33,990
The plane is boarding

2323
02:00:34,058 --> 02:00:35,923
You're good at deadlines

2324
02:00:35,993 --> 02:00:37,688
Here's your ticket

2325
02:00:39,464 --> 02:00:40,988
It's amazing

2326
02:00:41,065 --> 02:00:43,499
You commit this
breach of ethics

2327
02:00:43,568 --> 02:00:45,593
then you act as if...

2328
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:49,436
I'm giving you a hard time
about nothing!

2329
02:00:49,507 --> 02:00:50,940
Try and get this!

2330
02:00:51,008 --> 02:00:52,942
When you edited
that piece...

2331
02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:54,341
I'm leaving now

2332
02:00:55,847 --> 02:00:57,007
Gate E-2

2333
02:02:14,025 --> 02:02:15,458
Good morning!

2334
02:02:15,526 --> 02:02:17,960
Good morning

2335
02:02:18,029 --> 02:02:19,963
DuPont Circle, please

2336
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:22,965
Don't take the beltway

2337
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:25,468
because at this time of day

2338
02:02:25,536 --> 02:02:27,470
there's going to be a...

2339
02:02:27,538 --> 02:02:29,472
Go any way you want

2340
02:02:42,553 --> 02:02:44,487
But New York Avenue's faster

2341
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:55,991
When they told me
Bill had decided to retire

2342
02:02:56,067 --> 02:02:58,501
and offered me
the evening news

2343
02:02:58,569 --> 02:03:02,005
I thought it was
the same kind of joke

2344
02:03:02,073 --> 02:03:05,008
we used to pull
at the station...

2345
02:03:05,076 --> 02:03:09,012
turning someone's prompter off
in the middle of a show

2346
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:10,513
[Laughter]

2347
02:03:10,581 --> 02:03:13,015
But when they heard
my reaction

2348
02:03:13,084 --> 02:03:15,018
they thought I was kidding

2349
02:03:15,086 --> 02:03:18,021
I told them
I'd be their anchor

2350
02:03:18,089 --> 02:03:21,525
but I didn't want to be
the managing editor

2351
02:03:21,592 --> 02:03:24,527
that there were people
better qualified

2352
02:03:24,595 --> 02:03:26,028
than I
to control the content

2353
02:03:26,097 --> 02:03:29,533
and if there weren't,
we were all in trouble

2354
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,033
[Laughter]

2355
02:03:31,102 --> 02:03:33,036
Now to something
more important

2356
02:03:33,104 --> 02:03:36,540
I'd like to introduce
my fiancée

2357
02:03:36,607 --> 02:03:39,041
Lila?

2358
02:03:52,924 --> 02:03:54,482
Oh, Aaron!

2359
02:03:54,559 --> 02:03:55,992
Congratulations

2360
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,493
Lila, Lila

2361
02:03:57,562 --> 02:03:59,496
Lila, this is Aaron Altman

2362
02:03:59,564 --> 02:04:01,088
Hi

2363
02:04:01,165 --> 02:04:02,962
This kid

2364
02:04:03,034 --> 02:04:06,367
couldn't possibly belong
to anyone else!

2365
02:04:06,437 --> 02:04:08,598
What's your name?

2366
02:04:08,673 --> 02:04:10,004
Clifford

2367
02:04:10,074 --> 02:04:12,338
Do you know
who this is?

2368
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:14,537
The big joke?

2369
02:04:14,612 --> 02:04:16,477
Ha ha

2370
02:04:16,547 --> 02:04:19,641
Ooh I don't know

2371
02:04:19,717 --> 02:04:21,810
You know, Jane’s down here

2372
02:04:21,886 --> 02:04:23,513
I'm taking Cliff to see her

2373
02:04:23,588 --> 02:04:25,021
Can I come along?

2374
02:04:25,089 --> 02:04:26,522
Yeah

2375
02:04:26,591 --> 02:04:29,526
I'll meet you back
at the place? OK?

2376
02:04:29,594 --> 02:04:31,459
Yes

2377
02:04:31,529 --> 02:04:33,019
We'll call Mommy later

2378
02:04:33,097 --> 02:04:34,530
Your speech was magnificent

2379
02:04:34,599 --> 02:04:38,035
Oh, I forgot to say something
about the speech

2380
02:04:38,102 --> 02:04:40,093
I appreciate that

2381
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:42,537
Tom, we are proud of you

2382
02:04:42,607 --> 02:04:43,972
Thanks

2383
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:47,973
Hey, guys!

2384
02:04:48,045 --> 02:04:49,514
Come over here!

2385
02:04:59,056 --> 02:05:00,489
Hey

2386
02:05:00,558 --> 02:05:01,991
Hey, what is this?

2387
02:05:02,059 --> 02:05:05,495
My life is rushing
in front of my eyes!

2388
02:05:05,563 --> 02:05:06,996
Clifford, come over here!

2389
02:05:07,064 --> 02:05:09,498
I want to show you something!

2390
02:05:09,567 --> 02:05:11,000
Clifford, come on!

2391
02:05:11,068 --> 02:05:13,502
I want to show you something

2392
02:05:20,077 --> 02:05:21,510
Picnic?

2393
02:05:21,579 --> 02:05:24,013
I thought
for old Cliff here

2394
02:05:24,081 --> 02:05:26,015
but who knew about this?

2395
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:28,017
It'll be great, though

2396
02:05:28,085 --> 02:05:30,519
Did you get in last night?

2397
02:05:30,588 --> 02:05:32,021
Yeah Extreme culture shock

2398
02:05:32,089 --> 02:05:35,024
You are more adorable
than your pictures

2399
02:05:35,092 --> 02:05:36,525
Look at you!

2400
02:05:38,095 --> 02:05:41,030
Look what I got
for you, Cliff

2401
02:05:41,098 --> 02:05:42,531
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

2402
02:05:44,035 --> 02:05:45,468
That's terrific!

2403
02:05:45,536 --> 02:05:47,470
Let me see it, Cliff

2404
02:05:47,538 --> 02:05:48,971
Come here

2405
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:51,975
Are you any closer
to a decision?

2406
02:05:52,043 --> 02:05:53,476
I think so

2407
02:05:53,544 --> 02:05:55,478
Aaron, they've
been talking to me

2408
02:05:55,546 --> 02:05:56,979
about being managing editor

2409
02:05:57,048 --> 02:05:58,481
Really?

2410
02:05:58,549 --> 02:05:59,982
Whoo!

2411
02:06:00,051 --> 02:06:01,985
I'm going to take it

2412
02:06:02,053 --> 02:06:03,486
Oh, that is...

2413
02:06:03,554 --> 02:06:04,987
Jane, what a job!

2414
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:06,489
A great surprise!

2415
02:06:06,557 --> 02:06:09,492
I didn't think
we had a chance

2416
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,996
They told me you wanted
to stay in Washington

2417
02:06:13,064 --> 02:06:14,497
Well, there's a guy

2418
02:06:14,565 --> 02:06:17,500
but he says
he'll fly up a lot

2419
02:06:17,568 --> 02:06:19,001
Well, we should talk

2420
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:21,504
Do you have time for dinner?

2421
02:06:21,572 --> 02:06:24,006
I'd like you to meet Lila

2422
02:06:24,075 --> 02:06:27,010
I was really
looking forward to that

2423
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:31,014
I'm going to go back
in a few hours

2424
02:06:31,082 --> 02:06:33,516
It's so good to see you

2425
02:06:33,584 --> 02:06:35,518
It's nice to see you

2426
02:06:35,586 --> 02:06:37,019
Congratulations,
on the history's

2427

longest winning streak

2428
02:06:38,589 --> 02:06:41,524
If you ever get restless
in Portland

2429
02:06:41,592 --> 02:06:43,025
let me know

2430
02:06:43,094 --> 02:06:44,618
Why?

2431
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:47,463
OK

2432
02:06:48,866 --> 02:06:50,299

Where are you going?

2436
02:06:59,543 --> 02:07:00,976
Cliff!

2437
02:07:01,045 --> 02:07:02,979
Go back to your father

2438
02:07:03,047 --> 02:07:04,981
Come on, Cliff!

2439
02:07:05,049 --> 02:07:06,482
Come on

2440
02:07:09,053 --> 02:07:10,486
Daddy

2441
02:07:12,056 --> 02:07:13,489
So who's the guy?

2442
02:07:13,557 --> 02:07:15,991
Uh, well, we met about...

2443
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:17,994
three months ago

2444
02:07:18,062 --> 02:07:21,498
He works at
the surgeon general's office

2445
02:07:21,565 --> 02:07:23,499
He loves boating

2446
02:07:23,567 --> 02:07:26,502
So, he's been getting me
into waterskiing

2447
02:07:26,570 --> 02:07:28,504
Ha ha ha!

2448
02:07:28,572 --> 02:07:30,005
I like it!

2449
02:07:30,074 --> 02:07:32,008
So what about you lately?

2450
02:07:32,076 --> 02:07:33,509
Well

2451
02:07:33,577 --> 02:07:36,011
my wife got
this new job

2452
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,014
