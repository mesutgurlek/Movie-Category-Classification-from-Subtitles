00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:50,662
Benden daha az tecrübeli olanlar..

3
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,727
...Size kýzlar hakkýnda söyleyeceklerim var.

4
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:56,202
Temel olarak, çok iðrençlerdir.

5
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,828
Anlýyorsunuz ya, bu taraftan her þey oldukça siyah beyaz kadar farklý görünüyor.

6
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:04,205
Eskiden, 1 ilkokul 1 yada 2 sýnýftayken..

7
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,846
.. erkekler arasýndaki en yaygýn düþünce, baþkalarýna bit bulaþtýrdýklarýydý.

8
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,505
Biiit!! Bana dokundu!!

9
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,948
- Bitler!!!
- Dokunma bana!!

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,021
Bitli! O artýk bitlendi!!

11
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,685
Aslýnda, bit ne demek, bilmiyorduk bile!

12
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,987
...but the general feeling was,
if a girl touched you...

13
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:23,756
...some very, very bad things
were gonna happen.

14
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:36,409
How right we were.

15
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,635
This is me now.

16
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,940
I've been in love
for two and a half weeks...

17
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:44,516
...and it's a pain I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemies.

18
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:47,487
I'm not gonna dress this up pretty.

19
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,715
Just about everything I know
about women, love...

20
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,860
...and the birds and the freaking bees...

21
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,587
...I've learned in the past
two and half weeks.

22
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,230
But when you're 10 years old...

23
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,127
Rosemary!

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,861
...two and a half weeks
can be a lifetime.

25
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,704
Okay, here's the deal:

26
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:24,681
If you came to hear some
great New York love story...

27
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,080
...keep walking.

28
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:29,018
You want a real love story?
I'll tell you a real one.

29
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,594
My parents, Camp Anawana,
Catskill Mountains, 1984.

30
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:37,890
My father was 19
and the star sports counselor.

31
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:39,896
- Shoot it.
- My mom was a C.I.T.

32
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,359
People say she reminded them
of Sissy Spacek.

33
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:50,401
What happened under that harvest moon
that summer, that's the stuff of legend.

34
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:53,342
In my family,
it's what we like to refer to as...

35
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:57,050
...ancient history.

36
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,451
These days,
my dad's sleeping on the couch.

37
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:03,522
Due to this unusual quirk
in the New York state divorce code...

38
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,687
...neither one of my parents
can move out of our apartment...

39
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:10,319
...until their settlement is signed,
sealed and delivered.

40
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:15,631
Needless to say, it doesn't make
for the greatest living environment.

41
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,431
- Did you drink my Pepsi?
- It was my Pepsi.

42
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:19,834
It had my name on it.

43
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,374
Especially since my mom's
recently decided to start dating again.

44
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,037
- Hello.
- Leslie?

45
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:29,978
Is there anything worse
than being mistaken for your mother?

46
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:32,585
- No, this is Gabe.
- Hey, sorry, big guy.

47
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:36,450
You two sound so much alike.
Is your mom around? This is Ronny.

48
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,388
I got it, honey. You can hang up.

49
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,891
Now, that's a real love story.

50
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:48,297
This much I know firsthand:
Love ends.

51
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,132
You want proof?
Check out my parents' refrigerator.

52
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:58,471
Why did I ever have to discover
this ridiculous pain inside of me?

53
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:03,506
Because two and a half weeks ago,
before all this love nonsense...

54
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:05,879
And I'm not just saying this either.

55
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,214
No, before all this, I was happy.

56
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,720
No!

57
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,221
Truly happy.

58
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:15,522
I'm serious. My life was filled with song.

59
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,324
And sport.

60
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,257
And constant adventure.

61
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,595
Oh, Rosemary.

62
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:28,640
Rosemary, Rosemary, Rosemary.

63
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,902
Why did you ever
have to come into my life?

64
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:33,845
Who am I kidding?

65
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:37,246
She's been in my life
for as long as I can remember.

66
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:41,120
For one little stretch there
during kindergarten...

67
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,313
...you might even say we were friends.

68
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,755
What are you kids doing under there?

69
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:52,330
That was before first grade,
when the iron curtain came down.

70
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,092
Girls on one side...

71
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,963
...boys on the other.

72
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,907
Oh, she was still there, of course.

73
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,270
I have the class pictures to prove it.

74
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:06,072
I just didn't see her.

75
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,046
I lived in a world of men.

76
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:11,207
So who wants to go to Duane Reade?

77
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,945
Man, I am not helping you
steal Kit Kats again, Max.

78
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,349
Watch it!

79
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:18,617
But you got no trouble eating the candy
I provide for you, do you?

80
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,591
I'm not doing lookout. I'm sorry, guys.

81
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:25,129
- Hey, guys, it's 5:00. I gotta roll.
- I thought we were gonna shoot some 21.

82
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,290
No, I'm meeting my dad
for football practice.

83
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,265
See you guys later.

84
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,837
The two of you are so nuts, man.

85
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,338
See, my father and I
have this sort of plan.

86
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,341
I'm gonna be the Tiger Woods
of the place-kicking world.

87
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,479
- Yeah!
- And he's gonna be my Earl.

88
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,878
See? If you dedicate yourself
to one goal and one goal only...

89
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,677
...at a ridiculously young age...

90
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:47,548
...history has taught us
we can achieve anything. Get back.

91
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,246
- One, two, three...
- You see? Before Rosemary Telesco...

92
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:51,857
...I had a very fulfilling life.

93
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,015
Nice.

94
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,028
How did it get so late?

95
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,596
Your mother's gonna have
dinner waiting for you.

96
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,563
What do you say we stop by Patsy's
and get a couple of slices?

97
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,259
- Can I take karate?
- Karate?

98
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:04,836
It's a martial art.

99
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:07,769
- What's karate have to do with place-kicking?
- It can't hurt.

100
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,570
- Well, how much is it?
- I can?

101
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:14,578
If it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg.
It might help your flexibility. Sure.

102
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,740
Mistake number one
was ever taking that godforsaken class.

103
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,910
Karate is not about strength.

104
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,189
It's about skill. It's about focus.

105
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,297
It's an art of determination.

106
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:35,561
- When she showed up that first day...
- Sorry, my tap class ran late.

107
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:40,935
...I was actually kind of glad, you know.
A familiar face and all that.

108
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,377
I didn't know anybody else in the class.

109
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:54,685
If you can master the art of karate,
you can master anything.

110
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,922
Come on!

111
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:01,060
About face.

112
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,893
Middle punch, kiai.

113
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:08,832
You're each gonna progress
through this course at your own pace.

114
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:14,133
Those of you who pass the test
to get your yellow belt will be given yellow.

115
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:17,675
Those who pass red, red.

116
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:22,976
It's about finding your personal best.

117
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,314
Come on.

118
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:30,480
Now, I want you to pair up.
Everyone gets a sparring partner.

119
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,458
Oh, the painful dance of pairing up.

120
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:38,126
Twenty seconds of pure torture.

121
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:47,268
Now, I didn't want a girl for
a sparring partner. Would you?

122
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:56,415
Okay, let me tell you something
about Rosemary Telesco.

124
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:00,144
Rosemary wasn't the prettiest girl
in our class. That was Madison Shaw.

125
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:03,415
And she wasn't the second prettiest either.
That was Vanessa Muir.

126
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:08,119
No, Rosemary was third.
But, boy, could that girl do karate.

127
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:16,398
Keep it tight.

128
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:23,873
Don't get the wrong idea.
We weren't really friends.

129
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:27,241
We were just karate friends.

130
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,575
Back at school,
nothing changed, of course.

131
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:33,920
As far as the rest of the world
was concerned, the real world...

132
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,851
...that iron curtain was still solid.

133
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,692
But when we put on those white robes...

134
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:45,525
...we could see past our many differences
and fight like equals.

135
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:49,193
There was just one tiny problem.

136
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,998
I pretty much sucked at karate.

137
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,174
We all congratulate Rosemary Telesco...

138
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:02,509
...on being the first in the class
to earn her yellow belt.

139
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:05,117
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,317
Talk about an assault
to everything I knew about the world.

141
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,190
Girls mature faster than boys.

142
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,759
That's completely made up.
Boys are much more mature.

143
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:17,624
This isn't a matter of opinion, Gabe.
There were studies.

144
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:21,700
Girls speak first, they walk first.
I see it in my little sister's class.

145
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,461
The boys her age all seem retarded.

146
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:27,266
There's absolutely no reason I shouldn't
be able to get my yellow belt in a week.

147
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:29,875
- You don't take it seriously.
- I take it seriously.

148
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:33,207
You're not focused.
You think you're this natural.

149
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,314
- You don't practice.
- I practice.

150
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:36,949
- When?
- All the time.

151
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,779
You should practice with me.
You'd get better.

152
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,784
- Fine, let's practice.
- Name the time.

153
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,820
- I don't care. This afternoon.
- Fine.

154
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,219
Great.

155
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,623
Oh, I forgot. I have this one errand.

156
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:52,459
I'm supposed to be this flower girl
in a couple of weeks, and I have this fitting.

157
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,966
But it's gonna be, like, five minutes.
I promise.

158
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,464
Classic female move.
The bait and switch.

159
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,269
My mother's tricked me
into many a shoe store with that one.

160
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,477
Is there anything worse
than dress shopping?

161
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:08,876
I'm serious.

162
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,984
I'd rather have my toenails peeled off
one by one with pliers...

163
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,985
...than spend five minutes
in a dress store.

164
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:37,502
Okay, what's going on here?
What the heck is this?

165
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:42,377
My God, what's this feeling
in the pit of my stomach?

166
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,483
Who is this..?

167
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:49,054
This amazing creature before me?

168
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:51,420
What do you think?

169
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,986
You are going to be
the prettiest flower girl there.

170
00:11:57,898 --> 00:12:01,026
I'm definitely gonna be the oldest one.

171
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,569
Who..?

172
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:07,431
- Who's getting married?
- My mom's sister.

173
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,301
Oh. Cool.

174
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:15,010
It's kind of weird because she's,
like, seven months pregnant.

175
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:19,346
In that one moment, Rosemary Telesco
leaped past Vanessa Muir...

176
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,215
...past Madison Shaw.

177
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:25,324
I looked at Rosemary
and just felt so...

178
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,226
...confused.

179
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:28,725
She's a girl.

180
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:32,332
I'm supposed to despise girls,
not feel nervous talking to one.

181
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:33,727
Not be all tongue-tied.

182
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:38,600
I mean, this was Rosemary Telesco.
I knew her since kindergarten.

183
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,538
Just a little rock.
I mean, it's... It'll be fine.

184
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:45,735
Just gonna grab my scooter.
I'm really cool, honestly.

185
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:55,918
As she took me to practice karate
at her place, one thing became clear.

186
00:12:56,356 --> 00:13:01,419
Rosemary went to P.S. 87 because
her parents believed in public education.

187
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,859
See, believing in public education...

188
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:07,228
...wasn't really a luxury
my family could afford.

189
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,363
Don't go to Taos. Not without me.

190
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,903
Mr. And Mrs. Telesco, her parents...

191
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:17,476
...they, like, started this soap opera,
Santa Fe, that's on, like, every day...

192
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,236
...so you know they had a few bucks.

193
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:21,540
Oh, look at that. You see that?

194
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:25,344
I knew your folks were gonna
keep them together. Didn't I say it?

195
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,646
- Let's go practice in my bedroom.
- Okay.

196
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,289
- Will you have me, Kate?
- What do you think I'll say?

197
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,915
Come on. He is no good for you.
Get back in the truck.

198
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,589
If karate is all about focus...

199
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:41,330
- Good one.
...my focus was all over that pink room.

200
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:47,099
I mean, there I was,
in the inner sanctum, alone with her.

201
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,936
Smelling her smell.

202
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,840
What is that? Strawberry?

203
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:57,272
- So, what made you take karate?
- Made me?

204
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,043
Daryl Kitzens.

205
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:02,382
- Daryl Kitzens made you take karate?
- Yeah, have you seen the guy?

206
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:03,784
He's insane.

207
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:08,321
Daryl Kitzens is without a doubt
the scariest kid in the Upper West Side.

208
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,759
He's a fifth grader
but he's supposed to be in seventh.

209
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,756
He is a giant.

210
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,368
Held back two grades
out of his first five.

211
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,631
At the rate he's going,
he'll graduate from high school at age 27...

212
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,298
...and will have terrorized
an entire generation of Upper West Siders.

213
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,709
Are you afraid he's gonna beat you up?

214
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:29,844
No. No, no. Of course not.

215
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:34,317
I just, you know, wanna be ready
when that day comes, you know.

216
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:36,615
Who was I kidding? I was petrified.

217
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:38,585
Kitzens hangs out a lot...

218
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,320
...in front of the subway station
on 72nd and Broadway.

219
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:46,330
I haven't walked past that corner
since October.

220
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,697
- Well, we should practice more.
- Yeah, sure, let's go.

221
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,805
We need to start working
on those maneuvers he taught us.

222
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:56,670
Well, I kind of meant some other time.
It's getting kind of late.

223
00:14:56,843 --> 00:15:01,143
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
It's getting kind of late anyway, so...

224
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,646
Yeah.

225
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,074
How could I have said that?

226
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:08,517
Okay, just shake it off. Keep it together.

227
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:12,052
- Are you okay?
- That's the... The door.

228
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:20,866
Look at her, living this perfect life up here,
with a view of the park and everything.

229
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,865
Yet she's so humble.

230
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:27,332
Suddenly, Rosemary's whole world
seemed very attractive to me.

231
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,441
Her parents, with all their success...

232
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,044
...the nanny who's been with her
since she was born...

233
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:35,841
...and the adopted 3-year-old sister
rescued from an orphanage in Beijing.

234
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:40,282
And me, my family's on a one-way ticket
to The Jerry Springer Show.

235
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,050
- Hi.
- Hey.

236
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,748
- Is Leslie around?
- Yeah.

237
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:49,127
Les, your date's here.

238
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:53,058
She's coming. I'm her...

239
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,095
...husband.

240
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,901
Only 20 more minutes of video,
okay, hon? Bedtime soon.

241
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,269
- All right.
- Good night.

242
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,141
- Adam, Ronny. Ronny, Adam.
- Yeah, yeah.

243
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,112
- You guys met? Okay, good.
- Yeah, we met.

244
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,875
Shall we?

245
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:13,781
See, this divorce thing...

246
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:15,421
- You guys have fun.
- Thank you.

247
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,750
...it's a very difficult situation
for everyone.

248
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,585
This isn't anybody's fault, you know.

249
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,387
It's not anybody's fault.

250
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:26,965
It's just that your father and I
are a lot more different than we thought.

251
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:29,534
They're just very different people.

252
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:34,606
Even though I was just 9 and a half,
I totally took it like a man.

253
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:38,444
Now, I'm not saying
I'm some latchkey kid.

254
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:42,548
I mean, I don't wanna make it seem like
my parents are irresponsible either.

255
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,617
But for a year now,
I've been able to roam the city.

256
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:52,390
Well, okay, not really the city.
Nine square blocks.

257
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,721
The planetarium to the north,
Riverside Park to the west...

258
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:02,267
...Central Park to the east.
And 72nd street to the south.

259
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,540
In those blocks, I own this town.

260
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,453
Rosemary lived on 81st Street,
near the park.

261
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:25,853
A few yards north
of my territory.

262
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:30,195
When I started, you know,
casually riding past her building...

263
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,558
...I was heading into
some uncharted waters.

264
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:41,636
It was summer break.
Our next karate class wasn't for three days.

265
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:45,469
Do you know how many Telescos there are
in the Manhattan phone book?

266
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,169
Two.

267
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:51,674
- Telescos'.
- One's a butcher shop down in the Village.

268
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:56,050
Rosemary? No, there's no Rosemary here.

269
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,189
- And trust me...
- This is Frank.

270
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,327
...the other was not her either.

271
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,658
Hi, is Rosemary there?

272
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:07,356
You the kid that called
a half an hour ago?

273
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:13,638
What was I to do?
Except loiter and hope?

274
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,913
Her doorman's looking at me.

275
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,416
Oh, my God, there she is.

276
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:31,986
I didn't have a contingency plan
for if I actually saw her.

277
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:37,156
Just go up to her. Go, go.
Say hi to her.

278
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:41,762
She looked so busy.
I'll talk to her another day.

279
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:44,233
Coward. You fool.
How could you be so weak?

280
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,773
I'm not weak. I'm only human.

281
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,909
What was I gonna say? "I was
in the neighborhood"? That's pathetic.

282
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,737
No, you're weak and you're pathetic.

283
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:53,937
And you're gonna be alone
your entire life.

284
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:57,550
Who cares? I'd rather be alone
than endure this misery and torment.

285
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:03,920
- Watch it, child.
- Gabe?

286
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:08,119
Oh, hi. How's it going?

287
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:11,093
I'm just, you know,
in the neighborhood.

288
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:16,327
- Don't you live in the neighborhood?
- Well, 73rd and West End.

289
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:20,405
I guess it sort of depends on
how the neighborhood is defined.

290
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,567
Could I sound like any more of a loser?

291
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,905
So, what are you guys up to?

292
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,605
Well, my sister's got a birthday party
in the park.

293
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:31,978
I'm just bringing my book.

294
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:35,246
- Wanna come?
- Come?

295
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:39,152
Sure.

296
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,529
Stop it.

297
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,158
- Sorry you came?
- Not yet.

298
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,195
- Bubble.
- Bubbles, yeah.

299
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:57,400
Look. Look, there's my point.
Those two kids are the same age.

300
00:19:57,577 --> 00:20:00,740
She's, like, talking,
using her hands, telling stories...

301
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,882
...and he's drooling over a cupcake.

302
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,144
- They're not the same age.
- How much you wanna bet?

303
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,378
A buck says
he's six months younger than her.

304
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:11,786
- Buy me an ice cream?
- No, you're buying me one.

305
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,025
Excuse me.

306
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,492
- Is that your son?
- Yeah.

307
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:20,531
- How old is he?
- He's two and a half.

308
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,191
And that little girl,
do you know how old she is?

309
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:25,002
She's three months younger.

310
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,170
That proves nothing.

311
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,908
Man, look at her.

312
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:35,070
Have you ever seen anyone
more beautiful?

313
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:38,775
So smart too. She's just my type.

314
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:42,519
Wow, I didn't even know I had a type.

315
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:46,751
Now, if I could only shake the nanny,
we'd be in business.

316
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:51,330
- So should we get that ice cream now?
- Now?

317
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:54,092
Well, I mean, sure, if you want one.

318
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:57,828
- Birdie, could we go get an ice cream?
- Yeah, hurry back, now.

319
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:02,771
Oh, no, thanks.
Unfortunately, this one's on me.

320
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:11,275
My first date. The big spender.
Haagen-Dazs all the way, baby.

321
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,855
So how come I have
nothing to say to her?

322
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,854
And why isn't she looking at me?

323
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:22,324
Am I that hideous? Do I smell?

324
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:26,932
- You come here often?
- Central Park?

325
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,102
- Yeah.
- What kind of question is that?

326
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,794
I hate myself.

327
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:35,070
I live across the street, you know. You?

328
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:37,539
- Me?
- Are you more Riverside?

329
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,736
Yeah, I'm more of a Riverside guy.

330
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,780
That's really the park.
But Central Park's pretty cool.

331
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,541
I've done my time here.

332
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:47,209
Hey, Strawberry Fields.
You know what it's named for?

333
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:49,753
- Some Beatles song, right?
- Close.

334
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:52,357
It's actually the name
of the orphanage in Liverpool...

335
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,686
...where John Lennon
used to play with his friends.

336
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:56,089
- Really?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,627
I didn't know that. Neat.

338
00:21:57,797 --> 00:22:01,597
I took Rosemary on a tour of the park
that would make your head spin.

339
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,236
This was my Central Park, my New York.

340
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:08,898
Yeah, they used to have herds and hundreds
and hundreds of sheep grazing these fields.

341
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:12,704
And then they gave the sheepherder
a job on the zoo at the lion house.

342
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,747
Oh, yeah, didn't the sheepherder
live up in Tavern on the Green?

343
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,885
It was a sheepfold back then,
but yeah.

344
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:33,329
See those buildings up there?

345
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,967
When I was younger, I'd pretend
they were pirate ships, and I'd fight them.

346
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:42,234
- I never took you for a pirate guy.
- Well, I outgrew that eventually.

347
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,737
That's where my aunt's
getting married next week.

348
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,644
Oh, the Boathouse. Of course.

349
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:27,419
- Flower girl.
- Oh, I'm so looking forward to that.

350
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:30,823
My aunt asked me to be her flower girl
when I was 4.

351
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,548
But little did any of us know...

352
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,853
...it would take seven years
for her boyfriend to pop the question.

353
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:37,796
That's hilarious.

354
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:39,522
I was charming and suave.

355
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,167
Everything you could hope to be
on your first real date.

356
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,065
- Maybe we should practice more karate.
- You need it.

357
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:48,696
- I am this close to becoming a yellow belt.
- Try this close.

358
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,106
- What's tomorrow like for you?
- Saturday...

359
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:54,437
I've got cello in the morning.

360
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:56,582
And then the afternoon, I've got tap.

361
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,910
Tap? What time does tap end?

362
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:03,112
I'm sorry, after tap I've got this
Indian princess thing I do with my father.

363
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:06,019
Jeez, it was easier scheduling
Arab-Israeli peace talks...

364
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,853
...than making a date with this girl.

365
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:10,962
- What's Indian princess?
- It's this Daddy-and-me thing.

366
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:12,359
Don't ask.

367
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,763
I just do it so he won't feel guilty
working late all week.

368
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:17,835
- How about Sunday?
- Sunday's good.

369
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:20,438
- Morning?
- In the morning I have a tutor.

370
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,131
But how about the afternoon?

371
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:27,245
- Tutor? What kind of tutor?
- It's for the ERBs.

372
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:31,941
My parents want me to go
to Ethical Culture next year, or Trinity.

373
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:35,246
Private school? Really?

374
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:38,624
I probably won't get in anywhere.

375
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:40,484
Maybe I'll throw the test.

376
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:44,861
What exactly did that mean?
Was that some kind of sign?

377
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:49,092
She'd throw her test for me?
Does she "like" like me?

378
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,965
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
Where were you, girl?

379
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:54,800
- I'm sorry. We were...
- "Sorry" ain't good enough.

380
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,965
You're 11 years old.
This is New York City.

381
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:59,634
You can't go off running
by yourself like that.

382
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:02,007
You want Birdie
telling your parents on you, huh?

383
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:04,180
Now, you two say your goodbyes now.

384
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,418
- Sunday afternoon?
- Sounds good.

385
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:11,079
- Maybe I should come to your place?
- My place?

386
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:13,987
See, ever since
my dad moved onto the couch...

387
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,424
...I've been uninterested
in having friends over.

388
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:19,095
- Perfect.
- See you then.

389
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:21,665
Come on, let's go. Here.

390
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:24,028
Running off like that.
You know better than that.

391
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,366
Never had I felt so alive.

392
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:32,841
I had a date with Rosemary.

393
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:47,754
Was there any better age to be
in any better city in the world?

394
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:50,229
Sunday couldn't come fast enough.

395
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,421
What was today?

396
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,329
Only Friday? Oh, the eternity.

397
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:57,128
Hey, watch where you're going!

398
00:25:57,303 --> 00:26:00,295
- Get off the sidewalk, you maniac.
- Sorry!

399
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:07,309
- Hey, how goes it, Mr. Gabe?
- Pretty fine, Ralph.

400
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,607
How's it coming along
with that place-kicking?

401
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,046
Place-kicking?
I'm more into karate these days.

402
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:13,446
- Karate?
- Yeah.

403
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,747
You gotta watch the show
Xtreme Martial Arts...

404
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,015
...with this guy Mike Chaturantabut.

405
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:19,419
- Mike?
- Mike Chat.

406
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:20,889
- Mike Chat. All right.
- Yeah.

407
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,528
- Cool, I'll check it out.
- Hold the door, please.

408
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,460
Oh, sure, no problem, Lina.
That's what I'm here for, right?

409
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:28,897
Thank you so much, Ralph.

410
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:48,116
- Thank you.
- Sure.

411
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:52,854
New au pair in 3G.
She's from Stockholm.

412
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:54,721
Got you.

413
00:26:57,263 --> 00:27:01,199
Mike Chat knows that showmanship is huge
in the martial-arts tournaments.

414
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:05,266
In fact, Mike's the Tony Hawk
of martial arts.

415
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:09,302
The guy who changed the game.
And he's Matt's teacher.

416
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:15,942
Mike pioneered XMA,
Xtreme Martial Arts.

417
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,043
He's rooted in the fundamentals...

418
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:26,155
- Hey, Mom?
- Hey.

419
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:31,025
- I was thinking I kind of need a haircut.
- A haircut?

420
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:34,325
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll do it in the morning.

421
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,435
See, this was a sensitive subject
around our house...

422
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:38,831
...because up until now...

423
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:41,803
...my mom's actually given me
every haircut I've ever had.

424
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:44,636
Not to say she hasn't learned
a thing or two over the years.

425
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:47,143
But lately it's been occurring to me...

426
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:51,306
...that she's not exactly
what we might call a professional.

427
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:57,581
Actually, I was, you know, kind of thinking
maybe we could go out for one.

428
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:01,853
- Out?
- Yeah, you know, like, to a barbershop.

429
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:06,196
- You mean, pay for it?
- Well, not an expensive one.

430
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:08,865
Don't be ridiculous, honey.
I can cut your hair.

431
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:17,141
Hey, Dad, I really think it's time
that Mom stops cutting my hair.

432
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,868
Don't you?

433
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:23,005
The thing about Giambi,
I don't trust that damn guy.

434
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:25,548
I don't trust him going to that bag.

435
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:28,482
He's got bat, no doubt about that.

436
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:30,986
What do you think
we ought to do with this guy?

437
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,489
Could you take it higher
over the ears, please?

438
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,183
- No problem.
- Thanks.

439
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:38,887
Best $12 I ever spent.

440
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:41,295
Look at me. I was hot.

441
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,166
- Our ball.
- What the heck?

442
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:48,933
- Hey, man, it's a legitimate foul.
- Dude, you just totally hacked me.

443
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:50,473
No.

444
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,668
Look, I don't need you losers.

445
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,245
Okay, maybe I was a little excitable...

446
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:59,181
...but I didn't wanna get bruised up
before my big karate practice.

447
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,717
Hey, Rosemary. Hey there, pretty lady.

448
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,554
How's it going, girl?
Hey, Rosemary Telesco.

449
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:11,696
I got it.

450
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:18,599
Mr. Gabe, I got a Rosemary
down here for you.

451
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:21,103
Send her up, Ralph.

452
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,901
- I loathe myself for feeling like I did.
- Hey.

453
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,138
I mean, this is crazy.
She's a girl, for God's sake.

454
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:32,546
It's not like she's a New York Knick
or something.

455
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:38,015
- Hey.
- Hey.

456
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,624
My mom dropped me off.

457
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:43,159
She's gonna pick me up at 5:15
if that's okay.

458
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,796
Yeah, sure, whenever is fine.

459
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:52,065
All right, let's go.

460
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:54,206
So do you remember the old place?

461
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:57,570
- Yeah, it's been a long time.
- Yeah, it has.

462
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:10,645
Mom, this is Rosemary Telesco.
You remember her, don't you?

463
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:16,789
From kindergarten, of course.
I haven't seen you in forever.

464
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:19,792
Look at you, Rosie. You're all grown up.

465
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:22,730
- Hi, Mrs. Burton.
- We're practicing karate.

466
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,363
Excuse me.

467
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:32,174
- Yes.
- Ronny's here. Should I bring him up?

468
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:35,370
Oh, okay.

469
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,916
I didn't know you were having a play date
or I wouldn't have made plans.

470
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:46,820
- Should I stay?
- It's not a play date, Mom. It's practice.

471
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:51,193
- Do you need snacks?
- No, we're fine. Don't worry about us.

472
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:53,491
Okay.

473
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,830
- Who's Ronny?
- My mom has got a date.

474
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:02,267
Hey. Hey, big guy.

475
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:06,440
Ronny, this is Gabe's friend,
Rosemary Telesco.

476
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,080
- Nice to meet you, Rosemary Telesco.
- You too.

477
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:11,816
You want me to hold this for you?

478
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:16,045
Oh, thank you. I'll just get my coat.

479
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:22,920
Is there anything more excruciating than
you and your date and your mom's date...

480
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:25,689
...all hanging out
with absolutely nothing to say?

481
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:30,002
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Okay, kiddo?

482
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,002
Okay, that's more excruciating.

483
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,802
I'll be back in time for dinner.

484
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,946
- Okay.
- Okay.

485
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:43,775
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:54,720
- I didn't know your parents were divorced.
- Well, they're not officially.

487
00:31:54,894 --> 00:31:57,863
See, it's kind of this long-term project
they've been working on...

488
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,622
...for, like, a year and a half now.

489
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,394
And my mom's decided that
she's finally gotta move on with her life.

490
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,868
- That sucks.
- Well, it is what it is, you know.

491
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,132
Hey, you wanna see something funny?

492
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:13,768
A few weeks earlier, my mother had left
her Match.com file open on her desktop.

493
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:18,144
See, this is a list of all the 45-year-old men
in New York who are looking for wives.

494
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:21,286
Most of them are looking
for their second or even third.

495
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:23,479
These are the ones my mom picked out.

496
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:25,783
They all look like the same guy to me.

497
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:30,093
- Yeah, she's kind of got a type.
- Oh, my God, there's Ronny.

498
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:34,657
"I'm a real live wire who tends
to take everything in life up a notch.

499
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:38,031
I like being quiet and contemplative,
but rowdy and spontaneous."

500
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:40,672
Enough of my mother
and her romantic dead ends.

501
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,777
Today was about me and Rosemary.
She was in my house, all alone.

502
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:48,539
It was time for us to fight.

503
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:10,066
Sparring that day, I was channeling
none other than the great one himself...

504
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:14,900
...my master, my inspiration,
Mr. Mike Chat.

505
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:23,577
It's a dance, Gabriel.
You lead her, not she lead you.

506
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,877
Kiss her. Kiss her.

507
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:02,043
I can't, that's disgusting.

508
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:05,184
Trust me, not disgusting.

509
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:12,688
How could you let her do that?

510
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:15,891
Girls mature faster than boys.

511
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:19,162
Baloney! Don't let her brainwash
you with that.

512
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:20,999
Boys stronger.

513
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:24,240
I had absolutely no idea
what she was thinking.

514
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,640
She was this total mystery to me.

515
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,542
Did I want to kiss Rosemary Telesco?

516
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:32,081
Yes, I guess I did.

517
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:34,719
I wanted to.
More than anything on earth.

518
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:38,019
Do you...

519
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:43,327
...want some Gatorade?

520
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:48,667
Who was I kidding, anyway?
Was I really gonna kiss her?

521
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,999
I mean, come on, she's 11, I'm 10.

522
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:55,163
Well, 10 and three-quarters, actually.
She's May, I'm September.

523
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,275
What do all the different names mean?

524
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,310
Oh, it's my mom's stuff
and my dad's stuff.

525
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,472
- Isn't that hard?
- Oh, no, not really.

526
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:05,446
I mean, I can choose
from either of them.

527
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,848
No, I mean, having them
still living together?

528
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,612
I might be falling in love
with the woman.

529
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:11,950
Doesn't mean I'm in the mood
for soul-searching.

530
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:15,218
Don't you think it's gonna be
so much better once it's all over?

531
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:16,622
What do you mean?

532
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,561
I don't know.
Like, getting your life started again.

533
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,232
I guess so, yeah.

534
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:25,563
Well, who do you think's
gonna move out?

535
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,939
I don't know. My dad, I guess.

536
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:33,010
- Has he looked at any places yet?
- I don't think so.

537
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,444
Hey, maybe we should look for him.

538
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,342
Turns out Rosemary's parents, their
favorite hobby was looking at apartments.

539
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,078
They never actually buy anything...

540
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,655
...but every Sunday for
as long as she can remember...

541
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:48,760
...they dragged her to open houses.
She knew what everything meant.

542
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:52,227
- "WBF"?
- Wood-burning fireplace. That's good.

543
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:55,231
- How much?
- Way too expensive, that's how much.

544
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:57,096
Yeah.

545
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,472
Estate condition is scary.
It means it has to be gutted.

546
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:04,108
- This is nice.
- What?

547
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:08,110
Romantic treetop view,
attic loft, hardwood floors.

548
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,612
It's a little downtown,
but there's two bedrooms...

549
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,614
...so you can stay over
whenever you want.

550
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:14,650
- Should we call?
- Call?

551
00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:20,353
- Hello, Isaac Properties.
- Yes, Isaac?

552
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:24,121
We wanted to arrange to see
the "romantic treetop view."

553
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:27,866
Something right in the range
of your place.

554
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,593
- Yes.
- Maybe it is true.

555
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:34,671
Maybe girls do mature faster than boys.
Could I talk like that?

556
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,869
How's tomorrow afternoon for you?

557
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:40,907
Tomorrow, for me? Let's see...

558
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:45,409
- It's good.
- Yes, that'd be perfect.

559
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:48,348
Three o'clock? See you there.

560
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,147
Three o'clock tomorrow.

561
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:52,079
All right.

562
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,318
Quick.

563
00:36:57,363 --> 00:37:00,423
Here. Here, hurry. Hurry!

564
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,027
G-man, you back here?

565
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:05,329
I got some new kicking tees.
They're titanium.

566
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:11,274
- How's it going?
- Good.

567
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,809
Dad, you remember
Rosemary Telesco, right?

568
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,346
From kindergarten.

569
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:21,008
- Sure.
- Hey.

570
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,653
Hi.

571
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:25,113
Long time, no see.

572
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:28,259
She's in my karate class, Dad.

573
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:30,661
Cool.

574
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:35,923
But she wasn't just
in my karate class anymore.

575
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:39,266
Oh, no. She was in my life.

576
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:42,635
We were going out to look for
an apartment for my father tomorrow.

577
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:45,834
These are things
boyfriends and girlfriends do.

578
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:49,503
What other things do
boyfriends and girlfriends do?

579
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:54,477
Someone need a ride?

580
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,051
So I'll see you tomorrow, 2:30.

581
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,048
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

582
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:07,027
Are there any more beautiful words
in the English dictionary...

583
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,497
...than "see you tomorrow"?

584
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,466
Oh, the plan was perfect.

585
00:38:11,904 --> 00:38:14,998
She would tell her friend Libby
to say Rosemary was over at her house.

586
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:16,939
Just from, like, 2:30
to around dinnertime.

587
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:19,737
See, Libby had a grandmother
who took care of her...

588
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:23,143
...and who was literally deaf
and would never hear the phone if it rang.

589
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:24,509
So her story was solid.

590
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,776
Let's try Anagrammed Birds for 200.

591
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:29,512
I would tell my friend
Max Kovinsky to cover for me.

592
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:31,656
The only possible flaw in my plan...

593
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:35,726
...was that I didn't actually
have the guts to tell Max...

594
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:37,623
...that I was hanging out with a girl.

595
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:42,028
So, you know, I, like,
never actually had the conversation.

596
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,965
Luckily, I knew Max was going
to Six Flags for the entire day.

597
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:46,564
I got this.

598
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:51,176
So I knew he wasn't gonna accidentally
call looking for me or anything.

599
00:38:57,182 --> 00:39:00,913
You ride the subway
a lot without any grownups?

600
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:03,953
Actually, no.

601
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,715
I...

602
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,553
I do it all the time, you know.
It's much more fun this way.

603
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:12,390
I didn't have the heart to tell her
I'd never been south of West 72nd.

604
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,191
I felt she needed my leadership.

605
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:21,700
Greenwich Village might
as well have been 1000 miles away.

606
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:27,138
I think we might've gotten off
a stop or two early.

607
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,574
Do you..? Do you want to ride?

608
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:35,879
- Do you think we can both fit?
- We can try.

609
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:38,949
Come on. Get on.

610
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,532
With that girl's arms around me,
there was nothing I couldn't do.

611
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,232
I think it's this way.

612
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:04,280
With the possible exception of finding
that apartment we were looking for.

613
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,758
Deja vu.

614
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:18,093
Maybe we should ask for directions.

615
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,522
No, I think it's just right up
this alley right here.

616
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:25,060
You are so like all the guys in my family.

617
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:36,441
- That your girlfriend?
- Excuse me?

618
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:37,912
Is she your girl?

619
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:41,743
Yeah, my girlfriend.

620
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:46,184
I had a girlfriend once upon a time too.

621
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:48,189
She trampled my heart.

622
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,952
Left me bleeding on the floor.

623
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:52,723
- Run.
- What?

624
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:55,628
Run while you still can, brother.

625
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,291
Take my advice.

626
00:40:57,469 --> 00:41:00,063
Make like the wind.

627
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,374
You were close. One block, a left,
and then another left.

628
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:07,171
Let's go.

629
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,724
Are you Isaac?

630
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:25,628
I'm Rosemary.
We're here to see the apartment.

631
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:29,563
- Am I getting Punk'd?
- No, it's for my dad.

632
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,600
And will Daddy be meeting us here?

633
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,171
- He will if I give him the high sign.
- Trying to make a commission or not?

634
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:42,608
We do a nice business
in two-bedrooms with divorced fathers.

635
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:46,979
This place will be gone
in a New York minute, I promise you.

636
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:49,718
Wood-burning fireplace.

637
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:53,448
Yeah, I noticed.

638
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:57,254
I didn't know what
we were looking for exactly.

639
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:59,192
What do you think?

640
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:00,592
I like it.

641
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:03,064
It's nice, amazing.

642
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:04,702
But I knew one thing for certain.

643
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,098
Yeah.

644
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:09,968
It was the most romantic
treetop view I ever saw.

645
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:18,305
We came home up the bike path
along the Hudson. Sixty-seven blocks.

646
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:22,886
The most physically grueling experience
in my short life on this planet.

647
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:25,251
But I barely felt it.

648
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:29,087
I never felt so ridiculously wonderful.

649
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:34,060
This was New York
the way I always want to remember it.

650
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:38,363
A place where anything is possible.
The city of dreams.

651
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,371
- What's this?
- Oh, this?

652
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,234
You don't know about this?

653
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:18,740
It's the smallest park in New York City.

654
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,970
Some commissioner died
and left his whole townhouse...

655
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:24,342
...to be knocked down for a park.

656
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:27,108
How come I didn't know about this?

657
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:29,880
Nobody on your side of Broadway
ever comes over this way.

658
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:32,387
That's what's so cool
about West End.

659
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:47,738
- Do you come here a lot?
- Actually, I...

660
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,036
I haven't been here in quite a while.

661
00:44:00,052 --> 00:44:01,417
Hey, Mini Me.

662
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,378
What are you doing in my park?

663
00:44:04,556 --> 00:44:07,423
Oh, no way.
Not Daryl Kitzens. Not now.

664
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:09,184
It's a public park.

665
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,693
What's she doing? Inciting him?

666
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:14,889
Didn't she know that
wild animals need to be placated?

667
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:18,666
I think this park's
big enough for all of us, right?

668
00:44:18,837 --> 00:44:20,464
Who were we kidding?

669
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,573
A white belt and a yellow belt...

670
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:26,302
...facing off against
the Darth Maul of P.S. 87.

671
00:44:26,478 --> 00:44:28,070
We were gonna get creamed.

672
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:36,447
You picked the wrong park, little man.

673
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:39,350
Get the hell out my park.

674
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,853
You're dead!

675
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:56,907
Come on. Run, run, hurry.

676
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:02,945
Hop on. Go, go, go.

678
00:45:07,335 --> 00:45:09,166
He's coming, he's coming!

679
00:45:12,106 --> 00:45:13,596
Go faster, he's coming!

680
00:45:16,777 --> 00:45:19,507
- Make the light.
- Hold on.

681
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:40,799
We were both still flushed
from our day of adventure.

682
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:43,937
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

683
00:45:44,705 --> 00:45:46,696
I could do battle with Daryl Kitzens...

684
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,104
...so why can't I just lean in to her?

685
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:51,535
Do it. Do it, you wimp. Do it!

686
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:55,215
That was fun.

687
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,217
Yeah, it was.

688
00:45:57,552 --> 00:46:00,112
Scared he's gonna hunt us down?

689
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:03,257
I just have to keep a low profile
for the rest of the summer.

690
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:07,258
And, of course, transfer
to a military school in the fall.

691
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:11,221
I just have to keep a low profile
for one more week.

692
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,027
A week?

693
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,294
Well, next Sunday, after the wedding,
I'm going to camp.

694
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:18,570
Camp?

695
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,172
For how long?

696
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:23,674
- For six weeks.
- Six weeks?

697
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:26,005
She might as well have said she's dying.

698
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:30,180
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

699
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:51,599
- I better get inside.
- Yeah.

700
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:55,365
- Good night.
- Good night.

701
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,364
What if she goes to camp
and I never get to kiss her?

702
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:20,796
That's the way it's gonna be.
It's so obvious.

703
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,493
Every opportunity I have
will go the same way:

704
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,070
"Good night."
"Good night."

705
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:27,298
No, I will not let that happen.

706
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:29,807
I will kiss her before
she gets on that bus to Maine.

707
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:31,844
I will, I will, I will!

708
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:44,418
Gabe?

709
00:47:45,026 --> 00:47:48,689
That's him, there he is. Oh, thank God.
If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.

710
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:53,095
So it turns out Max Kovinsky
didn't go to Six Flags after all.

711
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,495
He got sick.

712
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:57,832
My mother actually ended up
running into his mother at the Fairway...

713
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:00,371
...and, well, they got to talking.

714
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:01,974
What?

715
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:06,008
Gabe, come here. Come here.

716
00:48:07,114 --> 00:48:11,380
Don't you ever go anywhere again
without us knowing where you are.

717
00:48:11,552 --> 00:48:14,487
Do you hear me?
You had us scared half to death.

718
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:18,182
My punishment?
No phone, no TV...

719
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,021
...no leaving the apartment for 48 hours.

720
00:48:21,195 --> 00:48:23,823
It was the first thing my parents
agreed on in a long time.

721
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:25,989
- Please.
- Do I have to call Rosemary's mother?

722
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:27,361
No, don't call anyone.

723
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:30,470
I thought we had an understanding
on the nine square blocks.

724
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:32,765
- We do.
- That's the only way that this can work.

725
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,135
I had to throw myself
on the mercy of the court...

726
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:37,675
...to get special permission
to go to karate class.

727
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:40,609
I'll do anything. I'll wash dishes
for the rest of the summer.

728
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:41,770
I promise I will.

729
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:45,852
It just wasn't an option to miss that class.

730
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,054
You scared the hell out of us today.

731
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:52,249
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, what does sorry mean?

732
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:54,155
Sorry means I'm not gonna do it again.

733
00:48:54,328 --> 00:48:55,727
- Right, never again.
- Right.

734
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:57,830
- Right?
- Right.

735
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:01,229
- Dad?
- Yeah?

736
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:02,992
Are?

737
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,728
Are you gonna move out?

738
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:11,509
Eventually, yeah, I am, Gabe.

739
00:49:12,213 --> 00:49:14,545
Well, I...

740
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:17,548
- I found an apartment for you.
- You what?

741
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:21,786
That's where I went today.
To look for an apartment for you.

742
00:49:22,623 --> 00:49:25,319
- Do you want me to move out?
- No, no, of course not.

743
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:31,796
But, you know, maybe we can't get
our lives started again until you do.

744
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,796
Where do you get such big ideas?

745
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,299
- I don't know. I just get them.
- So where is this apartment?

746
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:43,102
It's a two-bedroom on Grove Street.

747
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:44,505
In the Village?

748
00:49:44,678 --> 00:49:47,272
- Yeah, wood-burning fireplace.
- No way.

749
00:49:47,448 --> 00:49:50,611
- Why not?
- It's too far from you, champ.

750
00:49:50,785 --> 00:49:54,084
I wouldn't move more than...

751
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:57,224
...a three- or four-block radius from you.

752
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:00,353
You're gonna have to go college
to get farther away from me.

753
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:03,854
- Okay?
- Okay.

754
00:50:04,198 --> 00:50:06,564
- Go to sleep.
- All right.

755
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:11,063
So, what's the deal with this Rosemary?

756
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:12,933
Rosemary?

757
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:14,938
How do you mean?

758
00:50:17,443 --> 00:50:21,243
Nothing, I'm just not used to...

759
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:23,314
We do karate together, Dad.

760
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:25,212
She's my sparring partner.

761
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:31,581
- Okay, great.
- I didn't even pick her.

762
00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:34,383
Whatever you say, kid.

763
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:40,323
That night, I had this dream.

764
00:50:48,374 --> 00:50:50,001
All right, yeah!

765
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,642
- I'm open, man!
- Gabe.

766
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,812
I'm open, Gabe.

767
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,954
Over here.

768
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:04,918
I'm open here. I'm open, man.
Where are you?

769
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:06,319
Gabe.

770
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:09,154
Gabe. Gabe.

771
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,860
Where you going?
You're ditching us for her?

772
00:51:23,743 --> 00:51:25,005
Come on!

773
00:51:25,178 --> 00:51:27,043
Disgusting.

774
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:36,048
The next day, I couldn't
get to class fast enough.

775
00:51:36,222 --> 00:51:38,190
I was gonna be near her again.

776
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:40,724
Grapple with her, smell her hair.

777
00:51:42,428 --> 00:51:46,023
That day, the gates of hell opened,
and Tim Staples walked right through.

778
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,829
So we're gonna shift sparring partners
to make sure everyone's with their level.

779
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:54,064
That means, Tim, you'll be with Rosemary.

780
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,502
Could this be?

781
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,576
My woman getting ripped
from my hands like this.

782
00:51:58,745 --> 00:52:00,337
I could see where all this leads.

783
00:52:00,513 --> 00:52:04,176
Do you, Rosemary Telesco,
take Tim Staples...

784
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,215
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

785
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:10,482
No! Rosemary!

786
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:15,458
And, Gabe, your new sparring partner
will be David Betanahu.

787
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:18,688
This is my level? David Betanahu?

788
00:52:18,865 --> 00:52:20,526
How could this happen?

789
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,565
She's with Ashton Kutcher over there...

790
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:25,499
...and I'm with the sweatiest

791
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:28,505
The kid's practically had
a mustache since nursery school.

792
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:37,808
Everything I took for granted,
stolen in a New York minute.

793
00:52:39,085 --> 00:52:43,419
Somehow, karate wasn't quite
the same without Rosemary.

794
00:52:45,425 --> 00:52:48,553
So how was that class for you?

795
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:50,286
Was it a good one?

796
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,621
I'm having a little trouble
with this maete zuki maneuver.

797
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,529
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

798
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:58,068
I couldn't resist.
I needed more and more pain.

799
00:52:58,237 --> 00:53:01,400
So how's that Tim guy
at the maete zuki?

800
00:53:01,574 --> 00:53:03,599
He's a lot better than me.

801
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:06,301
But he wants us to practice together.

802
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:08,470
Oh, really?

803
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:13,210
Well, that's terrific.
You know, hey, when can we get together?

804
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:17,620
Well, I've got cello this afternoon,
so not today.

805
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,452
Cello?
But I thought cello was on Saturdays?

806
00:53:20,626 --> 00:53:21,991
Tuesday and Saturday.

807
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,254
She can't cancel a freaking cello lesson?

808
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,365
Doesn't she know our days are numbered
before that bus to camp?

809
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:30,900
- How about I'll call you?
- Sure, sounds great.

810
00:53:32,205 --> 00:53:36,335
So that's it?
Just a lousy "call you"?

811
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:38,409
Not even an "I'll call you."

812
00:53:38,578 --> 00:53:40,773
A "how about I'll call you?"

813
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:43,939
What on earth does that mean?
When?

814
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:49,148
You have no new messages.

815
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:54,588
What choice did I have
but to return to my old, miserable life?

816
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:57,389
Wait a minute, you were happy.

817
00:53:57,563 --> 00:53:59,394
Oh, please, I was miserable.

818
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:03,057
I just didn't know how miserable I was.

819
00:54:04,437 --> 00:54:06,098
Heads up!

820
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:08,104
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

821
00:54:10,576 --> 00:54:13,374
Where's your head today, G-man?

822
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:16,978
- My head?
- Yeah, it's not with the ball. What was that?

823
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:19,841
It's not my head, Dad.

824
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:23,887
- It's my leg. I hurt it in karate class.
- Karate.

825
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:26,991
See, guys like us,
we weren't built for kicking bricks.

826
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,062
Let's keep our priorities in line.
Eyes on the prize.

827
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,599
Head down.
Go, sweet spot, one, two...

828
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:38,760
He was right.
My priorities were all screwed up.

829
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:40,166
I was an athlete.

830
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:41,966
- I just had to shake it off.
- Yeah.

831
00:54:44,143 --> 00:54:47,078
Look at me. I can bounce back.

832
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,680
I don't need some girl in my life
for me to be happy.

833
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,957
Hello. Yeah.

834
00:55:01,694 --> 00:55:05,755
You know, I really hate it when people
call me at home and try to sell me stuff.

835
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,567
That's okay. Okay, bye.

836
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:21,311
Hello?

837
00:55:22,548 --> 00:55:24,015
Hi.

838
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,242
Yeah, he's right here.

839
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:27,818
Gabe?

840
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:30,613
It's a girl.

841
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,992
- I got it.
- Got it?

842
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,827
I got it!

843
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:46,933
- Hey.
- I said I was gonna call.

844
00:55:47,106 --> 00:55:49,836
Did you? I don't even remember.

845
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:52,910
Smooth under pressure, that's me.

846
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,480
If only I could do something
about the beating of my heart.

847
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:58,412
Could she hear that through the phone?

848
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:01,144
So, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

849
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:03,119
- Tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

850
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:06,554
It's summer, so it's not,
like, a school night or anything.

851
00:56:06,726 --> 00:56:08,318
I'm free, totally.

852
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:12,055
Because my parents got these special tickets
to this concert with this guy...

853
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:15,064
...who's supposed to be
the greatest singer in New York.

854
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:18,226
Do you wanna go?

855
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:21,264
Me and your parents?

856
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,839
And me too.

857
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:25,273
My mom said
I could invite anyone I want.

858
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:27,412
- Sounds awesome.
- Great.

859
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,674
She called.

860
00:56:29,148 --> 00:56:31,139
She said she was gonna,
and she kept her word.

861
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:33,481
This was not just some figment
of my imagination.

862
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:36,622
Our love is a two-way street.

863
00:56:43,129 --> 00:56:46,496
- You're looking sharp there, tiger.
- Like I even care.

864
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,327
Nice.

865
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:50,163
I especially like the hair.

866
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:56,004
Come on, mess it up.

867
00:56:57,276 --> 00:56:59,540
Don't take all your romantic advice
from him, Gabe.

868
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:02,237
You look very nice.

869
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:04,977
I'm gonna wait downstairs.

870
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:08,313
Do you want us to come
say hi to her parents?

871
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:09,886
No.

872
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:13,423
Excuse me. They said
they'd have you home by 11.

873
00:57:13,593 --> 00:57:16,858
And if you're gonna be one second later,
I'll need a call.

874
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:18,792
Okay.

875
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:24,530
- Our little boy is growing up, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

876
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:35,506
Pretty snazzy. Big night?

877
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:40,345
Just some date with some girl.
You know, nothing... Nothing big.

878
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:44,751
- That girl who came by here the other day?
- That would be the one.

879
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:48,584
She was a nice girl,
that girl who came by here.

880
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:51,195
All right, Mr. Gabe.

881
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:58,134
- Gabe. Nice to see you.
- Hey, you too.

882
00:57:58,304 --> 00:58:00,204
Thanks for joining us.

883
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:03,432
- Hi, Mrs. Telesco.
- Hello. How are you?

884
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,008
Good.

885
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:14,251
Welcome to The Carlyle.

886
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:18,522
Ma'am.

887
00:58:25,097 --> 00:58:27,429
Mickey took me here on our third date.

888
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,534
We had to stand right over there
by the bar...

889
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:31,465
...because we couldn't afford a table.

890
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:34,697
From that moment on,
there was no turning back for us.

891
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:40,412
You're gonna love this guy.
No one sings like Loston Harris.

892
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:42,376
This guy is New York.

893
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:58,359
I can't tell you
what that first song was about.

894
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:01,625
Something about love
and a boy and a girl.

895
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:05,464
And this boy can think of nothing but
holding that girl's hand in the darkness.

896
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:16,245
I'm not sure how I got the courage.

897
00:59:16,415 --> 00:59:18,781
Maybe it was the buzz
in the Shirley Temple.

898
00:59:18,951 --> 00:59:20,748
Maybe it was Loston Harris...

899
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,185
...the greatest singer
this little town has ever known.

900
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:27,484
But I knew our relationship
had to get to the next step...

901
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,654
...or Rosemary and I would
just remain karate friends forever.

902
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:53,317
Never had I been so keenly aware...

903
00:59:53,486 --> 00:59:57,013
...of the ability of my palm
to manufacture sweat.

904
00:59:57,556 --> 01:00:01,549
But I was determined to hold
that girl's hand for every single second.

905
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,157
What does this mean?
Does she hate me?

906
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:10,496
Is she grossed out by me?
Am I pushing everything way too fast?

907
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:24,115
All those ridiculous songs about love,
I finally understood.

908
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,188
Forget the second stop.
We're gonna walk from here too.

909
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:33,086
Thanks.

910
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,750
Thanks.

911
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:40,724
Well, you guys say
your good nights now...

912
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,360
...and Daddy and I are gonna get some milk
for breakfast tomorrow, okay? So...

913
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:47,672
Good night, Mrs. Telesco.

914
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,640
- Oh, thank you for coming, Gabe.
- Oh, thank you.

915
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:55,842
Your parents are cool.

916
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:58,506
Everyone says I'm gonna hate them
in a few years.

917
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:02,678
- Think you will?
- Probably.

918
01:01:02,855 --> 01:01:05,255
If people say so.

919
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:07,422
This is the time.

920
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:09,652
I know it. She knows it.

921
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:11,660
My God, even her parents know it.

922
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:13,059
Why can't I kiss her?

923
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:16,724
What's stopping me?
Is it cooties I fear?

924
01:01:17,536 --> 01:01:19,800
So, big wedding this weekend.

925
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:23,669
Yeah, right. I forgot about that.

926
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:26,534
I wish you could come.

927
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:29,510
It's gonna be really boring.

928
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:34,585
Yeah, I really want to see you
do your flower-girl thing.

929
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,751
Part of me is sure I'm gonna tr...

930
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:44,419
Did..? Did I do it right?

931
01:01:46,932 --> 01:01:50,800
I don't know.
I've absolutely nothing to compare it to.

932
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,403
My God, was I even close?

933
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:55,802
I... I should go.

934
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:57,906
Yeah.

935
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:03,380
- Good night.
- Good night.

936
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:14,885
Hey, how was your night, little Romeo?

937
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,223
It was good. It was great.

938
01:02:18,397 --> 01:02:21,093
Fine, I think.

939
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:24,131
But I had no idea.

940
01:02:24,303 --> 01:02:28,797
I kept playing the moment
over and over and over in my head.

941
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:33,602
Was it too fast? Too hard? Too gross?

942
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:35,770
Did she actually want me to kiss her?

943
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:38,212
I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.

944
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:40,548
Or did I scare her away?

945
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,916
I had it bad. This new feeling
deep in the pit of my stomach.

946
01:02:44,089 --> 01:02:45,989
This horrible lovesickness.

947
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:52,019
Maybe this is what cooties are.

948
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,897
By the next day, I was a wreck.

949
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,729
I purposely didn't call her.

950
01:02:56,902 --> 01:03:00,804
Okay, except for one hang-up.
Because I knew I would see her in karate.

951
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:04,765
I got to class 10 minutes early.

952
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:11,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

953
01:03:11,717 --> 01:03:15,209
Okay, I knew what
I was doing here early.

954
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:17,912
But what was he?

955
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,785
One thing was clear.

956
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:24,328
This business had to be settled
right here and right now.

957
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:26,259
Staples.

958
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:14,407
If only life was so simple.

959
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:19,711
Three-oh-nine. She's not even coming.

960
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:21,580
She doesn't even wanna see me.

961
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:24,780
She's blowing off class. She hates me.

962
01:04:24,957 --> 01:04:27,585
Your fist should be like a hammer.

963
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:31,785
She came. She's here. She loves me.

964
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:36,599
- Sorry I'm late.
- Miss Telesco, nice of you to join us.

965
01:04:40,773 --> 01:04:42,866
Wait a minute. What was that?

966
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:47,479
Was that a smile?
Or is she, like, mad at me?

967
01:04:47,646 --> 01:04:50,877
Why would she be mad at me?
I only kissed her.

968
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,146
Why the heck did I kiss her?
What was I possibly thinking?

969
01:04:58,657 --> 01:05:02,457
There are very few things more painful
than watching the woman you love...

970
01:05:02,628 --> 01:05:04,323
...grapple with another man.

971
01:05:04,496 --> 01:05:06,623
Actually, I take that back.

972
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:09,199
There are no things more painful.

973
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:12,360
The answer lies within you,
Gabriel, and you alone.

974
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:14,335
You must find your strength.

975
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:17,771
Your focus. Your determination.

976
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:25,477
Poor David Betanahu.
He was just an innocent victim in all this.

977
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:28,211
Collateral damage in this love affair.

978
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:32,448
One, two, three, four.

979
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:34,489
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

980
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,957
- High block.
- She loves me.

981
01:05:36,128 --> 01:05:39,097
- Middle punch.
- She loves me not.

982
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:40,959
- Side kick.
- She loves me.

983
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:44,767
Loves me not. She loves me.

984
01:05:44,937 --> 01:05:48,031
Not. Not. Loves. Not.

985
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:52,644
By 3:51, I had descended
fully into madness.

986
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:55,371
- Who wants to take their yellow-belt exam?
- Me!

987
01:05:57,249 --> 01:06:00,741
Ah, Gabe, the moment
of reckoning is upon us.

988
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:05,083
Okay, maybe I was a little overeager.
But it was my only way back to her.

989
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:09,185
Luckily, I had the great
master of masters in my corner.

990
01:06:10,629 --> 01:06:11,994
Very nice, very nice.

991
01:06:12,164 --> 01:06:14,564
- Let's see your maete zuki now.
- Gabriel, switch.

992
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:17,201
Hit, hit, sweep.

993
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:23,874
Very nice. Very nice.

994
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:25,600
You've come a long way.

995
01:06:25,978 --> 01:06:28,913
Excellent, Gabriel. Excellent.

996
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:32,679
Now, time for the break.

997
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:35,285
All that stood between me
and the woman I loved...

998
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:38,287
...was a half-inch piece of plywood.

999
01:06:39,224 --> 01:06:42,250
Be the board, Gabe. Be the board.

1000
01:06:44,563 --> 01:06:47,361
At that moment, I was the board.

1001
01:07:05,217 --> 01:07:10,052
The pain! The pain! Oh, my God!

1002
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:21,431
I don't remember much after that.

1003
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:25,162
- Gabe.
- Damn. They said I blacked out.

1004
01:07:38,984 --> 01:07:40,212
Hi.

1005
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:46,324
I guess this is the end of karate, huh?

1006
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:49,150
I'm a place-kicker.

1007
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:53,287
If you work hard, you can achieve anything.
I really believe that, Gabe.

1008
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:55,490
Whatever.

1009
01:07:56,568 --> 01:08:01,733
Hey, I came as soon as I got the message.
What happened?

1010
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:05,365
He went a little too hard
for his yellow belt.

1011
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:09,479
Sounds like we're gonna need some
ice cream on the way home, huh?

1012
01:08:10,249 --> 01:08:12,183
No, thanks.

1013
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:17,553
Was this it?

1014
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,123
Was this the end for me and Rosemary?

1015
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:23,489
Two and a half weeks was all the time
we were going to be allowed?

1016
01:08:23,662 --> 01:08:26,654
I was not gonna call her.
That would be weak.

1017
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:30,290
And I resolved that night
to be weak no longer.

1018
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:32,200
Hello.

1019
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:35,670
- Hello, Mrs. Burton?
- No, this is Gabe.

1020
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:39,402
Who cares if she thought I was my mother?
It was her.

1021
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:41,913
- Hello?
- No, Mom, I got it.

1022
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,139
- Who is it?
- Mom, I got it. Hang up now.

1023
01:08:44,316 --> 01:08:46,079
Okay, hon.

1024
01:08:46,618 --> 01:08:50,054
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your hand?

1025
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,850
My hand? Oh, it's fine, barely hurt.

1026
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:56,358
I just got so worried
when you lost consciousness.

1027
01:08:56,528 --> 01:08:58,928
Yeah, that was only like
for a second or so.

1028
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:01,122
What color cast did you get?

1029
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,530
Plain was the best of my choices.

1030
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:05,636
My cousin got this Hulk one.

1031
01:09:05,971 --> 01:09:08,872
Yeah, they had that too,
but I'm not at all really into the Hulk.

1032
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:13,307
This was no time for small talk.
It was time to lay things on the table.

1033
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:17,005
To reach through that phone line
and dig deep into that woman's soul.

1034
01:09:17,182 --> 01:09:19,241
So when can we hang out?

1035
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:23,920
- It's a really crazy weekend for me.
- It is?

1036
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:26,557
It's Thursday night.
She's going to camp Sunday morning.

1037
01:09:26,725 --> 01:09:28,283
Who cares how crazy the weekend is?

1038
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,927
Rehearsal dinner tomorrow night.

1039
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,225
Wedding on Saturday, camp on Sunday.

1040
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:35,628
Sure. Right, of course.

1041
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:37,894
Where's "wish you could
come to the wedding"?

1042
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,197
Where's that Rosemary?
The Rosemary I loved.

1043
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:42,602
Not this alien with her crazy weekends.

1044
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:45,265
Your new sparring partner,
is he coming to the wedding?

1045
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:48,471
- What? Tim?
- Oh, is that what you call him?

1046
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:50,774
Are you calling him
after you call me?

1047
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:52,314
What are you talking about?

1048
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:54,975
I'm talking about you and Tim Staples
sitting in a tree.

1049
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:57,212
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

1050
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:59,584
First comes love,
then comes marriage...

1051
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:01,988
...then comes Tim Staples
and a baby carriage.

1052
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,627
You sound crazy, you know that?

1053
01:10:03,795 --> 01:10:05,490
Why don't you have time this weekend?

1054
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:08,792
I'm sorry, Gabe.
I haven't even started packing.

1055
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:11,898
- You know what, I hate you.
- What?

1056
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,937
I hate you. Why do you even care?
I hate you!

1057
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:17,735
- Well, I hate you too.
- I hate you more.

1058
01:10:18,243 --> 01:10:23,044
How can you say something so mean?
I hate you!

1059
01:10:37,896 --> 01:10:39,693
Oh, Rosemary.

1060
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,333
Rosemary!

1061
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,918
You want to, or should I?

1062
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:09,651
Rosemary.

1063
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:13,622
It was the pain that had no name.

1064
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:21,396
Why did Rosemary Telesco
ever have to walk into my life?

1065
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:24,599
Why, why, why?

1066
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:34,008
Maybe not everything
is supposed to last forever.

1067
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,284
Certain things are like...

1068
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:41,917
Like skywriting.
Like a really beautiful thing...

1069
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:46,029
...that lasts for a couple moments
and then... you know?

1070
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,466
Oh, sweetie.

1071
01:11:54,406 --> 01:11:57,933
- Mommy.
- I know, honey.

1072
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,443
- Love sucks.
- Yeah.

1073
01:12:09,187 --> 01:12:10,245
Look at them all.

1074
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:12,980
Rats in their cages.

1075
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:15,388
Their lives destroyed by love.

1076
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,425
I'm done with it.

1077
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:20,758
I won't be like them.

1078
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,631
The fools.

1079
01:12:27,372 --> 01:12:29,169
I remember my first girl.

1080
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:30,569
We met on the Jersey shore.

1081
01:12:30,742 --> 01:12:32,801
But she was from Philly,
I was from Brooklyn...

1082
01:12:32,978 --> 01:12:35,469
...so we knew right from the start
we were cursed.

1083
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,615
Ralph, not right now.
I'm not in the mood.

1084
01:12:38,617 --> 01:12:40,175
Okay.

1085
01:13:48,353 --> 01:13:50,617
It's amazing how quickly time moves.

1086
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:53,622
Just yesterday, I thought I loved her.

1087
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:57,455
But now I don't even
care about her at all.

1088
01:14:17,182 --> 01:14:20,913
The next morning, this kind of
amazing thing happened.

1089
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:23,577
The sun came out again.

1090
01:14:24,522 --> 01:14:27,787
See, life is about so much more
than Rosemary.

1091
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,028
I had my family, my health,
my kicking career.

1092
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:36,559
I really had no room
for a woman in my life.

1093
01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:39,528
How about some rocky road?

1094
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:41,796
I guess.

1095
01:14:45,844 --> 01:14:48,369
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1096
01:14:48,546 --> 01:14:53,540
What's the deal with girls?
I mean, why are they the way they are?

1097
01:14:56,655 --> 01:14:59,055
You're talking to the wrong man.

1098
01:15:00,058 --> 01:15:04,427
Well, how come all love has to end?

1099
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,766
Let me...

1100
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:19,510
Let me tell you something
about me and your mom.

1101
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:24,138
Once upon a time,
we really loved each other.

1102
01:15:25,483 --> 01:15:30,477
But as time went by,
there just got to be all these things...

1103
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:35,752
Little things.
Stupid things that were left unsaid.

1104
01:15:35,927 --> 01:15:40,557
And all these things
that were left unsaid piled up like...

1105
01:15:40,732 --> 01:15:42,791
Like the clutter in our storage room.

1106
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:46,664
And after a while, there was so much
that was left unsaid...

1107
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:50,604
...that we barely said anything at all.

1108
01:15:51,409 --> 01:15:54,572
Well, why didn't you
just say them then, Dad?

1109
01:15:57,482 --> 01:15:59,575
I don't know, Gabe.

1110
01:16:01,286 --> 01:16:03,345
I kind of wish I had.

1111
01:16:04,322 --> 01:16:08,190
Who was I kidding anyway?
I wasn't gonna get any real comfort here.

1112
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:10,953
I mean, the old guy meant okay.

1113
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:13,323
Let's knock over a hot dog stand
on the way home.

1114
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:16,830
Drown our sorrows
in pork shoulders and nitrates.

1115
01:16:17,001 --> 01:16:18,400
No, I think that's all right.

1116
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:21,471
I'm just gonna, I don't know,
hang out here for a while.

1117
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,008
Okay, champ.

1118
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:26,473
- See you at the homestead.
- All right.

1119
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:28,077
You kicked good today.

1120
01:16:28,246 --> 01:16:30,237
I'm telling you,
the trajectory you're on...

1121
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:32,007
...to the moon.

1122
01:16:32,183 --> 01:16:35,346
- Or at least the Big Ten.
- Thanks.

1123
01:16:35,653 --> 01:16:39,350
- It felt good.
- Good. I'll see you at home.

1124
01:16:43,394 --> 01:16:46,386
Somewhere a million miles away...

1125
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:50,494
...the girl I once loved
was going down her road...

1126
01:16:52,337 --> 01:16:54,396
...and I was stuck back on mine.

1127
01:17:40,585 --> 01:17:45,522
I couldn't escape them,
all the little things I left unsaid.

1128
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,714
I was drowning in them.

1129
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,571
Suddenly, I knew what I had to do.

1130
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:10,544
Love isn't about ridiculous little words.
Love is about grand gestures.

1131
01:18:10,715 --> 01:18:13,650
Don't go to Taos. Not without me.

1132
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:16,318
Love is about airplanes
pulling banners over stadiums.

1133
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:18,813
Proposals on Jumbo Trons.

1134
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:22,626
Giant words in skywriting.

1135
01:18:23,428 --> 01:18:26,920
Love is about going that extra mile,
even if it hurts.

1136
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:30,000
Letting it all hang out there.

1137
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:35,663
Love is about finding courage inside of you
that you didn't even know was there.

1138
01:20:08,032 --> 01:20:09,863
What are you doing here?

1139
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:13,902
You're going to camp tomorrow.
I had to say goodbye.

1140
01:20:15,073 --> 01:20:20,773
- But I thought you hate me.
- I don't. I lied.

1141
01:20:21,045 --> 01:20:23,206
I wasn't gonna be like my father.

1142
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:27,511
I wasn't gonna let all these things
left unsaid smother me.

1143
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:29,881
Rosemary...

1144
01:20:33,424 --> 01:20:35,392
...I love you.

1145
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,890
- You what?
- I do.

1146
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:43,860
I'm sorry, but I love you more
than anyone has ever loved.

1147
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:46,401
I love you. I love you. I love you.

1148
01:20:46,571 --> 01:20:48,698
How's that for letting
it all hang out there.

1149
01:20:49,107 --> 01:20:50,404
And hang...

1150
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:54,238
...and hang, and hang.

1151
01:20:57,448 --> 01:21:02,511
Do you think you might
wanna love me too?

1152
01:21:03,021 --> 01:21:08,220
I don't know what I think, Gabe.
I'm only 11.

1153
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:13,594
I don't think I'm ready to be in love.

1154
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:16,427
Well, I'm not ready and I'm doing it.

1155
01:21:16,601 --> 01:21:20,128
But it wasn't that easy.
I guess love never is.

1156
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,637
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe girls don't mature faster.

1157
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,278
No, they do. They do.
You know they do.

1158
01:21:28,446 --> 01:21:30,505
You even said so at the park.

1159
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:32,581
We at least mature at the same rate.

1160
01:21:34,285 --> 01:21:37,118
I don't know what mature is anymore.

1161
01:21:41,559 --> 01:21:44,585
But I'm really happy you came.

1162
01:21:50,802 --> 01:21:54,966
- Do you wanna dance, Gabe?
- Dance?

1163
01:21:55,706 --> 01:21:57,697
Sure, what the hell.

1164
01:22:12,657 --> 01:22:15,854
As I held on to Rosemary Telesco
for dear life...

1165
01:22:16,027 --> 01:22:18,154
...we both knew the truth.

1166
01:22:18,329 --> 01:22:22,766
She was going off to camp
and eventually private school.

1167
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,491
We were on different roads, she and me.

1168
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,831
Two ships that passed
in Sheep Meadow.

1169
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,781
See, this is just like I told you.

1170
01:22:43,955 --> 01:22:46,549
Same thing I knew
getting into this whole mess.

1171
01:22:46,724 --> 01:22:49,192
Love ends.

1172
01:22:51,696 --> 01:22:54,824
- Hey, Mr. Gabe, how goes it?
- Hey, Ralph.

1173
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:56,193
Hold the door, please.

1174
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:10,436
The truth is, you come
into this world alone...

1175
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:13,379
...and leave it the exact same way.

1176
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:15,947
I'm home.

1177
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:08,594
Who are these strangers laughing
in my mother's bedroom?

1178
01:24:08,773 --> 01:24:11,173
I'd only seen them in pictures.

1179
01:24:11,442 --> 01:24:12,909
Hi.

1180
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:20,014
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1181
01:24:20,184 --> 01:24:23,950
We were just talking about how horrible
our honeymoon was.

1182
01:24:24,355 --> 01:24:25,583
Yeah?

1183
01:24:25,756 --> 01:24:29,817
Key West.
Everything that could possibly go wrong...

1184
01:24:29,994 --> 01:24:33,327
An unmitigated disaster.
It wasn't even a tropical storm, it...

1185
01:24:33,497 --> 01:24:35,158
- Remember that?
- Like yesterday.

1186
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:39,167
It was awful. We lost our luggage.
God, you were so sick.

1187
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:43,230
God, I'm hungry. What time is it?

1188
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:49,637
- We should get something to eat.
- All of us?

1189
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:53,479
Yeah, we should...

1190
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,778
Why don't we go down
to the place on the corner.

1191
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:59,684
Yeah, the place on the corner
sounds good.

1192
01:24:59,857 --> 01:25:03,349
- It's getting cooler out there.
- Yeah, we're gonna need jackets.

1193
01:25:12,737 --> 01:25:16,673
I just cleared some old stuff
out of the storage room.

1194
01:25:37,628 --> 01:25:39,892
You wanted a New York love story?

1195
01:25:40,064 --> 01:25:42,532
There's a New York love story for you.

1196
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,294
I told you it wasn't gonna be pretty.

1197
01:25:47,305 --> 01:25:51,935
Love is an ugly, terrible business
practiced by fools.

1198
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:55,772
It will trample your heart
and leave you bleeding on the floor.

1199
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:58,779
And what does it really
get you in the end?

1200
01:25:59,183 --> 01:26:03,950
Nothing but a few incredible memories
that you can't ever shake.

1201
01:26:11,896 --> 01:26:14,797
The truth is, there's gonna
be other girls out there.

1202
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:17,525
I mean, I hope.

1203
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:22,398
But I'm never gonna get
another first love.

1204
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:27,201
That one's always gonna be her.

1205
01:26:28,201 --> 01:26:38,201
