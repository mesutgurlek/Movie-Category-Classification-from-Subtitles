1
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,303
What's it gonna be, Angelina?

2
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:55,502
It was Grogan...

3
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:58,171
the filthiest, dirtiest,
dumbest excuse for a man...

4
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,611
west of the Missouri River.

5
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:01,842
Now, you can die
two ways, angel.

6
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:04,407
Quick like the tongue
of a snake...

7
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:07,580
or slower than
the molasses in January.

8
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:10,583
But it was October.

9
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,219
I'll kill you, God damn it,
if it's the Fourth of July!

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,522
Where is it?

11
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:22,697
Get over there.

12
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,335
I told him to get out...

13
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:31,368
now that he had
what he came for.

14
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:33,712
Not quite, Angel.

15
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,475
Take 'em off.

16
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:37,677
Do it!

17
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:52,996
Come on!

18
00:01:58,806 --> 00:01:59,966
Aah!

19
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,185
That was the end of Grogan...

20
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:15,814
the man who killed my father,
raped and murdered my sister...

21
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:20,657
burned my ranch, shot my dog,
and stole my Bible!

22
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:37,242
But if there was one law
of the West...

23
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:40,113
bastards had brothers...

24
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,913
who seemed to ride forever.

25
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,955
But suddenly, there he was,
my beloved Jesse.

26
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:04,804
He was the one man I trusted--
the only man.

27
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:10,371
My heart leapt
as I watched him ride near.

28
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:13,505
I could barely wait to feel
the warmth of his touch.

29
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,330
At the moment
his lips met mine...

30
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:40,704
I knew that we would
never again be apart.

31
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,454
I knew then
that we would spend...

32
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:56,456
the rest of our lives together.

33
00:03:57,558 --> 00:03:58,684
Forever.

34
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:03,219
Oh, God, that's good.

35
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:16,874
The... End.

36
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,381
Oh.

37
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,591
Oh.

38
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:10,889
I finished, sweetheart.
You want to celebrate?

39
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,566
So do I.

40
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:55,300
Romeo, Romeo,
where are you, Romeo?

41
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:00,906
There.
Hey, it's Bumble Bee, kiddo.

42
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:05,078
Just so you know, I spare
no expense when I celebrate.

43
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:51,592
Here's looking at you, Jesse.

44
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:55,330
Whoever you are.

45
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,514
Are you finished?

46
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,879
Thank you.

47
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,526
Oh, come here, Romeo.

48
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:26,627
Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,540
Hello?

50
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,509
Hello?

51
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,990
Oh, my God,
Romeo, is that the time?

52
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:29,426
Gloria! I'm going to be late.

53
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,504
Oh!

54
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:51,041
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, pumpkin.

55
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,453
Mrs. Irwin, why won't
you take the elevator?

56
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,254
Pumpkin, I never get
in an elevator alone.

57
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:02,922
You know...rapists.
Where are you running off to?

58
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,295
Oh...I've got to get
to my publisher's.

59
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,593
By the way, pumpkin...

60
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,864
the mailman couldn't
fit this into your box...

61
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:11,336
so I told him
I'd give it to you.

62
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,907
That's some love letter.

63
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,109
Mrs. Irwin, you're a tease.

64
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:22,013
I know, but I keep hoping
for you, pumpkin.

65
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,957
Lady, how about a monkey
for your little nephew?

66
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:36,690
I'll give it to you
for ten dollars.

67
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,095
Really great deal.
Come on, lady.

68
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:39,429
No. I don't--

69
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,660
Your boyfriend will love it.

70
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,191
It's kind of kinky,
you know what I mean?

71
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:45,797
Nine dollars--
eight dollars, bottom line.

72
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,501
Thank you, but I really
don't need a monkey.

73
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,976
Oh, but, lady,
this is kinda cute.

74
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,942
Hey. That's
Miss Wilder's apartment.

75
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,350
Can I help you?

76
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,125
Excuse me.

77
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,524
Get away from that door.

78
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:12,726
What's this?

79
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:17,797
Uhh!

80
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:21,750
Wimp. Wimp.

81
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:23,986
Loser.

82
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,417
Loser.

83
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,520
Major loser.

84
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:33,092
Too angry. Too vague.

85
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,230
Too desperate.

86
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,734
God, too happy.

87
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:40,468
Oh. Look at this guy,
Mr. Mondo-dizmo.

88
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:43,306
I actually used to date him.
Total sleaze-bucket.

89
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,209
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold everything.

90
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:52,117
Get a load of this character.
Now, what about him?

91
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,849
No, he's--he's just not--

92
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,290
Who? Jesse?

93
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,760
Maybe it's silly, but I know...

94
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,730
that there is somebody
out there for me.

95
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,062
Oh, yeah? Where?

96
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,630
Certainly not here.

97
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,863
Gloria, why do we always have
to have this same conversation?

98
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:16,138
Because I like you, and I hate
to see you all alone...

99
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,839
waiting for somebody
who's not gonna show up.

100
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,109
OK, Gloria.

101
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:25,780
Here it is.

102
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:28,745
Mmm.

103
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,725
Read it and weep. I always do.

104
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:34,951
I'll call you, OK?

105
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,521
Come on, don't leave.
Have another grasshopper.

106
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,726
-I can't.
-Come on, stay.

107
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,598
I'm your publisher.
I'm ordering you to.

108
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,796
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I even
dragged you to this place.

109
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,274
I just wanted you to get out.

110
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,368
I know how hard
you've been working.

111
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,538
I know you're upset
about your sister.

112
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,481
Come on, how is she?
Have you heard from her?

113
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:58,145
Elaine?
I spoke to her last week.

114
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,120
She's still in Colombia.

115
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,249
Have they found
her husband's body yet?

116
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,560
Just the one piece.

117
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,163
You know what's really creepy?

118
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:12,860
I got this package
from Eduardo from Colombia.

119
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:14,596
Must have been mailed
just before he...

120
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,895
God!

121
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,469
Can you imagine how awful,
having your husband murdered?

122
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,374
How is she holding up?

123
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:28,674
Oh, she'll be fine.
Elaine always...manages.

124
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,429
Uhh!

125
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,655
Hey, Ira.

126
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,028
The kid's here with the broad.
They're taking her to the boat.

127
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,094
Look at these snappers,
will you?

128
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,405
We should have just
rifled her room.

129
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,467
Ralph, how many times
do I have to tell you?

130
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,240
It's not in the country.

131
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,305
This kidnapping stuff
makes me real nervous.

132
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:46,948
It's a piss-poor idea.
It's nothing but trouble.

133
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:50,822
Look, we've stolen enough
of these antique trinkets...

134
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,759
to keep us living comfortably
for the rest of our lives.

135
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,888
Let's kiss off
this Third World toilet.

136
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,331
One last big one.
Trust me, Ralph.

137
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,562
Whoa! Did you see that, Ralph?

138
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,968
That ugly striped son of a bitch
down there?

139
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,302
Somebody's gonna get killed...

140
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,831
and you're farting around
with prehistoric animals.

141
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,343
Come on, Ira!
Let's forget this one.

142
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,608
I got a real bad feeling
about it.

143
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,411
Will you stop worrying?
Have I ever hurt you?

144
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,918
I will never hurt you.
I can't hurt you.

145
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:19,544
We got the same blood.

146
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,988
We're not two people.
We are one person.

147
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,651
Would I hurt me?

148
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,552
Look at those snappers, Ralph.

149
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,791
Oh! Oh, Romeo!

150
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,861
Oh, baby! Oh!

151
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,869
Aah!

152
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:16,937
Hello?

153
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,674
Hello, Joan.
Joan, can you hear me?

154
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,682
Elaine,
I can't talk right now.

155
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,810
Listen to me.
Listen very carefully.

156
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm in trouble.

157
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,814
Elaine, please...

158
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:32,314
Joanie, I am in real trouble.

159
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
What's the matter?

160
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,688
Has any mail been
forwarded to you...

161
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,461
with Eduardo's handwriting?
Any big envelope?

162
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,694
Yes.

163
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:46,105
See if there's some kind
of treasure map inside.

164
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,676
It says El Corazon.

165
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:54,647
I need you to bring that map
to me in Colombia.

166
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,378
Colombia?

167
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,582
My God, what kind of trouble
are you in?

168
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,523
Joanie, please.

169
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,087
Get to the Hotel Cartagena
in Cartagena.

170
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,727
When you arrive,
call this number: 64-58-24.

171
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,737
-Are you writing this down?
-Yes!

172
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,797
And remember,
you mustn't tell anybody.

173
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,711
Elaine, I can't go to Colombia.

174
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,505
Aah... Joanie...

175
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,041
they'll cut me. They'll hurt me.

176
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,858
Colombia?

177
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,986
Do you have any idea what
it's like in Colombia? I do.

178
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,996
Your books do very well
in these macho countries.

179
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,998
They have jungles there,
Joanie...

180
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:47,227
insects the size
of sanitation trucks...

181
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:48,428
revolutionaries.

182
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,336
-Have you had your shots?
-Shots? What shots?

183
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,136
You're completely
unprepared. Wait a minute.

184
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,642
Would you tell me
what's going on?

185
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,769
Why are you doing this?

186
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,111
Elaine is in some trouble.

187
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,844
She has
a little domestic problem.

188
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,182
Domestic problem?

189
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,652
Elaine's
last domestic problem...

190
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,655
was finding her husband
cut into small pieces.

191
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,590
I'm not gonna let you do this.
You cannot go!

192
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,594
Here's Romeo.

193
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:16,620
Now, I want you to promise me
to feed him...

194
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,825
and hold him
at least once a day.

195
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:24,561
You're gonna need
something stronger than that.

196
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,765
Listen to me.

197
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:28,775
You get bus-sick, sea-sick,
plane-sick, train-sick.

198
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:32,506
You practically puke on
the escalator at Bloomingdale's!

199
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:35,641
A lot of people
get sick in department stores.

200
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:37,844
Joanie, please, don't go.

201
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,844
You're not up to this, Joan,
and you know it.

202
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:46,287
I know, but she's my sister.

203
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,956
I'll feed him,
but I'm not picking him up.

204
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,976
Crazy!

205
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,054
The plane from New York,
has it arrived yet?

206
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,795
-The areo arrivo aqui?.
-No comprendo.

207
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,906
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

208
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,937
-Que?
-Oh.

209
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:19,946
Es este el autobus
a Carta--?

210
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,113
Cartagena.

211
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:24,955
Oh, you speak English.
Good!

212
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:29,452
Can you tell me,
is this bus going to Cartagena?

213
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:32,991
Yes, Cartagena.

214
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:35,502
Great. Thank you.

215
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,703
OK.

216
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:41,664
Oh, thank you.

217
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,260
Hey, you're on the wrong bus!

218
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,700
Miss Wilder!
She got on the wrong bus.

219
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:11,898
This is terrible!

220
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,753
Oh--

221
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,895
My God.

222
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,493
Excuse me.

223
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,443
Uh...

224
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,749
Excuse--excuse me.

225
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,954
I'm-- I'm very sorry.

226
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,518
I'm really sorry.

227
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,869
Ahem. I'm sorry to bother you.

228
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,266
Can you tell me what time
we get to Cartagena?

229
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,809
ls this the bus to Cartagena?

230
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,576
I need to get
to Cartagena-- Aah!

231
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,356
Shit!

232
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,520
What are we gonna do now?

233
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,250
Where's my suitcase?

234
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:05,877
You don't have to walk.
Another bus will come along.

235
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,018
They know nothing.
They are peasants.

236
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,577
Another bus? Really?

237
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,385
Of course.

238
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:18,755
There are schedules
to be maintained...

239
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,522
even in Colombia.

240
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:12,699
What?

241
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:15,005
-The purse.
-What are you--

242
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:24,482
Alto!

243
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:30,385
Aah!

244
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,738
Oh, my God!

245
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,553
What the hell?

246
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,953
Jesus Christ!

247
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:42,360
What the hell
happened to my birds?!

248
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,424
Son of a bitch!

249
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,212
Hi.

250
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,952
I demand this car in the name
of the law.

251
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,197
Turn this car around.

252
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,725
Oh, no. Talk about breaks.

253
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,181
Don't I know you?

254
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:42,354
You are American.

255
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,687
I hate Americanos.

256
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:49,560
I spit on 'em.

257
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:51,360
Ptew! I hate Americanos!

258
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,560
They're scumo! Scum!

259
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,531
Are you French?

260
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:09,973
Well, honey, looks like
we're gonna have to wait...

261
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,077
just a little longer.

262
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,451
Shit.

263
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:18,782
Excuse me.

264
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:21,318
Could you please tell me
how to get to a telephone?

265
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:24,728
Lady, I don't have
any idea. I'm sorry.

266
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:27,394
It's very important
that I get one.

267
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:31,132
We've all got
our problems today, don't we?

268
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,367
Can you tell me where
the nearest town is?

269
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,400
-How about Miami?
-Will there be another bus?

270
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,480
This is it.
You got rush hour.

271
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:43,750
I have to get to Cartagena.

272
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:45,480
Cartagena?

273
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,580
Angel, you are hell and gone
from Cartagena.

274
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:50,386
Cartagena's
over there on the coast.

275
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,985
-But they told me this bus.
-Who told you that?

276
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:54,921
That man that--

277
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:57,431
That nice man who pulled
a gun on you? Uh-huh.

278
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,124
What else did he tell you?

279
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,464
Please, I need your help.

280
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:04,630
I guess that's my new career.

281
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:05,798
It's very--

282
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,540
Lady, half a year's work
Just flew south for the winter.

283
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:13,171
My Jeep is totaled.

284
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:16,448
In five minutes, everything
I own is gonna be wet...

285
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:18,850
so could you lighten up?
I don't have the time.

286
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,354
I'll pay you.

287
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,784
You don't understand.
It's a matter of life and death.

288
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,759
-If I don't get--
-How much?

289
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:29,290
Fifty dollars?

290
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:32,259
Oh, shit.

291
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,627
You said you just lost
everything you owned.

292
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,035
Not my sense of humor.

293
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,665
I'll pay you
a hundred dollars!

294
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:41,231
Two hundred dollars!

295
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,844
I'll do it.

296
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:53,481
For five.

297
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:54,681
What?!

298
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,758
I'll pay you
two hundred and fifty dollars.

299
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:04,158
Now, I ain't cheap,
but I can be had.

300
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:08,027
My minimum price for taking
a stranded woman...

301
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:10,731
to a telephone
is four hundred dollars.

302
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,706
Will you take
three hundred seventy-five

303
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:14,799
in traveler's checks?

304
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:16,036
-American Express?
-Of course.

305
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,237
You got a deal.

306
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:20,336
Good.

307
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,290
You got any valuables
in that suitcase?

308
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:41,818
No. Yes!
All my clothes and things.

309
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:43,660
You got an umbrella?

310
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,057
No.

311
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,863
You got a good pair
of walking shoes?

312
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,231
They're all like these.

313
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,210
OK, let's make some time.

314
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,854
Aw, shit!

315
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:02,774
Oh, God damn it!
What a ride, huh?

316
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,672
I'm telling you...

317
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,544
this is turning out to be
one hell of a morning.

318
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,344
You OK?

319
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:14,482
I said, are you hurt?

320
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:16,951
What's the matter?
You paralysed from the neck up?

321
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:18,151
Are you hurt?

322
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,254
-No!
-Good!

323
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:22,522
What's your name?

324
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:27,462
I'm Joan Wilder.

325
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:29,129
Joan Wilder?

326
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,660
Welcome to Colombia!

327
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:42,443
Ira, l--

328
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:44,644
Hi, Ma. It's me, Irving.

329
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:46,676
Ralph, you little twerp,
where are you?

330
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:49,417
Calm down, Ma.
Who says I never call?

331
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,186
For Christ's sake,
tell me the story.

332
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:52,487
All right, cousin.

333
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:55,496
As usual, you got us
in some serious shit here.

334
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,829
First of all, the stupid dame
got on the wrong bus.

335
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:03,394
Now I'm stuck in some kind
of spico military compound.

336
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:07,036
They're mobilizing
for Iwo Jima here.

337
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,367
Do they know who you are?

338
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,971
What do you think,
I'm introducing myself...

339
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:15,039
to every cop in the pueblo?

340
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,980
And another little tidbit,
cousin.

341
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,015
Guess who else is here?

342
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,081
Zolo!

343
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:24,819
Oh, well, give the man a cigar!

344
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,351
You're goddamn right, Zolo.
He got in my car.

345
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:30,023
Not only are we kidnappers...

346
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:33,363
but I'm about to have a close
encounter with a cattle prod.

347
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:34,925
Ira:
Has he got his boys with him?

348
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,427
No. He's making do
with the local yo-yos.

349
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,234
Oh, no.

350
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:44,169
Aw! Look!

351
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,646
God damn it, Ralph,
get that map!

352
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:48,615
Don't yell at me, Ira!

353
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:50,276
Look, you want to kill me?

354
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:52,452
Take me back to Queens
and kill me.

355
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:55,751
Don't let me die in a jungle
like a goddamn snake.

356
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,281
Ralph, God damn it,
I don't care what you got to do.

357
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:00,123
Just get me that map!

358
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:08,092
Little sister
took the wrong road.

359
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:10,797
And that third party
I told you about...

360
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,373
he's tagging along.

361
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,432
The man who killed my husband?

362
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,637
The butcher
who killed your husband.

363
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:22,305
A very powerful man with his own
private army to back him up.

364
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,908
And whether he calls himself...

365
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:26,818
Dr. Zolo,
Minister of Antiquities...

366
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:28,287
or Colonel Zolo...

367
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:30,756
Deputy Commander
of the Secret Police...

368
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:33,385
he's still just a butcher.

369
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:39,956
Look at those snappers,
will you?

370
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:54,744
What's the matter? You sick?

371
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:58,013
Oh, no. I lost my button.

372
00:35:58,552 --> 00:35:59,678
You lost what?

373
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,178
I lost my button. My button.

374
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:05,124
You're gonna lose
a lot more than that.

375
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,707
These were Italian.

376
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,507
Now they're practical.

377
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,844
Is nothing that I own
sacred to you?

378
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:31,613
Only your three hundred
and seventy-five dollars.

379
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:38,685
Cops!

380
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,123
What the hell do they want?

381
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:45,255
I haven't done anything lately.

382
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:54,906
I'm shooting at a cop!

383
00:36:57,581 --> 00:37:00,448
Wait a minute. He's after you!

384
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,778
Who the hell are you?

385
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,812
Well, I'm a romance novelist.

386
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,380
You're what?

387
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,419
What are you doing here?

388
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,055
I told you.
My sister's life depends on me.

389
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,462
Don't give me that shit.

390
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,796
I thought you were donating
a kidney or something.

391
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,799
Christ, here they come.

392
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,001
This may be a good time
to try on those shoes.

393
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,410
-Wait!
-Deal's off, lady!

394
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,220
Wait!

395
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,851
Lady, you are bad news.

396
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,564
What'd you do,
wake up this morning and say...

397
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,539
''Today I'm gonna ruin
a man's life''?

398
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:11,018
Do you know where you're going?

399
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,919
Looks like a trail.

400
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,321
This is a trail?

401
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,037
Lady, you are a jinx!

402
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,239
What about the bridge?

403
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,841
That ain't a bridge.
Goddamn pre-Colombian art.

404
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:42,078
We can't get across that.

405
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,258
Aw, shit. All right.

406
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,119
We're gonna hold them off
right from here.

407
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,525
You just stay right behind me.

408
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:57,859
God damn it! I knew I should've
listened to my mother.

409
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,297
Faster, faster.

410
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,125
I could've been
a cosmetic surgeon.

411
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,787
Five hundred thou a year,
up to my neck in tits and ass.

412
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,576
Lady,
I hope you're taking notes...

413
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:44,775
'cause you got a real live
death scene going on right here.

414
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,690
Romantic novelist, my ass.

415
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,159
Holy shit!

416
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,932
Joan!

417
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,810
We can't cross.

418
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,220
What the hell are you doing?

419
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,056
Drinking?

420
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,426
I could've been killed,
and you're drinking!

421
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,133
Wait!

422
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:47,761
I will catch up to them.

423
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,158
Are we stopping?

424
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,170
Be my guest.

425
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:24,126
You OK?

426
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,238
Come on.

427
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,095
Is anybody else in there?

428
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,968
No.

429
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:04,132
No, it's a cargo plane.

430
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,403
What is all this?

431
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,777
All this?
Five-to-life in the States.

432
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,612
Couple of centuries down here.

433
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,777
Oh, marijuana.

434
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,377
Oh, you smoke it?

435
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,613
I went to college.

436
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:23,325
Sure.

437
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,061
All right! OK.

438
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,004
Oh, God,
do I love those fly-boys.

439
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,885
What?

440
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,426
This is Elaine's favourite drink.

441
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,388
You gonna tell me
about that sister of yours?

442
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,259
I already did.

443
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:59,774
Her husband died and...

444
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,472
and I've come down here
to comfort her.

445
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:07,743
-Uh-huh.
-It's the truth.

446
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:16,622
Right. Yeah, it's the truth.

447
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,494
All right,
I'm gonna make a fire.

448
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:30,697
You got any dry matches in here?

449
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:37,106
Well, looky here.

450
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:41,913
Huh? Oh, no, don't!

451
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:49,186
I think you and I ought
to have a talk.

452
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:53,990
All right.

453
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:05,768
Yeah, that's
what I call a campfire.

454
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:19,014
So they're ransoming your sister
for this El Corazon.

455
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:22,750
That's Spanish for ''The Heart.''

456
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:26,927
This map here
leads to The Heart.

457
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,258
But the heart of what?

458
00:47:32,636 --> 00:47:34,194
I don't care.

459
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:41,105
You see here where it says
this El Corazon...

460
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:43,612
is hidden in Cordoba province?

461
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:46,941
So we're sitting right
in the middle of it.

462
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:52,016
All I care about is my sister,
and that map is her life.

463
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:53,784
Like hell it is.

464
00:47:53,823 --> 00:47:56,587
Whatever's at the end of
this map is your sister's life.

465
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:59,959
Now, we get our hands
on this El Corazon...

466
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,789
then you got something
to bargain with.

467
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,594
I knew it would happen.

468
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,132
You knew what would happen?

469
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:10,139
All you care about
is yourself, isn't it?

470
00:48:10,173 --> 00:48:12,471
I knew that from the first
moment I laid eyes on you.

471
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:15,478
Was that the first moment
when I saved your ass?

472
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:17,412
You see? There you go.

473
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:21,076
You have no finesse. No style.

474
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:25,281
A real man doesn't have to draw
attention to his actions.

475
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:26,619
You're just...

476
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:29,382
You're a mondo-dizmo.

477
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:33,222
I'm--What am l?

478
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:37,063
You're a man who takes money
from stranded women.

479
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,228
A real man is--is honest...

480
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,671
and forthright and trustworthy.

481
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,436
Would you please
do me the courtesy...

482
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:51,072
of looking at me
when I'm speaking to you?

483
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:54,345
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

484
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:56,818
If you had
any kind of manners--

485
00:49:22,345 --> 00:49:24,472
Goddamn bushmaster.

486
00:49:25,448 --> 00:49:27,416
ls it poisonous?

487
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,610
Yeah...

488
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:31,209
but very tasty.

489
00:50:07,857 --> 00:50:09,154
Uniforme.

490
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:20,335
See, you got to figure
sulfur-crested cockatoos...

491
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,271
they go for about
eight hundred a shot.

492
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:26,538
Then you got
gentle red-tails...

493
00:50:26,576 --> 00:50:28,806
they're close
to two thousand each.

494
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:34,975
Shit, I lost close to
15,000 bucks in that bus crash.

495
00:50:39,222 --> 00:50:41,520
Do you want to know
something crazy?

496
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:43,219
What?

497
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:44,886
I don't even know your name.

498
00:50:44,928 --> 00:50:46,156
Well, you never asked me.

499
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:53,058
Excuse me.
I'd really like to know--

500
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:56,504
Colton. Jack T. Colton.

501
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,598
What does the ''T'' stand for?

502
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,474
Aw, God damn it, man!
The Doobie Brothers broke up.

503
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,742
Shit. When did that happen?

504
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:06,146
How long have you
been down here?

505
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:07,547
Aw, man.

506
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:11,116
Forever. I don't know.

507
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,654
-Were you always into birds?
-Mm-mmm.

508
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,626
No, no. l, uh...

509
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,218
No, I was...

510
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:22,494
I was into shortcuts.

511
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,528
Birds seemed to be a fast way
to get what I wanted...

512
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:29,663
and a hell of a lot healthier
than dealing in this crap.

513
00:51:30,974 --> 00:51:32,635
What is it you want?

514
00:51:37,947 --> 00:51:40,177
I think I'm gonna throw
another key on the fire.

515
00:51:40,216 --> 00:51:42,275
No, please.
I'm getting dizzy.

516
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,850
What do you want? Seriously.

517
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:50,382
I'd really like to know.

518
00:51:55,665 --> 00:51:57,724
Came down here
on a coffee boat...

519
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:00,736
about a year and a half ago,
right?

520
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,829
Christ, what a job that was.

521
00:52:04,908 --> 00:52:07,376
But I couldn't get over
that ocean, though, you know?

522
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:11,909
Yeah. I love the ocean.

523
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:17,315
You just kind of get out there
all by yourself...

524
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,980
nobody else around.

525
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:22,451
It's beautiful.

526
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:26,690
So that's what I want.

527
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:28,823
Try to get enough
money together...

528
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:31,959
buy a boat,
sail around the world.

529
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:36,805
So you're just gonna sail away
all by yourself?

530
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:40,669
Yeah.

531
00:52:42,278 --> 00:52:44,712
Sounds lonely, Jack T. Colton.

532
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,486
Well...

533
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:01,923
what does the ''T'' stand for?

534
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,365
Trustworthy.

535
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:26,846
Aw, man, I tell you,
one hell of a morning.

536
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:29,924
It's turned into
a bitch of a day.

537
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:53,775
''Tenedor del Diablo.''

538
00:53:57,553 --> 00:53:59,521
The Devil's Fork.

539
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,522
Zolo!

540
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,030
They are crossing the cemetery.

541
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,815
Friendly, aren't they?

542
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,055
Drug runners.
Just try to look mean.

543
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,192
Aw, shit.

544
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,430
-What's the matter?
-Nothing yet.

545
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,928
-OK, here we go.
-What?

546
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,863
I just knew I should have
listened to my mother.

547
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,400
You ready?

548
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,339
Ah...excuse me.

549
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,139
Gentlemen,
we are in need of a car.

550
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,545
Can any of you lovely
gentlemen tell me where...

551
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,681
Only one car in village.

552
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,122
Juan, the bell maker.

553
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,658
The bell maker.

554
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,089
Thank you.

555
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,333
Bell maker, my ass.

556
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,270
You know that fuselage
we slept in last night?

557
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,103
It's probably one of old Juan's
lost shipments.

558
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,335
You mean he's a drug--

559
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,969
Shh! Just don't
say a word out loud, OK?

560
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,707
-A dope--
-Come on, let's go.

561
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,788
All right.
Now, you hold back.

562
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,801
This one I'll handle.

563
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,475
What do you want, gringo?

564
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,454
You speak English.
That's great.

565
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,854
We understand
that you have a car...

566
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,257
and we would like
to rent it or buy it.

567
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,420
We have to get to a town.

568
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:15,226
What do you call this
I'm living in, a pigsty?

569
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,164
No. This is lovely.

570
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,102
Hit the road.

571
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:25,073
-You don't understand.
-Hit the road!

572
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,302
Senor, I'd--

573
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,878
It's cool.

574
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,977
It's cool. It's no problem.

575
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,529
OK, Joan Wilder,
write us out of this one.

576
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:49,725
Joan Wilder?

577
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,796
Joan Wilder?

578
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,504
The Joan Wilder?

579
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,769
You are Joan Wilder,
the novelist?

580
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,437
Yes, I am.

581
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:05,379
I read your books.
I read all your books.

582
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,213
Come in.
This is Juanita Wilder!

583
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,549
The one who writes the books
that I read to you on Saturdays.

584
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,454
-Come in.
-Adios, amiga.

585
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:22,157
I can't believe you're here.
Joan Wilder.

586
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,731
I've been reading your books
all these years.

587
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,293
I'm so honored to have you here.
I can't believe it.

588
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,533
Welcome to my humble house.

589
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:34,532
Joan Wilder. Ha! I'm sorry.

590
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,772
I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Juan.

591
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:40,806
I live here. Que paso? Ha ha!

592
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,683
The greatest novelist.
Get the door, please.

593
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,504
Come in. Make yourself at home.

594
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,536
Ever read
''The Return of Angelina''?

595
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,706
No.

596
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,807
Oh, that woman makes me hungry.

597
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,710
How about ''Love's Wicked Kiss?''

598
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,152
No. I haven't read
that one, either.

599
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,985
Really?
Take it. I have many copies.

600
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,354
I have here ''The Ravagers, ''

601
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,383
and I'm waiting for
''Angelina's Savage Secret.''

602
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,555
I'm so glad
you're here in Colombia.

603
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:03,895
I want to show you
all around my beautiful village.

604
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,027
We have colorful tile roofs,
typical cobblestone streets...

605
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,697
and very rich fields.

606
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,467
I was born here,
and so was my poor family.

607
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,804
What I would
really like would be a phone.

608
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,140
No phones, no phones.
I hate phones.

609
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,736
I don't have a phone.

610
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:20,015
But have a drink.
Let's hang out.

611
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:24,110
Look. Like it?
I can be in one of your books.

612
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,381
Oh, your drink.

613
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,582
I got Southern Comfort
or Michelob...

614
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,987
Kirin, Becks, Dos Equis...

615
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,724
Perrier, Anchor Steam,
Doctor Brown...

616
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,391
How about
a Xerox machine?

617
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,332
Yes, but she's broke.

618
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:47,207
-Where is the nearest phone?
-Many miles.

619
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,177
Can we get there in your car?

620
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,271
Who told you I had a car?

621
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,440
The men in the village.

622
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,384
They told you I had a car?
They are such comedians.

623
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,979
They meant my Little Mule, Pepe.

624
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,292
Not bad for a Little Mule, eh?

625
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,296
Now Pepe's warming up.

626
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,543
What are we stopping for?

627
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,878
I can't hurt my favorite pig.

628
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,794
Look out! Watch it!

629
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,771
See over there by the fence?
That's where my mother was born.

630
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,938
And see that tree,
the third tree up the ridge?

631
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,640
My brother planted that tree.

632
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:08,619
OK, Pepe, let's lose them.

633
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,098
-This guy's crazier than I am.
-Gracias. Yeah!

634
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:48,889
What the hell you doing?
That field was cover!

635
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,297
I wanted to show you
this other field.

636
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,404
This guy who's following you,
he's very persistent.

637
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,721
No problem.

638
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:20,986
My Little Mule is fireproof.

639
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,171
-See that river?
-The one without the bridge?

640
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,439
This is the main water supply
for many villages.

641
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,241
What do you mean,
the one without the bridge?

642
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,941
The one without the bridge!

643
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,008
Where the hell are you going?

644
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,611
To Lupe's Escape. I used it
many times in the past.

645
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:27,268
You're OK now.

646
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:30,008
You need Little Mule
to use Lupe's Escape.

647
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:33,016
You know, that river,
it's impossible to cross...

648
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:35,019
for two hundred miles
in either direction.

649
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,079
In fact, over that mountain...

650
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:41,523
the river becomes wild,
muy peligroso--

651
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,285
waterfalls, rapids.

652
01:04:45,296 --> 01:04:47,526
Angelina country. Right, Joan?

653
01:04:47,565 --> 01:04:49,192
What ever happened to Lupe?

654
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:52,793
Terrible disappointment
to family.

655
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:54,134
I can imagine.

656
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:57,403
He entered the priesthood,
so I took over the business.

657
01:04:57,442 --> 01:04:59,774
Is for the best.
I'm not so reckless.

658
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:03,042
He might have ended up hanging
from El Tenedor del Diablo.

659
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:04,548
It used to happen to bandidos.

660
01:05:04,582 --> 01:05:06,550
El Tenedor del Diablo?

661
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,619
OK, let's hit it.
We're on a roll.

662
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:16,086
I'm sorry I cannot take
you all the way to Cartagena.

663
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:18,220
Beyond this town,
I am a wanted man.

664
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:20,696
But in the morning,
there's always a bus.

665
01:05:20,732 --> 01:05:22,063
It will take you.

666
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:33,571
Of all the things
you can say to me right now...

667
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:35,545
''I've lost her, Ralph...''

668
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,879
is gonna get the most teeth
broken in your mouth.

669
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:41,441
Bullet head, if they're hiking
through the jungle...

670
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:42,885
there's nothing
I can do about it.

671
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,480
I have a car. I am not Tarzan.

672
01:05:45,523 --> 01:05:48,185
I have been through
every one-horse shithole...

673
01:05:48,226 --> 01:05:50,194
for a two-hundred-mile radius.

674
01:05:51,462 --> 01:05:54,192
You should've seen the river
I had to traverse this morning.

675
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:57,429
So don't give me any of
your crap, you gutless wonder.

676
01:05:57,468 --> 01:06:00,494
You have been an embarrassment
to me and the whole family...

677
01:06:00,538 --> 01:06:03,234
ever since you were born.
And one more thing--

678
01:06:03,274 --> 01:06:04,536
Joan.

679
01:06:04,575 --> 01:06:05,735
Yeah?

680
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:08,109
You are the luckiest
son of a bitch...

681
01:06:08,146 --> 01:06:10,341
that ever walked the earth!
She's here!

682
01:06:11,015 --> 01:06:12,141
She's there?

683
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:13,548
She's right here.

684
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:17,419
She's coming right toward
the phone booth.

685
01:06:18,556 --> 01:06:20,148
She's with some guy.

686
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:23,086
How do I know? She likes guys.

687
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:25,027
So do you, maricon.

688
01:06:38,643 --> 01:06:40,304
All the rooms have baths.

689
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:43,802
That's great.
You speak English, too.

690
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:45,076
That's great.

691
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:50,150
Listen, you wouldn't have
a Xerox machine around here?

692
01:06:50,188 --> 01:06:52,122
Yeah. We have one in the back.

693
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:57,557
It's big enough
to take, like, map-size?

694
01:06:57,595 --> 01:06:58,892
Yeah, complete.

695
01:07:00,865 --> 01:07:03,459
Yes, I understand.
I'll do that.

696
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,002
Well, I talked to Elaine.
She's all right.

697
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:12,441
They're gonna wait for me
to take the bus in the morning.

698
01:07:12,477 --> 01:07:14,377
That's great. You're covered.

699
01:07:14,412 --> 01:07:17,904
I don't know.
He sounded so smug.

700
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:19,974
-Who?
-That bastard that's got Elaine.

701
01:07:20,017 --> 01:07:23,077
Sure he is. You're bringing
him what he wants--the map.

702
01:07:24,055 --> 01:07:25,215
Yeah.

703
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:28,918
Well...

704
01:07:30,528 --> 01:07:31,688
I guess this is it.

705
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:35,857
I guess so.

706
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:41,629
Three-seventy-five.
That was the contract, right?

707
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:43,902
Yep. That was it.

708
01:07:51,616 --> 01:07:54,016
The least I can do
is buy you some dinner.

709
01:07:54,051 --> 01:07:55,643
Looks like it's gonna
be a hell of a party.

710
01:07:55,686 --> 01:07:56,846
I'd like that.

711
01:07:58,189 --> 01:08:00,521
I'll tell you what.
I got a room in the hotel.

712
01:08:00,558 --> 01:08:03,220
Why don't you go get cleaned up?
I'll buy us some new rags.

713
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:05,054
Number seven.

714
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:06,222
-Seven?
-Yeah.

715
01:08:06,264 --> 01:08:07,595
That's my lucky number.

716
01:08:10,034 --> 01:08:11,296
Mine, too.

717
01:08:48,339 --> 01:08:50,239
It's just beautiful.

718
01:08:51,309 --> 01:08:52,469
Thank you, Jack.

719
01:09:09,427 --> 01:09:12,487
I think
your writing's hot. It's great.

720
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,795
I mean it. I'm telling you,
I'm impressed. I am.

721
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,801
You've never even read the book.

722
01:09:18,436 --> 01:09:20,267
I know. I know.

723
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:27,444
I suppose it's my way
of living in another age.

724
01:09:27,478 --> 01:09:29,139
If you did that,
I never would have met you.

725
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:34,215
I got you something.

726
01:09:43,728 --> 01:09:45,218
El Corazon?

727
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:14,251
Let's dance.

728
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:17,358
-Oh, no, I can't.
-I'll show you.

729
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:20,387
-I-- No.
-Come on. Trust me.

730
01:11:05,943 --> 01:11:07,911
I lost my langostino.

731
01:11:18,656 --> 01:11:21,216
No, lady! No! Lady!

732
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:22,452
Calm down, lady!

733
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:46,367
Someday, if I had the money...

734
01:12:47,111 --> 01:12:48,510
I'd take you.

735
01:12:49,213 --> 01:12:50,771
I'd sail away.

736
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:53,242
Just the two of us.

737
01:12:54,952 --> 01:12:57,216
Around the world and back again.

738
01:13:00,624 --> 01:13:03,957
I promise you.
I promise you we'd do that.

739
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,164
Why haven't you
taken the map away from me?

740
01:13:19,143 --> 01:13:20,770
What are you talking about?

741
01:13:22,313 --> 01:13:24,747
I saw that tree today,
The Devil's Fork.

742
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:25,942
It's on the map.

743
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:28,182
You know how close we are?

744
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:30,380
Sure I do, but what has that
got to do with it?

745
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:33,782
I was thinking
about something you said--

746
01:13:33,824 --> 01:13:35,348
about having more
to bargain with.

747
01:13:35,392 --> 01:13:38,657
The best way to help your sister
is to get that treasure...

748
01:13:38,696 --> 01:13:40,061
and then you can waltz
into Cartagena.

749
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:42,395
You're holding all the cards.

750
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,367
I'd love to see you
on that boat.

751
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:52,698
But, Jack, if we have
to give it up to save Elaine...

752
01:13:52,743 --> 01:13:54,677
Then we give it up.
It's your sister.

753
01:13:54,712 --> 01:13:56,942
Of course we give it up,
but that's the point.

754
01:13:56,981 --> 01:13:58,972
At least we got the leverage
to do it.

755
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:12,457
Let's go for it.

756
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:05,929
Inspect, soldiers. That woman
has to be here.

757
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:07,297
He just won't quit.

758
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:25,842
-What are you doing?
-Hot-wiring the car.

759
01:15:26,753 --> 01:15:27,913
Try the key.

760
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:58,243
There it is. That's the shrine.

761
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,051
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

762
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,064
They are on the virgin road.

763
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:34,552
Well, this can't be all.

764
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:35,747
There's gotta be
another clue here.

765
01:16:35,789 --> 01:16:38,189
Landmarks change,
things grow...

766
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:39,816
all that stuff, you know?

767
01:16:43,663 --> 01:16:44,994
Hey, you hear that?

768
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:49,566
-Waterfall.
-Look, Jack.

769
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,399
All right, Joan!

770
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:17,162
You all right?

771
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:24,265
Oh! This has got to be it.

772
01:17:25,705 --> 01:17:30,540
Hey. What does
''Leche de la Madre'' mean?

773
01:17:32,645 --> 01:17:34,010
''Leche de la Madre''?

774
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:36,538
Yeah. It's on the map.

775
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:39,685
It means Mother's Milk.

776
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:41,687
-Mother's Milk?
-Yeah.

777
01:17:57,403 --> 01:17:59,132
I'll be goddamned.

778
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:02,397
Mama, I'm home.

779
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:11,044
I can't believe I'm doing this.

780
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:12,244
What?

781
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:15,849
Digging for treasure with you.

782
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,250
Jack?

783
01:18:20,426 --> 01:18:21,586
Yeah?

784
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:25,029
You're the best time
I've ever had.

785
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:31,135
Never been
anybody's best time before.

786
01:19:07,874 --> 01:19:09,034
It's a priceless statue.

787
01:19:15,148 --> 01:19:18,015
Somebody out there's got
a really sick sense of humor.

788
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,211
Wait a minute.

789
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:22,449
My first book,
''Treasures of Lust''...

790
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:24,649
I hid the treasure
inside the statue.

791
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:50,447
Jesus Christ,
we're in a lot of trouble.

792
01:19:52,318 --> 01:19:54,548
Understatement
of the year, asshole.

793
01:19:57,023 --> 01:19:59,617
Is there anybody
who isn't following you?

794
01:20:01,427 --> 01:20:03,452
Put the goods in the bag.

795
01:20:03,496 --> 01:20:04,656
Come on.

796
01:20:06,232 --> 01:20:07,494
Come on.

797
01:20:08,835 --> 01:20:11,167
Now move it,
before Batman comes home.

798
01:20:11,204 --> 01:20:14,173
It's time
I had a chauffeur, Miss Wilder.

799
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,506
Hey, back off me, creep!

800
01:20:17,543 --> 01:20:19,568
Oh, I'm the creep, huh?

801
01:20:19,612 --> 01:20:22,945
Well, at least I'm honest.
I'm stealing this stone.

802
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:25,212
I'm not trying to romance it
out from under her.

803
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:29,187
Wait a minute. Going for
the stone was my idea.

804
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:33,420
That's what the good
con artists want you to think.

805
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,053
He made you think
you needed it, you sap!

806
01:20:36,095 --> 01:20:39,394
Get in and drive!
Come on! Move it!

807
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:43,662
Move it!

808
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:46,668
See how you like being stuck--

809
01:20:47,607 --> 01:20:49,302
Holy shit!

810
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:54,269
Get in!

811
01:20:58,618 --> 01:20:59,983
Which way do we go?

812
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:01,577
Follow that stone!

813
01:21:18,671 --> 01:21:19,968
Mounties!

814
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:31,745
Hit it!

815
01:21:54,307 --> 01:21:55,535
Where the hell you going?

816
01:21:55,575 --> 01:21:56,974
Where am I going?

817
01:21:58,945 --> 01:22:00,970
How about Lupe's Escape?

818
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:24,232
Where you going? Quit steering.
You're not going anywhere.

819
01:22:30,977 --> 01:22:32,137
Oh, no!

820
01:22:35,448 --> 01:22:36,779
What are we gonna do now?

821
01:22:38,317 --> 01:22:39,716
Jump!

822
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:12,278
Hey!

823
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:16,216
Joan Wilder!
Hey! What a comeback!

824
01:23:16,255 --> 01:23:17,882
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

825
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:19,084
Yeah.

826
01:23:20,593 --> 01:23:23,790
-Man, I thought you drowned!
-I did!

827
01:23:25,364 --> 01:23:27,195
You OK?

828
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:30,202
Oh, sure. I'm great.

829
01:23:30,236 --> 01:23:33,933
I'm fine!
Only you're on that side!

830
01:23:34,774 --> 01:23:36,537
There's no way
across this sucker!

831
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,544
You did this on purpose!

832
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:41,809
What are you talking about?
We just went over a waterfall!

833
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:44,339
Admit it!
You planned this all along!

834
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:46,943
I knew
I couldn't depend on you!

835
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,688
What's the name
of that hotel in Cartagena?

836
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:56,854
Hotel Cartagena!
What do you care?

837
01:23:56,896 --> 01:24:00,024
All right. You just head
towards the sunset...

838
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:03,001
and you'll make it!
And I'll be there!

839
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:06,266
Oh, yeah, sure.
With El Corazon in your pocket.

840
01:24:06,305 --> 01:24:08,068
What about my sister?

841
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:12,737
They don't have to know
about this. You got the map!

842
01:24:12,778 --> 01:24:15,713
-Well, you've got the stone!
-Yeah, but--

843
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,353
I'll meet you there!
Trust me!

844
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,449
-What?
-I'll be there!

845
01:25:05,735 --> 01:25:07,828
So you made it finally.

846
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:10,596
Got the map?

847
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,438
Yes, I brought it.
I want to talk to Elaine.

848
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:17,344
No. You can't talk to her
till I get it.

849
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,405
All right,
now look out your window.

850
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,111
See the fort across the bay?
The tower?

851
01:25:23,152 --> 01:25:24,346
Yes.

852
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:27,982
You take a water taxi
right outside your hotel.

853
01:25:28,024 --> 01:25:31,255
You meet me there in two hours--

854
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,455
all by yourself.

855
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,103
Hello?

856
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:53,979
Has Jack Colton checked in?

857
01:25:54,016 --> 01:25:56,314
In the last two minutes, no.

858
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,057
Over here.

859
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:32,077
Stop right there.

860
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:35,083
Let me see the map.

861
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,744
Where are you?

862
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:38,617
Let me see the map.

863
01:27:39,789 --> 01:27:41,279
Let me see Elaine.

864
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:44,554
Joanie?

865
01:27:55,204 --> 01:27:57,297
Drop the map and back off.

866
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:09,217
If this isn't genuine...

867
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,779
If you've pulled a fast one...

868
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:36,007
Joan Wilder, you...

869
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:37,876
and your sister...

870
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:41,411
can go!

871
01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:47,680
Hey.

872
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:50,317
It's OK. It's all right.

873
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:51,451
Let's go home tonight.

874
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,869
I missed you at the hotel.

875
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:09,304
We all did.

876
01:29:19,889 --> 01:29:22,915
You brainless broad,
you let him follow you here.

877
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:24,949
Come on.

878
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:30,830
This map is nothing.

879
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,529
They already have the stone.

880
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:40,968
I had it in my hands, Ira.

881
01:29:42,178 --> 01:29:46,842
These hands that are gonna break
every bone in your body.

882
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:51,884
Later.

883
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:04,897
Where is it?

884
01:30:06,669 --> 01:30:08,034
I don't know.

885
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:10,530
Where is the stone?

886
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,240
I don't...

887
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,736
We dug.
We didn't find anything.

888
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:34,422
Traigala!

889
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,781
Crocodiles shed tears
while they eat their prey.

890
01:30:54,817 --> 01:30:57,479
You have heard of these tears,
I am sure.

891
01:30:57,519 --> 01:30:59,953
But have you seen them?

892
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:03,054
-Aah!
-Stop it!

893
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:21,335
Oh, no! No!

894
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:24,273
Look at those snappers.

895
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:28,476
You can forego this agony.

896
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:31,247
Simply tell me,
where is El Corazon?

897
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:33,016
Where is the heart?

898
01:31:33,055 --> 01:31:35,046
Where is the stone?

899
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:37,718
All right!
Just let her go, will you?

900
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,388
She doesn't know where it is.
I've got it.

901
01:31:40,429 --> 01:31:41,828
Where is it?

902
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:47,860
It's in a safe place.

903
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:49,302
Where is it?

904
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:55,303
Where is it?

905
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:38,912
Choke on it.

906
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,560
Thank you.

907
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:06,707
Get down!

908
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:25,266
All right, honey.
Come on.

909
01:33:48,424 --> 01:33:50,289
Hurry. Hurry.

910
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:55,922
Boys! Muchachos!

911
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:59,456
Bring the boat around!
Hold them down!

912
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:01,992
Let me get to the boat!

913
01:34:38,259 --> 01:34:40,193
Just a little more.
Come on.

914
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,642
Ira!

915
01:35:01,516 --> 01:35:03,279
Ira!

916
01:35:03,318 --> 01:35:04,945
Come back here, Ira!

917
01:35:04,986 --> 01:35:06,954
Jump, Ralph, jump!

918
01:35:06,988 --> 01:35:08,888
I can't swim.
You know that, Ira.

919
01:35:08,923 --> 01:35:12,120
-I'll come back for you!
-You promise?

920
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:14,720
I'll send the boat
back for you, Ralph!

921
01:35:14,762 --> 01:35:16,957
-When?
-Soon!

922
01:35:16,998 --> 01:35:20,525
-How soon?
-Very soon!

923
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,939
No.

924
01:35:26,975 --> 01:35:30,069
No! No!

925
01:35:34,716 --> 01:35:36,240
Where do you think
you're going, huh, pal?

926
01:35:36,284 --> 01:35:38,343
Come on, cough it up.

927
01:35:38,453 --> 01:35:40,318
Wait, wait!

928
01:35:45,326 --> 01:35:46,554
Joanie?

929
01:35:50,832 --> 01:35:53,665
How will you die, Joan Wilder?

930
01:35:53,701 --> 01:35:57,637
Slow like a snail...

931
01:35:58,506 --> 01:36:01,270
or fast like a shooting star?

932
01:36:05,547 --> 01:36:06,707
Oh, my.

933
01:36:54,696 --> 01:36:56,664
Come on, you bastard.
Give me a break.

934
01:36:57,966 --> 01:36:59,433
No!

935
01:37:01,803 --> 01:37:03,202
Jack!

936
01:37:05,873 --> 01:37:07,067
Damn it!

937
01:38:25,219 --> 01:38:26,811
Oh, Jack.

938
01:38:30,491 --> 01:38:32,959
It's OK. It's OK.

939
01:38:32,994 --> 01:38:34,859
Come on back, Ira!

940
01:38:34,896 --> 01:38:37,660
You're my cousin, Ira!
Don't you remember?

941
01:38:37,699 --> 01:38:39,599
Your mother, my mother!

942
01:38:42,303 --> 01:38:43,429
That way!

943
01:38:43,471 --> 01:38:45,200
That way! He's getting away!

944
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:48,106
He's got it all! Go that way!

945
01:38:48,142 --> 01:38:49,837
Joanie?

946
01:38:49,877 --> 01:38:51,606
OK. All right.
Here's what we got to do.

947
01:38:51,646 --> 01:38:54,513
Get to the American Consulate.
Just tell them everything.

948
01:38:54,549 --> 01:38:55,777
Where are you going?

949
01:38:55,817 --> 01:38:59,446
They might believe you,
but don't mention my name.

950
01:38:59,487 --> 01:39:01,455
Cartagena cops and l
go way back.

951
01:39:01,489 --> 01:39:02,956
Elaine, it's been a pleasure.

952
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:04,150
You're leaving?

953
01:39:05,193 --> 01:39:06,387
You're leaving me?

954
01:39:19,073 --> 01:39:22,531
You're gonna be all right,
Joan Wilder.

955
01:39:23,544 --> 01:39:24,772
Yeah.

956
01:39:40,595 --> 01:39:42,028
You always were.

957
01:39:51,639 --> 01:39:53,300
Jack Colton!

958
01:40:00,915 --> 01:40:02,109
Damn.

959
01:40:17,331 --> 01:40:19,265
Oh.

960
01:40:25,873 --> 01:40:29,274
Well, that is far and away
your best book.

961
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:32,143
I can't believe how fast
you cranked this out.

962
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:33,477
You really like it?

963
01:40:33,514 --> 01:40:37,006
Like it? Look at me.
I'm a mess. It made me cry.

964
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:39,246
You tell anybody,
I'll cut your heart out.

965
01:40:39,287 --> 01:40:42,450
I love the end where he dives
off the wall and swims away.

966
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:44,458
Then he meets her
at the airport.

967
01:40:44,492 --> 01:40:46,722
They sail off
around the world together.

968
01:40:47,495 --> 01:40:50,896
God, I can't believe
how this got to me.

969
01:40:50,932 --> 01:40:52,695
Well...

970
01:40:52,733 --> 01:40:54,598
I was, uh, inspired.

971
01:40:54,635 --> 01:40:59,265
Joanie, you are now
a world-class hopeless romantic.

972
01:40:59,307 --> 01:41:01,867
No. Hopeful.

973
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,038
Hopeful romantic.

974
01:41:13,955 --> 01:41:14,979
No, thank you.

975
01:41:15,022 --> 01:41:16,216
Nope.

976
01:41:16,257 --> 01:41:17,383
MAN: Name-brand. Name-brand.

977
01:41:17,425 --> 01:41:18,824
Never wear 'em.

978
01:41:20,895 --> 01:41:22,453
MAN: You can wear it
right now. Five dollars.

979
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,740
Hey!

980
01:42:07,408 --> 01:42:08,773
I like your boots.

981
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:11,801
Yep. That poor old
yellow-tailed guy...

982
01:42:11,846 --> 01:42:14,576
developed a fatal case
of indigestion.

983
01:42:14,615 --> 01:42:16,014
Died right in my arms.

984
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:18,642
I can't blame him.

985
01:42:18,686 --> 01:42:19,812
If I were to die...

986
01:42:19,854 --> 01:42:21,515
there's nowhere else on earth
I'd rather be.

987
01:42:21,555 --> 01:42:23,921
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

988
01:42:25,159 --> 01:42:26,456
I even read one of your books.

989
01:42:27,695 --> 01:42:29,094
Then you know how they all end.

990
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,654
Yeah.

991
01:42:30,698 --> 01:42:32,359
-Hi.
-Hi.
