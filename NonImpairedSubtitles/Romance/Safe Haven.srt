Uh... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be snooping. Um...

162
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,440
I wish I had a good excuse,
but it's just idle curiosity.

I've had out here in ages.

Yeah, my Realtor said
I didn't have close neighbors.

- Katie.
- Nice to meet you. Um...

168
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,564
Look, I moved out here
same reason as you, I think.

169
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,530
To get some peace and quiet,
so I get it if you just...

170

Yeah, I like the fact
that I can hear myself think.

Yes, thank you.

from all that noise and that chatter?

deafening sometimes, so it is...

as rustically inclined as I am.

175
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,406

- All right, well, it was nice to meet you.

- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah? Oh, good.

What you got there?

Oh, the little girl from the general store,
she drew it for me.

- I think it's the store owner's daughter.
- Oh.

It's a flying fish, right?

It's not gonna rain.
