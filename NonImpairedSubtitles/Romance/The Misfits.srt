1
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,349
Young man, do you have the time?
l got six clocks, and none of them work.

2
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,472
- Twenty after nine.
- After?

3
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,831
lt's twenty after, dear. Darlin'?

4
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,750
- Five minutes. What about you?
- l'm all set. l just ironed my sling.

5
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,556
- The lawyer said 9.30 sharp, darlin'.
- OK.

6
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,953
l hope you're not the miserly kind.
lt's brand-new.

7
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,958
She ought to get a very good price for it.

8
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,674
ls that the right mileage? 23 miles?

9
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,951
We only took two rides in it.
lt's the darn men.

10
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,753
They run into her
just to start a conversation.

11
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
- Will you come up, lz?
- Sure, dear.

12
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,915
Don't go by appearances. lt's brand-new.

13
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,713
lt was a divorce present
from her husband.

14
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,559
- They givin' presents for divorces now?
- Why not?

15
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,116
On the anniversary of our divorce,
my husband always sends me...

16
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,711
..one potted yellow rose,
and it'll be 19 years in July.

17
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,199
Course, he never did pay me the alimony.

18
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,393
But l wouldn't wanna put a man out,
you know, if his heart's not in it.

19
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,875
You break your arm in the car?

20
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,155
No. My last roomer, the one before Mrs
Taber, we celebrated her divorce and...

21
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,720
..l misbehaved.

22
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,798
l'm so sick and tired of myself.

23
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,595
(reciting in a whisper)

24
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,869
- Will you go over my answers again?
- Sure, dear.

25
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,878
But don't worry, you'll do wonderfully.

26
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,788
Let's see. ''Did your husband,
Mr Raymond Taber,...

27
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,275
..act toward you with cruelty?''

28
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,030
Darlin'?

29
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,833
- Well, yes.
- Just say yes.

30
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,393
Yes.

31
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,195
''ln what way did this cruelty
manifest itself?''

32
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,518
He persistently... How does that go again?

33
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,079
''He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights,...

34
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,876
..and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me.''

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,309
He persistently...

36
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Oh, do l have to say that?

37
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,396
Why can't l just say he wasn't there? He...
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.

38
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,750
lf that was grounds for divorce,...

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,749
..there'd only be about 1 1 marriages
left in the US. Now just repeat after me.

40
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,634
- ''He persistently...
- He persistently...

41
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,716
(car horn)

42
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,550
They'll call in their estimate, ma'am.

43
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,638
Those dents aren't my fault, you know.

44
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,636
l'll recommend
the best price l can, ma'am.

45
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,513
You can drive her now.
l've put in a new battery.

46
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,632
l'll never drive that car again.
Let's take a taxi.

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,832
l... l'll give you a lift
if you're leaving right away.

48
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,916
Swell. Two minutes.

49
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,873
lz, get dressed! You gotta be my witness.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,596
This'll be my 77th time
l've witnessed for a divorce.

51
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,234
Two sevens - that's lucky, darlin'!

52
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,629
Oh, lz, l hope.

53
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,999
- Easy does it, now.
- Oh, you're a dear.

54
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,112
- Here we are.
- Thanks a lot. We've gotta go now.

55
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,472
lf you're not goin' back East right away,
l'd be glad to show you the county.

56
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,398
Beautiful country around here, you know.

57
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,637
Well, l don't know where l'll be, but OK.
Thanks again.

58
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,399
My name is lsabelle Steers.

59
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,432
lsabelle. Well, OK, you come along too.

60
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,953
That's a sweet afterthought!
You Reno men!

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,075
l can't memorise this.
lt's not the way it was.

62
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,910
Just say it. lt doesn't have to be true.
This isn't a quiz show, it's only a court.

63
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,999
- l just got off the plane...
- l don't wanna hear anything.

64
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,998
Just give me five minutes.
After two years, five minutes...

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,475
You can't have me now,
so you want me, that's all.

66
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,232
Please, l'm not blaming you. lt's... l just
don't believe in the whole thing any more.

67
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,828
Kid, l understand. l understand...

68
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,077
You don't understand.
You're not there, Raymond.

69
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,998
lf l'm gonna be alone,
l wanna be by myself.

70
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,432
Go back. You're not gonna make me
feel sorry for you any more.

71
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,637
Gay!

72
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,433
Wait up! l was just goin' over to see ya!

73
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,634
Well, good luck now, Susan.
l won't forget you, you can be sure of that.

74
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,553
- l don't even know where to write you.
- General delivery. l'll get it.

75
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,275
Will you think about it? lt's the
second-largest laundry in St Louis.

76
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,312
l wouldn't wanna kid you.
l ain't cut out for business.

77
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,273
Well, will you think of me? Oh, Gay...

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,790
Oh, you know l will, honey. Goodbye.

79
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,596
Bye.

80
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,756
How're you doin', boy?
Ready to cut out of this town? Cos l am.

81
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,440
Well, l've been thinkin' about it.

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,712
- Which one was that?
- Susan. Swell sport, that woman.

83
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,588
l just met me a girl sweet enough to eat,
Gay. Fine-lookin' woman.

84
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,633
But when l think of all the useless talkin'
you gotta do, l get discouraged.

85
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,992
l tell you, l'm dyin' for some fresh air.
And no people, male or female.

86
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,352
Why don't we take out to the mountains?
We could even do a little mustangin'.

87
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,994
l wanted to pile up about 500 this time.

88
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,953
- l need a new engine.
- That engine'll fly you anywhere.

89
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,117
Say, you've been two months on this job.
You'll get the habit.

90
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,119
l'll see you over at Harrah's later.
Let's talk about it.

91
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,154
Tom Dooley.

92
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,918
lf you throw in your ring
you'll never get another divorce.

93
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,156
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.

94
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,353
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.

95
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,834
- Did you do that?
- Who, me? No.

96
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,758
l lost my ring on my honeymoon.

97
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,949
- Let's get a drink.
- That's my girl.

98
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,833
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.

99
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,949
Never say die.

100
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,992
Scotch, l guess, on i... Yeah, on ice.

101
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,953
- Rye and water.
- Scotch on ice, rye and water.

102
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,156
Well, cheer up.

103
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,910
l will. l just hate to fight with anybody.

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,191
When you win, you lose.
You know, in your heart.

105
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,711
Well, you're free. Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.

106
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,674
No, the trouble is l always
end up back where l started.

107
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,156
Never had anybody much. And here l am.

108
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,992
Well, you had your mother, didn't you?

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,913
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?

110
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,239
They both weren't there. She'd go off
with a patient for three months and...

111
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,997
You know how long
three months is to a kid.

112
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,390
Listen, don't leave. Settle here.

113
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,189
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.

114
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,189
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.

115
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,439
Oh, l'm sorry. What did l say? l...

116
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,951
l suddenly miss my mother.
Oh, isn't that the stupidest thing?

117
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,794
lz, you're a fine woman. Practically the
only woman that's ever been my friend.

118
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,115
Well, drink up then.

119
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,477
Oh, isn't that the dearest dog?
Look how sweet he sits there.

120
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,478
Yeah. Dogs are nice.

121
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,795
Here. Puppy.

122
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,435
Hey, Dooley.

123
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
Hello. How'd you make out?

124
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,876
OK.

125
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,591
l'd like you to meet
a friend of mine. Gay...

126
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,555
Gay Langland, Mrs Taber.

127
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,554
- Howdy do?
- And this is Mrs, uh...?

128
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,118
Steers. lsabelle Steers. One thing about
Reno men, they do remember the name.

129
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,394
- Why don't you boys sit down?
- Thank you. What're you girls drinkin'?

130
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,956
Whiskey. We're celebratin'
the jail burned down.

131
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,833
Mary, see if you can get
four doubles, will you?

132
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,599
Uh... you sure made a big impression
on my friend here. And l can see why.

133
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,235
- You a mechanic too?
- Him? He's a cowboy.

134
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,397
- How'd you know?
- l can smell, can't l?

135
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,310
- Hey, you can't smell cows on me.
- l smell the look on your face, cowboy.

136
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,477
But l love every miserable one of ya.

137
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,194
Course, you're all good for nothin',
as you know.

138
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,278
That may be. But it's better than wages.

139
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,358
l suppose you'll be headin'
back East soon, Mrs Taber?

140
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,233
l can't make up my mind.
l don't know yet what to do.

141
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,238
You don't have a business to run,
or a school to teach, or...?

142
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,954
Me? l never finished high school.

143
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,548
Well! That's real good news.

144
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,152
- You don't like educated women?
- They're all right.

145
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,477
Always wantin' to know
what you're thinkin', that's all.

146
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,556
Maybe they want to get to know you.

147
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,117
Did you ever get to know a man better
by askin' him questions?

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,594
- You mean he'd lie?
- Well, he might not.

149
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,188
And then again, he just might.

150
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,519
How about it, Pilot?
We takin' off today?

151
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,234
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs Taber?

152
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,670
l walked to the edge of town.
Doesn't look like much is out there.

153
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,791
Everything's there.

154
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,559
- Like what?
- The country.

155
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,468
- Well, what do you do with yourself?
- Just live.

156
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,635
- How do you just live?
- Well, you start by goin' to sleep.

157
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,514
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself. You fry some eggs.

158
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,509
You see what kind of a day it is.
You throw stones at a can and whistle.

159
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,831
l know what you mean.

160
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,077
l have an empty house in the country
just beyond Hawleyville.

161
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,239
lt's all yours if you want some
peace and quiet before you go back.

162
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,635
The last woman's gone?

163
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,957
No kiddin'. l never offered it before.

164
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,553
Well, l wouldn't stay there. But let's rent
a car. We could look at the country.

165
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,195
- Gay has a truck. You can have my car.
- Then you'll have to drive me back.

166
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,791
- l don't mind.
- Thanks, but l like to feel l'm on my own.

167
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,992
- l'll rent a car. Where can l?
- Right now?

168
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,193
- Why not?
- OK. You sure don't waste time, do you?

169
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,920
l just gotta stop by the garage and quit.

170
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,349
Hey, now, that's the boy.

171
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,394
No, Gay. This is mine.

172
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,713
Mm. What is that beautiful smell?
Smells like green perfume.

173
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,479
- That's sage, darlin'.
- Oh, sure!

174
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,593
l never smelled it except in bottles.
Gee, it's beautiful here.

175
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,669
Look, dear girl, l think l better
tell you somethin' about cowboys.

176
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,998
- You really worry about me, don't you?
- Well, you're too believin'.

177
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,429
Cowboys are the last real men left,...

178
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,189
..and they're about as reliable
as jack rabbits.

179
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,515
ls anybody any different?

180
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,792
Maybe you're not supposed to believe
people. Maybe it's not even fair to them.

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,518
l couldn't hear what he said to her, but
it looked like she left him. The husband.

182
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,828
She's kinda hard to figure out, you know?

183
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,476
One minute she looks kinda dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,...

184
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,160
..and the next minute...

185
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,796
- She sure moves, though, don't she?
- Mm. She's real prime.

186
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,508
- lt isn't finished yet.
- lt's weathertight. Come on in.

187
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,870
lt's insulated.

188
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,750
Flush doors.

189
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,396
This is the living room.

190
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,876
And this was gonna be another bedroom.

191
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,474
lt's even nicer this way.

192
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,195
Here's a picture window.
Take a look at this view.

193
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,912
- Take a look at that.
- Gee. lt goes on for ever.

194
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,435
Fireplace.

195
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,708
- Brick.
- This is the kitchen.

196
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
- Gas refrigerator.
- lt's nice.

197
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,672
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.

198
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,672
Here's our... This was our bedroom.

199
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,435
My wife. She died here.

200
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,116
l'm... sorry.

201
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,119
She was due to have a baby. l was up
setting the capstone on the chimney...

202
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,390
..and she screamed...

203
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,436
..and that was that.

204
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,995
Couldn't you call a doctor?

205
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,956
She didn't seem to be that sick.
Then l got a flat. l didn't have a spare.

206
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,153
Everything just happened wrong.
lt'll do that sometimes.

207
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,356
Yeah, l know.

208
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,631
Uh, you couldn't live here any more, huh?

209
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,350
We knew each other
since we were seven years old, see?

210
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,713
You ought to find yourself another girl.

211
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,595
l don't know. Me with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?

212
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,475
She wasn't like any other women.

213
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,752
Stood behind me 100 per cent,
uncomplaining as a tree.

214
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,394
Maybe that's what killed her.

215
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,354
l mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes maybe.

216
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,358
Hey, lz, isn't this a beautiful place here?

217
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,917
Yeah. lt'd be just perfect if somebody'd
bring in that bottle of whiskey l bought.

218
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,235
- With my own money.
- Hey, that's right!

219
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,750
And bring that bag of groceries.
Maybe somebody wants a sandwich.

220
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,317
The glasses are in the kitchen, lsabelle.
l'm real tired.

221
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,556
No, you're just a cowboy, darlin'.

222
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,468
You fellas won't move
unless it's rainin' down your necks.

223
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,434
Too rough for you, Roslyn?

224
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,315
l don't mind that.

225
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,877
You should've seen his wife. She helped
pour cement and knocked in nails.

226
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,560
She was a real good sport.

227
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,476
Now she's dead because
he didn't have a spare tyre.

228
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,114
Well, that's the way it goes.

229
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,915
lt goes the other way too, though.
Don't forget that.

230
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,191
lt's sure nice to see people in here.
Come on, let's have a drink.

231
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,348
- l'll start the fridge. lt makes ice quick.
- lce? We gonna stay that long, Roslyn?

232
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,472
- l don't know.
- Oh, sure. Come on.

233
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,469
There's no better place to be. And you
couldn't find better company, either.

234
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,068
- All right.
- That's it, sport.

235
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,875
Turn on that ice, Guido. Let's get this stuff
a-flowin', make the desert bloom.

236
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,275
Well, flow it slow. We only got one bottle.

237
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,836
There. Put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.

238
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,033
Come on, sit down, everybody.
Let's get comfortable.

239
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,356
- l'm sure glad you like this place.
- Here's to Nevada, the ''leave it'' state.

240
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,630
- The what state?
- The ''leave it'' state.

241
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,228
You got money to gamble, leave it here.

242
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,794
A wife you wanna get rid of,
get rid of her here.

243
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,277
Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it
up here. Nobody will mind in the slightest.

244
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,871
The slogan of Nevada is ''Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went.''

245
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,230
- That's no lie.
- l even left my Southern accent here.

246
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,956
How come you never went back home?
You came here for a divorce, didn't you?

247
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,833
- l wasn't beautiful enough to go back.
- Oh, lsabelle.

248
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,432
No, that's true. Beauty's a help any place,
but in Virginia it's a necessity.

249
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,358
Why, you can't hardly
get a driver's licence without it.

250
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,156
No, l love Nevada. You know, they don't
even have regular meal times here.

251
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,033
Never met so many people
didn't own a watch.

252
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,711
Might have two wives at the same time,
but no watch. Bless them all.

253
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,149
How quiet it is here.

254
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,555
Sweetest sound there is.

255
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,708
There's an lndian store about five miles,
if you wanna shop. Groceries, everything.

256
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,115
lf you wanna stay, that is.

257
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,630
Be glad to come by
and do your chores, if you like.

258
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,788
You know, he reminds me of that
cowboy friend l told you about.

259
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,071
Had one arm gone, but he was
more man with one arm...

260
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,395
..than any other man is with two.

261
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,873
Oh?

262
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,197
- l mean like cookin'.
- Oh!

263
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,630
No, l'm serious. He could take
a panful of chops, toss 'em,...

264
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,955
..and they all came down
on the other side.

265
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,835
- Who is he? Maybe they know him.
- Darlin', you can't go lookin' for a man.

266
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,077
- What, did he take off?
- No, not exactly.

267
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,554
He just never came back.

268
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,629
- Andy Powell. You ever...?
- Sure! Called Andy Gump sometimes?

269
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,716
That's him.

270
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,276
- You know where he is?
- Saw him at the rodeo only last month.

271
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,155
- Maybe we could find him.
- Stop thinkin' you can change things.

272
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,995
But if there's something you can do...

273
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,476
l don't know what to do,
but if l knew, l'd do it.

274
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,472
Have you got a radio or a phonograph?
Maybe we'll have some music.

275
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,956
- There's no electricity.
- The car radio.

276
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,437
- Now who'd have thought of that?
- You always get an idea, don't you?

277
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,790
l'll go bring the car round.

278
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,909
Say, how about another drink
to keep that first one warm?

279
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,555
- l'd love it.
- l'm gonna make myself a sandwich.

280
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,194
- How about you folks?
- OK.

281
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,272
l hope you're gonna stay on here.
Any chance?

282
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,595
Why? What difference would it make?

283
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,190
Might make all the difference in the world
as time goes by.

284
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,356
( dance music)

285
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,199
- Like to dance?
- OK.

286
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,871
Thanks. lz, give him another drink.
lt's a wonderful house, Guido.

287
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,753
Hey, that's pretty good dancin', cowboy.

288
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,276
What are you doin'?

289
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,109
She used to teach dancin'.
You know? Before she was married.

290
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,630
- No kiddin'? ln a dance hall?
- Uh-huh.

291
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,592
How about the landlord?
Move over, boy, huh?

292
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,759
- Watch out for those pretty little feet.
- She knows how to get out of the way.

293
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,836
Let's go.

294
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,958
Where'd you learn that, Pilot?

295
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,790
l never knew him to dance at all.

296
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,314
Look at old Pilot comin' out
from under a bushel!

297
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,478
Hey, you two ought to put on a show!

298
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,038
(music ends, new piece begins)

299
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,995
Come on, honey. This is a good one.
l haven't danced like this in years.

300
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,314
- Didn't your wife dance?
- Not like you. She had no gracefulness.

301
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,193
Why didn't you teach her to be graceful?

302
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,834
You can't learn that.

303
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,555
How do you know?
l mean, how do you know?

304
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,719
You see, she died, and she didn't
know how you can dance.

305
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,435
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.

306
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,075
- l don't feel like discussing my wife.
- Don't be mad.

307
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,749
l only meant that if you loved her
you could've taught her anything.

308
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,475
Because... we're all dying, aren't we?

309
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,354
All the husbands and all the wives.
Every minute.

310
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,352
And we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?

311
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,869
 Dum da-da... dum...

312
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,468
Guido, you're a nice man.

313
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,516
Smile.

314
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,356
Come on.

315
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,276
(drunken laughter)

316
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,713
- Come on, lz.
- l'm lookin' for your shoes, dear girl.

317
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,829
(Gay) Watch out. There's no step!

318
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,315
We better get you home, girl.

319
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,994
You were worried about me. How sweet.

320
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,957
Just wanna keep you
all in one pretty piece.

321
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,195
Would you have had a spare tyre?

322
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,914
(lz) Somebody'd better drive her.

323
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,909
Go ahead. l'll take the truck.

324
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,793
Oh, lz, don't leave poor Guido alone.

325
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,875
Tom Dooley!

326
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,475
You're a real beautiful woman.

327
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,030
lt's almost kind of an honour
sittin' next to you.

328
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,676
You just shine in my eyes.
That's my true feelin', Roslyn.

329
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,515
What makes you so sad? l think
you're the saddest girl l ever met.

330
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,759
You're the first man that ever said that.
l'm usually told how happy l am.

331
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,270
That's because you make
a man feel happy.

332
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,473
l don't feel that way about you, Gay.

333
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,835
Well, don't get discouraged, girl.
You might.

334
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,435
Look, why don't you try it out here
for a while, see what happens?

335
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,472
You know, sometimes when
a person don't know what to do,...

336
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,956
..the best thing is to just stand still.

337
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,597
l'll guarantee you'll have something out
here you wouldn't find on every corner.

338
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,590
l, uh... l may not amount to much
in some ways, but l am a good friend.

339
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,356
Thanks.

340
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,873
Let me take you back and get your things.
Try it for a while, see what happens.

341
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,718
Ever hear the story
about the city man out in the country?

342
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,992
He sees this fella sittin' on his porch,
so he says ''Mister,...

343
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,035
..could you tell me how l can get back
to town?'' The fella says ''No.''

344
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,280
''Well, could you tell me how to get
to the post office?'' The fella says ''No.''

345
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,439
''Well, do you know how to get
to the railroad station?'' ''No.''

346
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,757
''Boy,'' he says, ''you sure
don't know much, do you?''

347
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,599
The fella says ''Nope. But l ain't lost.''

348
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,190
Don't you have a home?

349
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,710
Sure. Never was a better one, either.

350
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,789
Where is it?

351
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,156
Right here.

352
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,237
Come on. l got a surprise for you.

353
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,714
You cooked breakfast. Here, let me.

354
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,118
No, no, no. You sit down
and enjoy yourself. Just this once.

355
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,395
- You do this often?
- Uh-uh. First time for me.

356
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,318
- Really and truly?
- Mm-hm.

357
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,475
Mm. Smells delicious.

358
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,069
Hey, you really go all out, don't you?

359
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,751
Even the way you eat. l like that.
Women generally pick.

360
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,836
You like me, huh?

361
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,871
(birdsong)

362
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,710
Birds must be brave to live out here.
At night especially.

363
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,991
- Whereas they're so small, you know?
- Mm-hm.

364
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,118
- You think l'm crazy.
- l look that way cos l can't make you out.

365
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,913
- Why?
- l don't know.

366
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,554
You got children?

367
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,318
- l never wanted children with him.
- Oh.

368
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,269
Children are supposed to bring you
together. But what if they don't?

369
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,914
l've known of so-called
happily married couples.

370
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,591
One time, the wife was in the hospital
to have the baby...

371
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,518
..and the husband was calling me up.

372
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,631
l mean, he was calling me.

373
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,712
They're still supposed
to be happily married.

374
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,354
l guess you believe in true love,
don't you?

375
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,075
l don't know, but they ought to invent
a way that you don't have children...

376
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,476
..unless you care for each other,
cos kids know the difference.

377
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,716
l always knew the difference.

378
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,753
Listen, if you wanna go somewhere,
l don't mind being alone.

379
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,352
- Do l look like l wanna leave?
- l just want you to do what you feel like.

380
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,600
You ain't kiddin'. Even when
you're kiddin', you ain't kiddin'.

381
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,154
No. lt makes me feel peaceful.

382
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,148
You know, they come out here
from New York, Chicago, St Louis,...

383
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,875
..and find them a cowboy. Cowboys
are supposed to be dumb, you know.

384
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,798
So they tell 'em everything.
And they do everything.

385
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,673
Everything they couldn't do back home.

386
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,075
- lt's pitiful.
- Why is it pitiful?

387
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,398
Cowboy's laughin' at 'em,
and they don't even know it.

388
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,433
lt's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.

389
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,233
Did you ever think
of getting married again?

390
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,150
Yeah. l've thought about it a lot of times.
But never in daylight.

391
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,031
- You get lonesome for your children?
- Oh, l see 'em now and then.

392
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,517
They come whenever l'm in a rodeo.
l'm a pretty good roper.

393
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,114
l get lonesome, sure.

394
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,519
My daughter is almost your size.
Uh... You size 1 2?

395
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,995
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. So is she.

396
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,476
l bought her a dress for Christmas.
Size 1 2.

397
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,278
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?

398
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,996
Well, l come home one night and
she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella.

399
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,318
Turned out to be an old friend.
A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact.

400
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,193
Oh. You never had any idea, huh?

401
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,871
No. You know, in those days
l thought you got married and that was it.

402
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,753
But nothin' is it. Not for ever.

403
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,195
That's what l can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.

404
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,118
l'll tell you this, though. l wouldn't know
how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn.

405
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,999
lt surprises me.

406
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,552
There's a lot to be done around this place.
lf we were gonna stay awhile.

407
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,433
Let's go out in the sunshine. Come on.

408
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,468
Let's just live like you said in the bar.
l don't know where l am yet.

409
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,639
Hey! Couldn't we use that for a step?

410
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,389
Well, we just might at that.

411
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,198
- There you are.
- Let me try it.

412
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,915
lt's perfect. l can go in...
and l can come out.

413
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,278
Go in... and l can come out.

414
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,751
Go in...

415
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,030
..and l can come out.

416
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,790
l can go in...

417
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,115
..and l can come out.

418
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,476
(airplane)

419
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,350
Guido!

420
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,038
- What's he doing?
- Might land. There's a place back there.

421
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,997
Nah. l guess he's just sayin' hello.

422
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,237
- Here, have some lemonade.
- Oh, thanks.

423
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,631
- What does he do? Just fly around?
- Could be goin' for eagles.

424
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,115
Now and again ranchers
hire Guido to shoot eagles.

425
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,516
- Why?
- Well, they kill a lot of lambs.

426
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,074
He gets $50 a bird.

427
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,278
l never really saw anything grow before.

428
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,236
How tiny those seeds were. And yet they
know they're supposed to be lettuces.

429
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,955
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don't you?

430
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,675
Everybody's busy in Chicago,
and here we are.

431
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,116
l love this whole state!

432
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,714
Hey... What have we here now?

433
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,475
Well... Just plain old rabbit!

434
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,309
l'm gonna get him.

435
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,159
lt's just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it any more.

436
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,229
No, ma'am! lt's them or us! There won't
be a thing left inside of a week.

437
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,035
Couldn't you wait and see?
l can't stand to see anything killed.

438
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,438
- Honey, it's only a rabbit.
- But it doesn't know any better, does it?

439
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,676
Go on inside and let me handle this.

440
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,439
- l know you worked hard...
- You're darn right!

441
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,155
And l didn't do it
for some bug-eyed rabbit.

442
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,636
- Gay, please.
- Honey, will you go on inside now?

443
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,230
- And stop bein' silly?
- l'm not being silly.

444
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,555
You don't respect what l feel.

445
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,717
- And l don't care about the lettuce!
- l care about it!

446
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,718
And how about havin'
some respect for me?

447
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,790
Oh, Guido and lsabelle!

448
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,876
- Guido!
- Dear girl!

449
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,515
l thought l saw a passenger!
We never heard you land.

450
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,713
- My, you look thrivin'.
- Boy, am l in the right place?

451
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,355
Seen the vegetable garden?
Took Gay a week just to turn the soil.

452
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,789
Mowed the grass
and put in them flowers too.

453
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,753
l got your windows unstuck.
Fireplace don't smoke now.

454
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,079
You must be a magician. All he ever did
for a woman was get out the ice cubes.

455
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,397
- Look, we have chairs. Come and sit.
- Let's show him the inside.

456
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,196
You know, l've moved this furniture
so many times, l'm gettin' long ears!

457
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,833
My, you look lovely. You've really
found yourself, haven't you?

458
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,158
Well, l... Oh, it's so nice to see you,
lsabelle. Look, we have a step.

459
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,750
- How's your arm?
- Well, it's still as weak as a bird's wing.

460
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,077
Well, l never saw anything like it
in my life. lt's magical.

461
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,829
Just hope you realise you finally
made contact with a real woman.

462
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,996
My dear girl!

463
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,148
Come, Guido. l wanna show you the rest.
l've changed a few things, though.

464
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,474
We've changed things around.

465
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,195
How do you like it?

466
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,355
Oh, don't look at those.
Gay just hung 'em up for a joke.

467
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,358
l put your picture up in the living room.

468
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,877
Come on, let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.

469
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,829
Oh, it's so nice to have company.

470
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,432
- l put your picture there. ls that all right?
- You don't have to keep it out.

471
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,712
Why, Guido, it's part of the house.
Besides, it's your house.

472
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,957
Oh, sit in the big chair.
This must've been your chair.

473
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,071
Matter of fact, it was.

474
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,873
lsabelle. Put this under your arm.

475
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,956
Thanks, dear girl.

476
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,828
l used to do all my studyin' in this chair.
When l was still ambitious.

477
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,712
What did you study?

478
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,877
l was on my way to bein' a doctor.
Before the war.

479
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,515
Well, you never can tell.
Maybe you'll get ambitious again.

480
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,393
l'm gonna tell you somethin', Roslyn.

481
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,150
l spent four years in the war.
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.

482
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,553
Every time l came back to base
l started to design this house.

483
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,355
But somehow l could never
get it to look like my idea of it.

484
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,274
Now it almost does.

485
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,039
You just walk in,
a stranger out of nowhere,...

486
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,118
..and for the first time it all lights up.

487
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,709
And l'm sure you know why too.

488
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,155
- Why?
- Because you have the gift for life.

489
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,270
The rest of us, we're just lookin' for
a place to hide and watch it all go by.

490
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,356
Amen.

491
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,159
Here's to your life, Roslyn.
l hope it goes on for ever.

492
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,748
And yours. And yours, lsabelle.

493
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,070
And Gay. Gay did all the work, you know.

494
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,273
Yeah. And the rabbits
are sure enjoyin' it too.

495
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,269
Can you break away from this paradise
long enough to do a little mustangin'?

496
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,712
Mustangin'? Now you're sayin' somethin'.
You been up in the mountains?

497
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,591
Took a quick look earlier this mornin'.
l spotted 1 5 horses.

498
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,950
That's not too bad.

499
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,030
Boy, l'd sure like
to get my hands on a rope again.

500
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,192
- What do you say?
- (lz) l will never understand cowboys.

501
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,710
All crazy about animals, and
the minute they got nothin' else to do,...

502
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,196
..they run up in the mountains
and bother those poor wild horses.

503
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,515
Shame on you!

504
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,551
Horses?

505
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,639
Sure. Nevada mustang. Used
to ship 'em all over the United States.

506
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,514
Not many left.
We'd have to pick up another man.

507
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,235
Dayton Rodeo's on today. We ought
to be able to pick up a fella there.

508
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,750
That's an idea.
Hey, you never saw a rodeo.

509
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,871
(lz) Oh, you gotta see a rodeo!

510
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,037
- l'd love to. Will you come too?
- l'm all set.

511
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,474
- l'll get dressed up. Let's have some fun!
- That's a girl. Go right now.

512
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,718
Honey, when you smile
it's like the sun comin' up.

513
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,237
Boy, l'd like to have stopped off home
and get cleaned up.

514
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,954
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?

515
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,473
- Lots better than some l've known.
- You're a mass of compliments, lsabelle.

516
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,354
Hey, Gay, stop. That guy next
to the phone booth. What's his name?

517
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,950
- You worked the Stinson Rodeo with him.
- Perce Howland?

518
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,913
Gay Langland! You old buzzard, you!

519
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,919
What are you doin' sittin' out here, fella?

520
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,634
Well, l hitched a ride
down to the Dayton Rodeo,...

521
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,991
..but this fella changed his mind
and just left me settin' here.

522
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,236
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.

523
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,557
Well, old Gay's sure comin' up
in the world. How do, ma'am?

524
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,716
- This is lsabelle.
- (phone rings)

525
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,992
Oh, 'scuse me. l got a call in for home,
but they keep puttin' me in to Wyoming.

526
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,156
Hello?

527
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,430
Hello?

528
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,915
Hello, Ma? This is Perce.

529
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,070
Yeah, l'm OK.

530
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,953
No. l was in Colorado. l'm in Nevada now.

531
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,835
Just won me a bull ride.

532
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,356
Yeah.

533
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,873
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.

534
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,309
A hundred dollars.

535
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,355
Ma, l was gonna buy you
a birthday present with it,...

536
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,153
..but l was comin' out of my boots.

537
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,272
No, Ma, l haven't been in hospital since
l talked to you. l just bought some boots.

538
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,955
Ma, what would l wanna get married for?
l just bought me...

539
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,352
Hey, you know what? On top of purse
money, l won me a nice silver buckle.

540
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,508
Yeah. Got a buckin' horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.

541
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,108
You proud?

542
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,358
Oh, no, no. My face is fine. lt's all
healed up. lt's just as good as new.

543
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,998
You would too recognise me.

544
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,511
Oh, OK, operator. Ma, listen.
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?

545
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,155
And to Victoria.
Yeah, and to Uncle George.

546
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,314
OK, say hello to him too.

547
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,194
No, no, Ma. lt just
slipped my mind, that's all.

548
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,959
Well, OK, l'm sayin' it now.

549
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,788
Ma, you married him, l didn't.
So say hello to him.

550
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,831
Oh, is that...? Listen, maybe
l'll call you at Christmas time.

551
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,558
OK.

552
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,035
Hello? Hello?

553
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,875
God bless you too.

554
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,069
l just know you'll take me to that rodeo.

555
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,236
Sure. You entered?

556
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,909
Well, l aim to be,
if l can get me a ride to town.

557
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,350
And, uh, if l can raise $10
for the entrance.

558
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,315
But l just spent my last $2 in that phone
booth. Boy, l'm real equipped, ain't l?

559
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,956
Say, how'd you like to do some
mustangin'? We need a third man.

560
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,435
You still fly that DC-6 and seven eighths?

561
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,869
lt's a lot safer than buckin' horses.

562
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,675
- There are still mustangs around here?
- l spotted 1 5 this morning.

563
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,917
- There might be a lot more, though.
- Well, l don't know.

564
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,634
What do you expect to get out of it?
Of 1 5 horses?

565
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,593
l mean, like, if there was
a thousand or more...

566
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,633
But goin' all the way up there for 1 5,
it kinda hits me sideways.

567
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,389
- Better than wages, ain't it?
- Oh, anything's better than wages.

568
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,559
l tell you what. We'll drive you to
the rodeo, put up the ten for the entrance.

569
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,672
You come along tomorrow
and help us run some mustang.

570
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,920
All right. You get me a good bottle of
whiskey to keep me primed for the rodeo.

571
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,395
Just wait right here.

572
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,591
You, uh... you an old friend of Gay's?

573
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,716
Pretty old.

574
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,516
l broke my arm twice -
no, three times, in the same place.

575
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,279
And you don't do that fakin' a fall.

576
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,630
You know what some of these riders do?

577
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,070
They just drop off and lay there
like they was stone-dead.

578
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,034
Not me, boy. l don't fake nothin'.
Right, Gay?

579
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,550
That's right.
You're just a natural-born fool.

580
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,592
lt's wonderful to be that way.
l know what you mean.

581
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,757
l used to dance in places,
and everybody thought l was crazy.

582
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,872
l mean, l really tried.
People don't know the difference.

583
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,790
- Oh, she'd try. l can just see her tryin'.
- What kind of dancin' do you do?

584
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,799
Oh, interpretive dancing.
You know, nightclubs and... That's all.

585
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,835
l was in a nightclub once
in Kansas City called The Naked Truth.

586
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,069
And they wasn't kiddin'!

587
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,035

A-ha-ha!

632
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,669
One hundred... One hundred
and forty-five bucks!

633
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,156
- Hello, gold mine.

l'd marry you.

635
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,389
Thanks for saying it,
but you don't have to do that.

636
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,991
Don't shake that thing at me!
l'm still payin' for this broken arm.

637
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,270
Charles!

638
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,514
lt's in the middle of your pretty eyes.
You're looking for the light, sinner.

639
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,791
l know you, and l love you
for your life of pain and sin.

640
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,799
Give it to the only one
who loves you in your lonely desert.

641
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,311
- She ain't sinned that much.
- We're going to fence off the graveyard.

642
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,671
Keep these cowboys from pasturing
their horses on the graves.

643
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,750
Sweetheart, you've gone and helped
our dead to rest in peace. Go reborn.

644
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,919
Who do you think is here, dear girl?
Who do you think is here?

645
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,679
- Who?
- My husband.

646
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,556
Oh, lz! l'm so happy.

647
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,231
l never was so surprised.
They're here on their vacation.

648
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,913
- His wife?
- Clara. You've heard me speak about her.

649
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,918
She's my oldest friend,
and she's sweeter than ever.

650
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,634
She must be, to make you
so glad to see her.

651
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,151
Charles never would've stayed married to
me. l even lost the vacuum cleaner once.

652
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,316
They still haven't found it.

653
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,877
- Well, we gotta get this boy on a horse.
- l'll be around. But l can't go mustangin'.

654
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,833
They're gonna stay
at my house for a week.

655
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,270
- Good luck, boy. So long.
- Oh, lsabelle...

656
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,276
(crowd cheers)

657
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,910
(announcer) Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, gate one.

658
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,310
Here he comes.

659
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,999
- l didn't know it was that dangerous!
- That's the way they want it.

660
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,079
Look. See that strap they've taken off?
That's what makes 'em buck.

661
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,590
- That grabs 'em where they don't like it.
- That's not fair!

662
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,518
Well, you wouldn't
have a rodeo otherwise.

663
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,598
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.

664
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,516
(laughter)

665
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,594
Lester, what are you tryin' to do?!

666
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,879
- Don't break it, Grandpa.
- Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.

667
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,952
- l hope you're sober.
- Man, l've won buckets of money...

668
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,674
..in towns l couldn't remember the name.

669
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,109
Hey, there she is.

670
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,435
l mean, there they are.

671
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,632
Gay, l wouldn't, uh...
l wouldn't wanna move in on you.

672
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,718
- Unless, of course, you wouldn't mind.
- Boy, l'd mind.

673
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,797
The next rider is Perce Howland
ofBlack River, Wyoming.

674
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,195
- California, not Wyoming.
- Ready, boy?

675
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,311
- Outside.
- Open the gate!

676
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,320
Come on, Perce!
