- Sure.

"Hi, I'm Janice."

Absolutely.

He was unable to make it.

He stood you up?

1157
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:13,440
Maybe he had a car accident.
Those cab drivers are maniacs.

They hit something and you slam
into that plastic partition.

1159
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:21,388
Or his elbows could be in
splints, so he couldn't dial.

1160
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:23,922
Or he could be unconscious.

In a coma.

two blocks from the caf.

01:10:46,983 --> 01:10:48,678
Is there a picture?

1171

So that explains it.

01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:55,722
He was in jail.

1173

And there was a phone.

1174
01:10:58,094 --> 01:11:00,255
He only got one call,
so he called his lawyer.

01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:48,137
<i>Someday I'll explain everything.</i>

1241
01:16:48,678 --> 01:16:49,975
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

1242
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:51,579
<i>... I'm still here.</i>

01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:53,776
<i>Talk to me.</i>

Did he say anything about
wanting to meet you again?

1245
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:58,477
No, not really.

1246
01:16:59,088 --> 01:17:00,578
Listen, it doesn't matter.

1247
01:17:00,757 --> 01:17:03,590
We'll just be like George Bernard
Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.

1248
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,954
We'll write letters our whole lives.

1249
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:09,493
BIRDIE: Thank you for the scones.
They look lovely.

1250
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:13,065
Birdie, where was this one taken?

1251
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,697
Seville.

1252
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,169
KATHLEEN: When you fell madly in love?
BIRDIE: Yes.

1253
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,807
So, dearie,
what have you decided to do?

1254
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:23,568
Close. We're going to close.

1255
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,438
Close.

1256
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:30,516
Closing the store is
the brave thing to do.

1257
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:33,881
You are such a liar.
But thank you.

1258
01:17:35,224 --> 01:17:40,287
You are daring to imagine that
you could have a different life.

1259
01:17:41,097 --> 01:17:46,000
I know it doesn't feel like that.
You feel like a big, fat failure now.

1260
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:47,395
But you're not.

1261
01:17:47,804 --> 01:17:51,900
You are marching into
the unknown, armed with...

1262
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:53,132
...nothing.

1263
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:55,538
Have a sandwich.

1264
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:00,080
Not nothing.
I have a little money saved.

1265
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:04,117
If you need more, ask me.
I'm very rich.

1266
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,118
I bought Intel at six.

1267
01:18:10,493 --> 01:18:13,189
I suppose you want me
to tell you who it was...

1268
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:15,761
...I fell madly in love with.

1269
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:17,931
But I'm not going to tell.

1270
01:18:18,835 --> 01:18:20,166
Who was it, Birdie?

1271
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:24,072
Come on, tell. Uch. That's so mean.

1272
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,538
But so romantic.

1273
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:29,143
BIRDIE: - It wasn't meant to be.
- Why not?

1274
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:31,837
He ran Spain.

1275
01:18:33,082 --> 01:18:34,447
Spain?

1276
01:18:34,684 --> 01:18:37,209
The country, he ran it.
It was his job.

1277
01:18:37,453 --> 01:18:39,216
And then he died.

1278
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:41,082
Just as well.

1279
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:42,857
Milk or lemon?

1280
01:18:44,393 --> 01:18:47,521
She fell in love with
Generalissimo Franco.

1281
01:18:47,697 --> 01:18:49,756
Don't say that.
We don't know that for sure.

1282
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:53,026
Who else could it have been?
It was around 1960.

1283
01:18:53,202 --> 01:18:55,796
- Do you want some popcorn?
- I can't believe this.

1284
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,601
It's not like he was something normal,
like a socialist or an anarchist.

1285
01:19:01,878 --> 01:19:03,470
It happened in Spain.

1286
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,977
People do stupid things
in foreign countries.

1287
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:09,208
They buy leather jackets
for much more than they're worth.

1288
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:12,751
But they don't fall in love
with fascist dictators.

1289
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:21,762
[WHISPERING]
Birdie is a very special person to me.

1290
01:19:21,998 --> 01:19:24,694
She is practically my surrogate mother.

1291
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:26,334
[WHISPERING]
She's out of her mind.

1292
01:19:26,502 --> 01:19:27,560
She is not.

1293
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:32,100
I could never be with anybody who
doesn't take politics as seriously as I do.

WOMAN:
Do you mind?

1295
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,110
A hot dog is singing.

1296
01:19:35,344 --> 01:19:38,404
You need quiet
while a hot dog is singing?

1297
01:19:41,817 --> 01:19:44,251
I have something to tell you, Frank.

1298
01:19:45,354 --> 01:19:47,652
- I didn't vote.
- What?

1299
01:19:47,823 --> 01:19:49,654
In the last mayoral election...

1300
01:19:49,825 --> 01:19:52,817
...when Rudy Giuliani was running
against Ruth Messinger...

1301
01:19:53,095 --> 01:19:54,824
...I went to get a manicure.

1302
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:57,090
And forgot to vote.

1303
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,933
Since when do you get manicures?

1304
01:19:59,101 --> 01:20:02,161
I suppose you could never be with
a woman who got manicures?

1305
01:20:03,306 --> 01:20:05,774
It's okay. I forgive you.

1306
01:20:06,842 --> 01:20:07,866
You forgive me?

1307
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:19,814
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

This has been a big week.
You're closing the store.

No, it's not that.
Really, it's not.

That was terrible of me.

What was terrible?

01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,265
Jumping all over you
when I'm the one...

1313
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:39,206
I don't even know how to say this.

1314

You're a wonderful person.

So are you.

1318
01:20:50,152 --> 01:20:54,316
And I'm so honored that
you'd want to be with me...

1319
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:58,586
...because you wouldn't be with
anyone who wasn't truly worthy.

1320
01:20:58,794 --> 01:21:01,524
- I feel exactly the same way.
- No, God, don't...

You don't love me.

01:37:47,035 --> 01:37:49,902
I don't mean to say things like that.
No matter what you've done...

1551
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:52,435
...there's no excuse
for my saying that.

1552
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:53,835
Every time I see you...

1553
01:37:54,009 --> 01:37:56,239
Things like that just
fly out of your mouth.

1554
01:37:58,813 --> 01:38:00,007
I brought you flowers.

1555
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,540
Ohh.

1556
01:38:03,718 --> 01:38:04,742
Thank you.

1557
01:38:10,191 --> 01:38:12,455
Why don't I just put these
in some water?

1558
01:38:13,928 --> 01:38:15,828
You're sick.
You should sit down.

1559
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,136
I need a vase.

1560
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:26,107
Above the refrigerator.

1561
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:29,041
JOE:
There it is. Obviously.

1562
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:32,941
George says hello, by the way.

1563
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:36,216
He told me you were sick.

1564
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:37,984
How is George?

1565
01:38:39,487 --> 01:38:41,387
Great, really great.

1566
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:44,122
He's revolutionizing the place.

1567
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:45,792
You can't work in his department...

1568
01:38:46,061 --> 01:38:48,655
...unless you have a Ph.D.
In Children's Literature.

1569
01:38:48,963 --> 01:38:50,555
I love daisies.

1570
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,234
- You told me.
- They're so friendly.

1571
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:57,901
Don't you think daisies
are the friendliest flower?

1572
01:38:58,073 --> 01:38:59,097
I do.

1573
01:39:00,308 --> 01:39:01,400
When did you break up?

1574
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:03,904
Couple of weeks ago.

1575
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:07,408
Everyone is breaking up.
You. Me.

1576
01:39:07,615 --> 01:39:11,142
This other person I know broke up
with someone in an elevator.

1577
01:39:11,386 --> 01:39:14,116
Or after it, or just outside it or...

1578
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:16,118
It got stuck.

1579
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:20,025
When I saw you at the coffee place,
I was waiting for him.

1580
01:39:20,295 --> 01:39:21,592
And I was...

1581
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,093
Charming.

1582
01:39:23,665 --> 01:39:25,155
I was not charming.

1583
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,095
JOE:
You looked charming. Tea?

1584
01:39:27,302 --> 01:39:28,826
Yes. I was...

1585
01:39:29,003 --> 01:39:31,699
I was upset and horrible.

1586
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,035
JOE: - Honey?
- Yes.

1587
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:35,506
I was the horrible one.

1588
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,302
Well, that's true.

1589
01:39:37,545 --> 01:39:40,013
But I have no excuse.

1590
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:42,809
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1591
01:39:43,818 --> 01:39:45,012
That's interesting.

1592
01:39:45,286 --> 01:39:47,277
Whereas I am a horrible person...

1593
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:51,050
...therefore I have no choice
but to be horrible.

1594
01:39:51,326 --> 01:39:54,420
That's what you're saying.
But that's all right.

1595
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:57,291
I put you out of business so...

1596
01:39:57,932 --> 01:39:59,456
...you're entitled to hate me.

1597
01:40:00,935 --> 01:40:02,459
I don't hate you.

1598
01:40:03,438 --> 01:40:05,633
But you'll never forgive me.

1599
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:08,168
- Just like Elizabeth.
- Who?

1600
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:11,073
Elizabeth Bennet in
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1601
01:40:11,312 --> 01:40:12,336
She was too proud.

1602
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:14,981
I thought you hated
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1603
01:40:15,216 --> 01:40:17,707
Or was she too prejudiced...

1604
01:40:17,986 --> 01:40:20,454
...and Mr. Darcy is too proud?

1605
01:40:20,688 --> 01:40:22,053
I can't remember.

1606
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:30,221
It wasn't personal.

1607
01:40:30,532 --> 01:40:33,865
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm so sick of that.

1608
01:40:34,102 --> 01:40:37,469
All that means is that
it wasn't personal to you.

1609
01:40:37,705 --> 01:40:39,468
But it was personal to me.

1610
01:40:39,707 --> 01:40:41,971
It's personal to a lot of people.

1611
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:45,236
What is so wrong
with being personal anyway?

1612
01:40:46,414 --> 01:40:47,745
Nothing.

1613
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:52,112
Whatever else anything is,
it ought to begin by being personal.

1614
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,890
My head is starting to get fuzzy.

1615
01:41:03,264 --> 01:41:05,198
Why did you stop by again?
I forget.

1616
01:41:06,734 --> 01:41:07,996
I wanted to be your friend.

1617
01:41:09,204 --> 01:41:10,569
Oh.

1618
01:41:11,406 --> 01:41:13,533
I knew it wasn't possible.

1619
01:41:14,642 --> 01:41:17,702
Sometimes a guy
just wants the impossible.

1620
01:41:27,655 --> 01:41:29,555
Can I ask you a question?

1621
01:41:29,757 --> 01:41:30,951
What?

1622
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,456
What happened with that guy
at the caf?

1623
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:37,457
Nothing.

1624
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:39,530
But you're crazy about him?

1625
01:41:40,902 --> 01:41:41,926
Yes, I am.

1626
01:41:42,103 --> 01:41:45,539
Why don't you run off with him?
What are you waiting for?

1627
01:41:47,942 --> 01:41:49,910
I don't actually know him.

1628
01:41:50,478 --> 01:41:51,536
Really?

1629
01:41:54,115 --> 01:41:56,777
I only know him through...

1630
01:41:57,619 --> 01:41:59,086
You won't believe this.

1631
01:41:59,254 --> 01:42:00,915
JOE:
Let me guess.

1632
01:42:01,456 --> 01:42:02,821
Through the Internet?

1633
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:05,850
Yes.

1634
01:42:07,762 --> 01:42:08,854
JOE:
Hmm.

1635
01:42:09,063 --> 01:42:11,531
"You've got mail."

1636
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:13,166
Yes.

1637
01:42:15,503 --> 01:42:16,868
Those are very powerful words.

1638
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:18,995
Yes.

1639
01:42:22,076 --> 01:42:23,839
I'm happy for him.

1640
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:26,942
Although...

1641
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:30,217
Could I just make a suggestion?

1642
01:42:30,852 --> 01:42:32,183
What?

1643
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,087
I think...

1644
01:42:34,622 --> 01:42:36,317
...you should meet him.

1645
01:42:36,824 --> 01:42:39,292
No, wait, I take that back.

1646
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:43,095
Why would you meet
somebody you're crazy about?

1647
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:47,028
I hardly think I need to take
advice from a person who...

1648
01:42:49,404 --> 01:42:51,599
I can see I bring out
the worst in you.

1649
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:54,467
Let me help you
to not say something...

1650
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:59,169
...you'll torture yourself about
for years to come.

1651
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,555
I hope you feel better soon.

1652
01:43:15,897 --> 01:43:18,195
It'd be a shame to miss
New York in the spring.

1653
01:43:22,437 --> 01:43:23,995
Thank you for the daisies.

1654
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:37,711
Well, you take care.

1655
01:43:39,153 --> 01:43:40,177
I will.

1656
01:43:41,422 --> 01:43:42,514
Goodbye.

1657
01:43:44,392 --> 01:43:45,757
Goodbye.

1658
01:44:02,777 --> 01:44:04,972
KATHLEEN:
<i>I've been thinking about this...</i>

1659
01:44:05,213 --> 01:44:07,306
<i>... and I think we should meet.</i>

1660
01:44:13,988 --> 01:44:15,580
JOE:
<i>We should meet.</i>

1661
01:44:16,257 --> 01:44:18,054
<i>And we will meet.</i>

1662
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:22,552
<i>But I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of a project that needs...</i>

1663
01:44:27,769 --> 01:44:29,430
<i>... tweaking.</i>

1664
01:44:49,223 --> 01:44:50,656
Some tweaking?

1665
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:53,192
A project that needed...

1666
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:54,487
..."tweaking."

1667
01:44:54,662 --> 01:44:58,792
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- T-W-E-A-K-l-N-G? Tweaking.

1668
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:02,469
It sounds to me like he's married.

1669
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:03,830
Three kids.

1670
01:45:04,005 --> 01:45:06,997
That's a terrible thing to say.
He couldn't be married.

1671
01:45:07,275 --> 01:45:08,469
How do you know?

1672
01:45:08,676 --> 01:45:10,871
Have you said, "Are you married?"

1673
01:45:11,145 --> 01:45:13,739
No, I'm not going to... No.

1674
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:18,550
KATHLEEN: <i>I know this is a little late</i>
<i>to be asking but...</i>

1675
01:45:19,654 --> 01:45:21,144
<i>... are you married?</i>

1676
01:45:24,659 --> 01:45:26,126
JOE:
<i>Am I married?</i>

1677
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:28,295
<i>What kind of question is that?</i>

1678
01:45:28,863 --> 01:45:31,764
<i>How can you ask me that?</i>
<i>Don't you know me at all?</i>

1679
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:33,898
<i>Oh, wait, I get it.</i>

1680
01:45:34,535 --> 01:45:37,834
<i>Your friends are saying the reason</i>
<i>we haven't met is I'm married.</i>

01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:39,506
<i>Am I right?</i>

1682
01:45:40,842 --> 01:45:43,037
- So he didn't answer the question.
- Yes, he did.

1683
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:46,212
- He did not.
- He did. He did. He nailed me.

1684
01:45:46,481 --> 01:45:50,383
He knew what I was after which is,
by the way, exactly like him.

1685
01:45:50,651 --> 01:45:53,882
He did not answer
the question, did he?

1686
01:45:55,156 --> 01:45:56,521
No.

1687
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:59,920
Maybe he's fat.

1688
01:46:00,595 --> 01:46:02,529
He's fat. He's a fatty.

1689
01:46:03,297 --> 01:46:04,321
I don't care.

1690
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:06,433
You don't care that he's so fat...

1691
01:46:06,667 --> 01:46:10,364
...he has to be removed from his house
by a crane. You don't care.

1692
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:12,004
KATHLEEN:
That is very unlikely.

1693
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,572
That is completely ridiculous.

1694
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:17,040
What's his handle?

1695
01:46:17,211 --> 01:46:18,542
Uh...

1696
01:46:20,348 --> 01:46:21,838
I'm not going to write him.

1697
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:24,108
You think I'm going to e-mail him?

1698
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,012
All right, N-Y-1-5-2.

1699
01:46:28,322 --> 01:46:30,916
N-Y-1-5-2? 152.

1700
01:46:31,192 --> 01:46:33,319
He's 152 years old.

1701
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,825
He's had 152 moles removed...

1702
01:46:37,064 --> 01:46:39,965
...so now he's got
152 pockmarks on his...

1703
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:42,262
on his face.

1704
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:46,028
The number of people who think
he looks like Clark Gable.

1705
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,140
152 people who think
he looks like a Clark Bar.

[KATHLEEN LAUGHS]

1707

KATHLEEN: - Why'd I even tell you?
- 152 stitches from his nose job.

1708
01:46:57,852 --> 01:47:00,878
The number of his souvenir
shot glasses...

1709
01:47:01,122 --> 01:47:04,614
...that he's collected
in his travels.

1710
01:47:05,593 --> 01:47:07,117
His address.

1711
01:47:07,395 --> 01:47:11,263
No, he would never do
anything that prosaic.

1712

The only thing I
really care about is that...

...aside from the married thing
and the jail thing...

1714

...is the boat thing.

1715
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:26,303
What boat thing?

1716
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,778
I could never be
with someone who had a boat.

1717
01:47:30,484 --> 01:47:31,951

Oh.

Which clinches it.
We'll never be together.

- Three.

- Thank you.

That would mean he's a Westsider.

Maybe I've seen him
and don't even know it.

every day and not know it.

It's very possible.

The Zipper Man.

1765
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:44,074
Who is that?

1766
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:46,742
He repairs zippers
on Amsterdam Avenue.

- You'd never have to buy new luggage.
