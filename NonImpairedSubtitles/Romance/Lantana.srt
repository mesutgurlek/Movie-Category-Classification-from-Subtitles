1
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,361
(fly buzzing)

2
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:53,891
(man and woman moaning)

3
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,850
You're okay?

4
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,718
Yeah.
I lost my earring.

5
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,486
- Man: What does it look like?
- It's a pearl one.

6
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,093
Man:
It should turn up.

7
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:39,966
I'm fond of them, 'cause
my husband gave them to me.

8
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:50,013
- You should go.
- Yeah.

9
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:58,947
I...

10
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,554
really enjoyed that.

11
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,892
Yes, I know.

12
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,269
(salsa music playing)

13
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,657
(mumbles)

14
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:43,517
Leon...

15
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,583
Leon...

16
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:47,825
this is about sex.
It's about a man and a woman

17
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:51,026
joined groin to groin.
Get it?

18
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,203
Come on.

19
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:04,806
No.

20
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,708
Like this.

21
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:07,005
Boy: Mom?

22
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:09,307
- I'm in here.
- I don't have any clothes.

23
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,440
- You looked on your bedroom floor?
- Yeah. I mean clean ones.

24
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,315
When I come home,
I'll clean them, okay?

25
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,379
- Boy: Why are you jogging, Dad?
- I want to get fit.

26
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:22,050
- What for?
- I don't want to die.

27
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,151
- You are gonna die.
- Not just yet.

28
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,718
Mom? Clothes?

29
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,765
- Then stop jogging.
- Mom, clothes?

30
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,994
What am I gonna wear?

31
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,797
(exhales deeply)

32
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,337
Boy: See you, mom

33
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:37,567
- See you, Dad.
- See you, mate.

34
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:44,876
- See you, Dad.
- Hey, hey, what about me?

35
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,884
- I'm 16 now.
- You're telling me you're a man now?

36
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:48,884
No, but...

37
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,549
- Have a good day, Dad.
- Yeah. You too.

38
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:01,096
Is there some point where a son
stops kissing his father?

39
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:02,530
Apparently.

40
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,234
- Police!
- Get out!

41
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,630
You weren't a bit hard?

42
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,063
The guy deals drugs.
He's scum.

43
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,998
Woman: Yeah, but
he wasn't going anywhere.

44
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,763
What did you
expect me to do?

45
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,521
Are you seeing anyone?

46
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,058
Not with the hours I keep.

47
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,160
What about somebody
on the force?

48
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:16,001
Male cops
are lousy in bed.

49
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,242
There is someone.

50
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:26,078
He eats in the same
restaurant as I do.

51
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,742
Have you spoken
to him yet?

52
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,944
We've exchanged glances.

53
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,455
Oooh...

54
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,321
It's a start.

55
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,888
- How's Sonja?
- She's good.

56
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:41,932
Haven't seen her
around for a while.

57
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,129
Yeah, well... she's busy,
with the boys and work...

58
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:49,433
Tell her I said hi.

59
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,734
I will.

60
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,673
Woman: Have you told him
you're not happy?

61
00:09:56,914 --> 00:10:00,145
I would have thought that
he wouldn't need to be told.

62
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,951
That depends on how good
an actor you are.

63
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,217
Well...

64
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,384
I guess I must be
pretty good.

65
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:13,922
How do you want
your marriage to be?

66
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:26,939
Passionate...

67
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,509
and challenging,

68
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,020
and... and...

69
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:39,783
honest...

70
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,920
Isn't it honest?

71
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:46,858
Not emotionally.

72
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,592
Not emotionally it isn't.
It just feels...

73
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,558
like we're...

74
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,602
like we're just...

75
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,666
going through
the motions,

76
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:00,971
you know?

77
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,308
And I want more.

78
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,550
I want more than that.

79
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,966
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,735
please welcome
Dr. Valerie Somers.

81
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,572
(audience claps)

82
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,748
Thank you.

83
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:54,060
We don't know
what to feel anymore.

84
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,463
We don't know
what's right or wrong anymore.

85
00:11:56,533 --> 00:12:00,401
The confused cry
of the modern age...

86
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,463
We ask,
"What can we believe in?

87
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,838
What should we believe in?"

88
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,843
Our politicians?

89
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,640
Hardly.

90
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,340
Our priests?

91
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,747
You'd be amazed at how many clients
come to see me

92
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,615
because they once believed
in a priest.

93
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,383
It's not supposed
to be that way.

94
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:21,117
But it is.

95
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,250
What then?
Our parents?

96
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,387
"Home is a sanctuary."
For the privileged few.

97
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,091
For most,
it's a battleground.

98
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,657
It's not meant
to be like that.

99
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,100
But it is.

100
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,430
Love?

101
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,473
Can we believe in love?

102
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:41,272
Feel safe in it?

103
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:47,075
Loving someone means
we have to relinquish power.

104
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:49,210
It's mutual surrender.

105
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,613
But how can this
take place?

106
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,549
Trust.

107
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,690
Trust is as vital
to human relationships

108
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,062
as breath is to life...

109
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,195
and just as elusive.

110
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,444
Two years ago, my 11 -year-old
daughter was murdered.

111
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:24,382
Her name was Eleanor.

112
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:27,355
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

113
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,587
But it did.

114
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,836
It seemed to go well.

115
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:45,133
I was worried you weren't
going to be there.

116
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,905
I said I would be.

117
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,361
Do you want a whiskey?

118
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,471
I've got an early client.

119
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:20,343
Why don't we take
separate cars in the morning?

120
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,039
I've got a late meeting. That way,
you wouldn't have to wait for me.

121
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,412
I've got plenty of work
I can do.

122
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:28,348
You can pick me up
after your meeting.

123
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,678
Sure.

124
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,118
Okay.

125
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,496
Man:
I met someone.

126
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,398
We went home and had sex.

127
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,164
As you do...

128
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:49,205
well, some of us do.

129
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,500
And he asked
to see me again.

130
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,102
I wasn't expecting that.

131
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,840
And?

132
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,047
Against my better judgement,
I said yes.

133
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:09,090
We've been seeing
each other for awhile.

134
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,659
And you like him?

135
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,828
Yes, I do.

136
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:16,888
Very much.

137
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:19,094
So?

138
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,237
He comes encumbered...

139
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,004
with a wife.

140
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,576
Is he gay?

141
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,408
When he's with me,
he seems to be.

142
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:37,180
Somers:
Does she know about you?

143
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:39,119
I assume so.

144
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,124
She would sense it,
wouldn't she?

145
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,962
It depends on how good
he is at deceiving her.

146
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,334
Or how good she is
at deceiving herself.

147
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,040
(Latin music playing)

148
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,005
"V." Don't forget "V."

149
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,182
Hi, Nik.

150
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,887
Having a party, Jane?

151
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,957
Yeah.
Did you want to join me?

152
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,357
Take this inside
for Mommy.

153
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,271
Well?

154
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,435
Yeah.

155
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:08,711
Where?

156
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,174
In a motel.

157
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,285
Woman: Oh...

158
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,756
- Did you get his number?
- Is that what you do?

159
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,726
I don't know.

160
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,161
If you like the guy.

161
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,959
But he's married.

162
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:35,262
Well, what?
He's not happy.

163
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:38,330
He can't be, if he's...

164
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,966
messing around.

165
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,345
You want
to see him again?

166
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,514
Do you think I should?

167
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,917
You want me to be honest?

168
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,421
No. No.

169
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,093
When are you gonna
take that thing off?

170
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,895
It's too tight.
I've got to get it cut off.

171
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,197
Nik caught up with Pete
the other day.

172
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,341
He wants to come back.

173
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,915
I don't love him, Paula.

174
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,924
Leon: Go up to the guy,
and ask if you can join him.

175
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:41,368
- What have you got to lose?
- Just a little dignity.

176
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:44,669
It is not the issue here.
He eats alone in a restaurant.

177
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,606
- So do I.
- Exactly.

178
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,052
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

179
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:04,826
Uh...

180
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,191
Jane, this is Claudia.

181
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,699
- Claudia, Jane.
- Hi.

182
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:11,995
Hi.

183
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,902
Jane's in the same dance class
as Sonja and I.

184
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,008
I'll get going.
Say hi to Sonja.

185
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,771
Sorry.

186
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,407
Is that really awkward?

187
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,677
No, it's fine.

188
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:35,614
- How are you?
- I'm good.

189
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:36,659
Yeah.

190
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:39,788
Good.

191
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,626
I'd better go.

192
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:46,797
Jane.

193
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,332
Mmmm.

194
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,934
Where did you find it?

195
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,962
- Nik: Paula?
- Paula: Mmm.

196
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,334
There's an unmarked police car
in front of Jane's place.

197
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:57,396
She's seeing a cop now?

198
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,942
Don't be nosy, Nik.

199
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,672
What? Are her and Pete
getting back together or what?

200
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,270
I don't know.

201
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,540
What if they are?
What do I say then?

202
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:10,711
Nothing.

203
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,085
Well, he's...
he's a mate of mine.

204
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:15,989
Then do him a favor
and stay out of it.

205
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,755
The baby's sick?

206
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,693
Yeah.

207
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,293
(Leon moaning)
Shit.

208
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,837
Oh fuck...

209
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,272
- Don't stop.
- Here.

210
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,447
- (Leon groans)
- Leon?

211
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,983
- Oh fuck.
- You're all right?

212
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,780
What is it?
What is it?

213
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,479
It's nothing.

214
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,613
- Should I call...
- No, no.

215
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,658
- Just...
- Should I get a doctor?

216
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,161
I get this pain
in my chest sometimes.

217
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,789
You should have told me
you have a weak heart.

218
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,298
I don't.

219
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,494
I don't want to have
an affair with...

220
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,400
I don't have a weak heart,
all right?

221
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:04,929
This is not an affair, it's
a one-night stand that happened twice.

222
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,577
Oh shit.

223
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:18,514
Sorry.
I didn't mean that.

224
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,326
Do you worry that we don't
make love very often?

225
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:59,293
No.

226
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:02,422
I don't really think
about it that much.

227
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,563
- Why not?
- I love you.

228
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,128
Whether we make love three times
a week or once a month

229
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,470
does not
really change that.

230
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,476
Doesn't it?

231
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,478
- Is this a test?
- No.

232
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:19,413
It's just... I want to know
what you're thinking.

233
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,247
Why do women always
want to know that?

234
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,723
You're up late.

235
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:36,891
Yeah, I'm trying
to finish this.

236
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:40,599
You want one?

237
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,194
I've got one.

238
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,570
What's wrong?

239
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,878
Nothing.

240
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,548
Just had a shit of a day.

241
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,355
Stopped off and had a drink
with Claudia.

242
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:10,098
Yeah, I know.
I phoned her.

243
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:16,130
I didn't know
if you were working late.

244
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,636
All right.

245
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:38,157
Fuck! Fuck!

246
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:44,095
You fucking stupid bastard!

247
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,499
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

248
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,901
Would you fucking look
where you're going?!

249
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:50,906
Fucking idiot!

250
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,498
Fuck!

251
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,170
Oh fuck.

252
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,738
Hey! Wait.

253
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:02,080
Leon:
Are you all right?

254
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,675
Sorry.
Here's your bag.

255
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,894
Leon: Jesus.

256
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,861
(man sobbing)

257
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:34,643
- What happened?
- I fell.

258
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:38,050
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing.

259
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,520
Let me look.

260
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,150
I'll be all right.
I said I'm all right!

261
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:11,811
Man:
I keep thinking about her.

262
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,788
Are you feeling guilty?

263
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,756
Do you think I should be?

264
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,725
It doesn't matter
what I think.

265
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:23,757
He feels manipulated by her.

266
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,891
How?

267
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,936
She's very needy.

268
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,938
Are you trying
to justify his deceit?

269
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,406
No, I'm trying
to understand it.

270
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:34,500
- It's complex.
- Mmm-hm.

271
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:36,636
But isn't it still
an act of deceit?

272
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:38,840
No marriage
can be based on that.

273
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:42,040
Most marriages
are based on that.

274
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:45,485
You think you know what goes on
in most marriages?

275
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:48,683
What? Because I'm gay,
I can't have an opinion...?

276
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:52,216
- It's not what I was...
- She's not the victim in this.

277
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:54,126
She chose to marry him.

278
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,687
Not knowing he was gay.

279
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,165
There's knowing,
and there's "knowing."

280
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:59,599
What do you mean?

281
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:06,374
I think some women
like to live the lie.

282
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,636
It's easier than dealing
with the truth.

283
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:14,010
Maybe she loves him.

284
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,483
But so do I.

285
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,487
Then he has
to make a choice.

286
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,547
Unless one of us withdraws
from the contest.

287
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:26,355
Is love a contest for you,
Patrick?

288
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,399
Patrick?

289
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,294
Yes.

290
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,437
Sometimes.

291
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,774
What happened to your head?

292
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:52,252
I bumped it on a clothes line.

293
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,055
Listen...

294
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,357
thanks for last night.

295
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,897
I'll lie for you
to anyone, except Sonja.

296
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:07,936
I don't want
to lie to her again.

297
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,266
Fair enough.

298
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,736
Why are you trying
so hard to fuck up your life?

299
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,335
You don't know how lucky you are
to have the marriage you've got.

300
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,277
And you're pissing
all over it.

301
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,886
(salsa music playing)

302
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,716
It's great your husband
comes with you.

303
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,385
Yeah.

304
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:03,851
- What about yours?
- I'm separated.

305
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:05,325
Ah...

306
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:08,227
- Can you tell?
- No.

307
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:10,629
No, you just have this...

308
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,533
- kind of look.
- What? Desperate?

309
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:16,538
No.
Full of potential.

310
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,610
Sorry I'm late.

311
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:32,384
- Jane, this is my husband Leon.
- Hi.

312
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:33,979
Yeah...

313
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,889
Instructor:
Excuse me, everybody.

314
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:43,091
There is a salsa band playing
tonight and tomorrow at The Latin.

315
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,691
Leon. Sonja.

316
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:47,429
Are you guys coming?

317
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:49,664
I thought we'd have
a nice dinner together.

318
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:52,367
Come on. You can go out
to eat anytime.

319
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:54,306
I'd like to go.

320
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:57,073
- I'm kind of tired.
- Okay.

321
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:58,807
Sonja:
I'll see you at home.

322
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,007
Bye.

323
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:11,422
- What was that about?
- Hey, she needed a partner.

324
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:14,930
- And you happened to volunteer?
- She chose me.

325
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,430
I'd never say
anything, Leon.

326
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,244
Nik: Pete!

327
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,787
G'day, Nik.

328
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:14,652
How are you, mate?

329
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:17,557
Drove by to see Jane.
Doesn't look like she's in.

330
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,527
Did you see her tonight?

331
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:20,892
No.

332
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,897
You don't know
where she is then?

333
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,490
No, sorry.

334
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,399
How is she?

335
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,802
The last time
I saw her, okay.

336
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,863
That's good.

337
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:34,136
- How are you going?
- Good.

338
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,802
Good.

339
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:39,075
It's late.
I thought she'd be home.

340
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,116
Sorry,
I haven't seen her.

341
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:46,621
If there was something
I should know, you'd tell me?

342
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,054
'Cause...

343
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:50,684
if she's seeing someone,
I'd want to know.

344
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,421
It'd be easier.

345
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,788
Of course.

346
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,489
I hate this.

347
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:03,363
- Thanks, man. See you later.
- Take care.

348
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:10,745
So why did you
and your husband split up?

349
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:16,210
I don't know.
I just turned around one day

350
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:20,449
and I realized I was living with a man
I didn't love anymore.

351
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:23,720
- It was that simple?
- No.

352
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,927
But you knew that much.

353
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,864
Maybe my expectations
were too high.

354
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:33,829
You're a brave woman.

355
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,905
You are.
Most people settle for less.

356
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:42,407
I really like you, Leon.

357
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,580
Maybe a little too much.

358
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,650
But I'm...

359
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,791
I'm starting
to wonder just...

360
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,097
where this might go.

361
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,045
I'm still in love
with my wife, Jane.

362
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,686
Right.

363
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,381
Leon: I'm sorry.

364
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,753
So...

365
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,926
I'm wondering why...

366
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:37,454
why have you been seeing me if
you're still in love with your wife?

367
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,865
I don't know.

368
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:45,902
It's not something
that I planned.

369
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,081
Look, Jane, l...

370
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,256
This doesn't have
to end badly.

371
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,622
Just go.

372
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,165
Jane: Just go. Go.

373
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,578
It's twofold actually.
He thinks he runs the faculty,

374
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:35,090
but he hasn't published
anything decent since 1985.

375
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,525
You seem preoccupied.

376
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:44,198
I'm having trouble
with a client.

377
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,901
I'm not handling him
very well.

378
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:50,299
Refer him on.

379
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,971
I find him
a little threatening.

380
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:58,036
Why?

381
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,144
I don't like...

382
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,983
- what he's doing.
- You're judging him.

383
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:09,522
Darling, you have
to refer him on.

384
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,291
I'll see you outside.

385
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,912
Excuse me.

386
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:50,153
I hate what's happening to us.
I hate it.

387
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,234
We don't talk anymore.

388
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:57,738
We lost our daughter.

389
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:01,368
That could have
brought us closer.

390
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:14,178
Do you think
about her very much?

391
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,715
Of course I do.

392
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:20,159
I just don't need
to write a book about it.

393
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,673
Do you think
I did the wrong thing?

394
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:42,143
I just wanted the whole...

395
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,044
world to know.

396
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,400
Look at me, John.

397
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,045
Look at me.

398
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,460
(bird chirping)

399
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:05,623
Nik: Come on, kids.
We're late for school.

400
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:08,664
Paula:
Watch the road.

401
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:11,939
Come on. In you get.

402
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,170
- Nik: Goodbye, love
- Paula: Bye, Derek.

403
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:19,876
(baby crying)

404
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:28,188
Hi.

405
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,020
Hi.

406
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:34,153
Are you okay?

407
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,163
Yeah.

408
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,698
I'll pop around
after work.

409
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,164
Okay.

410
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,041
Claudia: Hey, Nik.

411
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,600
You want coffee?

412
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:51,305
Yeah, sure.

413
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,350
Pete was over
last night.

414
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:05,251
How is he?

415
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:07,557
Not good.

416
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:11,727
How's the job hunting going?

417
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:16,137
Are you guys
all right for money?

418
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:18,173
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

419
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,708
'Cause if you need some money,
I'll be more than happy to...

420
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:21,970
No.

421
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,706
I know Paula
wouldn't take it.

422
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,044
She's doing
extra shifts now.

423
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,017
You sure there's no bill
you want to clear?

424
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,713
It's fine.

425
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,883
- The offer's there.
- (baby cooing)

426
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,984
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

427
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:12,489
Why didn't you wake me up?

428
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:17,158
I thought you could do
with the rest.

429
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:21,259
- I'll go have my shower.
- Actually, I've got an early start.

430
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:25,431
- I'll only be 10 minutes.
- Just take your own car.

431
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,533
- Come on, wait for me, please.
- Jesus.

432
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,441
Sorry.

433
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,181
I have a lecture
tonight anyway.

434
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,543
So, you'll be home late?

435
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:42,451
Yeah.

436
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,254
Bye.

437
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:52,358
I think
he's having an affair.

438
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:56,502
He's distant,
preoccupied,

439
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:59,803
like he's holding something
back from me.

440
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:04,811
What would you do
if he was?

441
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:10,178
l...
I think I'd leave.

442
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:13,316
Yeah.

443
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,186
And does that
scare you?

444
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:17,418
Yeah.

445
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,119
I'm...

446
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:24,462
I'm middle-aged. I don't know
what it's like out there.

447
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,160
You know?

448
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,635
And I have these two...

449
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,435
beautiful boys.

450
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,039
But l...

451
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:41,878
I would survive

452
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,542
if I had to.

453
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,316
I like being this age.

454
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,153
And l...

455
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:54,091
I like the lines
around my eyes.

456
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:56,892
I don't know
if he does, but...

457
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:58,796
I do.

458
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:07,268
It's not that he might have slept
with another woman,

459
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,207
you know?

460
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:14,780
It's that he might
not tell me.

461
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:21,578
That would be
the betrayal.

462
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,960
Do you still love him?

463
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:53,348
(cell phone rings)

464
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:03,621
Assistant: Valerie?
Patrick Phelan is here.

465
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:06,361
Give me a minute, okay?

466
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,438
- You don't like me, do you?
- Is it important to you?

467
00:43:22,084 --> 00:43:24,484
Would it make a difference
if I were straight?

468
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:27,283
I don't have a problem
with your sexuality.

469
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:31,258
But it is a problem that I'm having
an affair with a married man.

470
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:35,126
You must stop trying
to make me the subject.

471
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,631
It's just another form
of defense.

472
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,928
I'm curious about
your role in this triangle.

473
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:43,665
My role?

474
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:50,201
I'm a respite from a marriage
that's gotten too hard.

475
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:51,336
How?

476
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,177
He takes refuge in me.

477
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:58,951
- In what I offer him.
- What do you offer him?

478
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:04,082
Sex unencumbered by need.

479
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,859
Why doesn't he leave her?

480
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,964
Good men don't know
how to leave their wives.

481
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:12,796
Good men
or cowardly men?

482
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:18,097
He told me that making love
to her was like

483
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:20,573
trying to fill
an empty well.

484
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:39,453
What did you say?

485
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:40,495
What?

486
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:42,792
- You said something to me.
- No, I didn't.

487
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:45,094
- Yes, you did!
- I didn't say anything.

488
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,000
- You heard him, didn't you?
- This is bullshit...

489
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,503
- Bullshit?
- Yeah.

490
00:44:49,571 --> 00:44:52,836
I want your name.
Give me your name!

491
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:53,966
I want your name!

492
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:20,429
A bourbon, please.

493
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:23,801
A double bourbon with ice.
Thanks.

494
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,178
You all right?

495
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:41,913
Yeah.

496
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,515
You sure?
You don't look all right.

497
00:45:46,094 --> 00:45:47,994
What?
Are you a cop?

498
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:51,330
Yeah.

499
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:53,966
Really?

500
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,794
Really.

501
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:59,204
Sorry, I just...

502
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:01,674
something weird
really happened.

503
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:04,075
I was walking and this woman
started yelling at me.

504
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:06,876
She thought
I said something to her.

505
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,178
- What for?
- I don't know.

506
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,685
I was walking down the street
and she went nuts.

507
00:46:11,753 --> 00:46:13,277
- Did you?
- No.

508
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:15,653
I didn't do anything.
I don't do stuff like that.

509
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:18,318
Take it easy.
I believe you.

510
00:46:18,393 --> 00:46:22,295
Sorry. It was just
really weird and...

511
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,265
now you're a cop,
so that's really weird. Sorry.

512
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:29,292
You want another drink?

513
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:32,201
Yeah. Thanks.

514
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,774
Same again.

515
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:41,308
Paula: Sharon said
there's a booze bus on the freeway.

516
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,180
Nik: I'll take
the backroad home.

517
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:45,583
- Hannah!
- Yeah?

518
00:46:45,654 --> 00:46:47,645
Grab Dad's wallet
from the kitchen.

519
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,053
Hannah: Yeah.

520
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:52,884
Hey.

521
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:55,657
- She asked me for coffee this morning.
- Who?

522
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,223
- Jane.
- What for?

523
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:03,100
- I don't know.
- Hannah: I can't find it!

524
00:47:03,171 --> 00:47:04,798
It's near the fridge.

525
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:06,204
I don't know.

526
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:08,401
She's trying
to come on to me.

527
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:11,974
What?

528
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,277
She's lonely, Nik.

529
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,977
And you're bored.
That's a lethal combination.

530
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:18,952
Stay away from her.

531
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,647
What's the matter?

532
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:22,747
You're a bit jealous, huh?

533
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:23,756
Huh?

534
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:27,454
You ever fuck with our marriage,
and I cut your balls off.

535
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,965
I'll hang them on the lawn,
between your socks and your jocks.

536
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:32,465
Got it?

537
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:35,498
Sure, babe.

538
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:42,702
Wake me up
when you get home. Huh?

539
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,211
I'm running down
this hill,

540
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,838
and I go
around this corner.

541
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:50,146
And suddenly,
there's this guy, and bam!

542
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:54,154
Right into him. Right away,
I'm going after him...

543
00:47:54,222 --> 00:47:57,658
"You fucking prick!
Look where you're going."

544
00:47:57,726 --> 00:47:59,921
- But it was your fault.
- Well, yeah.

545
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:01,895
I don't know
why I went at him.

546
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:05,922
It was just... my buttons
got pushed or something.

547
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:08,868
Anyway,
so I look down,

548
00:48:08,937 --> 00:48:11,462
and there he is,
on the ground, cowering.

549
00:48:11,539 --> 00:48:14,474
- Huh?
- He's got blood on his face...

550
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:17,568
- and he broke his fucking nose.
- Oh no.

551
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:21,412
And he gets up and
he starts to role-play.

552
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,212
- And that's when it happens.
- What?

553
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,276
- He starts to cry.
- What for?

554
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:28,220
I don't know.
What makes a man cry like that?

555
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,190
Yeah, a lot of things.

556
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:32,226
So what did you do?

557
00:48:34,262 --> 00:48:36,787
I just held him.

558
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:39,356
I just stood there
and I held him.

559
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:41,527
But the whole time
I was thinking,

560
00:48:41,603 --> 00:48:44,697
"You fucking weak prick,
pull yourself together."

561
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:47,640
- Don't you want to cry sometimes?
- Yeah, but...

562
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:49,609
- you don't, do you?
- Mmm.

563
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:01,085
Hey.

564
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:02,919
We ordered your food,
but we ate it.

565
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:05,920
What's that smell?

566
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,228
- Where's your mom?
- Dancing.

567
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:16,369
- Where's your brother?
- Upstairs.

568
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:17,937
Shit.

569
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:19,939
Sam!

570
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,437
Sam?

571
00:49:23,511 --> 00:49:26,036
Sam! Sam!

572
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,116
What the fuck
is going on?

573
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:34,379
For Christ's sake,
I'm a cop!

574
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:38,415
- All right, you get the good stuff.
- Don't you smart-mouth me.

575
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,620
- What's going on?
- Your brother is being an idiot.

576
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:42,492
- So what's new?
- Did you know about this?

577
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,589
Have you tried it?

578
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,725
If you ever give
your brother that shit...

579
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:48,359
- As if I'd give...
- Shut up!

580
00:49:48,436 --> 00:49:49,528
- No...
- Shut up!

581
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:53,438
Give your brother this stuff, I'll
give you a thumping you won't forget.

582
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:56,739
I don't care how big you get!
Give me the rest.

583
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,509
Sam: That's it.

584
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,608
Get downstairs.

585
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:06,677
- You're grounded, mate.
- What?

586
00:51:06,214 --> 00:51:07,909
(engine stalling)

587
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:12,981
Oh shit.

588
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:22,990
Oh God.

589
00:52:07,175 --> 00:52:09,040
(Latin music playing)

590
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,632
You're a very
beautiful woman, Sonja.

591
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:55,046
I'd like
to fuck with you.

592
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:04,999
Can I have a whiskey,
dry please?

593
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:12,768
Excuse me.

594
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:21,181
Hello.

595
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:24,314
You look like
you're enjoying yourself.

596
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,080
Yeah, I am.

597
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:29,123
It's good you're having fun,
while our son's at home smoking pot.

598
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,452
I know.

599
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:33,289
I told him if he's gonna do it,
he should do it at home

600
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,455
- so we can control it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

601
00:53:36,531 --> 00:53:39,091
Because you haven't been
around much lately.

602
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:42,068
I'm not having drugs
in the house.

603
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:46,402
What are you gonna do?
Banning it won't solve the problem.

604
00:53:49,243 --> 00:53:51,268
- What are you doing here?
- What?

605
00:53:51,346 --> 00:53:52,870
What are you doing here?

606
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,142
Most of the guys here
aren't much older than our son.

607
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:34,478
- I thought we'd go back to your place.
- We can't. My mother.

608
00:54:40,395 --> 00:54:42,556
Wait. Slow down.

609
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:45,792
Stop. Get off.

610
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,528
Man: Jesus!

611
00:54:47,602 --> 00:54:49,661
What's wrong?

612
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:51,602
I'm sorry.

613
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:53,698
This was a bad idea.
Sorry.

614
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,910
Fucking uptight bitch!

615
00:55:41,022 --> 00:55:42,683
Hello?

616
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:14,286
Recording: You found John and Valerie.
Leave a message after the tone.

617
00:56:14,355 --> 00:56:15,344
(beep)

618
00:56:15,423 --> 00:56:17,755
Valerie: Hi, it's me.
Are you there?

619
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:23,029
Okay,
I've had an accident.

620
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:25,088
I'm okay.
I can't get the car started.

621
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:28,735
I'm on the backroad and...

622
00:56:31,439 --> 00:56:33,873
I just wanted to get home.

623
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,169
I'll try your mobile. Bye.

624
00:56:43,217 --> 00:56:46,414
I called road services.
There'll be a 90-minute wait.

625
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:50,446
Where are you?
You didn't say you'd be late.

626
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,493
I can't stand this!

627
00:56:54,962 --> 00:56:56,520
Please...

628
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,399
Please, I need you.

629
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:37,468
- (beep)
- John?

630
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:43,871
There is a man.

631
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:47,175
Patrick.

632
00:57:50,585 --> 00:57:52,712
He's a client and he's...

633
00:57:56,457 --> 00:57:58,084
he's gay.

634
00:58:09,437 --> 00:58:12,804
I don't understand this.
I don't understand...

635
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,342
us...

636
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:19,012
anymore.

637
00:58:24,485 --> 00:58:27,750
I don't want this
to be happening to us.

638
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:39,358
Oh...

639
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,230
There are lights.

640
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:44,100
There's a car coming.
I'll wave it down.

641
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:49,406
Wait for me.
We'll talk when I get home, okay?

642
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:51,468
Bye.

643
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:53,570
I love you.

644
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,064
- You need sleep.
- You wish.

645
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:29,735
- What have we got?
- Locals got a call, about 12:30 AM

646
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,904
from the husband. He gets home late,
his wife's not there.

647
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,813
She's left messages on the answering
machine, saying she ran off the road,

648
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:39,375
she's making a call from a phone box,
about 2kms down the road.

649
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:42,718
Last call says she saw a car coming,
she's gonna wave it down.

650
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,655
But she never makes it.

651
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,920
$50 says
it's the husband.

652
01:00:46,994 --> 01:00:48,791
You're on.

653
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:56,968
Mr. Somers?

654
01:00:57,038 --> 01:01:00,166
Knox. My wife's
name's Somers.

655
01:01:01,442 --> 01:01:03,273
I'm Detective Zat.

656
01:01:03,344 --> 01:01:05,778
This is my colleague,
Detective Weis.

657
01:01:07,615 --> 01:01:10,243
We've located
your wife's car, Mr. Knox.

658
01:01:12,386 --> 01:01:14,183
Do you mind if we come in?

659
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:27,927
Mr. Knox, it appears that
your wife ran off the road.

660
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:31,836
There's a telephone box
several kilometers further along.

661
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:37,606
- Should I go there?
- We're conducting a search, but...

662
01:01:37,678 --> 01:01:42,138
if she accepted a lift from somebody,
it's unlikely she'll be there.

663
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:44,013
Would you mind answering
a few questions?

664
01:01:44,085 --> 01:01:46,349
I've been through all this
with the police.

665
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,151
I know, but would you mind telling me
what happened last night?

666
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:54,089
I got home around midnight.

667
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:56,322
Her car wasn't here.

668
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:58,365
I came in,
I checked the machine.

669
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:00,662
There were
a couple of calls.

670
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:03,362
The last message said
there was a car coming

671
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:05,496
and she was going
to wave it down.

672
01:02:05,573 --> 01:02:08,940
- That's when you called the police?
- No, I waited about 20 minutes.

673
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:12,672
- That's how long it would have...
- So you called at about 12:20?

674
01:02:12,746 --> 01:02:14,407
Yes, more or less.

675
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:17,508
Do you have a photo of your wife
we could have, please?

676
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,357
Thank you.

677
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:36,069
How was your wife
yesterday?

678
01:02:37,138 --> 01:02:38,730
- Fine.
- Nothing troubling her?

679
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:39,738
No.

680
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:45,568
I am trying to find out
about your wife's emotional state.

681
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:49,742
Right now, I'd say
it's pretty bad, wouldn't you?

682
01:02:49,817 --> 01:02:51,580
None of this
is particularly pleasant.

683
01:02:51,652 --> 01:02:55,713
- I can imagine.
- Imagine what? You're married?

684
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:57,586
Yeah.

685
01:02:57,658 --> 01:02:59,683
If your wife got
into a stranger's car...

686
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,752
a man, let's assume...
and didn't come home,

687
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,593
what would you imagine?

688
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:09,959
Right now,
I'd be going mad.

689
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:13,102
Yeah.

690
01:03:13,174 --> 01:03:14,937
Mr. Knox,
we need the tape.

691
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:29,513
She...
this is private.

692
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:33,492
- In what sense?
- She's upset.

693
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,395
She wasn't expecting anyone
to listen to it.

694
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:41,693
I'll make sure
this is returned to you.

695
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:58,581
- You didn't wake me up last night.
- I got in late.

696
01:03:58,652 --> 01:04:00,779
What's with the face?

697
01:04:00,854 --> 01:04:03,379
- I fell over.
- You were pissed?

698
01:04:03,457 --> 01:04:04,583
A little.

699
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,625
Come on, kids.

700
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:09,526
You packed your bag, Hannah?

701
01:04:36,557 --> 01:04:38,855
- Quickly. Come on.
- Hi!

702
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:40,757
- Hi.
- Hi.

703
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:44,590
Seatbelts on, quickly.

704
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,030
- Nik got in late last night.
- Got nothing better to do than spying?

705
01:04:51,105 --> 01:04:52,163
Jane: What?

706
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:57,304
- What?
- You know,

707
01:04:57,378 --> 01:05:01,314
don't invite Nik in for coffee
when I'm not here.

708
01:05:01,348 --> 01:05:02,246
All right?

709
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,944
Paula?! Hey.

710
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:14,723
That's
the appointment book.

711
01:05:14,795 --> 01:05:17,889
All her notes and session tapes
are kept in a filing cabinet.

712
01:05:17,965 --> 01:05:20,024
- Do you mind?
- No.

713
01:05:22,603 --> 01:05:25,868
- How was she yesterday?
- All right.

714
01:05:25,939 --> 01:05:29,466
Is she the kind of person
that would get into a stranger's car?

715
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:30,942
No.

716
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,979
Not after what happened
to her daughter.

717
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:38,908
Sarah, I'd like you to print me
a list of her current clients,

718
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:42,319
- addresses and phone numbers too.
- Is that ethical?

719
01:05:43,457 --> 01:05:45,049
Probably not.

720
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:35,391
(baby crying)

721
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:54,602
Sonja, on tape:
It's not that he might have...

722
01:08:55,682 --> 01:08:58,378
slept with
another woman...

723
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,046
it's that
he might not tell me.

724
01:09:04,124 --> 01:09:06,183
That would be
the betrayal.

725
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,355
Somers:
Do you still love him?

726
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:31,342
Good evening.
Richard Morecroft with ABC News.

727
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,352
The police are inquiring

728
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:37,186
into the disappearance of a woman
in Bushland, north of the city.

729
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:41,557
Psychiatrist Valerie Somers
was last seen on Friday night.

730
01:09:41,628 --> 01:09:45,462
Her car was found abandoned
along the Lower Ridge Road.

731
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:49,263
She might have accepted a lift
from a passing motorist.

732
01:09:49,336 --> 01:09:51,998
Ms. Somers has recently
completed a book

733
01:09:52,072 --> 01:09:54,165
about the murder
of her own daughter.

734
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:56,903
The body of 11 -year-old
Eleanor Knox

735
01:09:56,977 --> 01:10:00,344
was found dumped in a city
laneway 18 months ago.

736
01:10:00,414 --> 01:10:03,042
Police are appealing
to the public for information

737
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,744
regarding
Ms. Somers' disappearance.

738
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:39,004
Why do you think
she turned off the freeway?

739
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:41,343
Some people say
it's shorter.

740
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:43,714
Who's Patrick?

741
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:47,110
I don't know.

742
01:11:48,455 --> 01:11:51,515
She mentioned she was having
some trouble with a client.

743
01:11:51,591 --> 01:11:53,422
What kind of trouble?

744
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:56,394
She didn't go into it.
She doesn't talk about her clients.

745
01:11:56,463 --> 01:11:58,693
- Why not?
- It's unprofessional.

746
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:01,529
- Even between husband and wife?
- Yes.

747
01:12:04,137 --> 01:12:07,004
- I tell my wife everything.
- That surprises me.

748
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,405
Why?

749
01:12:08,475 --> 01:12:10,773
Most men hold
something back.

750
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,740
You're some kind
of academic, aren't you?

751
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:20,650
I'm Dean of Law.

752
01:12:20,721 --> 01:12:23,622
I studied at Harvard.
That's where Valerie and I met.

753
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:29,259
I don't understand why she'd get
into a car with a stranger.

754
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,265
Maybe she didn't.

755
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,392
Maybe she knew him.

756
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:41,904
- How's your marriage been lately?
- Fine. How's yours?

757
01:12:41,975 --> 01:12:44,034
Up and down.
Where were you Friday night?

758
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:46,136
Am I a suspect in
my wife's disappearance?

759
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:48,181
Where were you
Friday night?

760
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:50,182
I was at work.

761
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,411
Can anybody verify that?

762
01:12:52,486 --> 01:12:54,784
No, I was alone.

763
01:12:54,855 --> 01:12:56,948
Nobody saw me.

764
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:04,625
Nine times out of 10
when a wife goes missing,

765
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:07,394
the husband knows
something about it.

766
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,129
You're a prick.

767
01:13:12,839 --> 01:13:15,706
The young constable
will give you a ride.

768
01:13:20,614 --> 01:13:23,082
Patrick, on tape:
Anyway, we've been

769
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,777
seeing each other
for a while.

770
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:26,614
Somers:
And you like him?

771
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,081
Patrick: Yes, I do.

772
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:32,121
Very much.

773
01:13:32,192 --> 01:13:33,557
Somers: So?

774
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:37,019
Patrick:
He comes encumbered...

775
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:39,327
with a wife.

776
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:57,144
- Don't you have a home to go to?
- Yes. Do you?

777
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,913
Did you find anything?

778
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:02,386
She dedicated
the book to John.

779
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:04,446
"For teaching me
to trust again."

780
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,652
- Did you listen to Phelan's tapes?
- Yeah.

781
01:14:07,727 --> 01:14:10,355
- What did you think?
- She didn't like the man.

782
01:14:14,234 --> 01:14:16,259
Go home.
You got an early start.

783
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:19,362
- What about you?
- Soon.

784
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:20,531
Okay.

785
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,512
You really look like shit.
Go home.

786
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:31,915
Thank you.

787
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:34,146
Talked to mystery man yet?

788
01:14:35,589 --> 01:14:37,420
He never came back.

789
01:14:39,326 --> 01:14:40,918
Silly bugger.

790
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:48,694
(door opens)

791
01:14:54,774 --> 01:14:56,799
I'm not asleep.

792
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,111
Did you watch the news?

793
01:15:03,216 --> 01:15:04,808
Yeah.

794
01:15:06,186 --> 01:15:07,585
Will you find her?

795
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,117
It's not looking good.

796
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:18,296
I saw her client list,
Sonja.

797
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:22,262
Why didn't you tell me?

798
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:31,568
Because it was private.

799
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,841
It was just something
I had to do.

800
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,383
There was a time when there was
no private between you and me.

801
01:16:06,513 --> 01:16:09,482
That is because I had somebody
I could talk to.

802
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:11,676
- I have to tell you something...
- I have to tell you...

803
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:13,582
I had an affair.

804
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:23,459
I slept with her twice.

805
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:30,864
I know it hurts you.

806
01:16:30,937 --> 01:16:32,564
It hurts her...

807
01:16:37,544 --> 01:16:38,977
Why?

808
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:43,709
Because I'm numb.

809
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,152
I can't feel
anything anymore.

810
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,218
Just totally
fucking numb.

811
01:17:09,843 --> 01:17:11,674
Why did you sleep
on the couch?

812
01:17:11,745 --> 01:17:15,340
I came in late last night.
I didn't want to wake your mama.

813
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:18,917
Are you fighting?

814
01:17:20,854 --> 01:17:23,914
- Yeah, a bit.
- Boy: Why?

815
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:27,619
There's something
we've got to sort out.

816
01:17:27,694 --> 01:17:30,424
- You all right, Mom?
- Yeah.

817
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,624
I'll be in the car.

818
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,628
Can you grab something to eat?
We're running late.

819
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,012
Are we gonna
talk about this?

820
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:53,519
Or you just going to punish me?
This is how you're gonna punish me?

821
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:56,344
I fucked up.

822
01:17:56,423 --> 01:17:59,221
- People fuck up.
- Really? I don't.

823
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:03,388
You know what's so easy?
It's easy to go and find somebody.

824
01:18:03,463 --> 01:18:07,729
You know what's hard?
What's hard is not to.

825
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:09,792
Sonja, listen.
I just want...

826
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,700
Get off me.

827
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,705
God.

828
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:17,106
We'll talk about this
tonight, all right?

829
01:18:17,177 --> 01:18:19,509
Oh... get fucked!

830
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:22,013
I don't even know
if I'll be here later.

831
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:34,254
Hi.

832
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:37,324
Did you know?

833
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,644
You're ready?

834
01:19:58,044 --> 01:19:59,477
Pete?

835
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:01,241
It's me.

836
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:04,974
Can you come over?

837
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:19,124
- What number is it?
- 406.

838
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,870
You sure
you're up to this?

839
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:34,378
Mr. Phelan.

840
01:20:34,447 --> 01:20:37,211
We're investigating the disappearance
of Valerie Somers.

841
01:20:37,283 --> 01:20:39,274
We were hoping
you could help us.

842
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:44,421
It's not a good time.
(clears his throat)

843
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:47,721
- Patrick: I was out late.
- Who with?

844
01:20:48,995 --> 01:20:51,896
Mr. Phelan,
the woman's missing.

845
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:06,335
- You know what's happened to her?
- Not yet.

846
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:09,643
You had an appointment with her?
Can you tell us how she was?

847
01:21:11,517 --> 01:21:14,645
She seemed all right.
I don't know.

848
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:16,245
You don't know?

849
01:21:16,322 --> 01:21:20,588
She's the therapist.
I wasn't focused on how she was.

850
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,321
How do you
get along with her?

851
01:21:22,395 --> 01:21:25,057
- Fine.
- Leon: That's it?

852
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,564
Fine?

853
01:21:29,535 --> 01:21:32,197
We didn't end our last session
on very good terms.

854
01:21:32,272 --> 01:21:34,137
Leon:
Why is that?

855
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:36,767
- We disagreed about something.
- What was that?

856
01:21:36,843 --> 01:21:39,812
What? That guy
you've been fucking?

857
01:21:39,879 --> 01:21:42,473
- Leon: Married guy?
- How did you know about that?

858
01:21:42,548 --> 01:21:44,948
- She records all her sessions.
- That's private...

859
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:48,510
- Yes, but under the circumstances...
- That's my life!

860
01:21:51,491 --> 01:21:53,220
Is there somebody
in that room?

861
01:21:53,293 --> 01:21:55,523
Who is it?
Your boyfriend?

862
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:59,053
- Could you ask him to come out?
- He has nothing...

863
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:00,326
- Leon!
- What's the matter with you?

864
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,300
- You don't have the right...
- Who are you?!

865
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,461
You have
no fucking right!

866
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:14,612
Finished?

867
01:22:23,122 --> 01:22:24,783
That went well.

868
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,348
Your marriage is falling apart
and so are you.

869
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:31,261
- It's none of your business.
- It is if you can't do your job!

870
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:33,697
If you don't like the way
I'm handling things,

871
01:22:33,766 --> 01:22:35,757
take it up at the station.

872
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:37,769
Push.

873
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:28,046
- (dialing)
- (ringing)

874
01:23:29,122 --> 01:23:30,783
(phone ringing)

875
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,384
- Hello?
- Leon: Dylan?

876
01:23:35,461 --> 01:23:36,393
Hi, Dad.

877
01:23:38,498 --> 01:23:40,625
Could I speak to your mom?

878
01:23:43,403 --> 01:23:45,701
No, she's still
pissed off at you.

879
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:49,602
All right.

880
01:23:49,675 --> 01:23:51,666
Tell her...

881
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:55,680
- tell her I'll be home soon.
- All right. See you, Dad.

882
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:59,574
What did he say?

883
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:04,621
He said that he's sorry,
that he loves you,

884
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:07,420
and he wants you to stop
being angry with him.

885
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,850
You look bereft, Leon.

886
01:24:36,923 --> 01:24:38,948
The other question is,
why don't you?

887
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:43,861
Don't be deceived
by appearances.

888
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,795
Want a whiskey?

889
01:24:52,038 --> 01:24:54,506
Leon: Somebody
may have hurt your wife.

890
01:24:54,574 --> 01:24:57,941
- I need to know if it was you.
- I didn't hurt her.

891
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,240
- She was upset on the phone.
- She was afraid.

892
01:25:00,313 --> 01:25:02,304
- Of what?
- Of being alone.

893
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:05,077
Of me not being
there for her.

894
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:06,778
Why weren't you
there for her?

895
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:13,925
While your wife
was in some phone box,

896
01:25:13,993 --> 01:25:17,759
calling for your help,
where were you?

897
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:21,156
Are you seeing someone else?

898
01:25:21,234 --> 01:25:23,259
- Is it an affair?
- No.

899
01:25:23,336 --> 01:25:25,270
With a man?
Is that what's going on?

900
01:25:25,338 --> 01:25:28,899
I believe that's what
Valerie thought was going on.

901
01:25:28,975 --> 01:25:30,602
What are you
talking about?

902
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:34,612
For some reason, she believe
you were involved with Patrick Phelan.

903
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,013
Is that it?
Were you seeing men on the side?

904
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:40,177
- I don't have to listen to this?
- Yes, you do.

905
01:25:40,253 --> 01:25:42,653
My wife's out there somewhere.
What are you doing about it?

906
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,622
I'm trying to find her.

907
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,056
But I need to know
what's inside her head.

908
01:25:47,126 --> 01:25:48,923
I don't know.

909
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,827
I don't know.

910
01:26:00,006 --> 01:26:02,099
Have you ever
cheated on your wife?

911
01:26:06,145 --> 01:26:07,373
No.

912
01:26:07,446 --> 01:26:10,643
- Never desired another woman?
- Yes, of course.

913
01:26:10,716 --> 01:26:12,274
- But you never acted on it?
- No.

914
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:14,751
Well, you're
a better man than I am.

915
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:17,448
So there is someone else?

916
01:26:17,523 --> 01:26:19,320
No.

917
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:23,090
There was someone once.

918
01:26:23,162 --> 01:26:24,686
A woman.

919
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:29,525
Once that's happened, you're never
entirely believed again.

920
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,627
Something gets broken,

921
01:26:31,704 --> 01:26:34,264
permanently.
Trust, I suppose.

922
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,309
When that happens,
anything's possible, it would seem.

923
01:26:41,013 --> 01:26:44,710
You don't lose a daughter,
like we lost Eleanor,

924
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:47,719
without some damage.

925
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:51,689
So where were you?

926
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:57,088
I left work late.

927
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:03,200
I stopped at the place
where my daughter was killed.

928
01:27:03,269 --> 01:27:06,204
I go there... a lot.

929
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,976
- Valerie didn't know that.
- You didn't tell her?

930
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:15,477
Why not, John?

931
01:27:23,856 --> 01:27:26,347
What holds
your marriage together, Leon?

932
01:27:34,533 --> 01:27:35,830
Loyalty?

933
01:27:36,902 --> 01:27:37,869
Love?

934
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:42,831
Maybe habits sometimes,
passion, our kids.

935
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:49,037
Ours was held together
by grief.

936
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,712
There wasn't
much else left.

937
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,550
You didn't love her
anymore?

938
01:27:56,622 --> 01:28:01,321
I'm saying that sometimes,
love isn't enough.

939
01:28:11,737 --> 01:28:13,068
Claudia: Leon!

940
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:14,572
Where the hell
have you been?

941
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,905
We got a call from a man,
saying his wife saw a neighbor

942
01:28:17,977 --> 01:28:21,413
throw a shoe into a vacant lot
on the night Valerie disappeared.

943
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,812
She's got the shoe.
Black leather.

944
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,851
Where are we going?

945
01:28:34,927 --> 01:28:37,555
- This could be tricky.
- Why?

946
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:40,927
I know the woman.

947
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,695
Oh Jesus!

948
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:51,332
(knocking on door)

949
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:56,210
- Detective Claudia Weis.
- Leon!

950
01:28:57,283 --> 01:28:59,979
- We had a drink the other night.
- How are you?

951
01:29:00,052 --> 01:29:01,019
Good.

952
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:03,248
You'd better come in.
My wife's pretty upset.

953
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:12,326
Pete: Jane, it's the police.

954
01:29:12,398 --> 01:29:15,162
- This is Leon and...
- Claudia.

955
01:29:15,234 --> 01:29:17,099
- and Claudia. Jane.
- Is that the shoe?

956
01:29:17,169 --> 01:29:19,137
Yeah.

957
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:23,139
You shouldn't have touched the shoe,

958
01:29:23,209 --> 01:29:24,904
- Mrs...?
- O'May.

959
01:29:24,977 --> 01:29:26,968
It's Jane O'May.

960
01:29:27,046 --> 01:29:29,105
Right, Mrs. O'May,
you shouldn't have touched it.

961
01:29:30,182 --> 01:29:31,376
Well, I did.

962
01:29:32,518 --> 01:29:35,112
Yeah, but you shouldn't have.

963
01:29:35,187 --> 01:29:37,678
Well, I did, didn't I?

964
01:29:37,757 --> 01:29:39,418
It's on the table.

965
01:29:40,493 --> 01:29:43,155
- Could we have some coffee?
- Yeah.

966
01:29:43,229 --> 01:29:45,026
It's out
the back here. Thanks.

967
01:29:45,097 --> 01:29:46,997
I'll give you a hand.

968
01:30:03,582 --> 01:30:05,243
(whispering)
Are you all right?

969
01:30:08,721 --> 01:30:11,986
- Have you got a light?
- Yeah.

970
01:30:17,029 --> 01:30:18,826
How do you want to handle this?

971
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:23,467
You're a policeman, aren't you?

972
01:30:23,536 --> 01:30:25,766
Why don't you just do your job?

973
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,004
I've never seen you before.

974
01:30:34,747 --> 01:30:37,045
Nik:
Can I speak to Paula, please?

975
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:40,642
Nik: It's urgent.

976
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,483
Can you tell her to
call me as soon as she can?

977
01:30:43,556 --> 01:30:45,615
Yes, as soon as she can, please.

978
01:30:49,595 --> 01:30:51,358
(knocking on door)

979
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,330
Leave it!
Go get your brother.

980
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:02,363
Nik D'Amato? Detective
Claudia Weis, City Central.

981
01:31:02,441 --> 01:31:05,842
My kids. I need
someone to watch my kids.

982
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,805
Right. I'll give you
a couple of minutes.

983
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,888
Jane: So I go to the window,

984
01:31:19,959 --> 01:31:21,586
at about 11:30.

985
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:24,185
I go to the window,
and he's chucking that.

986
01:31:24,263 --> 01:31:26,493
and he threw it over there,

987
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,897
and he was looking
like he was...

988
01:31:28,968 --> 01:31:31,095
really guilty.

989
01:31:50,623 --> 01:31:52,352
(knocking on door)

990
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,415
Nik.

991
01:31:54,493 --> 01:31:56,222
Nik: You're back, Pete?

992
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,158
Only sort of.

993
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:03,596
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

994
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:06,331
I'm in a bit of trouble.

995
01:32:07,406 --> 01:32:10,034
Can you take the kids?

996
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,701
Just till Paula gets back.

997
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,942
Nik: I wouldn't ask
unless I really needed help.

998
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:25,288
We'll take them.

999
01:32:25,357 --> 01:32:27,154
Thanks.

1000
01:32:27,226 --> 01:32:29,126
Here you go.

1001
01:32:30,296 --> 01:32:31,661
Nik: Thanks.

1002
01:32:32,731 --> 01:32:36,565
There's pajamas, toothbrush...

1003
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:39,570
there's a video and some
other stuff in there as well.

1004
01:32:40,706 --> 01:32:42,264
Thanks very much, okay?

1005
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:44,172
It's time to go.

1006
01:32:44,243 --> 01:32:47,041
No, Daddy, don't go.
Don't go!

1007
01:32:47,112 --> 01:32:49,876
Come on.
I'll be back soon.

1008
01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:52,611
- Come on.
- No! No!

1009
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:00,552
How did you get the
scratches on your face?

1010
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:05,887
- I want to see my wife.
- She's on her way.

1011
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,061
Can you tell us where
you were Friday night?

1012
01:33:13,138 --> 01:33:14,867
I want to see Paula.

1013
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,306
You are in deep shit, mate.

1014
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:19,173
Your wife can't help you.

1015
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:23,004
- Do I know you?
- I doubt it.

1016
01:33:24,383 --> 01:33:27,147
- I've seen you before.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1017
01:33:33,392 --> 01:33:36,293
- You were next door at Jane's place.
- I told you to shut up!

1018
01:33:45,437 --> 01:33:47,302
Where are my kids?

1019
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,967
- Where are my bloody kids?!
- With your neighbor.

1020
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:51,805
- Who are you?
- Calm down.

1021
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:55,313
- I don't want to be calm.
- Can I get you something?

1022
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:57,406
Yes, you can get
me my husband.

1023
01:33:57,483 --> 01:34:00,316
- And get me out of here!
- Can you just step in here?

1024
01:34:09,028 --> 01:34:10,893
Mrs. D'Amato.

1025
01:34:10,963 --> 01:34:14,194
I'm Detective Sergeant Zat.

1026
01:34:14,266 --> 01:34:17,099
I believe you met
Detective Constable Weis.

1027
01:34:18,203 --> 01:34:19,830
I want to see Nik.

1028
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:23,204
Your husband is helping us
with our inquiries.

1029
01:34:23,275 --> 01:34:25,106
Bullshit.

1030
01:34:26,845 --> 01:34:29,871
He was seen throwing a shoe
into a vacant lot.

1031
01:34:31,683 --> 01:34:33,310
Who saw him?

1032
01:34:33,385 --> 01:34:37,719
A search was conducted
in the block opposite your house.

1033
01:34:38,957 --> 01:34:40,083
Mmm?

1034
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:41,592
Another one?

1035
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,187
My kids play there.
Every kid on the street plays there.

1036
01:34:46,265 --> 01:34:48,096
They found the shoe.

1037
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:51,364
It was identified as belonging
to Ms. Valerie Somers.

1038
01:34:51,437 --> 01:34:54,167
She's been missing
since last Friday night.

1039
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:03,911
Paula!

1040
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:15,149
- Jane: Hello?
- Janey, it's Paula.

1041
01:35:15,227 --> 01:35:16,694
Hi.

1042
01:35:18,097 --> 01:35:19,724
Paula: Is Andrew awake?

1043
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:22,062
Your kids are fine.

1044
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:25,297
- You know?
- Maybe I could talk to Hannah.

1045
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:28,339
Jane: No, she's asleep.

1046
01:35:28,407 --> 01:35:32,503
- Paula: The baby?
- You know what? They're all asleep.

1047
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:36,005
Sorry about this, Janey.

1048
01:35:37,749 --> 01:35:39,944
Nik's in trouble.

1049
01:35:40,018 --> 01:35:43,215
They won't let me see him.
I don't know what to do.

1050
01:35:43,288 --> 01:35:46,348
You know what?
It's okay.

1051
01:35:46,425 --> 01:35:48,052
Everything's okay.

1052
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:49,958
Jane: Your kids are really safe.

1053
01:35:50,028 --> 01:35:52,019
I'm sorry.

1054
01:35:55,033 --> 01:35:57,228
I'll get there as soon as I can.

1055
01:35:57,302 --> 01:36:00,203
- Okay.
- Paula: Thank you.

1056
01:36:00,272 --> 01:36:01,933
Bye, Janey.

1057
01:36:07,813 --> 01:36:09,974
Does she know
you rang the police?

1058
01:36:11,116 --> 01:36:12,208
No.

1059
01:36:35,641 --> 01:36:37,506
They say you've...

1060
01:36:38,577 --> 01:36:40,602
hurt some woman, Nik.

1061
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,482
I didn't, babe.

1062
01:36:55,861 --> 01:36:57,328
I didn't touch her.

1063
01:37:45,177 --> 01:37:48,010
Don't. Not yet.

1064
01:37:51,817 --> 01:37:54,615
- What is it, Hannah?
- The baby's sick.

1065
01:37:59,091 --> 01:38:01,355
What is it?

1066
01:38:01,426 --> 01:38:02,893
What is it?

1067
01:38:04,563 --> 01:38:06,360
He's burning up.

1068
01:38:06,431 --> 01:38:09,832
- Get us a flannel. A wet one.
- Panadol.

1069
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,233
- What?
- He needs Panadol.

1070
01:38:12,304 --> 01:38:13,566
Panadol.

1071
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:18,003
- Poor little thing.
- It's all right for babies?

1072
01:38:18,076 --> 01:38:21,307
- I don't know. Only get half.
- Baby Panadol.

1073
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,405
- What?
- Baby Panadol.

1074
01:38:23,482 --> 01:38:27,475
- You'll have to go to the chemist's.
- There's some at our house.

1075
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:54,305
I'd met some mates for a drink.

1076
01:38:54,379 --> 01:38:57,974
We used to work together.
It's something we keep up.

1077
01:39:00,385 --> 01:39:03,877
We drank more than we should have,
so I took the backroad.

1078
01:39:04,956 --> 01:39:07,447
The police don't patrol it.

1079
01:39:09,795 --> 01:39:12,093
It must have been about...

1080
01:39:12,164 --> 01:39:14,064
a quarter to 12:00...

1081
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:19,302
and I see this woman standing
at the side of the road.

1082
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:21,362
I don't want to stop.

1083
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:25,399
It's late, and I'm thinking
Paula will get worried.

1084
01:39:25,477 --> 01:39:28,207
But what do I do?
The woman needs help.

1085
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,474
So I pull over.

1086
01:39:31,616 --> 01:39:33,607
My car ran off the road.

1087
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:36,845
Get in.

1088
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:46,354
Thanks.

1089
01:39:52,537 --> 01:39:54,198
What's your name?

1090
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:56,965
Valerie.

1091
01:39:57,042 --> 01:39:58,737
I'm Nik.

1092
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:05,581
Nik: It turns out she lives
in one of those houses by the Bay.

1093
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:08,141
There's a string
of houses along there.

1094
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:11,451
It's out of my way.
It's in the opposite direction.

1095
01:40:12,524 --> 01:40:14,617
She doesn't say much.

1096
01:40:14,693 --> 01:40:16,456
I can tell she doesn't want
to talk, so I just...

1097
01:40:16,528 --> 01:40:17,927
leave it.

1098
01:40:24,035 --> 01:40:25,696
But I know this shortcut

1099
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:29,138
and I just don't...
I just don't think.

1100
01:40:33,011 --> 01:40:36,174
And before I can say,
"This is the short way,"

1101
01:40:36,248 --> 01:40:38,079
she's gone.

1102
01:40:39,351 --> 01:40:41,251
What do you mean,
she's gone?

1103
01:41:03,575 --> 01:41:04,507
Hey!

1104
01:41:06,244 --> 01:41:07,438
Wait!

1105
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,695
Nik:
I'm not going to hurt you.

1106
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,569
Trust me!

1107
01:41:47,085 --> 01:41:48,712
(gasp)

1108
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:57,885
You know...

1109
01:41:59,764 --> 01:42:01,356
I thought that...

1110
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,801
if I'd leave her alone...

1111
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:08,198
she'd stop
being afraid of me.

1112
01:42:12,177 --> 01:42:13,508
I just...

1113
01:42:15,647 --> 01:42:17,979
I just left her there.

1114
01:42:27,158 --> 01:42:29,592
When I got home,
I saw her...

1115
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:34,590
I saw her shoe

1116
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:37,533
on the floor of my car.

1117
01:42:42,641 --> 01:42:44,233
And l...

1118
01:42:48,446 --> 01:42:51,745
Jesus, I just wanted
to help the woman...

1119
01:42:55,487 --> 01:42:57,421
Why didn't you report it, Nik?

1120
01:42:59,124 --> 01:43:02,252
Because I thought
she'd be all right.

1121
01:43:03,328 --> 01:43:05,728
I thought she'd find
her way out of there.

1122
01:43:10,869 --> 01:43:12,427
Then when l...

1123
01:43:14,706 --> 01:43:16,833
and when
I saw her on the news...

1124
01:43:17,976 --> 01:43:20,672
that she was missing, l...

1125
01:43:28,386 --> 01:43:31,844
By then who was going
to believe me?

1126
01:43:44,903 --> 01:43:46,495
Thank you...

1127
01:43:47,572 --> 01:43:49,335
for letting me know.

1128
01:43:50,909 --> 01:43:52,376
Bye.

1129
01:44:19,104 --> 01:44:21,572
Paula? Come in.

1130
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:23,369
Hi.

1131
01:44:28,713 --> 01:44:30,772
Hey, sweetie.

1132
01:44:34,285 --> 01:44:37,686
- Paula: Daddy will be home soon.
- Maybe they can come back later.

1133
01:44:37,756 --> 01:44:41,556
- They've been so good for me.
- No, I don't think so.

1134
01:44:43,561 --> 01:44:44,858
Paula.

1135
01:44:46,031 --> 01:44:47,999
He didn't do it, Jane.

1136
01:44:50,802 --> 01:44:52,497
How do you know?

1137
01:44:55,974 --> 01:44:57,532
He told me.

1138
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:06,444
Paula?

1139
01:45:07,886 --> 01:45:09,820
Jane:
What could I do, Paula?

1140
01:45:11,589 --> 01:45:12,749
All right.

1141
01:45:12,824 --> 01:45:16,123
Go inside and put
your bags in your rooms.

1142
01:45:31,342 --> 01:45:33,003
Stupid...

1143
01:45:35,547 --> 01:45:38,038
You've got no right, Jane!

1144
01:45:38,116 --> 01:45:40,050
You hear me?!

1145
01:45:40,118 --> 01:45:42,052
You have no fucking right!

1146
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:45,419
I don't want to see you
anywhere near my kids again.

1147
01:47:39,671 --> 01:47:42,367
I was home, Leon.

1148
01:47:47,779 --> 01:47:50,145
I didn't pick up the phone.

1149
01:47:54,252 --> 01:47:56,686
Valerie on tape:
John? There's a man...

1150
01:47:56,754 --> 01:47:58,517
Patrick.

1151
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:00,683
He's a client and he's...

1152
01:48:00,758 --> 01:48:02,589
he's gay.

1153
01:48:04,929 --> 01:48:08,922
I don't understand this.
I don't understand...

1154
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,331
us...

1155
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:12,528
anymore.

1156
01:48:12,604 --> 01:48:16,267
I don't want this
to be happening to us.

1157
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:20,878
Oh... there are lights.

1158
01:48:20,945 --> 01:48:23,607
There's a car coming.
I'll wave it down.

1159
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:28,708
Wait for me.
We'll talk when I get home, okay?

1160
01:48:28,786 --> 01:48:30,481
Bye.

1161
01:48:30,555 --> 01:48:32,785
I love you.

1162
01:48:34,826 --> 01:48:36,259
(machine beeps)

1163
01:48:39,864 --> 01:48:42,992
I thought she would come home.

1164
01:49:40,325 --> 01:49:43,726
Sonja, on tape:
It's not that he might have...

1165
01:49:43,795 --> 01:49:46,389
slept with another woman.

1166
01:49:48,599 --> 01:49:49,861
It's...

1167
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,027
that he might not tell me.

1168
01:49:55,974 --> 01:49:58,204
That would be the betrayal.

1169
01:50:02,146 --> 01:50:04,273
Valerie:
Do you still love him?

1170
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:15,188
Sonja: Yeah.

1171
01:50:15,259 --> 01:50:17,022
I still love him.

1172
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:08,161
I don't want to lose you.

1173
01:52:10,274 --> 01:52:12,299
What?

1174
01:52:14,946 --> 01:52:17,813
I don't want to lose you.
I couldn't bear it.

1175
01:52:42,273 --> 01:52:44,138
(Spanish ballad playing)

1176
01:53:00,424 --> 01:53:02,858
(music continues)
