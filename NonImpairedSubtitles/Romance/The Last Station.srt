1
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,669
Darling?

2
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, darling.

3
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,028
But sex.

4
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,030
You are 23.

5
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,200
Not an easy age for abstinence, is it?

6
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,410
Tolstoy does not approve
of sexual relations.

7
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,704
- I know this.
- He despises them, in fact.

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,291
Well, I don't mean
to belabor the point...

9
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,920
...but last summer
I arranged for a manservant...

10
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,923
...who proceeded to ruin
two housemaids, just like that.

11
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,132
He was very upset.

12
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,052
This would not be a problem with me.
I'm a vegetarian.

13
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,637
I am celibate.

14
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,347
I'm also a vegetarian.

15
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,476
My dear boy, if you were to become
Tolstoy's private secretary...

16
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,270
...you would be given a great gift.

17
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,940
Vladimir Grigorevich, please know
that I understand what a privilege...

18
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,401
...this position presents.

19
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,072
But since becoming a Tolstoyan,
I have become so eager to learn...

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,950
...to discuss ideas,
to perfect my very soul.

21
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,578
Yes. Well...

22
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,957
We have a lot to do
if we are to get his work to the people.

23
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,877
- We?
- Yes, we.

24
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,047
If we can encourage the spread
of passive resistance...

25
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,633
...just think of it, Valentin.

26
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,887
Thousands of ordinary Russians...

27
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,599
...casting off centuries of political
and spiritual oppression.

28
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,853
- In the name of truth and freedom.
- Truth and freedom. Yes, yes.

29
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,815
But, still,
there are many, many enemies.

30
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,443
- Enemies?
- Come.

31
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,695
The czar's police.

32
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,906
You will be followed
when you leave here...

33
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,492
...and the Church will stop at nothing
to bring him back into the fold.

34
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,746
And then, of course,
there is the countess.

35
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,458
Her dogged attachment
to private property...

36
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,461
...her public criticism
of our movement.

37
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,339
But the point is...

38
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,300
...he needs a man
of your intellectual gifts around him.

39
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,510
Someone who understands
his goals.

40
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,221
And they still won't let me see him.

41
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,265
They keep me under house arrest.

42
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,771
I have another task for you, my dear.

43
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,359
I want you to keep a diary for me.

44
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,864
I need to know
what goes on at Yasnaya Polyana.

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,991
You let me know
who visits the house...

46
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,828
...any talk of the copyright to his work,
any contact with the Church...

47
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,206
...anything the countess says.

48
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,042
- Anything?
- She's very, very dangerous.

49
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,051
Godspeed, my boy.

50
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,553
And remember what I said.

51
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,682
Write everything down.

52
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,559
Driver!

53
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,919
Good morning, countess.

54
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,463
- Are you rolling?
- I am.

55
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,425
Countess?

56
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,806
It doesn't matter.

57
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,517
If my heart stopped beating,
I'd still go riding today.

58
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,144
Your pulse is my responsibility.

59
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,229
- No. It's mine.
- Fine.

60
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,356
If you must ride,
I insist you wear a coat.

61
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,275
- Even the sun is cold today.
- Oh, this!

62
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,070
This is impossible!
These people are parasites!

63
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,824
"The Countess Tolstoy
is estranged from her husband.

64
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,410
They barely speak."

65
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,620
And they gossip about us in Paris.

66
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,457
"They do not share a similar view
of religion or politics."

67
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,958
You think that's inaccurate?

68
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,085
I think it's none
of the world's business.

69
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,254
What are you doing?
Why do you write down...

70
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,048
...everything we say?
Don't do that.

71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,967
Dushan Petrovich,
you are scribbling again.

72
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,513
Oh, Leovochka, why do you insist
on dressing like that?

73
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,808
- What do you mean, like what?
- Like the man who looks after sheep.

74
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,977
It wasn't meant to offend you.

75
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,938
You're a count, for God's sake.

76
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,732
Darling, where are you going?

77
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,443
Riding with Sasha.
Don't expect us for lunch.

78
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,653
Lev Nikolayevich,
you've forgotten your coat.

79
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,988
Dushan, are you fretting?

80
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,991
Yes, because you refuse
to look after yourself.

81
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,123
Telyatinki was created
by Vladimir Grigorevich...

82
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,375
...as a center for the movement.

83
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:44,046
We're all equals here, you know,
as Tolstoy teaches us.

84
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,298
This is a place of freedom.

85
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,097
It's a beautiful day.

86
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,683
Yes, but we'll pay for it.

87
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,227
Toolshed is there.

88
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,605
That's the meeting room,
and this is the dormitory.

89
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,149
I found it!

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,818
- Afternoon.
- Yes, hello.

91
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,612
You are expected at Yasnaya Polyana
in the morning...

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,156
...first thing.
- First thing?

93
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,950
You'll need to be on the road early.
It's two hours away.

94
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,871
- I look forward to it.
- Yes. You're lucky.

95
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,414
We're all envious.

96
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,841
I'll see you in the morning.

97
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,093
If we're spared.

98
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,186
Right.

99
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,022
And out.

100
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,483
In.

101
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,281
Emma, can you come?
We need you in the house.

102
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,622
Come in.

103
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,422
- Brought you a glass of tea.
- That's very kind of you.

104
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,261
It's your first day.

105
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,055
Enjoy it.

106
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,437
You met Sergeyenko?

107
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,190
Last night, yes.

108
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,276
What do you think?

109
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,695
I thought he seemed very sincere.

110
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,239
Thank you.

111
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,908
What?

112
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,661
- Is that what you think?
- I think that...

113
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,999
I think I've just arrived.
What was your name?

114
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,461
Masha. But you should still say
what you think.

115
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,838
I mean, not just about him.

116
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,173
Like we all should.

117
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,009
Yes.

118
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,141
Excuse me.

119
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,480
Thank you for the tea.

120
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,739
He's a sorry, old, tight-assed
stick-in-the-mud...

121
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,993
...but, yes, he's sincere.

122
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,417
Hello?

123
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,629
Out of the way.

124
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,759
Hello?

125
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,929
Excuse me.

126
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,264
You.

127
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,433
- You're the new secretary?
- Yes.

128
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,435
Valentin Fedorovich Bulgakov.

129
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,189
Papa is out.
You can wait upstairs in the library.

130
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,816
I am so glad you're here.

131
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,446
I'm so glad.

132
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,078
- God bless you.
- Pardon me. I'm mortified.

133
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,415
I sneeze sometimes
when I get nervous.

134
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,709
Yes.

135
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,255
Now, Vladimir Grigorevich has already
written about you at lengths.

136
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,342
I don't need that.
What I do need is your help.

137
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,178
My manifesto against the government
is hard work.

138
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,933
They commit their idiotic abuses
faster than I can catalog them.

139
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,226
Yes.

140
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,770
And then there's the new book,
the compendium.

141
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,605
Grigorevich told me all about it.

142
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,526
He says that you say that all the
world's religions share common truths.

143
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,361
- It's very exciting.
- No, one truth.

144
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,365
One single organizing principle.
And can you guess what that is?

145
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,078
Love. Love.

146
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,371
Simple.

147
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,624
Yeah, but I want to talk about you.

148
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,752
How are you?
And how was your journey?

149
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
Come, sit down.

150
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,259
I was born on that sofa.
No, no, sit, sit.

151
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,637
Myself, my brother, my children...

152
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,307
...five or six of them, at least.
Right here.

153
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,808
Congratulations.

154
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,689
Well, I've read your essays.

155
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,026
How's the work progressing?

156
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,242
My boy, what is it?

157
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,913
- Oh, I've upset you in some way.
- No.

158
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,749
Was it the sofa?
I mean, it's only a sofa.

159
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,876
The sofa's wonderful.

160
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,961
I...

161
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,339
I'm very happy.

162
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,091
You're very kind to me.

163
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,179
You see, I am no one...

164
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,474
...and you are Lev Tolstoy.

165
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,894
And you ask me about my work.

166
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,897
I'll fetch you a glass of tea.

167
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,774
- Yes.
- Now, you rest.

168
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,863
Yeah, because there's work
for both of us to do, together!

169
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,116
Yes.

170
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,577
God.

171
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,374
This machine, it really is
the most extraordinary thing.

172
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,292
Mama, these people have nothing.

173
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,337
No, it's not for lack of land
that the muzhiks live in poverty.

174
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,131
It's because they have no willpower
and drink too much.

175
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,593
I am not suggesting
they be given land.

176
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,762
Private property is the root
of the problem.

177
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,723
- We should be giving ours away.
- God. Giving it to whom?

178
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,059
Yes, exactly.
I mean, this is ridiculous.

179
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,312
You think because the peasants
are poor, they're morally superior.

180
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,565
I believe that wealth corrupts us all.

181
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,816
Yes, I do.

182
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,985
It's a keystone of the movement.

183
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,153
Oh, God, I know
all about the movement.

184
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,948
If the peasants had money...

185
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,409
...they wouldn't surround themselves,
as we do...

186
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,744
...with footmen costing 10 rubles
a month.

187
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,998
No, they'd spend it on drink
and whores.

188
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,001
Valentin Fedorovich.

189
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,502
- What do you think?
- Tea.

190
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,171
You think that 50 years from now,
people will eat...

191
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,842
...while grown men walk around
waiting on them hand and foot?

192
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,176
- I think...
- That's good.

193
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,598
- Bless you.
- Stop scribbling.

194
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,475
I mean, you all think he's Christ,
don't you?

195
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,478
- He thinks he's Christ.
- I'm not...

196
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,441
I don't believe Lev Nikolayevich
is Christ.

197
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,777
- Christ is Christ, but...
- But what?

198
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,155
I do believe he's one of the prophets.

199
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,656
God speaks through him.

200
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,660
- I recognize the cadence in his voice.
- Oh, God, this is unbearable.

201
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,955
No wonder I feel lonely.
I'm surrounded by morons.

202
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,833
- Ma, you're being ridiculous.
- Oh, am I?

203
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,962
I have to sit here and listen to this talk
of love and God and equality...

204
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,506
...knowing all the time, full well...

205
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,676
...that Count Generosity is about
to give away everything we own.

206
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,971
Now, why do you keep going on
about this?

207
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,683
Why do you think that we should profit
from the work I'm doing now?

208
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,977
Which is only meant for the sake
of the people.

209
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,688
Stop writing!

210
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,193
Stop writing now!

211
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,875
In defense of my gift,
please let me demonstrate.

212
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,044
It's quite remarkable, really.

213
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,428
In the same way now,
a society of hunger...

214
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,264
...full of segregation...

215
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,767
I understand...

216
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,729
...not only with my mindV or heart...
- It's... It's your voice.

217
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,607
...but with my soulV
that the existence...

218
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,776
...of tens of thousands...
- It's your voice.

219
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,778
It's wonderful. It's wonderful!

220
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,239
It's tiresome.

221
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,367
Another remarkable invention
will supersede it.

222
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,494
Please excuse me.

223
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,915
No matter what all the learned men
in the world say...

224
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,793
Lev Nikolayevich
is something of a Luddite, I fear.

225
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,795
It is a crime.

226
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,258
And one committed not once,
but constantly.

227
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,302
I knew that IV with my luxury...

228
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,163
That's better.

229
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,918
That's nice.

230
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,346
That's very nice indeed.

231
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,342
Do your parents
often speak to each other so bluntly?

232
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,553
Mama doesn't understand
my father's goals...

233
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,765
...not since his work as a novelist
became secondary.

234
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:06,520
His commitment to the spiritual life
offends her.

235
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,397
They've fought about it for years.

236
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,275
Well, I'm sure she means well by it.

237
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,783
I see a fine young man before me.
Clear eyes, nice features...

238
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,202
...rather handsome
in a peculiar sort of a way.

239
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,745
Thank you, countess.

240
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,914
Oh, please,
call me Sofya Andreyevna.

241
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:30,126
We don't stand on formality here,
as you may have noticed.

242
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,087
No, no.
So many young men nowadays...

243
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:37,008
...spoil their good looks
with loose living, but you...

244
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,263
...you're a real Tolstoyan,
I can tell that.

245
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,432
Well, thank you. I have to say,
I admire your husband immensely.

246
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,226
Oh, very good.

247
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,603
Excellent. He likes that.

248
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,357
Well, his ideas are beautiful.
Social justice, the very concept...

249
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,318
Yes, he's very grateful for the help
you've been giving him.

250
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,779
He told me that himself.
He's rather surprised...

251
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,448
...that a young man like you
can be quite so diligent.

252
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,034
When he was your age,
he was whoring in the Caucasus.

253
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,412
Couldn't get enough of it.

254
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,081
Yes, he wrote all about it.

255
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,711
He even gave me a copy,
so I could read all the details.

256
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,797
- Would you like some more jam?
- Yes, thank you.

257
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,050
- Have you read War and Peace?
- Yes, many times.

258
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,637
Twice.

259
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,641
You know, when Lev was writing it...
Oh, this was ages ago...

260
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,645
...long before Chertkov
created that monstrosity at Telyatinki...

261
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:35,275
...over all that fake religion
and revolutionary nonsense.

262
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,652
What do you think of Chertkov,
by the way?

263
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,070
Well, I think that he's...

264
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,034
He's given me
a wonderful opportunity.

265
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,494
Yes, but you can see
what a pompous fool he is...

266
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,915
...what a self-serving
puritanical idiot.

267
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,834
It's been very pleasant
since he's been locked in his house.

268
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,294
Right.

269
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,506
So, anyway, when he was writing it,
in the mid-'60s...

270
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,509
...he used to bring me pages
to copy every day...

271
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,138
...because I was the only one who
could understand his writing or notes.

272
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,724
Do you know I copied out
War and Peace six times?

273
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,851
Six times?

274
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,896
I could understand
his intentions too.

275
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:17,025
So every afternoon, we'd have tea
and we'd discuss changes.

276
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,234
And I'd say to him:

277
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,113
"Natasha wouldn't speak to Prince
Andrei like that. No woman would."

278
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,116
Or, "Pierre's too simple here.
He's not an idiot."

279
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,410
You know, things like that.

280
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,000
But I don't count anymore.

281
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,565
You must help me,
Vladimir Fedorovich.

282
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,901
Oh, Valentin Fedorovich.

283
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,529
I only want what's best for my husband
and my family.

284
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,532
If it was for me alone,
I could tolerate the situation...

285
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,994
...but I cannot stand by while
they steal my children's inheritance.

286
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,414
Well, I don't believe anybody
wants to do that.

287
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,332
I don't. I mean...

288
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,918
Theft goes against the principles
of Tolstoy thought.

289
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,337
I have a little gift for you.

290
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,469
It's a diary.

291
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,931
You know, everyone
should always keep a diary.

292
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,685
Yes, it's a very popular activity
around here.

293
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,103
You're teasing us.

294
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,273
But I trust you'll write the truth.

295
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,109
Well, that may not be so easy.

296
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,279
Nonsense. You've been listening
to your friends at Telyatinki.

297
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,615
No, no, just write
what you see around you.

298
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,119
What you see.

299
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,057
You're finished for the day?

300
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,392
Yes, he didn't need me
this afternoon.

301
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,146
I thought I'd come back here...

302
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,939
...and lend a hand.

303
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,613
You know, Lev Nikolayevich
considers himself a liberal...

304
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:30,200
...but he doesn't approve of women
doing physical labor.

305
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,245
- Don't you find that reactionary?
- No.

306
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,122
I find it sweet.

307
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,459
I find you reactionary.

308
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,008
What do you talk about
when you're with him?

309
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,552
We...

310
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,349
- Why are you blushing?
- I'm not.

311
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,770
We talk about me.

312
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,107
- Really?
- Yes.

313
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,692
He wants to know about my family,
my upbringing.

314
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,154
My connection to God
and my relations with women.

315
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,366
What relations are these?

316
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,424
All right, it's all right.

317
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,987
Well done.

318
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,372
I had a lover before I came here.

319
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,042
He was headmaster of the school
where I taught.

320
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,753
He was married.

321
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,216
He was happily married.
It was difficult.

322
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,051
We could make love only at school.

323
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,761
At school?

324
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,098
In the gymnasium,
after the girls had gone.

325
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,767
I see. I see.

326
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,523
- There you are.
- Have I upset you?

327
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,525
No.

328
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,072
No, I find you...
I appreciate your frankness.

329
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,824
- But you disapprove of me?
- No!

330
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,785
- I see it in your eyes.
- Not at all.

331
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,290
No. I think sexual behavior...

332
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,875
...and intercourse...

333
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,794
...how two men, or two women...

334
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,755
...or men and women...

335
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,007
...animals,
combine their physical parts...

336
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,926
...I find it completely neutral.

337
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,888
Listen to you.

338
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,390
You're a prig.

339
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,478
You're just like Sergeyenko. I mean,
why else would they have hired you?

340
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,273
- That's not fair.
- I don't care if it's fair. It's true.

341
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,317
That's it.

342
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,030
- I'm going.
- Do as you like.

343
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,327
Valentin Fedorovich?

344
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,120
Yes?

345
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,998
You forgot your horse.

346
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,001
Yes.

347
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,118
Where's Papa?

348
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,125
I had a dream last night,
about a Tartar girl I knew in the war.

349
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,751
A girl who died?

350
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,381
No, no, no. Just a girl
I had sexual intercourse with.

351
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,092
Sometimes, we did it twice a day.

352
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,720
God bless you.

353
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,181
I've never forgotten our time together.

354
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,893
The positions of our bodies,
and the taste of her.

355
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,855
It was a long time ago.
Really, you mustn't torture yourself.

356
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,858
Torture? You are a virgin,
aren't you?

357
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,193
Well, I try to be.
I mean, I try to be...

358
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,112
To what, to be a good Tolstoyan?

359
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,824
Let me assure you that
I'm not a very good Tolstoyan myself.

360
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:44,829
You should think twice
before asking my advice on anything.

361
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,498
"Torture."

362
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,763
Kalya was her name.

363
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,099
She's an old woman now.

364
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,853
White hair, old body, like me.

365
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,439
Hardly remember my name,
I suspect.

366
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,733
She may even be dead.

367
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,737
Do you think all that
meant something?

368
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:18,946
What do you mean?

369
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,115
Well, I mean, that little romance.

370
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,369
Was there some meaning to it?

371
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,080
Well, I think you would say...
I mean...

372
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,084
...I think I've read where you say
that the physical body is not real.

373
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,668
That it's all an illusion.

374
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,755
I say a lot of things.
But what do you say?

375
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,174
What do you think?

376
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,928
I don't know.

377
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,973
I don't know, either.

378
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,186
Oh, smell that.

379
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,649
- Lilac.
- Precisely. Lilac.

380
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,776
Scent gets stronger
when the sun goes down.

381
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,319
Does it?

382
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,738
Papa!

383
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,871
He's free!

384
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,082
He's coming back!

385
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,393
My friend.

386
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,231
He has come to try again to persuade
your father to change the will...

387
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,276
...to give the copyright
as a gift to humanity.

388
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,445
- The reptile.
- Papa's not in his right mind.

389
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,697
He can't defend himself
against these thieves.

390
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,991
You're a fine son, my darling.

391
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,702
None of this fake chastity
or made-up religion.

392
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,622
I wish all my children
had turned out like you.

393
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,253
Vladimir Grigorevich,
what a surprise.

394
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,297
Sofya Andreyevna.

395
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,301
- I'm happy to see you.
- And I'm happy to make you happy.

396
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,054
Come, come, my friend.

397
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,391
Now, we have a great deal
to talk about.

398
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,025
I'm happy to have a moment
alone with you, Valentin.

399
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,236
- There seems to be some confusion.
- What do you mean?

400
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,655
You send me commentary
on Tolstoy's writing...

401
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,159
...and that's all very interesting,
but not very useful.

402
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,579
See, I need to know what goes on
with Sofya Andreyevna.

403
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,998
You must see by now
how committed she is...

404
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,542
...to undermining
her husband's best intentions.

405
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,753
It's not quite so obvious to me.

406
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,507
The woman understands nothing
of what we're doing.

407
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,468
We simply want to distribute
Tolstoy's writing...

408
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,012
...to the widest audience possible.

409
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,141
I can only be of limited use
to the master...

410
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,560
...if I don't know what's going on.

411
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,023
The survival of our movement
depends upon it.

412
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,567
- You value our work?
- I do.

413
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,196
- The ideals we share?
- It's why I'm here.

414
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,324
Very good.

415
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,476
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning.

416
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,897
- Do you mind if I join you?
- No, of course, of course, my dear.

417
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,504
You know...

418
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,009
...it's quite insane, my darling,
how people are making fun of you.

419
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,303
- What are you talking about?
- Even the muzhiks.

420
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,180
I heard them laughing about it in
the horse barn.

421
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,849
About what?

422
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,018
Laughing about what?

423
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,898
About the fact
that you've developed a senile crush...

424
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,401
...on a fat, middle-aged flatterer.

425
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,321
Your passion for Chertkov
has become a standing joke.

426
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,115
I have a great affection
for Vladimir Grigorevich.

427
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,534
Let them laugh
if they find it so amusing.

428
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,829
It's not amusing, darling.
It's sick. It's not normal.

429
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,541
- I mean, you hang on his every word.
- We have a great deal in common.

430
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,877
You have nothing in common.

431
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,464
You are a genius,
and he is a sycophant and a pervert.

432
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,342
Because he understands
what I'm trying to do?

433
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,427
Because he tries to help me
accomplish it?

434
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,597
He's just using you.
You just can't seem to see it.

435
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,973
This is absolute nonsense.

436
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,226
- That bald, obese, idiotic man, you...
- It is impossible for you...

437
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,728
...not to distract me!

438
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,066
Now, leave me alone, for God's sake.
You're like a spoiled child.

439
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:11,030
- Do you love me, Leovochka?
- Of course I do.

440
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:15,242
- Then why do you betray me like this?
- Why do you say that?

441
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,662
Because of the will.

442
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,914
The new will.

443
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,417
There's no new will.

444
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,752
Does Chertkov have it?

445
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,005
- There is no new will.
- But that's why he's here, isn't it?

446
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,133
You talk about it, you
and your boyfriend. You plan for it.

447
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,761
You have no heart
for the people who really love you.

448
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,306
You'd rather be seduced by charlatans
and deluded by flatterers...

449
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:41,102
...all in the name of love.
You can't even love your own children.

450
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,604
You can't even love me. Where is it?

451
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:48,192
- There is no new will!
- Then promise me there never will be.

452
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:56,409
I have told you the truth.

453
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,954
Now let me work.

454
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,748
Will you?

455
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,006
Fine, I'll go to the station
and I'll throw myself under a train.

456
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,175
Madam Tolstoy
becomes Anna Karenina.

457
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,886
- See how the press will like that.
- This is unbearable.

458
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,557
You don't need a husband,
you need a Greek chorus!

459
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,746
Masha...?

460
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,069
Masha...

461
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,138
Move your book.

462
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,390
- What?
- Your book.

463
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,393
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

464
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,416
Is it okay?

465
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,294
Yeah?

466
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,770
What? What is it?

467
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,732
- What is it?
- You really are a virgin?

468
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,904
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

469
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,782
- It was wonderful, really.
- I could do it again.

470
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,617
- Let me try again.
- It was wonderful.

471
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,452
- Really?
- Yes.

472
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,539
Hold me.

473
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,173
And up.

474
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,926
That's good. Pull it, your side.

475
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,219
There.

476
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,471
Keep it tight.

477
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,474
That's it, stretch it so we can read it.

478
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,145
Right, push it right firmly down
into the ground.

479
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,152
We don't want it to blow over.

480
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,906
That's good.

481
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,993
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,623
Hi.

483
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,723
Why did you come here, Masha?

484
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,102
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

485
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,813
You don't follow any
of the rules here.

486
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,985
Because it's not about rules.

487
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,820
Not for Tolstoy, anyway.

488
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,823
Valentin Fedorovich.

489
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,533
- What is it?
- Open the door.

490
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm currently indisposed.

491
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:14,333
Yes, well, Lev Nikolayevich
is downstairs. He wants to see you.

492
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,545
Tell Lev Nikolayevich
I'll be down in a moment.

493
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,841
Yes. And tell Maria Filipovna we could
use another hand in the kitchen.

494
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,303
- Lf I see her, I will.
- Lf you see her, yes.

495
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,933
If you're going to behave like rabbits,
you should go live in the woods.

496
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,694
I'll go first.
Give me five minutes, yes?

497
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:48,575
Come on. That's a boy.

498
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,077
That's my boy.

499
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,038
You too, come on.

500
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:56,875
You're wonderful,
you're just wonderful, wonderful.

501
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,008
And you too, you too, son.

502
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,764
Look at the love in him. It's like...

503
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,352
...Jesus suffering the children.

504
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,104
- All that.
- I know, an old man's...

505
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,856
...a very ugly thing. Yes.

506
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,443
Hey, my boy! Hey!

507
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,653
Come and kiss me.

508
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,784
And who's this? Maria Filipovna.

509
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,371
Oh, you're both looking so well.

510
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,332
Life here obviously agrees with you.

511
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,962
God bless you, boy.
What are you nervous about now?

512
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,590
Sit down. Sit down.

513
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,968
Oh, Masha, my dear.

514
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,767
Valentin tells me that you are
the great treasure of Telyatinki.

515
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,479
He claims you're
a very gifted teacher.

516
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,398
We're happy to have you with us.

517
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,072
What are you doing?

518
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,325
- What do you mean?
- You just killed a living thing.

519
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,496
Do you have something to say?

520
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,625
- It's absurd, that's all.
- What are you saying?

521
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,836
- I'm sorry, but it's a mosquito.
- Forgive him. He can't help it.

522
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,964
He's a much better Tolstoyan
than I am.

523
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,802
That's not the message
we want to send.

524
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,639
Please, have your seat.

525
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,102
Very well.

526
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,190
Papa, from Mother:

527
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,527
"Nerves dreadful. Stop.
Insomnia. Stop.

528
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,196
Pulse 100. Stop.

529
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,156
Please come home."

530
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,417
So...

531
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,546
...are you ill? Or what is it?

532
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,134
Oh, I'm much better,
now you're here.

533
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:15,222
It's no good, you know, all this.
You frightened everyone.

534
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,309
Really? No, I don't believe you.
Not you.

535
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,231
I'm your little bird.
You know the sounds I make.

536
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,317
Then that was some sort of love call,
I suppose.

537
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,736
Brought you back to me.

538
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,784
Why? Why, why, why do you do it?

539
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,413
We live in the country, you insist
on making it an opera house!

540
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:43,167
- What's wrong with a little peace?
- Look at me!

541
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:48,297
This is who I am.
This is what you married.

542
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:52,009
We may be older,
maybe we're old...

543
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,762
...but I'm still your little chicken.

544
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,767
- And you're still my big cock.
- Oh, for pity's sake.

545
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,645
Let me make you crow.

546
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,363
Oh, come on, let me make you sing.

547
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,741
No. No.

548
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,951
No, no, no.

549
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,603
Let me make you sing.

550
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,991
- Do you love me?
- I do, I do. I do.

551
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,828
I want you to love me.

552
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,624
I do.

553
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,393
I must say you do look beautiful
in the firelight.

554
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,854
You mean I look beautiful
in the dark.

555
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,081
Masha.

556
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,793
You wouldn't look at me.

557
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,672
It was difficult,
in front of the others...

558
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,882
It wasn't difficult in your bed...

559
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,176
...when it was just you and me
in front of God.

560
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,803
I'm not sure
I was aware of God.

561
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,014
- So I made you forget God?
- No. Never.

562
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,390
Yes. Only for a moment.

563
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,935
You forgot your rules
and you remembered love.

564
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,272
- You make it sound very simple.
- It is simple.

565
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,567
I mean, what we did
is what men and women do.

566
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,486
It's what they have done,
it's what they'll continue doing.

567
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,449
We touched each other.

568
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:25,078
When we stayed close together,
something passed between us.

569
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,747
Something real.

570
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,625
And that's a betrayal of what?

571
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,877
Nothing.

572
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,547
But you're afraid.

573
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,924
All your ideas.

574
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,032
She wants to question you
about the new will.

575
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,077
But how does she even know
it exists?

576
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,247
Well, she claims that Lev Nikolayevich
said she could look at the draft.

577
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,961
Well, he is obviously
not thinking clearly.

578
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,631
And now we have to contend
with her petty grasping.

579
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,134
- It doesn't seem that petty to me.
- I beg your pardon?

580
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,393
He's her entire life. The work,
in her mind, is theirs, together.

581
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,936
And you're her advocate?

582
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,522
You have been taken in
by her celebrity.

583
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,734
- I was worried about this.
- I'm simply talking about their history.

584
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,029
- Nothing more.
- We have to see her.

585
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,908
- Act as if nothing has happened.
- Nothing has happened.

586
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:51,081
Sofya Andreyevna.
At last, you honor us with a visit.

587
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,543
Well, I'm curious to see how things
are progressing here at Telyatinki.

588
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,169
Well...

589
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,505
What is it?

590
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,341
Your mustache is...

591
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,510
No, it's just a problem with the wax.

592
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,056
Vladimir Grigorevich,
let me come straight to the point.

593
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,850
I don't wish to be your enemy.

594
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,770
On the contrary, I am delighted
that my husband has found a friend...

595
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,524
...who understands
and shares his ideals.

596
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,986
I just want what's reasonable.

597
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:24,781
I want an opportunity
to evaluate the new will.

598
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,368
If you agree,
then I'm sure we can be friends.

599
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:33,665
You are very kind, Sofya Andreyevna,
but I can't help you...

600
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,544
...not without specific instructions
from your husband.

601
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,549
Oh, he has agreed.
Hasn't he, Valentin?

602
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:46,928
No witness you produce
can change my position, I'm afraid.

603
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,221
But I will, of course...

604
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,516
...speak to Lev Nikolayevich
at the first opportunity.

605
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,813
Very well.

606
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,399
I want us to be friends too, Sofya.

607
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:04,070
Lev Nikolayevich is the most valuable
thing in the world, to both of us.

608
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,782
We should endeavor to set things right
between us. Give him peace.

609
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,242
Let him work.

610
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,828
Yes.

611
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,632
Valentin Fedorovich, would you
accompany me to the house, please?

612
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,763
I'll accompany the countess
back to the house...

613
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,766
...and be back in time for supper.

614
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,186
Masha will be overjoyed.

615
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:49,032
Valentin Fedorovich, you've been
keeping something from me.

616
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,784
Have I?

617
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,120
You can tell me anything, Valentin.

618
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,499
I love a romance.

619
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,502
That's... It's nothing.
Really, it's nothing.

620
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,629
A young woman in your life
is nothing?

621
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,631
Masha is a friend.

622
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,760
- A lover?
- A very... A very good friend.

623
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,930
See, you forget
that I'm an experienced reader...

624
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:16,268
...so I can read your face,
every letter.

625
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,895
It's beautifully clear.

626
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,105
Really?

627
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,108
Do you love her?

628
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,946
- I think perhaps I do.
- Yes.

629
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:36,580
It's not something they'd understand,
these disciples of my husband's.

630
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,708
They've never understood a word
he's ever written.

631
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,964
What do they know about love?

632
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,197
Let's try to be as efficient as possible,
get the job done, and get back.

633
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:31,009
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

634
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,178
- Did I scare you? Are you all right?
- Fine.

635
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,388
I'm sorry.

636
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,973
I got back as soon as I could.

637
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,686
It was a strange day.
Lev Nikolayevich is...

638
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:46,941
I love to listen to him talk,
but today I could barely concentrate.

639
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,155
All I could think about was you.

640
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,785
- I think I've confused you.
- No.

641
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,079
- I think I've confused us both.
- No.

642
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,581
I...

643
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:02,916
I was stupid.

644
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,586
I was afraid,
but I'm not afraid anymore.

645
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,380
What are you?

646
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,593
Masha.

647
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,555
I love you, Masha.

648
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,789
Here.

649
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,131
Masha.

650
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,511
Masha! I have...

651
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,640
In my heart...

652
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,353
...I have committed the act
of copulation many times!

653
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,487
Please know it was never
like it was with you.

654
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,163
I'll wait for you, then.

655
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,081
You will?

656
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,959
Give me this.

657
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,088
What? What are you laughing at?

658
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,841
It's a problem with the wax.

659
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,974
I think I look just like him.

660
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,146
You're happy.

661
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,522
Well, of course I am.

662
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,486
Love and be loved. That's the only
reality there is in the world.

663
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,988
He said that?

664
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:00,867
Yes, Tolstoy said it, but I'm saying it.

665
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,039
I'm saying it, Masha,
because you make me know it.

666
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,709
I look into your eyes
and I can see the future.

667
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,964
I think you're the bravest person
I've ever met.

668
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,843
You amaze me.

669
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,847
You believe more
than I know how to.

670
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,684
I love you.

671
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,025
You're pure, Valya.

672
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,990
You're what I came here to find.

673
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,719
Ivan, who's wearing
that awful perfume?

674
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,854
I understand this is difficult.
It is a delicate situation.

675
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,772
This way.

676
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,026
This must be discussed now.
It cannot wait any longer.

677
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,697
Whatever happens,
Mother mustn't find out.

678
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,326
I hate to say it, but the countess has
become more and more dangerous.

679
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:29,414
Oh, not dangerous. She's concerned
for the welfare of the family.

680
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:32,458
And we're concerned
with the welfare of mankind.

681
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,050
- You've been more than reasonable.
- Have I?

682
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,760
Of course you have.

683
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,263
She already controls the income
from your property.

684
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,349
Please, listen to him, Papa.
He has our best interests at heart.

685
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,728
We are speaking only of the rights
to your words, your ideas.

686
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,855
With all love and respect...

687
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:57,650
...the countess is too interested
in making a profit from your work.

688
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,243
She's my wife. She's part of me.
We've been together all these years.

689
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,830
But you're more than a husband
and father. She must understand that.

690
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,541
The best interests of the people
are one with your own.

691
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:17,879
- You belong to them.
- She won't. She'll never understand.

692
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,132
What is she doing?

693
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,928
- She's unstable. I wonder if she isn't ill.
- It's sadly more than probable.

694
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,847
I know it's hard for you, Papa,
but you must be realistic.

695
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,183
Her behavior is extremely alarming.

696
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,021
Do you truly think she is fit to control
the final disposition of this will?

697
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,522
Well, I don't... I don't...

698
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,857
How dare...

699
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,527
- God!
- Oh, God.

700
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,322
What are you doing?

701
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,534
You're all plotting against me,
in my own house too!

702
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,996
I bear you 13 children.

703
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:55,583
How can you betray me like this?

704
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,461
Somebody, help me up.

705
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,300
Go ahead. Go ahead.

706
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,387
Why don't you give everything
we've got to him?

707
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,721
Your little catamite!

708
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:13,017
"What will it be, my dearest darling,
my Vladimir Grigorevich?

709
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:16,688
My wife's heart on a platter?
Her kidneys, with salt?

710
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,440
But of course, my dear Chertkov.
Whatever pleases you.

711
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,733
The china, the estate...

712
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,361
...permanent copyright
on anything I've ever written?

713
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:26,948
Anything for you, my love."

714
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,163
- Give that to me.
- No.

715
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,332
- Give it to me, you little weasel!
- Sofya!

716
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,583
- Give it to me!
- Sofya.

717
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,043
Give it to me!

718
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,673
- Now...
- Can I have... Can I not have some...

719
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:48,386
- Can I not have some...
- You'll kill him, Mama.

720
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:52,432
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
You want him to die!

721
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,267
Lev.

722
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,606
It's all right, it's all right.
Let's get him out of here.

723
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,576
You don't deceive me
for one moment.

724
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:14,829
I know exactly what you're doing.

725
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,793
I want to see the will.

726
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:25,465
It is my right as his wife
in the sight of God.

727
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,800
What are you afraid of?

728
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,469
You.

729
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,554
I'm afraid of you.

730
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,641
The press are bloodthirsty, Sofya.

731
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,811
Had I wished,
I could have demolished you.

732
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,021
You make it easy.

733
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,607
Then tell them anything you want.
Go ahead. Ruin us!

734
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,985
I have too much respect
for Lev Nikolayevich!

735
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,403
You're lucky!

736
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,989
Why can't my husband see you
for what you are?

737
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:55,036
If I had a wife like you,
I would've blown my brains out!

738
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,164
Or gone to America.

739
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,043
I hope you're feeling better.

740
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,342
Do you like the opera?

741
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,386
Yes.

742
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,977
I'm very sorry...

743
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,311
...about everything.

744
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,695
This aria is so beautiful.

745
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:15,491
It's about a woman who's been
abandoned by the man she loves.

746
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,077
Everyone finds that very moving...

747
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,080
...in the opera.

748
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,595
Our life together
has become intolerable.

749
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,056
- Sit down, Valentin.
- Really, I'm expected at Telyatinki.

750
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,017
No, please.
Come, enjoy your dinner.

751
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:44,770
We've just had a disagreement,
like all married couples.

752
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,275
Despite good cause for it,
I have never stopped loving you.

753
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,152
Of course.

754
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,112
But God knows
you don't make it easy.

755
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,280
Why should it be easy?

756
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,741
I am the work of your life,
you the work of mine.

757
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,118
That's what love is.

758
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,621
- I should go.
- No, sit down.

759
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,959
So that's what love is?

760
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,378
Does that surprise you?

761
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,256
I thought it might be
a touch quieter, but...

762
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,758
- God bless you.
- Bless you.

763
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,010
He's right, though.

764
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,139
If we can't live a decent, quiet life...

765
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:24,936
...if I can't work and find some peace,
then I shall go away.

766
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,356
- Go?
- Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.

767
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,776
- Go where?
- Dushan says you're killing me!

768
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,113
Then go! Go anywhere you please!

769
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,742
Go anywhere you please!

770
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,745
I hate you!

771
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,498
I hate what you've become!

772
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,126
- Countess.
- Go. No.

773
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,336
Dushan!

774
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,298
- Oh, God.
- Countess?

775
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,510
Countess! Is she all right?

776
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,053
Is she all right?

777
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:03,766
Sofya. Sofya, are you all right?
Open your eyes.

778
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,142
Open your eyes.

779
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,021
Oh, my back!

780
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,024
Oh, my back.

781
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,111
You're lying on a fork.

782
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,533
Sit up and you'll improve markedly.

783
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,786
If you'll be good enough
to take her upstairs.

784
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,539
Come along, countess,
come with me.

785
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,727
Masha.

786
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,241
I'm sorry.

787
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,495
It was terrible there today.

788
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,584
They loved each other so much,
I'm sure of it, I'm sure they do, but...

789
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,004
...you see what it becomes,
and you just wish that you could...

790
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,302
Is something the matter?

791
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,387
Masha?

792
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,560
I'm going back to Moscow.

793
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:31,354
What?

794
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,690
Chertkov spoke with me
this afternoon.

795
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,860
He said I could
be more useful there.

796
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,071
- Which means...
- Means he's punishing us.

797
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,698
He's punishing me.

798
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,786
He's punishing me for befriending
Sofya Andreyevna. This is Chertkov.

799
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,038
We've both disappointed him,
but I don't care.

800
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,207
I don't care either,
but you can't leave.

801
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,251
I'm going to talk to him.
I'm going to make him make you stay.

802
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,838
- No. I want to go.
- Yes. What?

803
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,549
I'm leaving the movement.

804
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,516
Sit down, sit down.

805
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:11,894
- You can't leave Tolstoy.
- I'm not.

806
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,480
- You can't leave.
- No, I'm not.

807
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,401
When I read his confession,
it moved me, Valya.

808
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,904
- Yes.
- When he was searching for freedom.

809
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,241
Freedom from anger,
freedom from attachment...

810
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:28,994
...freedom from all the superstition
and the nonsense of the Church.

811
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,164
I mean, it moved me so much.

812
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,667
And that's what I thought
it would be about.

813
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,128
I mean, isn't that what it's about?

814
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,547
Freedom and love?

815
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:44,385
They mix it all up.

816
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,976
Come with me.

817
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,188
Please?

818
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,329
I can't.

819
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:26,969
- I'm going to my room.
- Wait.

820
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,930
Masha.

821
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,317
Masha, please. I can't.

822
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,569
I need you.

823
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,659
I know you do.

824
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,914
I know.

825
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,304
A-Y. A-Y.

826
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,849
A-Y.

827
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,270
What was it? I don't remember.

828
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,526
- Was it your...
- No, no, no.

829
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,903
You rest now.

830
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,989
You rest.

831
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,985
Is everything in order?

832
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,671
- Good afternoon, Lev Nikolayevich.
- Is it?

833
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,772
Remember that this will ensure...

834
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,900
...that your complete works
will live in the public domain.

835
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,611
Monumentous.

836
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,823
Your works are the birthright
of the Russian people.

837
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,202
And now
they will possess them forever.

838
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,706
Yes?

839
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,250
I need a pen.

840
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,462
Of course, of course.

841
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,715
- I...
- What?

842
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,888
I don't seem to have a pen.

843
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,349
You're a secretary.
How can you not have a pen?

844
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,268
He's a secretary too. Ask him.

845
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:25,189
Valentin Fedorovich,
do you have a pen?

846
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,857
I...

847
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,659
Yes.

848
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,745
Yes, I have a pen.

849
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,095
Are you all right?

850
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,598
I'm a conspirator.

851
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,267
Nothing more.

852
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,679
Lev Nikolayevich.

853
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,765
May I ask you a question
that has nothing to do with the work?

854
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,392
Of course, my dear.

855
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,562
Do you love your wife?

856
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,650
You see,
when I was courting Sofya...

857
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:55,112
...she was so young and so pure...

858
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,907
...it just seemed impossible
that I could ever have her.

859
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,578
I didn't want to tell her how I felt,
and yet...

860
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,789
...I wanted to tell her nothing else.

861
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,083
So I wrote down a string of letters...

862
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,836
...and asked her
if she would decipher them.

863
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:15,007
At first, she was completely confused
and thought it was some sort of game.

864
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,301
So I gave her a clue. One clue.

865
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,931
"The first two Y's," I said,
"stand for 'your youth"'...

866
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,850
...and that was all I said.

867
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,143
And then...

868
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,688
...the most miraculous thing
happened.

869
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,358
She simply spoke the phrase:

870
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,864
"Your youth and your desire
for happiness...

871
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,533
...cruelly remind me of my age...

872
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:45,204
...and the impossibility of happiness
for me."

873
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,124
The entire phrase, my phrase.

874
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,211
As if she'd read my mind.

875
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:57,299
In that moment, we both knew
we would always be together.

876
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,553
And for the first few years, we were...

877
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,597
...incredibly...

878
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,141
...terrifyingly...

879
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,312
...happy.

880
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,696
And now this.

881
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,882
I'm leaving Telyatinki.

882
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,095
- Really?
- Yes. I'm going to Moscow.

883
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,806
She's leading you around
by the nose, my boy.

884
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:49,268
Look, you say that the movement
is about love.

885
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,521
And it is.
The love that he teaches us.

886
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,440
The love that binds
all mankind together.

887
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,442
I've never met mankind.

888
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,321
I've only ever met men or women.
Imperfect men, imperfect women.

889
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,116
Yes. But Lev Nikolayevich
also teaches us...

890
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:08,620
...that love cannot be weak-minded.
It cannot be stupid.

891
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,711
Go. We will miss you.

892
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,631
Our naive sentimentalist.

893
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,635
Keep clear.

894
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,431
Give it to me.

895
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,108
Leovochka?

896
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:48,160
Kashnikov wants to buy the rights
to your work after your death.

897
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,704
Then I shall try and die
as soon as is convenient.

898
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:53,123
Oh, come on, don't be silly.
Come, look.

899
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:57,169
Look, he has offered
1 million rubles.

900
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,007
- How can you not be pleased?
- I don't write for publishers...

901
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,509
...I write for people.
- Well, where are you going?

902
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,471
Valentin is in the library.
He wants to see me.

903
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:11,266
Fine! Fine, go ahead
and let your wretched family starve.

904
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:15,020
I don't see anyone starving
in this house.

905
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,855
On the contrary...

906
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,524
...our privilege revolts me.

907
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,526
Well, you're the first to the trough!

908
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,948
Always have been.

909
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,322
What is it, my boy?

910
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,700
You look unhappy.

911
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,120
What do you want to tell me?

912
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:27,092
Sofya!

913
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,266
What are you doing?

914
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:38,061
How could you do this to me?

915
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,401
- You're not well.
- You just hurt me again and again.

916
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:48,363
You tear pieces off me
until there's nothing left.

917
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,368
I don't know who I am anymore.

918
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,124
I read your diary.

919
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,461
I know what you've done.

920
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,422
You behave like this,
I have no choice.

921
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,301
- Now give me the gun.
- No!

922
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:12,095
- Please, countess.
- Give me the gun, please.

923
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,518
I'd like you to stay here tonight.

924
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,605
Yes, of course.

925
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:29,714
Valentin.

926
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,007
- Get up.
- What?

927
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,926
He's leaving.

928
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,481
Pack essentials only.

929
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,569
Nothing that isn't
absolutely necessary.

930
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,320
Please, we must hurry.

931
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,197
- Where will you go?
- Your coat, Papa.

932
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,907
We don't need a plan, we just go.

933
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:59,035
A lantern, I think.
It's very dark tonight.

934
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,913
And the apparatus
for giving an enema.

935
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,382
Everything's ready.

936
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,764
Dushan, you all right?

937
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,641
Please, go steady.

938
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,393
You all right?

939
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,020
Papa?

940
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,736
He's changed his mind.
He's going back to the house.

941
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,811
Do you want to go back?

942
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,565
No.

943
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:16,196
This life is behind me now.

944
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,922
- Help me up.
- Yes, of course.

945
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,101
Give this to Sofya.

946
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,894
Yes.

947
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,735
Be well, be well.

948
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,539
Don't cry, don't cry.

949
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:10,041
I'll send for you when I can.

950
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,056
Drive on.

951
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,707
He's gone.

952
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:54,252
- For good?
- I think so, yes.

953
01:17:56,881 --> 01:18:00,175
Oh, Sasha, darling,
I know you know where your father is.

954
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,345
So, darling, please, this is not a time
to play games, please?

955
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:07,766
Countess, I have this for you.

956
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:21,946
My position in the house
has become intolerable.

957
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:26,659
What I'm doing now is what people
have commonly done...

958
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,162
...leave their worldly life behind...

959
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:34,250
...to spend their last days
in peace and solitude.

960
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,925
The pond.

961
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,470
- Mama!
- Countess!

962
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:46,721
Please, Mama!

963
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,557
Please understand this
and don't come after me...

964
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,976
...even if you find out where I am.

965
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,146
Your coming
would only make our position worse...

966
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,565
...and would not alter my decision.

967
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,609
Mother!

968
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:04,989
I beg you to forgive me
for everything I've done to you...

969
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,659
...just as I forgive you
with all my soul...

970
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,995
...for everything you've done to me.

971
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,922
Countess!

972
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:32,142
Mama!

973
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:36,688
- Mama!
- I have her!

974
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:44,821
- Here! Here! Take her! Take her.
- Mama!

975
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,872
Ivan, Ivan, go to the house.
Get a doctor, quickly, quickly!

976
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,917
Turn her. Turn her over, come on.

977
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,383
Oh, God. Thank God.

978
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:25,236
Ivan, go to the station.
Find out which train he took.

979
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,322
For God's sake.

980
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,284
Come, come, come.
Let's get you to bed.

981
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:34,704
- Ready and up. There we...
- Let's go, there.

982
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,376
Thank you.

983
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,235
Here, tea.

984
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,949
She's exhausted herself.
She slept for nearly four hours.

985
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:15,119
Well, I'm glad she can sleep.
The pain subsides a little.

986
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:18,122
The noise subsides a little.

987
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,461
Come in.

988
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,048
- A message, miss.
- For me?

989
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,133
From your father.

990
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:36,766
My darling Sasha,
I have stopped to rest at Shamardino.

991
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:39,811
Ljll wait for you to join me here.

992
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:43,481
Please ask Valentin to stay
and look after your mother.

993
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:47,986
When you arrive, wejll continue
the journey south together.

994
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,445
Your loving father.

995
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,672
They've all gone.

996
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,341
I'm here.

997
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:19,475
You're writing to your girl.
Oh, how lovely.

998
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:22,145
I'm not sure she is my girl.

999
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,522
But you believe you'll see her again.

1000
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,816
- I very much hope so.
- Yes.

1001
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,359
Yes.

1002
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,780
I know you know
where he is, Valentin.

1003
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:38,953
- Sofya Andreyevna...
- I won't ask you to betray his trust.

1004
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:42,540
I just need you to go to him. I do.

1005
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,543
I have to see him.
I have to talk to him.

1006
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:49,380
I won't make a scene.
You can promise him that. L...

1007
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,010
I just want to see him.

1008
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,233
"Tolstoy abandons home,
whereabouts unknown."

1009
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,862
"The sage of Yasnaya Polyana
takes flight."

1010
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,947
Thatjs Tolstoy.

1011
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,618
I hope it's not too much for him.

1012
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:31,756
- Where are we?
- Itjs all right. Everything's fine.

1013
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,342
Let me take your temperature.

1014
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,680
Come on.

1015
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,669
Be mindful of these steps.

1016
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:25,685
We've come to the end of the world.

1017
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,418
This is the stationmaster.

1018
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:53,129
He said we may have his home
for as long as we want it.

1019
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,923
There are no inns nearby,
so we are lucky.

1020
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,259
- Yes, very lucky.
- Yes.

1021
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,511
You'll be comfortable here, Papa.

1022
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:04,640
The rest of us, we'll find cots,
or sleep in the station.

1023
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,226
- And then we'll be on our way.
- Yes.

1024
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,188
Yes, Papa. Wejll be on our way.

1025
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:19,363
Excuse me?

1026
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:22,200
I'd like to send a telegram, please.

1027
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:27,038
At Astapovo. Stop.

1028
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:31,417
Tolstoy ill. Stop.

1029
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:33,711
Temperature high.

1030
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:38,424
You can send it to Countess Sofya
Andreyevna Tolstoya...

1031
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:41,552
...Yasnaya Polyana, Tula Province.

1032
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,306
Please come back.
Please come back.

1033
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,904
Concern for Lev Nikolayevich's health
has been expressed...

1034
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:03,074
...by people as diverse as
Mr. Henry James...

1035
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:05,159
...and Mr. Joseph Conrad.

1036
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:09,080
Lev Nikolayevich's temperature
currently stands at 40 Celsius.

1037
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:11,249
That is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

1038
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,752
His blood pressure,
which is hypertonic, is 180 over 100.

1039
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,712
However, it should be added...

1040
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,006
...Lev Nikolayevich's manner...

1041
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,758
...and mental acuity...
- Bulgakov!

1042
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:22,802
...is as great as ever.

1043
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,680
- Where is he? Take me to him.
- This way.

1044
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:28,432
He left. It's astonishing.
He actually finally left.

1045
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,603
- He was very sick, too sick to travel.
- Itjs a triumph for the movement.

1046
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,950
He looks so small.

1047
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,619
Papa.

1048
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,623
Oh, it's you.

1049
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:56,294
My dear friend...

1050
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,588
...what is all of this?

1051
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:01,883
Well, I needed to see you.

1052
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,802
Thank you.

1053
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,306
We have so much to do.

1054
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:12,685
Have you seen Sofya?

1055
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,479
I've made a point not to.

1056
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,815
She'll come.

1057
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,360
I don't know when she'll come,
but she'll come. I know that.

1058
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:24,447
- And we'll be ready.
- Ready for what?

1059
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,661
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's time for your enema.

1060
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,747
Don't apologize, my friend.

1061
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:36,292
Your enemas have become the news
of the world.

1062
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,223
My only concern is getting the copy
back to London in time.

1063
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,975
Good morning, gentlemen.

1064
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,398
I'm sure you will all be as relieved
as I am...

1065
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:45,069
...that Lev Nikolayevich
slept a relatively peaceful night.

1066
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:49,407
His temperature
remains 40 degrees Celsius.

1067
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,742
And his blood pressure
is also hypertonic.

1068
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,828
That having been said, however...

1069
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,999
...his mind remains agile
and full of fortitude.

1070
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,710
- Itjs the countess.
- Of course, we have to remember...

1071
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,545
- Is she here?
- Itjs the countess.

1072
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:05,047
- Let's see.
- Where is she?

1073
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:08,259
- It js the countess!
- Which car is it?

1074
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,739
- The Countess!
- There she is.

1075
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,408
Countess Sofya.

1076
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,536
She's coming this way.

1077
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,248
Not before she stops to tell them lies,
catalog my atrocities.

1078
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,417
Let me talk to her.

1079
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,461
I want to see my husband.

1080
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,379
Yes.

1081
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,714
I'll...

1082
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,467
I want to see him now!

1083
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,635
Countess! Countess!

1084
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,638
Oh, Valentin.
I want to see him, please.

1085
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,849
I'm not sure
now is the right time, countess.

1086
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:59,560
Yes, it is. It's the right time for me.

1087
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,645
Have you had any contact?

1088
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,150
It might be a better idea, countess,
I think, if you waited...

1089
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,153
- He only left because of you.
- Countess!

1090
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:18,329
I want to see my husband.

1091
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:21,874
- He's too weak to see you, Mother.
- He's not too weak to see you.

1092
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:26,337
- Not too weak to see that...
- Do you really want to do this here?

1093
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:31,133
So I am the leper outside the gate,
while he sleeps with the devil himself.

1094
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:35,012
Chertkov is here
because Father asked him to be here.

1095
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:39,975
- Is that true?
- Yes.

1096
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:46,690
Well, did you tell him
that I nearly drowned in the pond?

1097
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:50,486
We didn't need to.
It's been in all the papers.

1098
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,863
- Please, let me take you back.
- What did he say?

1099
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:57,576
He said that if you killed yourself,
he'd be upset.

1100
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:03,457
- He'd be upset?
- Horribly upset.

1101
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,627
But he could not have acted
other than he did.

1102
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,462
I want to see him.

1103
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:12,967
He's my husband.
He's not your husband.

1104
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,218
You're unbearable.

1105
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:19,056
And you are a stone-hearted bitch
of a daughter.

1106
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,559
I lost five children!

1107
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,395
Why couldn't one of them
have been you?

1108
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:27,648
Did she just say that?

1109
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:30,651
Are you finished?

1110
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,326
Valentin, would you
take me back, please?

1111
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,245
Yes, of course.

1112
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:47,251
Please, make way.
Make way. Make way.

1113
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:53,215
- I've behaved rather badly, haven't I?
- No, countess.

1114
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,301
No, don't worry.

1115
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,624
Here. For you.

1116
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,384
- Is this clean?
- Of course it's clean.

1117
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,931
Dushan, what's the matter?

1118
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,016
Listen to him.

1119
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,353
I'm supposed to be a doctor,
for God's sake.

1120
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:33,774
Sofya?

1121
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:37,861
What is it?

1122
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:45,703
She's come, hasn't she?

1123
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:49,832
- She's here.
- You're imagining things.

1124
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,208
Sasha!

1125
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,670
Where is your mother?

1126
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:57,715
She's at home.

1127
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:03,637
If she wants to see me,
I can't refuse her.

1128
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,431
Yes.

1129
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,475
Is she going to come here?

1130
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,103
I don't...

1131
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,647
There's no way to...

1132
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,735
There's no way to what?

1133
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,592
I'd like to send
another telegram, please.

1134
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,012
At Astapovo. Stop.

1135
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,266
Tolstoy ill. Stop.

1136
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,769
Heartbreaking. Stop. Please come.

1137
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:56,273
You can send it to Masha...

1138
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:58,776
Maria Filipovna Melinova.

1139
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,282
You lied to him.

1140
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,950
Keep your voice down.

1141
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,036
He wants to see her.
You heard him say it.

1142
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,039
And what exactly do you think
she'll bring him?

1143
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,500
I don't know.
They've been married for 48 years.

1144
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,378
I'll tell you what she'll bring.
Vanity, fuss, and noise.

1145
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:20,839
- She promised me she would not...
- Promised you what? What, what?

1146
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,966
You've seen her at close quarters,
my boy.

1147
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,470
Think she's capable of restraining
herself from acting like a madwoman?

1148
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,472
They have a life together.
Why deny that?

1149
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,392
You have become a victim
of her romantic nonsense.

1150
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,646
And you willfully forget that she wants
to destroy everything we do.

1151
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,898
She travels here
with that unctuous priest.

1152
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:41,485
- We'll keep the priest away.
- These people are vultures, Valentin.

1153
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,154
And they wait to descend
till the very last moment...

1154
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,115
...to welcome him back
to the Church.

1155
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,450
- This is their fantasy.
- Keep the priest away.

1156
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:49,993
A deathbed recantation.

1157
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:54,623
Do you have any idea
the damage that that will do?

1158
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:56,500
Everything that he has dreamed of...

1159
01:35:56,668 --> 01:36:02,339
...everything that we have worked for
will be gone.

1160
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:06,009
A simple, noble death...

1161
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,345
...is what we want.

1162
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,265
Thatjs what he wants.

1163
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,603
No, you want to create an icon.

1164
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:20,482
And you want people to kneel
in front of an image that you create.

1165
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,109
But he doesn't want that.

1166
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:25,654
He never has wanted that.
It'll give him no peace.

1167
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:30,534
He wants to see her. Let her come.

1168
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:36,039
I will do everything in my power
to prevent that.

1169
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:40,544
That image you want to create...

1170
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,882
...it's going to look more like you
than him.

1171
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,405
Valentin?

1172
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,300
It can't be right. His fever is down.

1173
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:11,969
Yes.

1174
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,470
But...

1175
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:17,975
...his pulse, you see, it's...

1176
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,401
My dear.

1177
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,324
Shall I call her?

1178
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:38,829
- He wouldn't know who she is anyway.
- Yes.

1179
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:06,023
Bring a coat. It's cold.

1180
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:19,161
Countess. Countess, could
you give me some information?

1181
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,288
Countess, is he dying?

1182
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,373
Is he dead?

1183
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,472
Leovochka! Leovochka, my darling.

1184
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,224
Oh, my darling,
please forgive me, please!

1185
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:46,688
I'm a fool. I'm a selfish woman,
but I love you, darling.

1186
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:49,191
Please believe me.

1187
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,778
Please, please understand me...

1188
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:55,822
...and please forgive my wickedness
and my badness.

1189
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,741
Mother.

1190
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:00,619
Control yourself.

1191
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:04,206
- Am I shouting?
- You have to control yourself.

1192
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,877
Yes.

1193
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,962
Yes, I will.

1194
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:30,857
You don't speak, but I hear you.

1195
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,945
Do you love me, Leovochka?

1196
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:43,620
I never stopped, my little bird.

1197
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,459
And you will never stop?

1198
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,838
No.

1199
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,798
Never.

1200
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,761
Nor ever leave me again?

1201
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:06,643
No, never again.

1202
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,231
Good.

1203
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,067
Let's go home.

1204
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,022
First cessation.

1205
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:06,453
Second cessation.

1206
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:00,590
Ten minutes after 6 in the morning...

1207
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:04,970
...a great soul passed
from our world.

1208
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:10,100
Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy...

1209
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:17,792
Masha.

1210
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:24,424
- I'm sorry, but he is gone.
- I know.

1211
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:30,680
But I came for you, Valya.

1212
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,683
I came for you too.

1213
01:45:23,693 --> 01:45:26,194
God go with you, Sofya Andreyevna.

1214
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:28,279
God bless you!

1215
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:33,284
We'll pray for you, countess!
