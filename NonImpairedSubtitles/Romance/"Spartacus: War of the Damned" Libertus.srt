1
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,587
Apologies.

2
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,006
lt appeared abandoned.

3
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,175
l stand proof it is not.

4
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,012
Return to where you came.

5
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,281
A slave is so treated.

6
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,869
l have owned them.

7
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,915
lf that be offense enough,

8
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,084
have my life.

9
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,462
Wine's gone anyway.

10
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,816
Good Mercato
assures me grand spectacle

11
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,402
to be spoken of for years
throughout the Republic.

12
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,585
l have invoked the god Hymenaeus
to sanction the union.

13
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,378
His blessing is affirmed.

14
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,423
The gods bestow gift
beyond measure.

15
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,782
He appears well pleased.

16
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,478
until life leaves from body.

17
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,473
A simple task.

18
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,440
You have a way of making a man
invisible as well.

19
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,234
Great spectacle is being made
of the games tomorrow.

20
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,528
llithyia's slaves attend her.

21
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,281
Most of Glaber's men
provide welcome security

22
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,867
to calm nervous city.

23
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,077
lt should not be hard
for a man of your talents

24
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,371
to avoid the remainder.
