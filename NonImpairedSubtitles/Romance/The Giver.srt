1
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>After The Ruin, we started over,</i>

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,383
<i>creating a new society,
one of true equality.</i>

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,587
<i>Rules were the building
blocks of that equality.</i>

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,860
<i>We learned them as Newchildren.</i>

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,541
<i>Rules like:</i>

6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,506
<i>Injected.</i>

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,665
<i>My name is Jonas.</i>

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,540
<i>I don't have a last name.</i>

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,790
<i>None of us did.</i>

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,424
<i>That day, the day before graduation,</i>

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,302
<i>I admit it, I was scared.</i>

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,985
<i>Tomorrow we'd be assigned
our jobs, our purpose.</i>

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,149
<i>It seemed everyone
knew theirs already.</i>

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,461
<i>Not me.</i>

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,829
<i>I was lost.</i>

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,829
<i>I always felt like I saw things</i>

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,549
<i>differently, saw things
other people didn't.</i>

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,430
<i>I never said anything.</i>

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,705
<i>I didn't want to be different.</i>

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,867
<i>Who would?</i>

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,620
Jonas.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,820
I apologize, we're late.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,180
I got Asher to come say
goodbye to Teacher.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,820
I accept your apology.

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,460
<i>Asher and Fiona,</i>

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,460
<i>we'd been friends our whole lives.</i>

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,020
<i>Asher was the boy who
made everyone laugh.</i>

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,940
<i>Fiona, well,</i>

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,780
<i>she was the girl who
made everyone smile.</i>

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,860
Take that back!

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,460
Whoever is listening, please, please,

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,980
do not make me Vice Chancellor
of Waste Management!

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,060
Please!

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,460
<i>We lived in a world</i>

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,460
<i>where differences weren't allowed.</i>

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,260
<i>There was no "popular."</i>

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,620
<i>No fame.</i>

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,984
<i>No losers and no winners.</i>

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,980
<i>Our Elders had eliminated all of that</i>

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,582
<i>so there'd be no conflict between us.</i>

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,351
<i>Fear, pain, envy, hate,</i>

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,980
<i>they weren't words so much as sounds.</i>

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,060
<i>Their echoes were gone,
to the other side of history.</i>

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,786
<i>I'm asked if I should
apologize for what I did.</i>

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,024
<i>I'll let you decide.</i>

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,340
I'm going to miss volunteering here.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,460
Oh, no. If ever there
was a person born

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,910
- to work at the Nurturing Center...
- I could be surprised, right?

49
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,220
Jonas, if you had to guess,

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,788
of all the positions the
elders picked for me?

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,700
Nurturing Center.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,146
<i>Welcome to the Nurturing Center.</i>

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,300
I got this. I got this.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,982
- Think heavy. Think heavy.
- Come on, come on.

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,340
We win!

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,060
Aren't you my chubby champion?

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,940
- Which one was heavier?
- Mine.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,060
Asher?

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,860
Father, I think Fiona put
her finger on the scale.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,100
I did not.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,431
Aw, this little guy didn't
qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,580
He's just not strong enough to
be assigned to a family yet.

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,060
He looks so unhappy.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,822
Hey...

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,590
It's okay, Jonas, you can open it.

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,700
Yeah, it's Jonas.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,665
Here, let me.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh, There you go. There you go.

69
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,020
- It's okay.
- Some people have it, huh?

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,260
Well, that's just not fair.

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,021
Be strong, Gabriel.

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,180
You looked at his name?

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,660
Isn't that against the rules?

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,500
Yeah, it, it is.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,783
I just thought having a
name might help him grow.

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,543
So I whisper it to him
when no one can hear.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,305
Sometimes I call him Gabe.

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,780
But he's usually so restless,

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,109
I, I'm not even sure he can hear me.

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,420
You okay?

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,100
Huh? Yeah.

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,180
I'm fine.

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,820
So the old man turns
to the Elder and says,

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,220
"Do you know who I am?"

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,340
And the Elder says,
"Sir, I know you're old,

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,100
but that is no excuse
for being prideful."

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,020
And then the old man says,
"No, really, I'm asking.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
- Who am I?"

89
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,460
I don't get it.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,860
"Who am I?" like, like he
forgot who he was.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,420
Okay, but wouldn't the joke be better

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,620
- if the old man says...
- Okay, one...

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,300
- What?
- ...two...

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
...three!

95
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,020
Aren't we graduates now?

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,180
You do this every time!

97
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,300
- Come on!
- Okay!

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,220
One, two, three!

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,580
There you go.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,148
So, I guess this is it.

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,860
The last night of our childhood.

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,900
I guess everything is
gonna be different.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,980
No.

104
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,860
Tomorrow the only thing
that changes is what we do.

105
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,460
It doesn't change who we are.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,860
Quick question: Who are we?

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,940
Friends.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,380
- Friends forever.
- Yes.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,300
Even when you're both
assigned to be Birth Mothers.

110
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,460
Hey!

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,580
Well, I guess we'll
find out tomorrow, huh?

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>Citizens are reminded</i>

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,580
<i>that evening recreation
will end in 30 minutes.</i>

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,386
<i>Thank you.</i>

115
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,340
Well, he did need
to be rehabilitated.

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,140
And I know he was Lily's Teacher,
but what was I supposed to do?

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,147
I feel...

118
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,460
disappointment.

119
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,820
What was the Elders' decision?

120
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,180
Released to Elsewhere.

121
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,100
Can I be "Released to
Elsewhere," Mother?

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,620
Even just for one day?

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,143
No, you're too young, Lily Billy.

124
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,542
Jonas, your turn for Feelings.

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,387
Well, I guess I'm sort of...

126
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,021
terrified.

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,060
Precision of language.

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,424
I mean anxious.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,780
When you were about to graduate,

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,180
did you ever feel like there
was no position meant for you?

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,740
They've been watching since
you were a Newchild.

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,944
The Elders are never wrong.

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,625
You'll find your place.

134
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,300
<i>Welcome, citizens,</i>

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,780
<i>to the annual Ceremony
of Advancement.</i>

136
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,587
<i>Please stand by for a transmission.</i>

137
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,940
<i>Good morning, Community.</i>

138
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,900
Good morning, Chief Elder.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,740
<i>I apologize for my remote attendance.</i>

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,700
We accept your apology.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,509
<i>I can't be at every
Ceremony in person.</i>

142
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,420
<i>But here's a secret:</i>

143
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,261
<i>you are my favorite Community.</i>

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,100
<i>However, because we do not lie,</i>

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,980
<i>I readily admit I say
that to every Community.</i>

146
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,700
<i>Beginnings...</i>

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,860
<i>From disorder and chaos,</i>

148
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,111
<i>from great suffering, great pain.</i>

149
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,100
<i>From confusion and envy and hatred</i>

150
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,980
<i>came a solution:</i>

151
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,700
<i>Communities.</i>

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,909
<i>Serene, beautiful places where
disorder became harmony.</i>

153
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,260
<i>Let me get through it.</i>

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,780
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

155
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,580
<i>It begins.</i>

156
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,545
<i>The Ceremony.</i>

157
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,700
<i>Ceremony of the Release to Elsewhere,</i>

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,420
<i>honoring the elderly citizens
who have devoted their work</i>

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,740
<i>to the beauty and harmony
of our beloved Community,</i>

160
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,628
<i>and are now ready for joyous
retirement to Elsewhere.</i>

161
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,580
<i>Celebrating the Newchildren,</i>

162
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,780
<i>proudly engineered by our
esteemed geneticists.</i>

163
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,100
Abigail.

164
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,980
<i>Produced by our honored

<i>All of your training has been</i>

176

set you apart from others,</i>

<i>We were not hasty this time.
We could not afford another failure.</i>

<i>intelligence, integrity, courage,</i>

236

<i>and one I can name,

<i>But I must warn you,
your training involves pain.</i>

239
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,304
<i>Pain far beyond anything we know.</i>

240
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,630
<i>Are you strong enough?</i>

241

<i>Do we think Jonas is brave enough?</i>

242

<i>Jonas...</i>

246

Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas.
Jonas. Jonas. Jonas.

248
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,940
Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas.

249
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,940
- Help me up, please.
- Okay, this foot, yeah.

250
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,300
That one, you got it.

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,380
Sit back, sit back.

252
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,060
Is Jonas now more powerful than you?

253
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,860
- Shh.
- What did the Chief Elder mean

254
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,340
when she said, "We cannot
afford another failure"?

255
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,260
Well, ten years ago, the Receiver...

256
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,780
We do not speak of it.

257
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,780
You've been greatly honored.

258
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,780
You've got it! Go, go, go!
You've got it, got it, got it!

259
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,820
- I can do it.
- I should probably catch Lily.

260
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,900
- Good!
- I can ride!

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,865
Good, Lily!

262

<i>Receiver of Memory.</i>

263
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,025
<i>Five rules.</i>

264
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,260
<i>One: Report directly to
the Receiver of Memory</i>

265
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,100
<i>for your training.</i>

266
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,590
<i>After training, return
immediately to your dwelling.</i>

267
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,940
<i>Two: From this moment,</i>

268
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,700
<i>you are exempt from all
rules governing rudeness.</i>

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,950
<i>You may ask any question.</i>

270
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,700
<i>Three: Aside from
your daily injection,</i>

271
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,940
<i>you may not receive other medicines,</i>

272
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,900
<i>especially those for pain.</i>

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,868
<i>Injected. S-7- 5- 2.</i>

274
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,784
<i>Four: You may not discuss
your training with anyone.</i>

275
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,740
<i>Ever.</i>

276
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,260
Yours look so important.

277
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,340
I don't know. I stick out.

278
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,060
Well, yeah, there's only
one Receiver of Memory.

279
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,140
Two.

280
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,340
What did they say again?

281
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,700
You have the capacity to see beyond?

282
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,301
Yeah.

283
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,749
Can't wait to hear
every single detail.

284
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,669
<i>Five: You may lie.</i>

285
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,100
<i>Asher and I, we used
to dare each other</i>

286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,140
<i>to get close to his place.</i>

287
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,027
<i>It was built right on the Edge.</i>

288
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,060
<i>We'd all heard of people
getting lost to the Edge,</i>

289
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,420
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

290
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,670
<i>And yet, here I was,</i>

291
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,220
<i>being told that I'd have to
get close to it every day,</i>

292
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,822
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

293
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,780
<i>Welcome.</i>

294
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,140
Hi.

295
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,061
- I'm Jonas. I'm...
<i>- Please gaze at the sensor.</i>

296
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,027
<i>Welcome, Receiver of Memory.</i>

297
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,020
They're called books.

298
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,260
Your books.

299
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,780
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

300
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,900
Of course.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,180
I apologize.

302
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,311
I apologize.

303
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,825
Don't say that.

304
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
"I apologize."

305
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't apologize to me ever again.

306
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,750
Not here.

307
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,900
We haven't the time.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,300
"I apologize."

309
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,740
That's an automatic pleasantry.

310
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,300
It doesn't mean anything.

311
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,900
I apologize. I'm sorry.

312
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,831
I mean...

313
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,747
We are here for only one purpose.

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,661
Simply stated, although it
isn't really simple at all,

315
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,100
I will transmit to you all the
memories that I hold within me.

316
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,180
Memories of the past.

317
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,020
I would be very interested
to learn about your life.

318
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,622
No, no. Not...

319
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,791
Not my life.

320
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,620
You will learn the secret
history of the world.

321
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,820
Before me, before you, generations...

322
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,831
Back and back and back.

323
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,620
When things were different,
when there was more.

324
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,060
More?

325
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,060
The chair.

326
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,660
You see, no one in our Community
has any memory of the past.

327
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,420
Only me.

328
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,300
When the... Elders need
guidance on matters that are

329
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,340
beyond their experience,
I provide wisdom.

330
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,980
That is now your role.

331
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,180
To provide guidance in the present
using memories of the past.

332
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,384
Move closer.

333
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,670
Where to begin?

334
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,750
Move closer.

335
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,947
Closer.

336
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,300
There is no way for me to prepare you

337
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,540
for what I'm going to do now.

338
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,983
You can take comfort in knowing

339
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,540
you are completely helpless.

340
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,420
If any of this proves too much
for you, tell me immediately.

341
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,704
I just have...

342
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,660
<i>♪ Holy night</i>

343
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,860
<i>♪ All ♪</i>

344
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,500
That was...

345
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,940
It was...

346
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,020
How did that happen?

347
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,900
What do you mean, how? It happened.

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,220
But it's impossible.

349
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,380
And yet, it happened.

350
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,311
Well, why?

351
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,020
Why don't we have...

352
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,621
Th...

353
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,191
That thing?

354
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,180
Go on. The memories,
they give you the word.

355
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,500
It's not a "thing." It's...

356
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,420
- Sled.
- Sled.

357
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,980
And the...

358
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,630
- Snow.
- Snow.

359
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,500
Did my parents have them? Did you?

360
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,580
No, no. It's a very distant memory.

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,746
Simply stated, there is no snow
because of climate control.

362
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,540
But why don't people know about them?

363
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,140
I mean, what's so dangerous
about the memory of a sled?

364
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,460
What's so dangerous?

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,020
For a sled, you need snow.

366
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,140
Snow is cold.

367
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,549
Cold destroys crops.

368
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,220
Which meant farmers couldn't farm.

369
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,780
Unpredictable weather,
hills, mountains,

370
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,660
made it difficult to transport food.

371
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,300
Then we had hunger,
starvation, famine.

372
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,551
Everything is connected,
everything is a balance.

373
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,300
With good there is always bad.

374
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,504
- The two...
- Show me more.

375
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,590
Let's go for a walk.

376
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,421
A real one, with your legs.

377
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,304
At the bottom of the hill,
I saw something.

378
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,905
Like a place.

379
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,740
- Home.
- Home. Yes.

380
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,260
Home? Like a dwelling?

381
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,660
- Receiver.
- Afternoon.

382
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,706
No. It is different.

383
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,707
A dwelling is not a home.

384
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,509
A home is more.

385
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,220
Your instructions said I can lie.

386
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,380
Do you lie?

387
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,500
All the time.

388
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,102
Mostly for personal amusement.

389
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,060
But I won't lie to you.

390
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,583
How do I know that's not a lie?

391
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,430
There was someone else before me.

392
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,070
What happened to them?

393
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,180
One more question.

394
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,700
If I'm now the Receiver,
what does that make you?

395
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,951
Well, then that must make me...

396
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,270
The Giver.

397
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,780
So, how was it?

398
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,620
It was good.

399
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,426
What'd you do?

400
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,140
We just talked.

401
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,105
What else?

402
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,220
That's it.

403
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,460
- You seem different.
- How do you mean?

404
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,460
He can't settle down,

405
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,420
no matter what I do.

406
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,380
And you said you'd look after him.

407
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,860
- I know, I know.
- I apologize.

408
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,820
I accept your apology.

409
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,500
- Thank you, Dinah.
- Thank you.

410
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
Hey.

411
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,260
Gabriel?

412
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,460
How does Jonas know the child's name?

413
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,340
Jonas met Gabriel the other day.

414
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,863
Look at him! He's so cute!

415
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,540
- Hello. Hi.
- Would you like

416
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,824
to issue me a warning,
Director of Justice?

417
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,620
It's just for a while, Mother.

418
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,300
Till the little guy catches up.

419
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,551
I think we're all in agreement
that he sleeps in my room.

420
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,780
Only if the Elders say it's okay.

421
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,666
They will.

422
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,946
Yeah. Lily, give me
your Comfort Object.

423
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,623
Come on, Lily. It's time for bed.

424
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,462
- Look at this.
- Bye, baby.

425
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,020
This is a mythical
creature called a hippo.

426
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,900
And it's incredibly fast,
because it has two, three, four,

427
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,502
five legs.

428
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,460
<i>We had the same mark.</i>

429
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,222
<i>I almost didn't need
to see his to know.</i>

430
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,820
<i>But I felt it.</i>

431
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,500
<i>Felt that one day,</i>

432
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>Gabriel would be chosen, too.</i>

433
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,700
A hippo, Gabe.

434
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,306
Yeah.

435
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,460
That's the pain they all talk about.

436
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,660
No. Not even close. Did you...

437
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,140
It had a face.

438
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,260
Wait, was that thing alive?

439
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,380
Don't skip ahead.

440
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,100
Did you notice anything about it?

441
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,340
Yes. It hurt.

442
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,783
No. Any quality?

443
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,065
Well, maybe.

444
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,067
I think I saw it in my
friend Fiona's hair.

445
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,303
My first was yellow.

446
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,421
If you thought the
sled was special...

447
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,109
Oh, whoa!

448
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,860
It's...

449
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,506
red.

450
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,263
- Just like her hair.
- Yes.

451
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,468
There's red, green, blue,
many different colors.

452
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,382
You'll see them all in time.

453
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,784
When our people, they chose
to do away with all of them,

454
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,545
color, race, religion,
they created Sameness.

455
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,821
If we were different,
we could be envious,

456
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,469
angry, or resentful,
consumed with hatred.

457
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,424
We need Sameness.

458
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,740
Don't you think?

459
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,024
Oh, I completely agree.

460
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,545
But still...

461
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,184
It's all so beautiful.

462
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,380
<i>They'd always said
Elsewhere was so far away,</i>

463
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,180
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

464
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,066
<i>It was right there.</i>

465
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,626
<i>Close enough to touch.</i>

466
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,020
Jonas?

467
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,740
Have you fallen?

468
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,420
Do you need immediate help?

469
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,541
No. I was just...

470
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,585
What's going on with you?

471
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,060
Nothing is going on with me.

472
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,980
No, you're right, it's totally normal

473
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,500
to lie in the grass
and stare at the sky.

474
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,909
No, I was just...

475
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,622
You're seeing something, aren't you?

476
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,309
Can't you tell me?

477
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,231
Give me your hands.

478
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,945
What do you see?

479
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,469
- Oh, my goodness.
- You see it?

480
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,740
Yes.

481
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,471
It's water.

482
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,670
No, come on, concentrate.

483
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,107
Hi.

484
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,340
Jonas was just teaching
me about his training.

485
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,460
As you can see,
it's incredibly interesting.

486
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,620
Can't be half as great as mine.

487
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,949
Care to have your minds blown?

488
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,420
Whoa!

489
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,020
Do you know how to fly those?

490
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,380
Absolutely.

491
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,900
Sort of.

492
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,229
I'm learning.

493
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,511
When I'm flying,
looking down at everything,

494
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,780
it's like I'm seeing things
for the very first time.

495
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,660
You get to fly into Elsewhere?

496
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,740
Oh, yeah.

497
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,149
Once, when I was
looking at that mist,

498
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,660
even though they tell us there's
nothing close to the Edge,

499
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,547
I thought I saw a tree
out there somewhere.

500
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,700
Well, don't get too excited.

501
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,740
I've actually seen Elsewhere.

502
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,620
It's just mostly our farms,
weird rocks, that kind of stuff.

503
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,660
What's weird about them?

504
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,944
There's these two huge rocks

505
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,900
leaning against each other,
making a kind of triangle.

506
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,660
Hey, it's kind of like our triangle.

507
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,780
What's past there?

508
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,220
Don't know.

509
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,663
We're not allowed to fly past that.

510
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,180
So many secrets.

511
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,580
So what are your secrets?

512
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,780
Uh, nothing.

513
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,660
What do you mean, "Uh, nothing"?

514
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,625
You're Receiver of Memory.

515
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,711
Maybe I can show you.

516
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,900
- Okay, grab a tray.
- What?

517
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,548
Bring it over to the
solar panel. Come on.

518
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,946
Now this might seem a little funny,
but you got to trust me.

519
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,744
Okay, sit down on the tray.

520
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,940
- Careful.
- You're not gonna...

521
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,900
- What, you're scared?
- I'm scared of nothing.

522
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,740
I don't know, it's just...

523
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,260
It's against the rules, Jonas.

524
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,181
Since when do you
care about the rules?

525
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,708
Actually, I have auxiliary training.

526
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,791
I'll see you guys.

527
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,302
Look who grew up,
but lucky for you, I haven't.

528
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,780
Okay?

529
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,940
Now, go!

530
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,344
Put your heels down to slow it!

531
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,860
I think your training might be a bit

532
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,900
- more fun than mine.
<i>- Please stand by</i>

533
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,980
<i>for a Community announcement.</i>

534
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,660
<i>Citizens are reminded that
it is impolite to touch</i>

535
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,460
<i>community members outside
your family unit.</i>

536
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,300
<i>Thank you.</i>

537
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,140
<i>He's punctual.</i>

538
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,020
- He's inquisitive.
- How inquisitive?

539
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,180
He's interested in his position.

540
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,544
Then why is he breaking the rules?

541
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
He has been observed
trying to share his training

542
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,540
with his former classmates.

543
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,744
That always happens.

544
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,267
But it's an impossible experiment.

545
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,670
Even I tried to share the memories
back when I was in training...

546
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,985
If you remember.

547
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,711
So, forget about it.

548
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,220
I don't tell you what to do in
your position, so don't tell me.

549
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,420
I apologize, but isn't
that what's happening now?

550
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,502
Your apology is accepted,
but you are being careless.

551
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,340
You're moving too fast.

552
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,546
We both know what happened
ten years ago with the girl.

553
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,110
The girl had a name.

554
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,862
You think I don't remember her name?

555
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,749
I know you feel her loss.

556
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,184
The boy must hold in the pain.

557
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,390
Don't fail us again.

558
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,980
You want me to read all these?

559
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,620
What's this?

560
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,940
"One day you shall meet a boy

561
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,827
who answers to the name of Jonas."

562
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,340
"He shall be the most powerful
of all the Receivers."

563
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,660
Wait. That says...

564
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,750
Don't be gullible.

565
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,180
Another trick?

566
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,225
Actually, no.

567
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,700
It's some kind of map.

568
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,900
The Triangle of Rocks!

569
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,582
Hey, that's real,
my friend Asher saw it.

570
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,785
Look at all these towers.

571
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,940
What were they for?

572
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,420
How did your friend see
the Triangle of Rocks?

573
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,500
He's a pilot. He told me he saw it.

574
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,541
What's past there?

575
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,709
A mystery.

576
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,740
"Boundary of Memory"?
Is that what they built

577
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,220
so the memories would only
stay within you and me?

578
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,420
Let's move on.

579
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,700
Wait.

580
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,020
That boundary is meant
to keep memories in.

581
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,031
So if a Receiver crosses it,

582
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,583
does that mean the
memories get set free?

583
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,500
Perhaps.

584
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,020
Perhaps if you or I crossed it,

585
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,861
everyone could feel
those memories again.

586
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,142
So, what am I seeing today?

587
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,544
Nothing.

588
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,671
You're seeing nothing today.

589
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,708
We've already covered
"seeing beyond."

590
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,460
There is also such a thing
as "hearing beyond."

591
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,100
A table?

592
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,828
All the food would
slide to the floor.

593
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,380
Now, don't judge me.

594
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,903
I'm not very good,

595
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,180
even though I had
a very good Teacher.

596
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,860
Music.

597
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,620
Well, music when I
hit the right keys.

598
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,990
Just like music,

599
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,147
there's something else you
can't see with your eyes.

600
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,547
Something that lives deep inside you.

601
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,464
Something those morning
injections take away.

602
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,500
But I thought the injections
are for our health.

603
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,740
No, they remove something.

604
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,466
What?

605
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,300
Emotions.

606
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,705
You mean like feelings?

607
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,980
Feelings are just fleeting.

608
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,706
On the surface.

609
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,500
But emotions,

610
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,460
they're very deep, primal.

611
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,471
They linger.

612
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,711
Now, Jonas...

613
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,380
you might not understand where
you are or what's happening,

614
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,221
but don't think about
what you're seeing.

615
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,625
Listen.

616
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,465
Listen to what's calling from inside.

617
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,660
A beautiful wedding!

618
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,500
Why would anyone want
to get rid of this?

619
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,670
Good question.

620
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,660
What are you doing?

621
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,546
Take my hand.

622
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,780
Ready?

623
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,940
You ready for the fast part?

624
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,660
And turn!

625
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,740
Spin!

626
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,460
What are you doing with her?

627
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,780
Jonas says it's called dancing.

628
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,066
<i>Please stand by for a transmission.</i>

629
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,900
<i>I apologize for my intrusion.</i>

630
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,900
We accept your apology.

631
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,540
<i>I just wanted to say hello.</i>

632
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,180
Hello.

633
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm Lily.

634
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,980
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

635
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,580
<i>You're a Nine now, isn't that right?</i>

636
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,060
Lily, I think it's time for school.

637
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,788
- We should probably get going.
- Hello, Jonas.

638
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,300
Hello.

639
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,580
<i>How is your training?</i>

640
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,820
<i>Injected.</i>

641
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,020
Fine.

642
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,100
<i>I am concerned about the Receiver.</i>

643
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,700
<i>Injected.</i>

644
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,860
<i>Many years ago,
there was an incident.</i>

645
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,580
What kind of incident?

646
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,140
<i>Living alone in a building on
the Edge can isolate a person.</i>

647
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,506
<i>I'm concerned that the
Receiver is becoming reckless.</i>

648
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,460
<i>Are you being properly prepared?</i>

649
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,540
I think so.

650
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,949
<i>You're focused?</i>

651
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,260
<i>Perhaps you're spending too much time
with friends from your childhood.</i>

652
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,340
I'm focused.

653
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,700
<i>Jonas, what do you and
the Receiver actually do?</i>

654
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,420
My rules say I'm not
allowed to share.

655
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,465
She is the Chief Elder.

656
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,184
Jonas, she only wants to help.

657
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,511
You're right.

658
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,022
But you can't tell the
Receiver I told you.

659
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,340
<i>You have my word.</i>

660
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,300
We sit in chairs and
don't talk all day long.

661
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,028
And then when time is up,
I come back here,

662
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,061
and in the morning,
I do it all again.

663
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,463
I apologize, but I'm late.

664
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,508
<i>Your apology is accepted.</i>

665
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,706
Goodbye, Mother.

666
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,180
<i>Injected.</i>

667
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,900
<i>He's not usually like this.</i>

668
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,749
I'm surprised you're not
more worried about him.

669
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,102
Were he my responsibility,
I would be.

670
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,300
<i>We'd been told the Chief
Elder knew everything.</i>

671
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,700
<i>Things nobody else did.</i>

672
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,061
<i>But I had learned that
knowing what something is,</i>

673
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,150
<i>is not the same as knowing
how something feels.</i>

674
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,980
You get to be the very best,

675
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,460
the last one at the
top of the mountain,

676
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,540
gasping for air,
having survived, and be alone.

677
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,940
Be curious.

678
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,820
<i>I got lost.</i>

679
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,910
<i>The good kind of lost.</i>

680
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,980
<i>I saw sights and sounds I
had no words to describe.</i>

681
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,540
<i>Faces with flesh of
all different colors.</i>

682
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,380
<i>I felt so alive.</i>

683
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,060
<i>This was forbidden?</i>

684
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,311
<i>I didn't know what
to think, what to believe.</i>

685
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,380
<i>Have faith, the Giver told me.</i>

686
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,900
<i>He said faith,
that was seeing beyond.</i>

687
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,700
<i>He compared it to the wind,
something felt but not seen.</i>

688
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,060
Don't accept...

689
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,300
What is the truth just because

690
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,060
it's coming from someone you respect.

691
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,740
I feel completely stupid.

692
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,260
- I have a weird feeling.
- Weird?

693
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,510
- It tingles in your hands.
- Yes.

694
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,467
Memories are not just about the past,

695
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,023
they determine our future.

696
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,260
You can change things.

697
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,749
You can make things better.

698
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,464
<i>It was life.</i>

699
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,587
<i>It just seemed more complete.</i>

700
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,868
<i>The more I experienced,
the more I wanted.</i>

701
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,071
<i>Once, there were other living things.</i>

702
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,780
<i>But unlike us,</i>

703
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,270
<i>they knew who their
mothers and fathers were.</i>

704
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,260
<i>They had joy</i>

705
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,464
and they had pain.

706
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,780
I can't prepare you for
what's going to happen...

707
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,340
You don't need to warn
me every single time.

708
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,780
No, Jonas, you don't understand.

709
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,420
There was tremendous cruelty.

710
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,900
Giver, I'm not a kid any more.

711
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,990
Show me.

712
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,660
That's $250,000 of ivory.

713
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,780
Come on!

714
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,711
Come on!

715
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,985
Got him!

716
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,269
No, stop! Stop!

717
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,026
Stop.

718
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,860
Gabe.

719
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,020
Hey, hey.

720
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,620
Hey, hey, Gabe.

721
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,740
Gabe.

722
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,980
If I tell you a secret, do you
promise not to tell anyone?

723
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,784
I'll take that as a yes.

724
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,150
This Comfort Object

725
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,985
is not a hippo.

726
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,100
It's an elephant.

727
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,180
And once, it was real.

728
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,425
And it was beautiful.

729
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,140
<i>Citizens are reminded</i>

730
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,020
<i>that sleep period
commences in 15 minutes.</i>

731
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,621
<i>Thank you.</i>

732
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,140
It was like a memory,
but Fiona was there.

733
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,071
You had a dream.

734
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,300
- A what?
- A dream.

735
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,780
A combination of reality,
fantasy, emotions

736
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,540
and what you had for dinner.

737
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,231
You've stopped taking your
injections, haven't you?

738
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,380
The emotion was so strong.

739
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,660
And at the wedding, everyone all
together, laughing and dancing.

740
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,940
The old with the young,
the bride and the groom,

741
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,349
there was something there.

742
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,300
But different to what we have.

743
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,026
Yes.

744
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,308
We don't have that any more.

745
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,340
What do you mean by "that"?

746
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,423
Well, I'm talking about what
you feel for someone else.

747
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,900
And the mind can't
explain it and you...

748
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,060
You can't make it go away.

749
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,180
What is it?

750
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,191
Love.

751
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,545
It's called love.

752
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,786
Love.

753
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,300
Oh, hi.

754
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,860
Hi.

755
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,428
So what's new?

756
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,260
What's new with you?

757
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,669
What's ever new?

758
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,100
Why are you being weird?

759
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,980
I'm not.

760
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,866
I'm just...

761
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,111
I'm just...

762
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,340
Hold on to the hippo, Gabe!

763
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,180
Hold on!

764
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,300
Father, do you love me?

765
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,380
Jonas, precision of language.

766
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,540
Please.

767
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,180
What does "love" mean?

768
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,860
I got him, Lily.

769
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,340
Jonas used a word so antiquated

770
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,820
that it no longer
has any application.

771
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,260
- Okay?
- Okay.

772
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,501
If you asked, "Do you enjoy me?"
the answer is certainly yes.

773
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,191
Or do Mother and I take pride
in your accomplishments?

774
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,220
Well, of course we do.

775
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,504
Do you understand?

776
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,060
Yes.

777
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,980
I think I finally do.

778
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,540
Hey!

779
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,541
Hey, Gabe!

780
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,340
Boop- ah! Boop- ah!

781
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,341
Boop- ah!

782
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,940
I love you, Gabriel.

783
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,220
Whoa! Ho, ho, ho!

784
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,260
Giver, you were right!

785
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,860
I asked my family about love and...

786
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,224
Get down! Get down!

787
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,460
Giver!

788
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,860
They're in the trees!

789
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,500
They're in the trees, Robbie!

790
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,980
Get down! Get down!

791
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,580
Robbie, get down!

792
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,380
- Robbie, get down!
- Stay down!

793
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,820
- It's an ambush!
- I can't see them, man!

794
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,460
They're in the trees.

795
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,860
Stay down!

796
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,549
Medic!

797
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,703
Robbie. Robbie.

798
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,740
<i>- There's women firing on us.</i>
- Robbie.

799
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,860
<i>Listen, I'm certain
they're firing on us.</i>

800
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,100
Jonas.

801
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,180
What...

802
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,980
No. I'm sorry, Jonas.

803
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,620
How did people do that?

804
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,348
I didn't mean for you
to receive that.

805
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,500
Not for years.

806
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,380
Don't let this turn you away.

807
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,780
I'm not strong enough.

808
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,980
Of course not yet!

809
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,949
But, Jonas, this is what we
need to know so we can advise.

810
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,420
I can't.

811
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,260
I'm sorry.

812
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,260
I just can't.

813
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,180
Jonas! Jonas! Jonas!

814
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,941
Come back!

815
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,220
Please! Come back inside!

816
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,900
Let me explain it!

817
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,940
When you see something like that,
there's no explanation.

818
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,340
Rosemary, promise me
you'll come back tomorrow.

819
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,780
Rosemary!

820
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,870
<i>Promise me.</i>

821
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,980
Hey, Jonas.

822
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,700
Come on. You're just in time.

823
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,540
<i>I didn't ever want to go back.</i>

824
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,587
<i>I didn't want the wisdom,
didn't want the pain.</i>

825
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,460
<i>I wanted my childhood again.</i>

826
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,301
<i>Scraped knees and ball games.</i>

827
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,348
<i>Back then, we'd played war.</i>

828
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,940
<i>But war was real.</i>

829
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,460
<i>The Elders understood that.</i>

830
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,903
<i>They'd erased it from our world.</i>

831
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,900
<i>Maybe they were right.</i>

832
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,540
- Could you watch over Harry for me?
- Of course.

833
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,264
Hey, what's wrong?

834
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,020
Nothing.

835
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,860
I know you.

836
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,100
You do, do you?

837
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,701
Yes.

838
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,540
What do you think would happen

839
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,585
if you skipped your
morning injection?

840
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,300
If you skipped it.

841
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,860
Then the sensor would blink and
remind me that I forgot it.

842
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,220
No, I don't mean if you forgot.

843
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,900
I mean, what do you think
would happen if you chose

844
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,100
not to be injected?

845
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,940
Jonas, I thought something was wrong.

846
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,580
There is something wrong.

847
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,180
Everything is wrong.

848
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,500
I quit.

849
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,829
Fiona, I'm done being the Receiver.

850
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,780
Tomorrow morning,
skip your injection.

851
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,860
What? You quit?

852
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,780
Prick your finger and put
a little blood on this apple.

853
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,900
No, you can't quit.

854
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,820
If you quit your position,
you get sent to Elsewhere.

855
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,900
When you leave in the morning,
put the apple over the sensor.

856
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,620
It'll find your blood and
think it's your hand.

857
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,980
Stop, you're scaring me.

858
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,420
Fiona, I need you to do this.
I need you to feel what I know it's...

859
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,226
Jonas.

860
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,940
An apple wouldn't even work.

861
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,862
I've been doing it for months,
and it's worked every single time.

862
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,060
Don't quit.

863
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,866
You can't leave.

864
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,146
I don't think I can go
back to that place.

865
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,110
You will if you want me to do this.

866
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,384
Okay. Fine.

867
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,267
But tomorrow after work,
meet me in the triangle.

868
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,060
<i>I wanted to share it with her.</i>

869
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,340
<i>Not all of it.</i>

870
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,140
<i>The good things.</i>

871
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,583
<i>Was I wrong to want that?</i>

872
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,510
<i>I thought about her now,
all the time.</i>

873
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,100
Hello?

874
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,540
I have something to show you.

875
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,664
Come here.

876
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,385
Who are you?

877
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,940
Come over and try this.

878
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,020
- Me?
- Me?

879
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,100
Yeah.

880
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,384
I want to teach you.

881
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,345
You've come back.

882
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,860
Where did you learn that?

883
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,500
From the memory you gave me.

884
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,260
And you can just play it?

885
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,260
That's beautiful.

886
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,340
- Who's that?
- Thanks.

887
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,069
- This is Rosemary.
- I'll show you.

888
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,380
The previous Receiver.

889
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,221
- See?
- She's the one they all talk about.

890
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,700
She no longer exists.

891
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,980
Remember?

892
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,340
Except here.

893
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,780
And in my memories.

894
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,820
She was in training
only two short months.

895
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,420
♪ Watch how my fingers move ♪

896
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,465
And like you,

897
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,508
she wanted to experience,

898
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,860
well, everything.

899
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,820
I only gave her pleasant,
beautiful memories.

900
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,620
Three, four...

901
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,060
She fought me.

902
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,460
- Don't protect me.
- No!

903
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,220
Don't show me a map and then
not give me all the memories.

904
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,260
- I thought we were gonna help.
- We will, but we must move slow.

905
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,225
Show it to me.

906
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,465
You gave her war?

907
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,630
I gave her the memory of a child...

908
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,590
A child taken from her mother.

909
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,349
I gave her loss.

910
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,540
Too soon.

911
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,347
You're gonna get the hang of this.

912
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,860
The light went from her eyes.

913
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,663
The next morning, without telling me,

914
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,668
she went to the Chief Elder
and asked to be Released.

915
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,940
So she was Released?

916
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,110
And now lives in Elsewhere?

917
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,340
<i>Yes, Receiver?</i>

918
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,420
I would like to see
this morning's Release.

919
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,660
<i>Thank you for your instructions.</i>

920
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,500
- There, there.
- That's my father.

921
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,580
This one is heavier.

922
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,940
More twins. Great.

923
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,349
- Watch.
- Oh, good.

924
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,460
For a moment, I thought
they'd be exactly the same.

925
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,540
Here we go.

926
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,180
Then we'd have a problem.

927
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,100
Okay, okay.

928
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,900
Thank you, Dinah.

929
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,580
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- And you,

930
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,820
only one unit less.

931
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,340
Oh, I know it hurts, I know.

932
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,780
I know, I know.

933
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,260
But I have to use a vein,
and the ones in your arms

934
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,100
are too teeny weenie.

935
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,300
Almost, almost...

936
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,420
Done.

937
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,988
That wasn't so bad now, was it?

938
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,300
That's death.

939
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,780
He doesn't know what he's doing.

940
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,860
Doesn't know what he's doing?

941
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,660
He killed him.

942
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,910
But he doesn't know what it means.

943
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,020
Just like you didn't.

944
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,349
Neither did Rosemary.

945
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,340
How can he not see the
baby isn't moving?

946
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,140
Doesn't that tell him
something is wrong?

947
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,780
The young and the old are killed.

948
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,220
You're friend, Fiona,

949
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,820
she will soon be trained
to Release as well.

950
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,820
That's a lie.

951
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,300
She'd never do that.

952
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,380
If Fiona understood...

953
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,020
We are the only ones
who understand it.

954
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,420
Then it's our fault.

955
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,180
You and me and all the Receivers

956
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,260
back and back and back
and back and back.

957
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,100
There has to be a way to show them,

958
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,180
to give them the memories
so they can understand.

959
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,386
- Yes.
- Because if you can't feel,

960
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,220
what's the point?

961
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,310
But what can you do?

962
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,620
<i>Citizens are reminded</i>

963
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,260
<i>that evening recreation
will end in 30 minutes.</i>

964
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,305
<i>Thank you.</i>

965
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,980
Did it work?

966
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,740
I don't know how long it
takes for the injections

967
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,420
to leave you, whether a
day was long enough or...

968
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,943
Why did I do this, Jonas?

969
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,980
On the walk here, I was thinking
of how I would scold you.

970
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,540
How I would say,
"Oh, it's fine for you

971
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,820
to break the rules
because you're chosen."

972
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,344
When I thought about
telling you, I just, I...

973
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,460
I began to think about you.

974
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,911
Is this okay?

975
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,989
Do you feel anything?

976
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,580
It feels like...

977
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,740
Fiona,

978
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,380
- what do you feel?
- I don't know.

979
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,460
I don't have the
words to describe it.

980
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,660
Warm?

981
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,100
Does it feel warm?

982
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,260
Warm?

983
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,783
Does it feel nice?

984
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,460
No...

985
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,540
I, I'm on night shift.

986
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,860
I need to...

987
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,660
I don't feel right, Jonas.

988
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,260
I need to go and get my injection.

989
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,703
I need to go to work.

990
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,580
What was that?

991
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,540
Fiona, there is more.

992
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,790
So much more.

993
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,100
<i>I remembered it now.</i>

994
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,060
<i>I had dreamed of her.</i>

995
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,264
<i>When I was younger.</i>

996
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,670
<i>I told my parents.</i>

997
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,380
<i>"It was the Stirrings they said.</i>

998
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,220
<i>Everyone had them.</i>

999
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,620
<i>Medication would stop them.</i>

1000
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,420
<i>Nothing that couldn't be fixed.</i>

1001
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,180
Precision of language.

1002
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,820
And Teacher said,
"That's right, Lily."

1003
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,820
Very good.

1004
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,180
Jonas.

1005
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,500
Just in time for Feelings.

1006
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,300
- Lily was telling us how she...
- Where's Gabe?

1007
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,700
Uncertain was returned
to the Nurturing Center.

1008
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,900
What happened?

1009
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,150
Well, he failed his Test of Maturity.

1010
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,300
Again.

1011
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,940
I couldn't ask for another extension,

1012
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,383
so I'll have to Release
him to Elsewhere.

1013
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,900
Release him?

1014
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,582
Well, we certainly gave it
our best try, didn't we?

1015
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,540
But he's family.

1016
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,980
Precision of language, please.

1017
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,740
Sit down.

1018
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,830
Eat with us.

1019
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,304
I just need to rest for a while.

1020
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,020
<i>I hadn't been wrong.</i>

1021
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,740
<i>This was wrong.</i>

1022
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,860
<i>They hadn't eliminated murder.</i>

1023
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,740
<i>They'd brought it home.</i>

1024
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,627
<i>They just called it
by a different name.</i>

1025
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,550
<i>Father, he didn't know any better.</i>

1026
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,231
<i>I did.</i>

1027
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,940
Jonas, what are you doing?
It's against the rules

1028
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,540
to leave your community this late.

1029
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,940
Asher, there's something
I have to do that is right,

1030
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,220
but is sort of against the rules.

1031
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,060
If it's the right thing to do,
how can it be against the rules?

1032
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,300
There are things that I've learned

1033
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,740
that you don't know
that you can't know,

1034
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,140
- not because it's your fault...
- Jonas,

1035
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,580
you need to go back
to your family unit.

1036
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,340
But that's the point.

1037
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,980
It isn't my family,
and neither is yours.

1038
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,420
- Asher, I got to go.
- Jonas, listen.

1039
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,340
- Get out of my way.
- Jonas, stop!

1040
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,026
Giver!

1041
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,740
Giver, wake up.

1042
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,700
I'd have to be sleeping to wake up.

1043
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,940
Something can be done.
Something can be done.

1044
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,060
What are you proposing?

1045
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,660
All the memories back and back
and back can be returned.

1046
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,940
I need to leave the Community.

1047
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,540
I need to find the
Boundary of Memory.

1048
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,620
And then?

1049
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,860
And then cross it.

1050
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,660
- No more discussions.
- Slowly.

1051
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,740
Gabe is in danger.

1052
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,500
- Slowly.
- I can't wait any more.

1053
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,590
Something must be done.

1054
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,180
If you had that map, then why
didn't you try to leave?

1055
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,869
I was waiting for someone like you.

1056
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,860
You are the reason we have a chance.

1057
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,060
So, the plan will be for you
to go and for me to stay.

1058
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,389
If you did cross this Boundary,

1059
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,500
and if the memories were set free,

1060
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,140
all of the pain that you felt,
all the confusion, the chaos,

1061
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,420
it would all return.

1062
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,341
- So you'd stay to help them?
- Yes.

1063
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,825
And for my daughter.

1064
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,780
It's what she would've wanted.

1065
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,140
Your daughter?

1066
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,980
Rosemary.

1067
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,300
Now, your friend.

1068
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,660
If he truly saw the
Triangle of Rocks...

1069
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,343
Bring up Jonas's activity
for the past year as well.

1070
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,540
So Asher came directly to you?

1071
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,620
Yes.

1072
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,420
What was Jonas's disposition
at evening meal?

1073
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,100
Dissatisfied.

1074
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,220
Anxious.

1075
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,340
Indignant.

1076
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,940
Set up a communication with
the Receiver of Memory.

1077
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,860
We're not permitted to see
into the Receiver's residence.

1078
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,180
We can only transmit.

1079
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,500
Well, then we shall only transmit.

1080
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,580
If you go, head towards the Triangle,

1081
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,500
away from the other Communities.

1082
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,340
That will lead to the
Boundary of Memory.

1083
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,820
<i>Please stand by for a transmission.</i>

1084
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,780
<i>I apologize for the intrusion.</i>

1085
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,189
I accept your apology.

1086
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,220
<i>We have a problem.
The Receiver-in-Training is missing,</i>

1087
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,100
<i>and he physically attacked
his friend, Asher.</i>

1088
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,660
He did?

1089
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,780
That's serious.

1090
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,667
<i>Do you know where Jonas is?</i>

1091
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,180
I do not.

1092
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,980
Well, thank you very much

1093
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,740
for helping us to narrow
down the possibilities.

1094
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,900
<i>I will contact you if he comes here.</i>

1095
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,628
<i>Only if it's not an imposition.</i>

1096
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,706
<i>Thank you.</i>

1097
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,940
He's lying.

1098
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,060
Talk!

1099
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,660
They're going to kill Gabe.

1100
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,980
I'm leaving, I'm leaving tonight,
and I'm going to take him with me.

1101
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,940
Jonas, not yet, you're not ready.

1102
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,544
When they decided to kill Gabe,
they decided I was ready.

1103
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,420
I like this map.

1104
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,500
Don't mess it up.

1105
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,431
I'll be wanting it back.

1106
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,463
You don't mind if I accelerate
your training a bit, do you?

1107
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,340
You'd think for someone who
is the keeper of emotions,

1108
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,704
that I'd be better at...

1109
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,421
Well...

1110
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,106
I love you, Jonas.

1111
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,668
There. There it is.

1112
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,740
You have the courage.

1113
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,025
- Let me give you the strength.
- Can I just...

1114
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,220
<i>Attention all Community residents,</i>

1115
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,820
<i>the Receiver-in-Training
has been reported missing</i>

1116
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,260
<i>from his dwelling.</i>

1117
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,820
<i>Please, be alert.</i>

1118
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,467
<i>He may be in danger.</i>

1119
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,260
The Group One will start from
the Edge and work inward.

1120
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,544
And then Group Two
from the center out.

1121
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,705
No, no, like this.

1122
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,740
<i>Welcome to the Nurturing Center.</i>

1123
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,460
- Shall I convene the Elders?
- Yes.

1124
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,260
Jonas!

1125
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,340
I heard an alert.

1126
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,420
What's going on?

1127
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,500
Hey, where's Gabe?

1128
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,580
Is he here?

1129
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,140
- Is he in one of these?
- If he's back,

1130
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,860
then he'd be with the Uncertains
on a restricted floor.

1131
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,621
Show me where.

1132
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,826
Fiona, please.

1133
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,980
They're downstairs. Come on.

1134
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,820
<i>Jonas was chosen for the
most important position</i>

1135
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,460
<i>in our Community.</i>

1136
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,620
He was asked if he
were strong enough.

1137
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,420
It turns out he was not.

1138
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,100
<i>Instead, he is a rebel</i>

1139
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,740
<i>who must be stopped by you.</i>

1140
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,910
<i>When you find him,</i>

1141
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,380
take him.

1142
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,460
Gabe is in danger.

1143
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,260
- Jonas, he's fine, I'll show you.
- No, he's not fine.

1144
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,580
He should be here.

1145
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,100
Fiona, I'm leaving tonight.

1146
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,980
Leaving? What do you mean?

1147
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,620
I'm taking Gabe.
We're leaving the Community.

1148
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,380
I want you to come with us.

1149
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,980
There you go.

1150
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,100
There you go.

1151
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,109
<i>I don't have the
words to describe it.</i>

1152
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,780
<i>Fiona, there is more.</i>

1153
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,745
<i>So much more.</i>

1154
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,660
What are they doing?

1155
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,380
<i>Fiona, what do you feel?</i>

1156
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,980
<i>I don't have the
words to describe it.</i>

1157
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,105
<i>Attention, Nurturers.</i>

1158
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,660
<i>Please secure your work
area and immediately report</i>

1159
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,185
<i>to the Newborns Nursery to allow
for a security search procedure.</i>

1160
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,111
<i>Promptly report all sightings
at the nearest security kiosk.</i>

1161
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,866
<i>Thank you.</i>

1162
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,620
Fiona, we got to go now.
You, me and Gabe.

1163
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,140
Jonas, I can't.
What about my family unit?

1164
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,071
The other Newchildren?

1165
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,540
- I can't leave them.
- This is the only way.

1166
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,586
This is the only way to
make everything okay.

1167
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,264
I can't go.

1168
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,903
When I get there, you'll understand.

1169
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,380
I'll come back for you.

1170
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,061
Jonas!

1171
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,540
<i>We're checking the Nurturing Center.</i>

1172
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,551
Come back.

1173
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,420
Now go, Jonas!

1174
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,300
Please! Stop!
She's in corridor three!

1175
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,940
<i>Subject lost to the Edge.</i>

1176
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,871
<i>Search terminated.</i>

1177
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,740
And I asked why he was out so late.

1178
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,140
He seemed angry.

1179
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,830
I didn't understand why,
but I wanted to help him.

1180
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,260
He hit me, and at first...

1181
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,940
I can tell why you've
been acting this way.

1182
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,191
Your injection levels
are extremely low.

1183
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,580
I can correct this.

1184
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,864
Friends forever, right?

1185
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,304
And then we will address
what's happened.

1186
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,460
<i>When I went over the Edge,</i>

1187
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,340
<i>we shouldn't have made it.</i>

1188
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,820
<i>This was a miracle.</i>

1189
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,420
<i>The Giver had talked about them.</i>

1190
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,830
<i>He told me I could draw
strength from the memories.</i>

1191
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,741
<i>I knew by giving them to Gabe,</i>

1192
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,628
<i>I could protect him.</i>

1193
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,460
<i>Prick your finger and put a
little blood on this apple.</i>

1194
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,180
<i>When you leave in the morning,
put the apple over the sensor.</i>

1195
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,900
<i>I've been doing it for months,
and it's worked every single time.</i>

1196
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,707
What has he taught you?

1197
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,620
<i>This is the only way.</i>

1198
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,620
<i>This is the only way to
make everything okay.</i>

1199
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,980
<i>Gabe is in danger.</i>

1200
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,180
<i>What they're gonna
do to him is really bad.</i>

1201
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,260
<i>I want you to come with us.</i>

1202
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,180
<i>When I get there, you'll understand.</i>

1203
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,380
<i>I'll come back for you.</i>

1204
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,061
Yes.

1205
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,380
Careful.

1206
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,226
Careful.

1207
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,140
I apologize for failing again.

1208
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,980
I don't think you failed.

1209
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,700
I think you succeeded with your plan.

1210
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,540
Ever since the girl was Released,
you haven't been the same.

1211
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,860
I genuinely hoped
Jonas would help you.

1212
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,260
You'd have a fresh start.

1213
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,828
The two of you would work together.

1214
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,584
Which, it seems, you have.

1215
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,270
We will find Jonas.

1216
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,340
<i>Jonas, our Receiver of Memory,</i>

1217
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,900
<i>lost to the Edge.</i>

1218
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,540
Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas,

1219
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,100
Jonas, Jonas, Jonas,

1220
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,700
Jonas, Jonas,

1221
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,060
Jonas, Jonas, Jonas...

1222
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,940
How do they know Jonas is gone?

1223
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,420
We must not say his name any more.

1224
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,180
I will.

1225
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,820
You have to be quiet now, Lily.

1226
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,980
Jonas, Jonas...

1227
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,020
And a hippo is really an elephant.

1228
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,625
Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas...

1229
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,020
What I'm about to tell you,
you must never repeat to anyone.

1230
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,300
I don't believe Jonas is Lost.

1231
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,500
But the Ceremony of Loss?

1232
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,540
A charade.

1233
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,340
I don't expect you to understand,

1234
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,940
but you must know that Jonas
has become dangerous.

1235
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,700
He must be stopped.

1236
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,144
He must not get beyond
the Triangle of Rocks.

1237
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,260
What do you want me to do?

1238
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,060
You know Jonas.

1239
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,991
I want you to find him.

1240
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,500
And then...

1241
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,222
I want you to lose him.

1242
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,340
Jonas.

1243
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:06,103
- What are you doing?
<i>- Asher, please, let us go.</i>

1244
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,180
I can't.

1245
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,300
I'm supposed to...

1246
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,311
<i>To what?</i>

1247
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,705
To lose you.

1248
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,100
Asher, if you are my friend,

1249
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,300
<i>if you ever were my friend,</i>

1250
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,460
<i>can you please somehow trust me?</i>

1251
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,744
Trust me now.

1252
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,991
I do trust you, Jonas.

1253
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,504
Come on, please.

1254
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,665
Jonas.

1255
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,145
<i>You found him.</i>

1256
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,260
I did.

1257
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,430
<i>For the good of all of us,</i>

1258
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,506
<i>I beg you,</i>

1259
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,784
finish this.

1260
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,706
It's finished.

1261
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,985
Hey.

1262
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,504
It's okay.

1263
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,540
<i>Nothing the Giver had shown me</i>

1264
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,020
<i>had prepared me for
the voices in my head,</i>

1265
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,622
<i>screaming at me to stop.</i>

1266
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,026
<i>But I knew Fiona would be
punished for helping me,</i>

1267
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,662
<i>Asher, for letting me go.</i>

1268
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,180
<i>The only way to help them,</i>

1269
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,620
<i>to keep them alive,</i>

1270
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,749
<i>Was to get to the Boundary,
if it even existed.</i>

1271
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,660
<i>I strengthened Gabe with
memories of having enough</i>

1272
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,910
<i>and knowing joy.</i>

1273
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,061
<i>It was the memory of Fiona
that kept me going.</i>

1274
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,191
Fiona?

1275
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,420
I've taken care of everything.

1276
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,420
We've arranged for your Release.

1277
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,060
There'll be a nice ceremony.

1278
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,503
Now, you get some rest.

1279
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,780
- I felt things.
- What?

1280
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,420
I know that there's something more.

1281
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,620
- Fiona...
- Something missing from our lives.

1282
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,860
No, not missing.

1283
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,624
Something that has been
stolen from me and from you.

1284
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,302
I don't know what it is exactly,

1285
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,470
but Jonas does.

1286
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:51,745
I have felt things, and they
were warm, and they were nice.

1287
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,103
They were beautiful.

1288
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,180
I have felt things.

1289
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,066
I have felt things.

1290
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,149
I have felt things.

1291
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,022
Where is the tower, Gabe?

1292
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,948
The tower should be here.

1293
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,146
You can stop this.

1294
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,140
Stop what?

1295
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,030
If you don't want to see it,
sit down with the other Elders.

1296
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,384
Close your eyes.

1297
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,227
<i>Ceremony of Release to Elsewhere.</i>

1298
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,860
Hello, Fiona.

1299
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,825
You uncomfortable?

1300
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,780
I'm not uncomfortable.

1301
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,825
I'm afraid.

1302
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,549
You don't have to be afraid.

1303
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,580
You know me.

1304
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,460
I'll be very gentle.

1305
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,340
I promise.

1306
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,101
Okay?

1307
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,900
Her name was Rosemary.

1308
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,940
She was my daughter.

1309
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,060
I loved her.

1310
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,380
Precision of language.

1311
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,180
I could not be more precise.

1312
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,748
Do you know what that's like?

1313
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,705
To love someone?

1314
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,140
I do.

1315
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,820
<i>I've cried, felt true sorrow.</i>

1316
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,229
<i>I've sung, danced.</i>

1317
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,820
I've felt real joy.

1318
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,260
Then you should know

1319
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,261
better than anyone.

1320
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,660
You have seen children starve.

1321
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,220
You've seen people stand
on each other's necks

1322
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,584
just for the view.

1323
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,380
You know what it feels like
when men blow each other up.

1324
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,460
Yes.

1325
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,460
Over a simple line in the sand.

1326
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,820
I do, I do, but...

1327
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,340
And yet...

1328
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,620
And yet,

1329
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,140
you and Jonas want to

1330
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,820
<i>open that door again,</i>

1331
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,260
bring all that back.

1332
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,020
If you could only see
the possibility of love.

1333
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,820
- Why?
- Of love.

1334
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,540
- Love is just...
- With love comes faith,

1335
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,620
with it comes hope.

1336
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,871
Love is just passion that can turn.

1337
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,580
We can do better.

1338
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,100
It turns into contempt and murder.

1339
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,740
We could choose better.

1340
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,540
People are weak.

1341
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,029
People are selfish.

1342
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,620
When people have the freedom
to choose, they choose wrong

1343
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,029
every single time.

1344
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,825
It's a sled.

1345
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,820
<i>Loss and pain,</i>

1346
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,700
music,

1347
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,220
Joy,

1348
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,700
the raw, impossible,

1349
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,620
beautiful feeling of love.

1350
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,100
Your son, he felt that.

1351
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,940
That girl, she has felt it.

1352
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,020
That's enough.

1353
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:19,140
We are living a life of
shadows, of echoes, of faint,

1354
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,900
distant whispers of
what once made us real.

1355
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,070
Excuse me for one second, Fiona.

1356
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,230
<i>We must continue.</i>

1357
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,220
<i>I wish I had been there</i>

1358
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,470
<i>when the memories returned.</i>

1359
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,944
<i>They were the truth.</i>

1360
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,827
<i>The Elders and their
rules were the lie.</i>

1361
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,664
<i>So I do not apologize.</i>

1362
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,150
<i>I knew Fiona was safe,</i>

1363
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,265
<i>that I'd see her again,</i>

1364
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,260
<i>and that I held the
future there in my arms.</i>

1365
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,985
<i>The Giver had led us
here to this house.</i>

1366
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,066
<i>It was real.</i>

1367
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,309
<i>From far behind me,
from the place I had left,</i>

1368
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,022
<i>I thought I heard music, too.</i>

1369
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,584
<i>Perhaps it was only an echo,</i>

1370
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,545
<i>but it was enough.</i>

1371
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,829
<i>It would lead us all home.</i>
