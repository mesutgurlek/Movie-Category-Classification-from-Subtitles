1
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,886
The second star to the right

2
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,596
Shines in the night for you

3
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,918
To tell you that the dreams you plan

4
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:01,080
Really can come true

5
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,840
The second star to the right

6
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:08,205
Shines with a light so rare

7
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:12,041
And if it's Never Land you need

8
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:16,006
Its light will lead you there

9
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:18,840
Twinkle, twinkle little star

10
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,920
So we'll know where you are

11
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:26,841
Gleaming in the skies above

12
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,521
Lead us to the land

13
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:33,885
We dream of

14
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:38,006
And when ourjourney is through

15
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,601
Each time we say

16
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:43,520
Good night

17
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:49,125
We'll thank the little star
that shines

18
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:54,285
The second from

19
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,677
The right

20
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,122
All this has happened before.

21
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,199
And it will all happen again.

22
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:10,165
But this time
it happened in London.

23
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:17,005
It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.

24
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:21,717
That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.

25
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,196
And Peter Pan chose
this particular house...

26
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,802
because there were people
here who believed in him.

27
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:31,118
There was Mrs Darling.

28
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:35,041
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

29
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:39,439
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.

30
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:43,315
- But Mr Darling...
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links...

31
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:45,443
we don't go to the party.

32
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:49,520
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

33
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,438
And if I can never... Ouch!

34
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,236
Well, Mr Darling
was a practical man.

35
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:58,444
The boys, however,
John and Michael...

36
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,836
believed Peter Pan
was a real person...

37
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:04,397
and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.

38
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:06,443
Blast you, Peter Pan!

39
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,962
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?

40
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:15,039
Never! I'll teach you
to cut off me hand!

41
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,324
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.

42
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,443
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.

43
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:24,406
Wendy, the eldest,
not only believed...

44
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,955
she was the supreme authority
on Peter Pan...

45
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,878
and all his
marvellous adventures.

46
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:32,562
Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

47
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,844
Nana, the nursemaid,
being a dog...

48
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,316
kept her opinions to herself...

49
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:41,763
and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.

50
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,000
Take that!

51
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,239
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!

52
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,040
And I'll cut you to pieces.

53
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:58,516
- Aha!
- Ouch!

54
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,520
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

55
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,996
You'll never leave
this ship alive!

56
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:08,443
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!

57
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:17,881
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

58
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,719
Oh, no, you won't.

59
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,958
Back, back, back, you villain!

60
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:26,164
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

61
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:30,843
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.

62
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:34,522
Take that and that!
And that!

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,723
Boys, boys,
less noise, please.

64
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,485
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

65
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,956
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael...

66
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:48,642
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

67
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:51,605
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

68
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,247
Uh, have you seen my cuff...

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,125
Oh, Nana,
for goodness sake!

70
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,767
Where are those cuff links?

71
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:03,999
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

72
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,124
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

73
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,243
- I don't know.
- The map then.

74
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,239
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

75
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:15,399
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

76
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,955
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

77
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,198
And hereafter...
Don't paw me, Michael.

78
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:26,315
This is my last clean...
No! No!

79
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,046
George, dear, we really must
hurry or we'll be late...

80
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:32,722
- Mary, look!
- George.

81
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,924
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

82
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,805
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.

83
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:41,879
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

84
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:46,518
I might have known. Wendy!

85
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:49,280
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

86
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,325
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

87
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:55,444
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

88
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,677
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

89
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:01,043
- But it did turn out
rather nicely, didn't...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

90
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,802
- I'd like...
- Why, Father, what have
you done to your shirt?

91
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:08,641
What have l... Oh!

92
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:13,403
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.

93
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:18,322
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

94
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:21,126
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.

95
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,596
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!

96
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:27,965
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

97
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,003
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you...
- Oh, you don't understand.

98
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:34,683
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

99
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,203
- Now, George.
- "Now, George."

100
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:40,323
"Now, George"!

101
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,046
Well, "Now, George,"
will have his say!

102
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:47,120
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.

103
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,437
It's high time she had
a room of her own.

104
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:51,757
- Father!
- George!
- What?

105
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:54,839
- No!
- I mean it!

106
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,476
Young lady, this is your
last night in the nursery.

107
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,525
And that's my last word
on the matter...

108
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,362
No!

109
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,760
No!

110
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,643
Oh!

111
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:34,922
Poor Nana.

112
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,476
"Poor Nana"?

113
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,762
This is the last straw!

114
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:42,077
Out! Out, I say!

115
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,965
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

116
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,005
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

117
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,039
Goodbye, Nana.

118
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,846
"Poor Nana."
Oh, yes, "Poor Nana."

119
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,715
But "Poor Father"?
Oh, no!

120
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:03,196
Blast it!
Where is that rope?

121
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,365
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,965
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

123
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,322
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...

124
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,598
Well, you're not really
a nurse at all.

125
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,645
You're, well, a dog.

126
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,685
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

127
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,680
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

128
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,565
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.

129
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:36,720
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

130
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,561
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock."

131
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:45,198
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

132
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,758
Poor Nana,
out there all alone.

133
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:52,759
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

134
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,963
She'll be all right.

135
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,686
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

136
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:01,442
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

137
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,995
Don't judge your father
too harshly.

138
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:08,239
After all, he really
loves you very much.

139
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,841
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

140
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:14,442
- "He"?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.

141
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:18,440
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

142
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:22,156
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.

143
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:25,557
- "Shadow"?
- Mmm, Nana had it.

144
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,559
But l...
I took it away.

145
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:34,797
Oh? Yes, of course.

146
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:37,117
Good night, dear.

147
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,962
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

148
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,242
Safe? Of course
they'll be safe. Why not?

149
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:48,558
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and l...

150
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,320
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

151
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,843
Oh, Peter Pan...
Peter Pan!

152
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,478
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

153
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,523
- But, George... Really, l...
- Sound the alarm!

154
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,326
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

155
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:07,683
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

156
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,239
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the
children to grow up and be practical...

157
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,682
- George, dear.
- When you're as bad as they are.

158
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,520
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets
these idiotic ideas.

159
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,757
Over there, Tink,
in its den.

160
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,566
Is it there?

161
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,557
Must be here somewhere.

162
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,561
Tink! Shh!

163
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,560
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

164
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:11,684
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

165
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,766
Huh?

166
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,640
Aha!

167
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:11,806
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

168
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,163
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

169
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,238
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

170
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,887
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

171
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,561
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then...

172
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,525
Oh, you can't stick it
on with soap, Peter.

173
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,405
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

174
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,796
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.

175
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:34,880
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was
your shadow the minute I saw it.

176
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,084
And I said to myself, I said, "I'll
put it away for him until he comes back.

177
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:42,001
Oh, he's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

178
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:46,046
After all, one can't
leave his shadow lying about
and not miss it sooner or later.

179
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:51,121
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

180
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,165
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

181
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,125
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.

182
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,482
- Although Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

183
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,957
Yes, girls talk too...
Hmm? Oh.

184
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:06,517
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.

185
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,519
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

186
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,122
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?

187
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,767
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

188
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:17,360
Well, what were
you doing there?

189
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:21,281
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?

190
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,597
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.

191
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,838
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

192
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,680
The Lost Boys...
Oh, I remember.

193
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,485
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:35,446
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.

195
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,836
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

196
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,999
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night
in the nursery.

197
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,920
But that means
no more stories.

198
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:46,396
- Mm-hmm.
- No!

199
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,557
I won't have it.
Come on!

200
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,638
Bu-Bu-But
where are we going?

201
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,525
To Never Land.

202
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:56,280
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

203
00:13:56,367 --> 00:14:00,645
Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

204
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:04,163
But wait.
What would Mother say?

205
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:06,078
Mother? What's Mother?

206
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:11,002
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...
who loves and cares for you.

207
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:14,363
- And... And tells you stories...
- Good! You can be our mother.

208
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:16,278
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, l...

209
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,597
Let me see now.
L-I have to pack.

210
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,759
Oh, and I must leave
a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.

211
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,884
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

212
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,527
Oh, l...
l-I'm so happy l...

213
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:31,122
I think I'll give you a... a kiss.

214
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,598
What's a... a kiss?

215
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:39,043
Oh, well, uh,
l-I'll show you.

216
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:41,083
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!

217
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,039
John, John, wake up!
He's here.

218
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,756
Huh? Jiminy!

219
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,042
Ooh, what in the world was that?

220
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,357
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

221
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:59,642
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.

222
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,321
And my name is John.
How do you do?

223
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:05,285
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.

224
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,642
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

225
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,046
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

226
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:16,005
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

227
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:21,317
Oh. Well, I think
she's lovely.

228
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,964
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

229
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,163
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

230
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,158
- Peter's taking us.
- "Us"?

231
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:33,523
Well, of course. L-I couldn't
go without Michael and John.

232
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:37,202
Oh, I should like very much to cross
swords with some real buccaneers.

233
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:41,200
Yes, and fight pirates too.

234
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,245
Well, all right,
but ya gotta take orders.

235
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,636
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

236
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,202
But, Peter, how do
we get to Never Land?

237
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,926
- Fly, of course.
- "Fly"?

238
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:56,398
It's easy. All you
have to do is to... is to...

239
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:59,365
Is to...

240
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,166
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?

241
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,238
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.

242
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,603
It's... It's just that
I never thought about it before.

243
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,997
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

244
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,726
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,879
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

246
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,481
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!

247
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,161
It's easier than pie.

248
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,841
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

249
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:28,441
He flewed!

250
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:32,600
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon...

251
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,075
underneath a magic moon.

252
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,362
I'll think I'm
in a pirate's cave.

253
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,278
I think I'll be
an Indian brave.

254
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,198
Now everybody try.

255
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,438
One, two, three!

256
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:49,281
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!

257
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,515
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

258
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,917
All it takes
is faith and trust.

259
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:05,795
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!

260
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,447
- Dust?
- Dust?

261
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:13,521
Yep, just a little bit
of pixie dust.

262
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,684
Now, think of
the happiest things.

263
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,964
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

264
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:27,163
Look! We're rising off the floor.

265
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,842
- Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!

266
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:35,159
- You can fly!
- We can fly!

267
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,645
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!

268
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,080
Off to Never Land!

269
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,720
Think of a wonderful thought

270
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,401
Any merry little thought

271
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,717
Think of Christmas
Think of snow

272
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:59,437
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky

273
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:03,600
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

274
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,645
Think of the happiest things

275
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,287
It's the same as having wings

276
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,517
Take the path that moonbeams make

277
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:16,806
If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye

278
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,562
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

279
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,758
Up you go with a heigh and ho

280
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,963
To the stars beyond the blue

281
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,517
There's a Never Land
waiting for you

282
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:34,044
Where all your
happy dreams come true

283
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:39,440
Every dream that you dream
will come true

284
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,643
Come on, Nana!

285
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:45,083
When there's a smile
in your heart

286
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:50,525
There's no better time to start

287
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,757
Think of all thejoy you'll find

288
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:57,637
When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye

289
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:00,764
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

290
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:03,122
You can fly

291
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:16,000
There it is, Wendy. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

292
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,639
When there's
a smile in your heart

293
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,005
There's no better time to start

294
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,635
Think of all thejoy you'll find
when you leave the world behind

295
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:35,197
And bid your cares goodbye

296
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:38,359
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

297
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,881
You can fly

298
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,481
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

299
00:19:56,407 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

300
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:04,242
A- rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer

301
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:07,478
It's the life
of a pirate for me, oh

302
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,956
The life of a pirate for me

303
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:14,916
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

304
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,804
They never bury your bones

305
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:20,562
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones

306
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,720
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones

307
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:29,835
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

308
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:34,159
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

309
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:37,922
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

310
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:39,725
Look out. It might go off.

311
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,958
We ought to be tending to
the business of looting ships.

312
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:47,325
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

313
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,205
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain...

314
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:52,881
we wants to put to sea, see?

315
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:59,038
Peter Pan...

316
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:04,478
Blast that Peter Pan!

317
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,560
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

318
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,638
But where is it?

319
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,195
Mermaid Lagoon?

320
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:16,085
No, we've searched that.

321
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:19,682
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

322
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,679
H-Here! No. No, no, no!

323
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,964
That's Indian terri...

324
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:27,878
But wait.

325
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:32,643
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

326
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,558
Ah...

327
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:37,366
I wonder.

328
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,915
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!

329
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,679
Tiger Lily, Smee!

330
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,076
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?

331
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,921
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

332
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,885
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?

333
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:55,279
Oh, a little persuasion
might be in order.

334
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,483
Now let me see.

335
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,400
Boiling in oil?

336
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:04,366
Keelhauling? Marooning?

337
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:08,725
A pirate's life
is a wonderful l-life

338
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:12,880
You'll find adventure and sport

339
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:16,562
But live every minute
for all that is in it

340
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:22,005
The life of a pirate is short

341
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:26,638
Oh, the life...

342
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:34,404
Now let me see, where was I?

343
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,682
Oh, dear, dear,
dear Captain Hook.

344
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,884
Shooting a man in
the middle of his cadenza?

345
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:42,322
It ain't good form, you know.

346
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:46,685
"Good form," Mr Smee?
Blast good form!

347
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:50,442
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

348
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:55,043
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

349
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:58,164
Aye! But throwing it
to the crocodile!

350
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,125
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well...

351
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:04,563
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops...

352
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,161
for the rest of me.

353
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:09,522
And he'd have had
you by now, Captain...

354
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,916
if he hadn't swallowed
that alarm clock.

355
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:16,364
But now when he's about, he warns ya
as ya might say with his tick-tock...

356
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,403
tick-tock, tick-tock.

357
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:50,517
Smee? Smee!

358
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,598
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

359
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,838
Please, don't let him
get me, Smee! Smee!

360
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:59,283
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.

361
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:02,006
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

362
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,397
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

363
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:12,963
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.

364
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,959
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

365
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,322
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

366
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:21,683
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.

367
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,122
What you need is a shave.

368
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:28,723
A nice soothing shave.
There now.

369
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,283
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

370
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:35,564
A- sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a...

371
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:38,207
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'...

372
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:42,678
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

373
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,678
Give me a career as a buccaneer

374
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:47,156
And the crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, Captain.

375
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,477
That is,
what's left of it.

376
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,922
Now, why don't we put
to sea, see? Leave Never Land.

377
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:59,761
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!

378
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:02,156
Give me a career as a buccaneer

379
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:06,035
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

380
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:14,440
Captain? Oh, dear! I never
shaved him this close before.

381
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:21,602
Now, don't worry, Captain.
L-It must be somewhere about.

382
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,401
Get up, you idiot!

383
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,842
Aye, aye, sir.

384
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,601
Ooh! I found it, Captain.

385
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:35,441
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!

386
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:39,361
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

387
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:42,678
Three points off
the starboard bow!

388
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,201
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!

389
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:48,359
Headed this way with
some more of those scurvy brats!

390
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,358
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

391
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,041
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up
the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.

392
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:55,641
All hands on deck!

393
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:58,321
All hands on deck!

394
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,318
All hands on deck!

395
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,918
All hands on deck!

396
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,636
Look alive, you swabs!

397
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:12,402
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.

398
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:16,526
Man the Long Tom,
you bilge rats!

399
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,883
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin'
the holidays either.

400
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,162
Double the powder
and shorten the fuse!

401
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,397
Shorten the powder
and double the fuse!

402
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:25,522
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.

403
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,075
We'll pot 'em
like sitting ducks.

404
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:32,240
- All right, men! Range 42.
- "Range 42."

405
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:35,603
- Elevation 65.
- "Elevation 65."

406
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:38,326
- Three degrees west.
- "Three degrees west."

407
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:43,527
Steady now! Steady!

408
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:47,282
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

409
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,722
Oh, look, John,
there's Mermaid Lagoon.

410
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:54,483
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!

411
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,525
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.

412
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:02,477
Look out!

413
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,397
Quick, Tink, take Wendy
and the boys to the island.

414
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,718
I'll stay here
and draw Hook's fire.

415
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:15,120
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!

416
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:25,646
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

417
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,480
We can't keep up with you.

418
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,604
Tinker Bell! Wait!

419
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:54,526
Ouch!

420
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,006
So!

421
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:03,645
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!

422
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,002
I'll show you!

423
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,206
Huh? Orders from Pan?

424
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:17,120
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

425
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:22,482
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- "Wendy Bird"?

426
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,242
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are...

427
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:28,795
What? Smash it?

428
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,117
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

429
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:35,481
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!

430
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,842
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!

431
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:41,363
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

432
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,915
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!

433
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:03,317
Ready, aim...

434
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,238
fire!

435
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:20,401
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.

436
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:25,757
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

437
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,725
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

438
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:33,198
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

439
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:38,996
- Hey, Pan, I got it
with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

440
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:42,159
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

441
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:47,397
Attention! Well...

442
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:51,639
I'm certainly proud of you,
you blockheads!

443
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:55,606
- I bring ya a mother
to tell ya stories...
- A mother?

444
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,839
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

445
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:04,443
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said
to shoot it down!

446
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:08,486
Tinker Bell. Tink!

447
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:13,516
Come here. You're charged
with high treason, Tink.

448
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:17,236
Are you guilty or not guilty?

449
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,717
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

450
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,481
Tinker Bell!

451
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:29,685
I hereby banish you forever.

452
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,156
Please, not forever.

453
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,001
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

454
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:38,726
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?

455
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:41,446
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

456
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:43,358
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

457
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,997
Personally, I should prefer
to see the aborigines.

458
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:49,159
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!

459
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,807
Go out and capture
a few Indians.

460
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:55,721
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

461
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,684
Forward! March!

462
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,921
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.

463
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,316
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

464
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:15,764
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

465
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,362
We're following the leader
wherever he may go

466
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,678
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

467
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,362
Tee dum, tee dee
It's part of the game we play

468
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:29,564
Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say

469
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:33,242
Just a teedle ee dum
a teedle ee do tee day

470
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:36,956
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee dum

471
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:40,323
We're one for all
and all of us out for fun

472
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:43,524
We march in line
and follow the other one

473
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:46,485
With a teedle ee do
A teedle ee di tee dum

474
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:05,038
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

475
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:08,676
We're following the leader
wherever he may go

476
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:12,157
We're out to fight the Injuns
The Injuns, the Injuns

477
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:15,603
We're out to fight the Injuns
because he told us so

478
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:19,202
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

479
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:22,723
We march along and
these are the words we say

480
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,685
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

481
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:29,442
Oh, a teedle dee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

482
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:32,837
Oh, a teedle ee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

483
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:37,079
Indians!
Oh, Blackfoot tribe.

484
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:41,520
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

485
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:43,916
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.

486
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:47,317
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

487
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:50,803
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?

488
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:56,041
A plan of attack. The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

489
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,526
John! Indians! Indians!

490
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:28,802
Let me in!

491
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,563
Now remember,
the Indian is cunning...

492
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,683
- Hey...
- but not intelligent.

493
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:39,043
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise...

494
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:13,202
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

495
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:17,166
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.

496
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:18,839
That's okay.

497
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,884
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!

498
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:30,245
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

499
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:33,683
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.

500
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:36,759
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.

501
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,645
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.

502
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,878
"Turn us loose"?
You mean this is only a game?

503
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:45,037
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

504
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,163
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.

505
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,681
This time, no turn 'em loose.

506
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,598
- Huh?
- Huh?

507
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:55,236
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.

508
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,602
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?

509
00:34:57,687 --> 00:35:02,158
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.

510
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:06,320
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.

511
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:10,116
If Tiger Lily
not back by sunset...

512
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:13,517
burn 'em at stake.

513
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:35,434
Just imagine,
real live mermaids.

514
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:38,279
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.

515
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:40,357
All right, come on.

516
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:45,841
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!

517
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,520
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!

518
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:50,642
Hello, Peter!

519
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:56,843
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.

520
00:35:56,926 --> 00:36:01,204
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

521
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:04,278
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

522
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:07,517
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand
and threw it to the crocodile?

523
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:11,076
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

524
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,726
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

525
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:16,081
- Oh, Peter!
- By 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?

526
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,556
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.

527
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:22,080
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

528
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,885
And in her nightdress too.

529
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,764
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.

530
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,837
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!

531
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,598
- We insist!
- No, no, please!

532
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:35,440
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!

533
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,520
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

534
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:48,245
They were just having a little fun,
weren't you, girls?

535
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:52,399
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

536
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:55,284
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...

537
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:58,438
- that I'm going to put up with a...
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.

538
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:07,600
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!

539
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,563
Hook! Oh!

540
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,319
Quick, Wendy.

541
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,126
They've captured Tiger Lily.

542
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:31,603
Looks like they're
headin' for Skull Rock.

543
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,962
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.

544
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:53,005
Now, me dear Princess,
this is me proposition.

545
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:57,204
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan...

546
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,117
and I shall set you free.

547
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:01,959
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

548
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,879
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

549
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:08,242
Oh, yes, always, Captain.

550
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:12,683
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in...

551
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,643
and then it will be too late.

552
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:18,958
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- "Fun"?

553
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,279
Remember...

554
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,403
there is no path
through water...

555
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:27,125
to the happy hunting ground.

556
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,359
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!

557
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:35,758
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

558
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:40,125
Beware, Captain Hook!

559
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:42,640
Beware! Beware!

560
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:46,435
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.

561
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:50,485
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

562
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:53,842
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

563
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:10,082
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.

564
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:15,922
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?

565
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:21,034
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

566
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:25,204
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess...

567
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:29,962
- But... But, Captain...
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

568
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,196
Aye, aye, sir.

569
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:38,883
- Well, at last Captain Hook's
comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

570
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:41,958
I told him all along you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

571
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,403
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

572
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:50,479
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

573
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:55,037
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go...

574
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,482
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!

575
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:04,038
- My orders. Of all the bumbling...
- Mr Smee!

576
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:07,198
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

577
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,720
Putting her back
like you said, Captain.

578
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:11,922
I said nothing of the sort!

579
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:14,839
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that...

580
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,882
For the last time, Mr Smee.

581
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:20,959
Take the princess
back to her people.

582
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:25,915
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?

583
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,794
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.

584
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,878
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew...

585
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,560
to help themselves
to me best rum.

586
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:40,959
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!

587
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,996
Why, it's Peter Pan.

588
00:40:46,766 --> 00:40:49,041
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.

589
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:52,880
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

590
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:56,163
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.

591
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,645
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

592
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,436
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

593
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:18,960
Right here, Mr Smee.

594
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:22,083
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!

595
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:28,085
Captain?

596
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,997
Oh, how dreadful.

597
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:34,796
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.

598
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:39,516
Captain!

599
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:41,278
In the back, Captain?

600
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,962
Give it to him, Captain!

601
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:52,719
Cleave him to the brisket.

602
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:07,595
I've got you this time, Pan.

603
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:15,605
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

604
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:19,884
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

605
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,638
I say, Captain,
do you hear something?

606
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:26,876
No.

607
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:28,805
No!

608
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:35,357
No!

609
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:40,158
Mr Crocodile,
do you like codfish?

610
00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:42,555
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

611
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:52,158
No!

612
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:56,075
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!

613
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,476
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.

614
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,316
Smee!

615
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,645
Smee!

616
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:15,202
Smee!

617
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:19,244
Ow!

618
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,837
Captain! Captain!

619
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:27,555
Smee! Smee!

620
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,477
- Give him back!
- Smee...

621
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:36,324
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship...

622
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:40,478
Whoa!

623
00:43:43,886 --> 00:43:47,037
Smee!

624
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:51,604
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

625
00:43:51,686 --> 00:43:54,120
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.

626
00:43:56,006 --> 00:43:58,156
Help...

627
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:07,876
Peter. Wait for me.

628
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:40,276
That cursed Peter Pan.

629
00:44:41,606 --> 00:44:44,245
Making a fool out of me.

630
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:53,159
Oh, my head.

631
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:02,241
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

632
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,601
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!

633
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:07,439
The poor Captain
has a splitting headache.

634
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:10,598
We mustn't annoy him.

635
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:31,562
Well, Captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

636
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,958
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

637
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:39,277
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain...

638
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:41,675
why don't we put to sea again?

639
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:44,883
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

640
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:46,797
Women trouble.

641
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:50,037
I wouldn't want this
to go any farther, but...

642
00:45:50,126 --> 00:45:53,835
the cook told me that
the first mate told him...

643
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:58,078
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

644
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:01,044
Whoa!

645
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:06,246
Why, you doddering imbecile, l...
Did you say Pan...

646
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,920
has banished Tinker Bell?

647
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,644
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.

648
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,399
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.

649
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:17,365
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

650
00:46:17,446 --> 00:46:21,644
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.

651
00:46:21,726 --> 00:46:24,718
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

652
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:27,274
That's it, Smee!
That's it!

653
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:29,243
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.

654
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:32,238
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.

655
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:34,794
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner
we get going, the better.

656
00:46:34,886 --> 00:46:39,004
Ah, yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything.

657
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,554
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

658
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:44,319
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.

659
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:47,876
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her...

660
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:50,878
the wench may chart
our course to a...

661
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:53,685
certain hiding place.

662
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:56,234
Our best hiding place
is the Spanish main, sir.

663
00:46:56,326 --> 00:46:58,476
I'll set our course...

664
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:03,037
And where do you think
you are going?

665
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:06,163
T-To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

666
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:10,956
You will go ashore,
pick up Tinker Bell...

667
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:14,243
and bring her to me.

668
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:17,556
Understand?

669
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:19,921
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.

670
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,719
- How!
- How!

671
00:47:34,766 --> 00:47:36,597
What's the Chief doing, John?

672
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:40,725
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

673
00:47:40,806 --> 00:47:44,242
- What's he saying?
- He says...

674
00:47:44,326 --> 00:47:47,762
"Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

675
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:49,837
"Save Tiger Lily.

676
00:47:49,926 --> 00:47:53,521
Make big Chief heap glad."

677
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:56,723
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad."

678
00:47:56,806 --> 00:48:00,719
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

679
00:48:00,806 --> 00:48:03,445
You now Little Flying Eagle.

680
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:08,085
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!

681
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,441
Hurray!

682
00:48:10,526 --> 00:48:14,314
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!

683
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,920
Teach 'em paleface brother
all about red man.

684
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,804
Good, this should be
most enlightening.

685
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:33,354
Uh, what makes the red man red?

686
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:35,596
- When did he first say, "Ugh"?
- First say, "Ugh"?

687
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:37,836
Why does he ask you, "How"?

688
00:48:37,926 --> 00:48:41,043
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

689
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,596
Hana mana ganda
Why does he ask you, how

690
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:49,840
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Once the Injun didn't know all
the things that he know now

691
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,837
But the Injun
He sure learn a lot

692
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:55,043
And it's all from asking how

693
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:58,675
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
We translate for you

694
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,838
Hana means what mana means
and ganda means that too

695
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:05,362
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

696
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:09,280
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

697
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,438
- Hana mana ganda
- Squaw, no dance.

698
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:14,960
Squaw, get 'em firewood.

699
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:18,800
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

700
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:22,845
When did he first say, "Ugh''
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

701
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,885
When did he first say, "Ugh''
Hana mana ganda

702
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,800
In the Injun book, it say
when first brave married squaw

703
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:35,755
He gave out with heap big "ugh''
when he saw his mother-in-law

704
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:39,282
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

705
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:41,436
Hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

706
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:45,644
What made the red man red

707
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:49,514
What made the red man red

708
00:49:49,606 --> 00:49:53,235
Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince

709
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:56,557
He kissed a maid and start to blush
and we've all been blushin'since

710
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:59,444
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

711
00:49:59,526 --> 00:50:01,118
Now you've got it right
from the head man

712
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,844
The real true story
of the red man

713
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:07,204
No matter what's been
written or said, no matter what

714
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:14,966
Now you know why
the red man's red

715
00:50:24,806 --> 00:50:27,764
- Wa-hoo!
- John!

716
00:50:27,846 --> 00:50:30,963
Squaw take 'em papoose.
Wa-hoo!

717
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:35,119
- Michael!
- Squaw, get 'em firewood.

718
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:38,164
Squaw no get 'em firewood!

719
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,714
Squaw go home.

720
00:50:49,886 --> 00:50:51,956
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell...

721
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:54,844
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

722
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:11,602
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

723
00:51:13,326 --> 00:51:17,877
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

724
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:21,197
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

725
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:28,595
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear...

726
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:32,042
to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.

727
00:51:33,766 --> 00:51:38,078
Oh, Pan has his faults,
to be sure.

728
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:40,964
Uh, bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

729
00:51:41,046 --> 00:51:42,877
Dangerous business, that.

730
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:51,644
Why, rumour has it that already
she has come between you and Peter.

731
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:59,565
But what's this?
Tears?

732
00:51:59,646 --> 00:52:03,764
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.

733
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:06,804
The way of a man with a maid.

734
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:11,437
Taking the best years
of her life and then...

735
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:15,758
casting her aside
like an old glove!

736
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:18,644
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

737
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:22,799
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.

738
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:26,435
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

739
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:30,314
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

740
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:32,795
But how?

741
00:52:32,886 --> 00:52:36,322
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

742
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:39,318
Sail! That's it, Smee!

743
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:45,645
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- "Shanghai Wendy," Captain?

744
00:52:45,726 --> 00:52:50,959
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon
forget this mad infatuation.

745
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:54,561
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home...

746
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:59,925
But, Captain, we...
we don't know where Peter Pan lives!

747
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:03,476
Great Scott,
you're right, Smee!

748
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:04,885
What's that, my dear?

749
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:11,279
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

750
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:15,120
- Take this down, Smee.
- "Take this down, Smee."

751
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:17,197
Aye, aye, Captain.

752
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:26,163
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- "Start at Pegleg Point."

753
00:53:27,846 --> 00:53:30,997
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- "Blindman's Bluff."

754
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:36,114
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and
a jump across Crocodile Creek.

755
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:40,597
Then north by northeast,
one, two, three.

756
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:44,520
Well, get on with it...
Continue, my dear.

757
00:53:47,326 --> 00:53:50,045
I mustn't harm Peter?

758
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:54,005
Madam, Captain Hook
gives his word...

759
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:56,759
not to lay a finger...

760
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:59,485
or a hook on Peter Pan.

761
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,044
Ah, Hangman's Tree.

762
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:10,404
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

763
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:14,161
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

764
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,916
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

765
00:54:24,006 --> 00:54:27,601
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

766
00:54:27,686 --> 00:54:30,280
- Hana mana ganda, Hana mana ganda
- Hana mana ganda

767
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:33,278
- Hana mana ganda
- What makes red men red

768
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:36,961
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

769
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:40,755
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

770
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,677
Hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

771
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,637
Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

772
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:50,763
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!

773
00:54:50,846 --> 00:54:52,325
- How.
- How.

774
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:55,239
Big Chief greets Little Mother.

775
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,681
- How!
- Ugh!

776
00:54:57,766 --> 00:55:00,883
Aw, Wendy, is that
all you have to say?

777
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:04,356
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

778
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:07,324
- Tiger Lily?
- John! Michael!

779
00:55:07,406 --> 00:55:09,636
Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

780
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:12,365
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

781
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:14,596
Go for days without sleep.

782
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,722
- But, boys, we're going
home in the morning.
- Home!

783
00:55:16,806 --> 00:55:20,435
- And...
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.

784
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:24,917
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

785
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:27,645
Now, Peter, let's stop
pretending and be practical.

786
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:31,002
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

787
00:55:31,086 --> 00:55:34,203
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.

788
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:37,881
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like... like savages?

789
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:39,797
- Of course.
- But you can't.

790
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:43,196
You need a mother.
We all do.

791
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:45,356
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

792
00:55:45,446 --> 00:55:47,437
Why, Michael, of course not!

793
00:55:47,526 --> 00:55:49,596
Surely you haven't forgotten
our real mother!

794
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:55,044
Did she have silky ears
and wear a fur coat?

795
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:58,721
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.

796
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:00,637
I think I had a mother once.

797
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:04,480
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.

798
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:07,399
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

799
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:09,920
Hey, who ya shovin'?

800
00:56:11,406 --> 00:56:15,604
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

801
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:18,120
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

802
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:21,358
Well, a mother,
a real mother...

803
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:24,882
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

804
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:28,402
She's the angel voice...

805
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:30,761
that bids you good night...

806
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,644
kisses your cheek...

807
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,921
whispers, "Sleep tight."

808
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:40,078
Your mother

809
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:43,875
And mine

810
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:48,676
Your mother

811
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:52,645
And mine

812
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:58,562
The helping hand
that guides you along

813
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:05,438
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong

814
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:09,121
Your mother

815
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:13,119
And mine

816
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:18,075
Your mother

817
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:22,557
And mine

818
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:27,845
What makes mothers
all that they are

819
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:36,880
Might as well ask
what makes a star

820
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:42,723
Ask your heart
to tell you her worth

821
00:57:42,806 --> 00:57:45,923
Your heart will say

822
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:50,397
Heaven on earth

823
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:54,718
- Another word
- Shh.

824
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:59,402
For divine

825
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:05,118
Your mother

826
00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:08,084
And mine

827
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:16,796
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.

828
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:19,195
I propose we leave
for home at once.

829
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:22,119
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!

830
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:26,245
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

831
00:58:26,326 --> 00:58:29,159
Uh, that is,
if Peter doesn't mind.

832
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:31,999
Go on!
Go back and grow up!

833
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:35,158
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up...

834
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,316
you can never come back!

835
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:40,603
- Never!
- Dear.

836
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:44,281
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

837
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:46,357
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

838
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:49,717
They'll be back.

839
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:56,437
Peter.

840
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:02,034
Goodbye, Peter.

841
00:59:09,486 --> 00:59:11,317
All right, men.
Take them away.

842
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:18,684
And now, Smee, to take care
of Master Peter Pan.

843
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:24,318
But, Captain, wouldn't it
be more humane-like to slit his throat?

844
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:27,000
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

845
00:59:27,086 --> 00:59:30,681
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

846
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:34,042
or a hook on Peter Pan.

847
00:59:35,246 --> 00:59:39,876
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

848
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:43,721
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

849
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:45,797
So try the life of a thief

850
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,717
Just sample the life of a crook

851
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:49,717
There isn't a boy
who won't enjoy

852
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:52,525
A- workin'for Captain Hook

853
00:59:52,606 --> 00:59:55,564
The world's most famous crook

854
00:59:55,646 --> 01:00:00,037
Crook, crook, crickety
crockety, crickety, crick
the croc is after Captain...

855
01:00:01,326 --> 01:00:03,237
A special offer for today

856
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:05,362
I'll tell you what I'll do

857
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:08,199
All those who sign without delay

858
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:10,800
Will get a free tattoo

859
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:13,354
Why, it's like money in the bank

860
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:16,199
Come on
Join up and I'll be frank

861
01:00:16,286 --> 01:00:20,245
Unless you do
you'll walk the plank

862
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,157
The choice is up to you

863
01:00:22,246 --> 01:00:24,362
The choice is up to you

864
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:28,075
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

865
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,997
You'll love the life of a thief

866
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:32,122
You'll relish the life
of a crook

867
01:00:32,206 --> 01:00:33,958
There's barrels
of fun for everyone

868
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:37,516
And you'll get treasures
by the ton

869
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:41,565
So come and sign the book

870
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:44,479
Join up with Captain Hook

871
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:46,682
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

872
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:49,917
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

873
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:54,761
Boys! Aren't you
ashamed of yourselves?

874
01:00:54,846 --> 01:00:57,883
But Captain Hook is
most insistent, Wendy.

875
01:00:57,966 --> 01:01:01,163
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

876
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:04,602
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

877
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:08,281
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

878
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:11,636
Peter Pan will save them.

879
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:15,437
Oh, Captain, you did it.

880
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:18,165
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

881
01:01:18,246 --> 01:01:21,397
I don't believe you are
in on our little joke.

882
01:01:21,486 --> 01:01:25,559
You see, we left
a present for Peter.

883
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:28,365
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

884
01:01:28,446 --> 01:01:31,756
Why, I can see our little
friend at this very moment...

885
01:01:31,846 --> 01:01:35,919
reading the tender inscription.

886
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:40,443
"To Peter, with love
from Wendy.

887
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:43,962
Do not open till 6 o'clock."

888
01:01:45,126 --> 01:01:46,957
Huh. I wonder what's in it.

889
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:50,038
Could he but see
within the package...

890
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:54,324
he would find an ingenious
little device.

891
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:57,204
Set, so that when
the clock is like this...

892
01:01:57,286 --> 01:02:00,403
Peter Pan will be blasted...

893
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:04,115
out of Never Land forever.

894
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:04,922
No!

895
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:11,721
But time grows short.

896
01:02:11,806 --> 01:02:16,163
We have but 18 seconds.

897
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:19,397
Fifteen seconds.

898
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:22,159
Thirteen seconds.

899
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:24,077
Twelve seconds.

900
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,043
Well, I guess
I can open it now.

901
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:34,725
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.

902
01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:38,082
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

903
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,236
Hook? A bomb?

904
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:42,396
Don't be ridiculous!

905
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:54,397
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

906
01:02:54,486 --> 01:02:56,317
Amen.

907
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:02,884
Hook! It was a bomb!

908
01:03:02,966 --> 01:03:07,198
Why, if it hadn't been
for Tink... Tinker Bell!

909
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:14,244
Tink? Tinker Bell?

910
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:18,957
Where are you, Tink?

911
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:22,243
Tink? Tinker Bell!

912
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,157
Tink. Are you all right?

913
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:35,955
Wendy? The boys?

914
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,562
But I've gotta save you first.

915
01:03:40,646 --> 01:03:42,682
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

916
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:45,883
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

917
01:03:45,966 --> 01:03:49,402
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world!

918
01:03:51,886 --> 01:03:56,801
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

919
01:03:56,886 --> 01:04:00,356
Captain Hook, we will
never join your crew.

920
01:04:00,446 --> 01:04:03,643
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.

921
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:07,002
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

922
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:10,874
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

923
01:04:10,966 --> 01:04:14,356
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!

924
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:17,006
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!

925
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,805
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!

926
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:22,684
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!

927
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:32,525
Wendy! Wendy!

928
01:04:36,766 --> 01:04:40,759
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.

929
01:04:40,846 --> 01:04:43,963
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

930
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,685
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

931
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:50,441
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates,
it's a black day.

932
01:04:50,526 --> 01:04:52,915
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.

933
01:04:53,006 --> 01:04:55,201
The ship is bewitched.

934
01:04:55,286 --> 01:04:57,277
No splash, Captain.

935
01:04:57,366 --> 01:05:02,281
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

936
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,561
I'll give you a splash!

937
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:07,080
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

938
01:05:07,286 --> 01:05:10,915
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

939
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:12,917
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

940
01:05:13,006 --> 01:05:15,122
It's his blinkin' ghost
what's talkin'!

941
01:05:15,206 --> 01:05:16,958
Say your prayers, Hook.

942
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:21,278
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

943
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:24,199
I'll run him through! Ooh!

944
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:26,197
Take that!

945
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,404
Curse this hook!

946
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:38,037
Come on, everybody!

947
01:05:41,326 --> 01:05:44,124
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

948
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,039
Don't stand there,
you bilge rats!

949
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:50,084
Get those scurvy brats!

950
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,919
After the brats, men!

951
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:19,122
This is no mere boy.

952
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:22,676
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

953
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:32,237
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

954
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:35,363
Steady, men. Steady.

955
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:37,357
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

956
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:40,882
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

957
01:06:40,966 --> 01:06:43,480
Down, you blackguard!

958
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:19,844
Hurray!

959
01:07:24,566 --> 01:07:29,196
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!

960
01:07:29,286 --> 01:07:32,323
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

961
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:34,044
Coward? Me?

962
01:07:34,206 --> 01:07:39,121
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

963
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:41,640
You'd fly away like
a cowardly sparrow!

964
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:44,684
Nobody calls Pan
a coward and lives!

965
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:47,599
I'll fight you man-to-man,
with one hand behind my back.

966
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:53,682
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

967
01:07:53,766 --> 01:07:57,839
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

968
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:22,720
Now! Insolent youth,
prepare to die!

969
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:25,400
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

970
01:08:25,486 --> 01:08:29,399
No! I gave my word.

971
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:34,885
You're mine, Hook!

972
01:08:36,406 --> 01:08:39,603
Cleave him to the brisket!

973
01:08:39,686 --> 01:08:44,123
You wouldn't do old Hook
in now, would you, lad?

974
01:08:44,206 --> 01:08:48,518
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

975
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:54,044
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.

976
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:57,357
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

977
01:08:57,446 --> 01:09:01,678
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!

978
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:05,918
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish

979
01:09:06,006 --> 01:09:10,079
- Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
- All right, Hook...

980
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:14,205
you're free to go,
and never return.

981
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,477
Peter!

982
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:29,880
Smee! Smee!

983
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:44,917
Smee!

984
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:51,475
Smee! Smee!

985
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:55,479
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

986
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:58,034
Captain!

987
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,117
Captain! Captain!

988
01:10:01,566 --> 01:10:02,999
Hurray!

989
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:07,402
Hurray for Captain Pan!

990
01:10:07,486 --> 01:10:10,603
All right, ya swabs,
aloft with ya!

991
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:14,565
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!

992
01:10:14,646 --> 01:10:18,434
But, but, Peter...
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.

993
01:10:18,526 --> 01:10:23,395
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir,
where we're sailing?

994
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:27,240
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.

995
01:10:27,326 --> 01:10:31,080
Michael! John!
We're going home!

996
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,805
Man the capstan!

997
01:10:33,886 --> 01:10:36,525
Hoist anchor!

998
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,122
Pixie dust!

999
01:11:17,846 --> 01:11:22,556
George, I am so glad you
changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.

1000
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:26,685
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.

1001
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:28,643
Do I, Nana?

1002
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:34,242
Oh! Wendy!

1003
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:39,643
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

1004
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:42,081
Mmm. Hmm?

1005
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:46,880
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?

1006
01:11:46,966 --> 01:11:49,719
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

1007
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,161
- Lost Bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

1008
01:11:52,246 --> 01:11:54,476
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

1009
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:57,524
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

1010
01:11:57,606 --> 01:12:01,076
- Uh, "am"?
- Uh, ready to grow up.

1011
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:03,316
Oh! Oh! Uh...

1012
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:06,842
Well, my dear,
all in good time.

1013
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:09,565
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- Oh, but, Mother...

1014
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:12,114
it was such a wonderful adventure.

1015
01:12:12,206 --> 01:12:14,845
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

1016
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:16,757
Oh, he was the most
wonderful of all.

1017
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:19,804
- Why, why, even when
we were kidnapped, l...
- Kidnapped!

1018
01:12:19,886 --> 01:12:23,401
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan
would save us, and he did.

1019
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:26,205
And we all called him a codfish!

1020
01:12:26,286 --> 01:12:28,277
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.

1021
01:12:28,366 --> 01:12:32,041
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

1022
01:12:32,126 --> 01:12:36,438
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.

1023
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:41,236
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

1024
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:44,363
See how well he sails the ship.

1025
01:12:44,446 --> 01:12:48,917
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?

1026
01:12:51,646 --> 01:12:53,762
Nana, d-did you see...

1027
01:12:56,046 --> 01:12:58,355
You know, I have
the strangest feeling...

1028
01:12:58,446 --> 01:13:00,755
that I've seen that ship before.

1029
01:13:00,846 --> 01:13:03,076
A long time ago...

1030
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,600
when I was very young.

1031
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:09,804
- George, dear.
- Father.

1032
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,003
When there's a smile in your heart

1033
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:18,114
There's no better time to start

1034
01:13:18,206 --> 01:13:20,197
Think of all thejoy you'll find

1035
01:13:20,286 --> 01:13:22,117
When you leave the world behind

1036
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:25,562
And bid your cares goodbye

1037
01:13:25,646 --> 01:13:28,206
You can fly

1038
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:30,595
You can fly

1039
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:36,357
You can fly
