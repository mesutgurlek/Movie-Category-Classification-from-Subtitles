1
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,290
And now,
friends.

2
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
It's an honor to
introduce to all of you..

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,700
...the nation's heart-throb.

4
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,500
The one and only.

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,100
Singer, music-composer,
and song-writer. Rahul Jayekar.

6
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,300
We're bringing you live
updates about this concert

7
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,300
As you can see, the ambiance is ready,
the stage is set.

8
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
And the fans have been waiting for..

9
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,300
...Rahul Jayekar for
the past two hours.

10
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Mr. Deepak. He won't make it.

11
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
I am Aryan. I'm a singer too.

12
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,500
Ohh! Get lost!

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
Let me go on the stage.

14
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,400
Sir. Listen to me.

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Sir, I've been struggling
for five years..

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,400
...all thanks to people like these.

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Sir, I am ready. Take me in, please.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Struggle for 10 more years.

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,500
Turn authentic.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
And if I'm still alive,
you can come meet me.

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
Okay. Get lost now.

22
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,200
Hello. Where's Vivek..

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Vivek! Vivek!

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,400
Tell me honestly.

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
...am I going to have a show or not?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Please. Get this show
done for the last time.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,100
That announcer's tired of announcing.

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,500
...sir's arrival on stage.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,200
"He's coming now!"

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,000
"He's on his way!"

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,700
Please. Don't ruin my show.

32
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,300
Rahul.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,100
Time to go on stage.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,700
What's the problem, Vivek?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,300
They paid me for this.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm here to sing.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
And I won't leave without singing.

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,000
In fact, those who expect nothing.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,900
...are the more responsible ones.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's go.

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
After countless album songs,
and live concerts.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,100
If anyone tries to create a scene,
just ignore him.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
If anything goes wrong..

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
"The security here will handle it.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,100
Listen.

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,900
Just control yourself.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,500
<i>RM. RM. RM.!</i>

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
Ask the boys to be ready.

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,100
We're going to give them a show.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Your waifs over.

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,800
And we're going to call on stage.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,900
...your favorite, RJ.

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,000
That is, Rahul Jayekar.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:13,300
"Bless me with your grace."

55
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
"Give me thoughts."

56
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,300
"Give me oaths and promises."

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,000
"Give directions to my prayers."

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,100
"Give my hear-t refuge."

59
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,000
"Give me new reasons."

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,300
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

61
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,800
"Bless me with your grace."

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,100
"Take a look at me as well."

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,000
"Are you listening?"

64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,800
--I am crying"

65
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,700
"Are you listening?"

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
"Why I am crying."

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,300
He's drunk! RJ!

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,200
"Destiny's are lost."

69
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,100
"The path's forlorn."

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,900
"Come and take me away."

71
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,400
"That's all I pray for."

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,400
"It's your safekeeping."

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,600
"You belong to me."

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,900
"Bless me with your grace."

75
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,500
"Take a look at me as well."

76
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,100
"Are you listening?"

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,900
--I am crying"

78
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,200
"Are you listening?"

79
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
RJ!

80
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,200
Come, come.

81
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,300
What are you waiting for?

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Get the camera.

83
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Hurry UP-

84
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
Take the shot!

85
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Get up. - Rahul, leave.

86
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,600
You have ruined me.
I won't spare you, RJ.

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,700
Rahul, let be.

88
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Get out.

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,300
I don't want security.
I don't want it.

90
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Wait.

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,700
Let's go - Yes sir.

92
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,400
I know, these things
happen in cheap shows.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,700
Anyway-

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,300
We'll discuss this back at the hotel.

95
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,700
I want to stay alone!

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Go somewhere far away.

97
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,500
But, do you have a
problem if I come with you?

98
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,000
No, there's no problem.

99
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,500
I just want to go away
from this commotion. - What?

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's not much
of commotion left now.

101
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
It's almost over, Rahul.

102
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,100
After doing <i>shows</i> at London,
New York, Australia.

103
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,900
...now you don't have work.

104
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
No one wants to work with you.

105
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Music directors. Film industry,
stage shows, pop albums.

106
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,500
You've nothing.

107
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,700
No one's going to support
a drunk artist for too long.

108
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,300
No one's going to tolerate that.

109
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,400
And now, it's come to this.

110
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,400
...that we've to perform
in small cities.

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
And pardon me;
this is what happens in such shows.

112
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
There's a lot that
happens in my hear-t too.

113
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
So what? - Nothing.

114
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,100
Just stop drinking.

115
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,500
We haven't lost anything yet.

116
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
You were a star yesterday.

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,100
And you still are. - Are you finished?

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Can I go?

119
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah, go on.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,300
But, this isn't Mumbai.

121
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Sir your car.

122
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,000
Where will you go?

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
In this strange city?

124
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
If you meet with an accident
in this state, you'll end up dead.

125
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
You know me well, Vivek.

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,300
I don't drink to die.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,300
But, I would die for a drink.

128
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,300
So see you, Vivek. - Rahul.

129
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,900
"The time's standing still."

130
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,000
"How did this happen."

131
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,600
"I want you to come in my life."

132
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,800
"Like a wish comes true."

133
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,000
"You're the satisfaction of my soul."

134
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,300
"You're my faith."

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
And this award goes to Rahul Jaykar!

136
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,400
"Bless me with your grace."

137
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,500
"Take a look at me as well."

138
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,700
Rahul Jaykar has been honored
with the best male singer award.

139
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,400
RJ the most popular Indian singer.

140
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,400
RJ's new song is super hit.

141
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,700
RJ! RJ! RJ!

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,900
RJ! RJ! RJ!

143
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
"Are you listening?"

144
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,500
--I am crying"

145
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,800
"Are you listening?"

146
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,400
--I am crying"

147
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,800
"You are listening, aren't you?"

148
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,800
--I am crying"

149
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,700
"You are listening, aren't you?"

150
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:23,700
--I am crying"

151
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,200
Oh no!

152
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,700
Sorry!

153
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Are you okay? - What okay?

154
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
It's a sunny day, right?

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,500
So, you're driving with your goggles.

156
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,800
You made me drop all the vegetables.

157
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
I just lost 86 rupees. - 86 rupees.

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a lot of money.
- What are you looking at?

159
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,400
Pick up the remaining tomatoes.

160
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,900
Come on. - Yes.

161
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,700
Three were crushed under the car.

162
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,300
I'll send you the money.
Give me your address.

163
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,600
No. You should be taught a lesson.

164
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,500
Bend down.

165
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Bend down!
And pick them all up. - Sorry.

166
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,600
They are spoilt now.

167
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,500
Forget it.

168
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I am sorry Ms..

169
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,700
That was two days ration.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You ruined it.

171
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,400
Make me a large. - The bar's closed.

172
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Make me a drink. - The bar's.

173
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Mr. RJ sir, you!

174
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,500
Sir, I'm a big fan.

175
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
Make me a drink.

176
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,700
Sir. - I'm okay.

177
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Make me a drink.

178
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
I am sorry, sir. But the bar's closed.

179
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
The owner's father passed away, $0..

180
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
Father's dead.

181
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
So, where can I get a drink?

182
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Sir, I can give you
drink mixed with coke.

183
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,100
No one will know.

184
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Forget it.

185
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,400
Someone's father is dead. Why cheat.

186
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
Then, can you tell
me if there's a bar around.

187
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,700
I'll be grateful.

188
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,400
Bar?

189
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,800
Oh yes, there's a beer
bar just a few paces ahead.

190
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
It stays open until 2 o'clock.

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
But, that place isn't your standards.

192
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,100
I'm not up to my standards, either.

193
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,300
What?

194
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Nothing.

195
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Thank you.

196
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,800
"Destiny's are lost."

197
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,200
"The path's forlorn."

198
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,300
"Come and take me away."

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,100
"That's all I pray for."

200
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,700
"It's your safekeeping."

201
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,600
"You belong to me."

202
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,500
"Give me thoughts."

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,500
"Give me oaths and promises."

204
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,300
"Give directions to my prayers."

205
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
"Give my hear-t refuge."

206
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,200
"Give me new reasons."

207
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,400
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

208
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,600
"Bless me with your grace."

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,500
"Take a look at me as well."

210
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,000
"Are you listening?"

211
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,000
--I am crying"

212
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,000
"Are you listening?"

213
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,700
"Why I am crying."

214
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,200
Keep this inside.
- What are you doing?

215
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,100
He's here.

216
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,200
Who? - Don't know.

217
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
He was drunk and driving.

218
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
I barely managed to escape.

219
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,800
He's no-good. Just enjoying for free.

220
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Don't look at him.

221
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Forget it. The manager's watching.

222
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Go on.

223
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,800
"The time's standing still."

224
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,500
"How did this happen."

225
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,300
"I want you came in my life."

226
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,700
"Like a wish comes true."

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,700
"You're the satisfaction of my soul."

228
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,200
"You're my faith."

229
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,200
"Bless me with your grace."

230
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,000
"Take a look at me as well."

231
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,600
"Are you listening?"

232
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,600
--I am crying"

233
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,500
"Are you listening?"

234
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,200
"Why I am crying."

235
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Salim, he's right here.

236
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm going to yell at him.

237
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,100
He's coming, isn't here?

238
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,100
He's here, right?

239
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Look, I..

240
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,200
Hello. - Hello, sir..

241
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,900
RJ. - Yes.

242
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,100
Rahul. . . Jayekar! - Yes.

243
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,400
This song.. - You, at our hotel?

244
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,100
And, I was singing your song. - No.

245
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,000
Salil. I said such rubbish.

246
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,900
I want to talk to you. - Sir, sorry..

247
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,300
Sit. - And,
I made you do such stupid things.

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,900
Pick up vegetables.
- Be quiet for a minute.

249
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,800
What's your name?

250
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,800
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

251
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Aarohi.

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
You've a great voice.
- No, I was just.

253
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,700
Just listen.

254
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,700
Yes.

255
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,500
You sung my song better than me.

256
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
I just realized my ?aws.

257
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,500
The mistakes I made in my songs.

258
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,700
I never felt any of my song like this.

259
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
You're joking.

260
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,700
No.

261
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,300
I never joke when concerns singing.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,100
Rahul! Rahul!

263
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,600
Are you mad?

264
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
I found your car crashed,
in the middle of the road.

265
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
Whether you're dead or alive,
you could've have..

266
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,300
What are you doing here?

267
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's go.

268
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,100
Let's go from here.

269
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,700
Rahul, let's go. - Don't go, Aarohi.

270
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's go.

271
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
Let's leave.

272
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
He's a drunkard.

273
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
He was just trying to convince her..

274
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes, let's go.

275
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,300
Is 1 am. And,
the police can raid any moment.

276
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,300
But, he's such a big artist.

277
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,600
If we leave.. - He won't know.

278
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,400
Let's go.

279
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Deepak's looking all over for you.

280
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
We've four more <i>shows</i> to do.

281
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,700
If this continues.

282
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,300
...we'll have to return all the money.

283
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,400
We will return the money, Vivek.

284
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
What are you saying Rahul?

285
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,600
Listen. I've to go
back to Mumbai tomorrow.

286
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,600
This singer, Aarohi.. - Who?

287
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,800
Where's everyone?

288
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,600
Forget it, let's go.

289
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,300
Rahul, let's go. - Wait.

290
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Where's everyone? - They all left.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
I want that girl's address.

292
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,700
Where does she stay? - Kolhapanaji!

293
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm going. - What?

294
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Give me the car keys.

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
What are you doing? - Give it.

296
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,100
What's going on?

297
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
What are you doing?
- Pay for the whiskey.

298
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Rahul!

299
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,400
Rahul! How will I go home?

300
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,100
'You've a great voice.'

301
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
'You sung my song better than me.'

302
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,900
'I just realized my ?aws.'

303
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,700
'The mistakes I made in my songs.'

304
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,600
'I never felt any
of my song like this.'

305
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,800
Aarohi!

306
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,600
Aarohi!

307
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
Aarohi!

308
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,300
Aarohi!

309
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Hi.-Oh, God!

310
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,400
I want to talk to you, come down.

311
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,200
Come down.

312
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I can't come. - Fine, I'm coming.

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,100
No. no. no. - What?

314
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,500
I'm coming. - Come down.

315
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
What are you doing?

316
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,500
What happened?

317
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
Come on.

318
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
What happened?

319
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Come here.

320
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
What are you doing?

321
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm not allowed to meet anyone here.

322
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,100
If the bar's management sees me..

323
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,000
...he'll deduct a day's salary.
- Sorry.

324
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,200
I had to come.

325
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,500
We couldn't complete
our conversation at the bar..

326
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
What?

327
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,400
So...

328
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,900
You want to be a singer?
- Who said that?

329
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
You did.

330
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,900
You were looking at Lata's picture.

331
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,200
Just like a child looks at the moon.

332
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,500
Wants to touch it.

333
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,100
That look told me everything.

334
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,100
Everyone looks at the moon.

335
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,000
What good is that? - The beginning.

336
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,000
Of every successful journey.

337
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,100
You know,
the best artists in the world.

338
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,900
...are the ones who
have their own style.

339
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,400
A style,
that doesn't come from imitation.

340
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,700
A style, that's born with them.

341
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
And, you've got that.

342
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
That special thing.

343
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,800
I wonder what's that thing.

344
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
...that you heard,
but the others can't.

345
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,800
I tried really hard.

346
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,400
But, no one gave me a chance.

347
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,300
That's why I am here.

348
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Because,
I want to make you successful.

349
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,300
I want to make you the greatest
singer of this millennium.

350
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:32,300
Look I...not the kind of girl you think.

351
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I don't say these
things to those girls.

352
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300
But, what to do?

353
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I think I am in love.

354
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,400
I've gone crazy.

355
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,500
Now, whether it's the art
or the artist, that's yet to say.

356
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
We'll know.

357
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,200
But, only after you're sober.

358
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,200
Listen. - What?

359
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,100
You won't work in that bar.

360
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,800
You'll leave that job.

361
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,500
Because I say so.

362
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Do you believe me?

363
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Listen.

364
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
What?

365
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
Nothing.

366
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,700
Just like that.

367
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,400
Aarohi, are you okay?

368
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
Yes. I am fine.

369
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
25,000!

370
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,400
That's what I spent to bring you here.

371
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,600
I suggest,
you pay up and you can leave.

372
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,000
What?

373
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,600
Don't have it.

374
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,800
Go.

375
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,000
Shankar sir.

376
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,400
It's the question of my life.

377
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,900
Please let me go.

378
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll return your money
once I get to Mumbai.

379
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,200
No one's going to pay
even 200 for this face.

380
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
What do you think?

381
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,900
This is no orphanage.

382
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,600
Pay up and leave.

383
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
You take up 50 percent.

384
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,200
And, what are we left with?

385
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,800
We've to buy food with our own money.

386
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,800
It'll take me months
to arrange that kind of money.

387
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
Yeah! Exactly.

388
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,000
That's why you steal
money from the money-bag.

389
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,300
What else do you expect me to do?

390
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,900
You cut 100 rupees for minor mistakes.

391
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,800
200 for coming late.

392
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
And my salary.. - Babu!

393
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,600
What's wrong with her?

394
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,600
She's constantly
saying "I want to go".

395
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,100
She was fine until yesterday.

396
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,400
That singer RJ that
came to bar yesterday.

397
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,000
...Is the one that provoked her.

398
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,200
That he'll make her a singer.

399
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
Give her a chance to sing in films.

400
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,400
Since then" - I see.

401
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
RJ. That singer.

402
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,700
Just a minute.

403
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,900
Look.

404
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,500
His picture's in the papers.

405
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,600
He had a fight with a man yesterday.

406
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,200
He left before the show started.

407
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,900
The organizer of the
show was crying on camera.

408
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,100
There are many other
stories about him.

409
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,700
But, no news about his work.

410
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,800
He'll get you work.

411
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,400
A man that's living off
his hit songs of yesteryear..

412
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,800
...can only pass time with you.

413
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,400
Do you know why?

414
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,800
Because you're worth it.

415
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,300
Hello, sir...you..

416
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,700
I am here for this girl..

417
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,900
...because she's going
to a great singer.

418
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,100
But, I can see her future, not you.

419
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,900
One more thing.

420
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,800
You run a bar.

421
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,100
You live off singers.

422
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
Learn to respect singers.

423
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
Ones that sing at your bar.

424
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,500
And the ones,
whose songs help you run your bar.

425
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Get that.

426
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,300
Vivek, throw the money on his face.

427
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
He isn't worthy of any respect.

428
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,400
Let's go, Aarohi.

429
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,300
Okay. Goodbye.

430
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,500
What's all this, Rahul?

431
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,000
This is it.

432
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,100
I pray to Allah that
you're never head-broken.

433
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
If that happens, don't hesitate.

434
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I'll get you work,
and won't taunt you either.

435
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,100
No, no, it's fine.

436
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll drop you.

437
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
No.

438
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,400
The place I stay,
isn't your standards.

439
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
I've noted my number, address..

440
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
...and my manager's
number in your diary.

441
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,300
So, call me when you get a new sim.

442
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,900
Okay?

443
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Don't forget.

444
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,700
Thank you. - For what?

445
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,900
For giving me new hope.

446
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,700
Bye. - Bye.

447
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,000
Listen.

448
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,600
What?

449
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Nothing.

450
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Just like that.

451
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,500
Father!

452
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,900
Aarohi.

453
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
You're back. - Yes.

454
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,600
I was thinking about you. - Really?

455
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
I even called you in my dreams.

456
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,400
Your mother yelled at me. - Why?

457
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
She called me crazy. - Father.

458
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,900
But, you left for three months,
didn't you?

459
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,900
And in one month..
- I'll tell you everything.

460
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,600
But where's mother?

461
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
At the station.

462
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,900
Today's Thursday.

463
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,000
She's gone to buy the
Maharashtra Rajya Lottery.

464
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,500
She's been buying lottery
tickets for the past two years.

465
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,100
But she's never won anything
more than 100 rupees.

466
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,200
Enough!

467
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,400
The daughter's back and
the father can't stop yapping.

468
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,800
Mother.

469
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,100
Why didn't you say you're coming?

470
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
I would've prepared something for you.

471
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,900
We live off on fritters.

472
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,200
But now that you're here,
we'll make something nice.

473
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,600
Give me 100 rupees..

474
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
...I'll get something from the market.

475
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
We'll make something good today.

476
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,800
Mother, I..

477
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,700
...didn't get paid. - Why?

478
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,000
I met someone.

479
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,100
He said he'll give me a
chance to be a singer, in films.

480
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,400
So I.. - You believed him.
And quit your job.

481
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,400
Mom.

482
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
Mom.

483
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,900
Everything will be okay.

484
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,900
Trust.

485
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,000
It's just a matter of few days.

486
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Once I star-t working. - So?

487
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
I only have 300 rupees.

488
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,200
300 rupees..

489
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,000
Your father doesn't earn a penny.

490
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,000
He.. keeps repairing everyone's
radio and TV's for free.

491
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
What are you saying? - Let me speak.

492
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Is this why I sent
you to the best teachers?

493
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Taught you to speak good Hindi.

494
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,200
So that you can become a great.

495
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,900
I stitched clothes
to pay for your fees.

496
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,500
Finally you found a job,
but you quit that as well.

497
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,100
And..

498
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,400
I don't win.. the jackpot either.

499
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,400
I thought if you get some money..

500
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,500
...I will manage a few months.

501
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,500
Now, I'll have to borrow from someone.

502
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,900
No, mom.

503
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
Let's see whether anyone
will lend me money or not.

504
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,100
Mom. Mom. Mom. Listen to me. - Aarohi.

505
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
Let her go.

506
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Actually, it's not her fault.

507
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,700
She's always seen poverty.

508
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,000
And I never gave her anything either.

509
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
But look.

510
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,200
All our hopes are with you.

511
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,100
We want good things for you.

512
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,100
Father.

513
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,400
First time someone's believed in me.

514
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,900
First time I believed in someone.

515
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,900
He came all the way from Goa,
only for me.

516
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,200
And he's gone to talk
to someone for me, father.

517
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,100
Uncle, I'm not joking.
- Deadlines, boys.

518
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,900
There's a girl

519
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,500
Thank God!

520
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,100
Get married, straighten up!

521
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,900
No, no, no, it's not that.

522
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
No. - No.

523
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,900
This girl's a very,
very, very, very good singer.

524
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I would've believed you
if you had said "very" once.

525
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,000
Please cancel my
appointment for tomorrow.

526
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,800
She was singing in a bar.

527
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,400
Bar.. you mean where
you were obviously..

528
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,600
Yes..

529
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,200
But, what a voice.

530
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,600
I had an entire bottle,
but I couldn't get drunk.

531
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,500
Can you imagine?

532
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
15 minutes.

533
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,800
Basically, I want you to
give her a chance to sing in films.

534
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Or, make an album.

535
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,400
She's superb, uncle.
I can write that in blood.

536
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,900
Do you have any blood left?

537
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,600
Where is she?

538
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,200
She stays here in Mumbai.

539
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,400
She's from a poor family..

540
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,100
...and performs out of
the city to make a living.

541
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,800
In these small bars.

542
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
But I am not going
to let that happen again.

543
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,600
I really want to help her, uncle.

544
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,700
She's a superstar.

545
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,300
Superstar? - Yeah!

546
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,800
A star, is someone whose songs,
and voice..

547
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,600
...makes you want to..

548
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,200
Whistle.

549
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
Whistle.

550
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
Just like people used
to whistle at your performance.

551
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,200
You were the star. You.

552
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,100
She's better than me.

553
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,600
She's amazing.

554
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,600
I'm telling you, she's amazing.

555
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Call her.

556
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I'll first hear her and then decide.

557
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,800
You're serious? - Yes.

558
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,200
Yes.

559
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,900
Thank you, uncle.

560
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,900
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

561
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,200
Out. Get out.

562
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
Thank you.

563
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,400
Listen to him. He's a good man.

564
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,000
Excuse me, give me a simcard.
- Take this.

565
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,500
You are leaving Deepak's show?

566
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,100
You will forget to sing.

567
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,900
Be careful.

568
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,900
Careful, please.

569
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,200
Careful.

570
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Don't you dare tell anyone about this!

571
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,200
If any journalist or
media-person asks you about him.

572
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,200
"Then say,
he's gone to London for a show.

573
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,200
In the meanwhile,
nobody comes in, nobody talks to him.

574
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
You get that.

575
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,300
Hello. - Hello.

576
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,700
Can I talk to Mr.
Rahul? My name's Aarohi.

577
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
He asked me to call me.

578
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,300
I'm a singer, we met in Goa
and he said.. - Rahul isn't here.

579
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,400
He's gone to London, for his shows.

580
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,800
And he'll return after 20-25 days.
- 20-25 days?

581
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,300
Yes, but just listen to me..

582
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,700
Hello! Hello!

583
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,600
"It's your fault, my heart!"

584
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,500
"It's your fault, my heart!"

585
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:11,200
"Why did you trust him?"

586
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,400
"All the promises were fake."

587
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,300
"The one you followed here."

588
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,200
"Beloved's nowhere."

589
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,000
"Beloved's nowhere."

590
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,800
"Beloved's nowhere."

591
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,800
"Now, stop seeing those dreams."

592
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,600
"Now, shatter those dreams yourself."

593
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,500
"Beloved's nowhere."

594
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,300
We don't have evidence.

595
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,900
"Whether Deepak's involved or not.

596
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,800
But I swear Rahul.

597
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,000
I will find out whoever he is and..

598
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Did Aarohi call?

599
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Not yet.

600
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,600
Is your phone on?

601
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,900
24/7.

602
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,100
Tell this girl that
it's a wrong number.

603
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
Hello. - Hello.

604
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,200
Hello, is Rahul back.

605
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,100
I am sorry, this is a wrong number.

606
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,500
What?

607
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Hello. Hello.

608
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,800
"There's punishment
for every mistake."

609
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,200
"if you're destined for sadness."

610
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,300
"There's always a reason."

611
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:09,000
"All my pain has
conjured in my tears."

612
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,800
"My tears don't stop trickling down."

613
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,000
"Beloved's nowhere."

614
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,500
"Beloved's nowhere."

615
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,500
"Beloved's nowhere."

616
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,800
"Beloved's nowhere."

617
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,400
Okay. Give the money.

618
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,700
See you. Goodbye.

619
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,200
This fracture showed
me the importance of my legs.

620
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,600
Take care.

621
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,700
Great.

622
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Good news.

623
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,900
It's time to celebrate.

624
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
I'll have a drink with you as well.

625
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,300
Where to? - To look for Aarohi.

626
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,300
Come on.

627
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,400
Excuse me, is this Rahul's house?

628
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,200
Yes, this is his home.

629
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,800
But, sir's out of town.

630
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,800
I don't know when he's coming back.

631
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,700
Vivek sir said he'll be
coming back after 20-25 days.

632
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,800
It's been two months now.

633
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,100
He hasn't returned.

634
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,400
What can I do if he hasn't?

635
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,300
I'll let you know once he comes back.

636
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Please leave.

637
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Please give this top
Rahul sir when he returns.

638
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,600
Tell him Aarohi was here.

639
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,800
I tried calling him many times.

640
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,600
I'll give it to him once he returns.

641
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,200
Please go now.

642
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Coming!

643
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,000
What happened?

644
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,600
Sister-in-law, Salim.

645
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,300
Aarohi. What's wrong?

646
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,700
Salim.

647
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,800
What's wrong? Who is it?

648
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,300
What's wrong, Aarohi?

649
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,300
I want a job.

650
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,700
Any place. Good, bad or cheap.

651
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,600
Just get me work.

652
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,200
I need money, Salim.

653
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,400
Come in.

654
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,700
Sir. A girl gave this.

655
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,800
When did she come?

656
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,000
Yesterday evening.

657
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,300
She said she called
you two-three times.

658
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Maybe she spoke to Vivek sir.

659
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,600
She looked decent, so I told you.

660
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,700
Thank you. - Welcome sir.

661
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,200
What the hell is wrong with you?

662
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
Don't ask why I did that?

663
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,800
You know.

664
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,500
I told that girl never
to sing in a bar again.

665
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,700
I told her she'll
be a successful singer.

666
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
I told her she will be a star.

667
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,600
I went to her hotel, Vivek.

668
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,900
She didn't come to me.

669
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,500
And what did you do?

670
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,100
You humiliated her.

671
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,100
You hid her calls from me.

672
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,000
You lied to her.

673
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,300
You treated her like an enemy.
- Yes, because I'm your friend.

674
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,300
I've been with you for years.

675
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
You could've shown
some respect for me.

676
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,600
And for any darn girl..
- She's no ordinary girl!

677
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,300
This is why I did it.

678
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,500
So that you stay away from her.

679
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,700
I didn't want this to happen, man!

680
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,000
First alcohol, then drugs.

681
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,200
And now.. - Whatever I do
with my life is my problem, Vivek.

682
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,100
No!

683
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,500
This isn't your personal problem.

684
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,100
I've been with you for 10 years.

685
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,400
I looked after you, your career.

686
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,700
I saw your success, your downfall.

687
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,700
But, I can't see you
handing over your success.

688
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,300
"Which you need the most now,
to some girl.

689
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,700
I can't see you doing
this for someone else instead.

690
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,200
I feel sad. It hurts me.

691
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,000
To know that you've stopped
recognizing your talent.

692
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,300
You've forgotten your own voice.

693
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
One that's unmatched.

694
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,500
Why?

695
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,400
Why don't you see yourself?

696
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,500
Why don't you hear yourself?

697
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,600
You call me your enemy.

698
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,500
Just. look at yourself.

699
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
You're right.

700
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,500
But the truth is,
I don't want anything.

701
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,600
Fame, for-tune,
success, money, respect.

702
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
It should all go to
the one that deserves it.

703
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,200
Give the bread to the
one that's hungry for it.

704
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,500
And I've seen that in that girl.

705
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,700
And I no longer have that.

706
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,100
And I've admitted this truth.

707
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,200
You should too.

708
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,900
Your friend can't pay
you your salary anymore.

709
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,700
RJ. - You're a free man, Vivek.

710
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,500
You can go anywhere you want.

711
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,700
Hello.

712
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,700
Can I talk to Aarohi, please?

713
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,900
She's performing? - Where?

714
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,200
Hotel Nightingale.

715
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,700
"What seemed like reality,
turned out to be an illusion."

716
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,200
"A saga, that was bound for a twist,
has ended."

717
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,100
"I forgot, so did she."

718
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,300
"How do I tell everyone about this?"

719
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,500
"I've slowly compromised myself."

720
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,400
"I've slowly controlled myself."

721
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,400
"Beloved's nowhere."

722
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,100
"Beloved's nowhere."

723
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,300
"Beloved's nowhere."

724
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:03,000
"Beloved's nowhere."

725
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,000
"It's your fault, my heart!"

726
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,400
"It's your fault, my heart!"

727
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,800
"Why did you trust him?"

728
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,500
Aarohi! Aarohi!

729
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,400
Please let me explain.

730
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,000
Look. I work here.

731
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,500
Don't create a scene.

732
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,400
I got this job with great difficulty.

733
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,200
Damn the job, I want to speak to you.

734
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,900
Why should I?

735
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,100
I've been waiting for two months.

736
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,400
First time I hurt my
parents and trusted someone.

737
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,700
I star-ted dreaming.

738
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,100
Everything seemed true.

739
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,900
What now?

740
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,000
Go ahead.

741
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
You can vent all your anger.

742
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,200
I am your culprit.

743
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,300
But, I am not.

744
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,100
I waited for you.

745
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,100
Get in.

746
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Come on. - What are you doing?

747
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,200
Get in. - What are you doing?

748
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,300
What are you doing? - Come on.

749
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,300
I want to tell you a story.

750
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,800
I don't want to hear your story.

751
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,500
Let's go.

752
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,400
If all that happened with you..

753
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,700
"Then, why didn't they show it on TV?

754
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,300
Aarohi, the TV..

755
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,300
Please forget it.

756
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,200
I want to keep my promise.

757
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,300
In fact I brought Sehgal uncle along.

758
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,600
He's called you at his office.

759
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,300
But, I cannot quit this job.

760
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,200
I cannot take a risk again.

761
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,600
Then don't.

762
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,200
You can keep the job
until you're satisfied.

763
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,000
But, you've believed me so far,
then why not another day.

764
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,300
Be ready at 11 am tomorrow.

765
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,700
Please.

766
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,200
Please!

767
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,000
You sing well, dear.

768
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
You're talented.

769
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,700
And you understand tunes.

770
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,900
But, for playback singing and albums..

771
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,000
...you'll need some grooming.

772
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,200
Just a little.

773
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,100
Because singing in recording
studios with new songs..

774
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,400
...can get a little overwhelming.

775
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,700
Okay?

776
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Fine.. we'll star-t your
vocal training from next week.

777
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,900
Yes, I'll do that.

778
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,200
I'll train her. - Fantastic!

779
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,900
What else do you want?

780
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,400
So many awards, records.

781
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,700
They're all yours.

782
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,600
They're mine, or not. I don't know.

783
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,300
What?

784
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Nothing.

785
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,200
Don't worry.

786
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,000
Someday you'll come with your award.

787
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,900
You'll have more awards than me.

788
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
I promise.

789
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,500
What?

790
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,900
Nothing.

791
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,000
Just like that.

792
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,000
I can't do it.

793
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,300
Okay, listen. I will show you.

794
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,100
It's in B flat.

795
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,800
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

796
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,400
"Show me the way to your heart
whether I want it or not."

797
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,100
You sing so well.

798
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
It's your training not me.

799
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,300
Let's star-t singing.

800
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:03,200
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

801
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:11,800
"Show me the way to your heart
whether I want it or not."

802
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:22,800
"Let me tell you,
that I don't have faith in my love."

803
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
"Still, the hear-t thought.."

804
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,100
"..now that we're here, why not ask."

805
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,900
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

806
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,000
"Show me the way to your heart
whether I want it or not."

807
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,400
"I never had such desires before."

808
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:25,600
"I never tried this
hard to meet anyone."

809
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:32,900
"Solve my confusion,
whether I want it or not."

810
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,900
"Express it through your eyes,
whether I want it or not."

811
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,600
Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi!

812
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,100
Ladies and Gentlemen.

813
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,100
The time has come,
for me to introduce you all..

814
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,100
...to the nightingale of India,
and our country's.

815
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,100
...latest singing sensation.

816
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,400
The beautiful,
the talented, the wonderful!

817
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,300
Aarohi Keshav Shirke!

818
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,300
Yes, dad.

819
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,300
Rahul. How are you, son?

820
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,000
Everything fine?
- Everything fine, dad.

821
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,300
In fact, I'm really happy.

822
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,500
After a long time.

823
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,400
You're in love, huh!

824
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,800
"Just tell me..

825
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,200
How did you know?

826
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,400
I'm your father.

827
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,300
Come.

828
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,300
When the son's in love,
the father knows.

829
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:59,800
"Show me the way to your heart
whether I want it or not."

830
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,100
What happened?

831
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,200
Sir, she needs five more minutes.

832
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,200
It's been half an hour, Rahul.

833
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Is there a problem?
- No, sir. There's no problem.

834
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Aarohi.

835
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,600
Come out.

836
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,800
Let's go.

837
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,000
I cannot sing.

838
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,800
Aarohi, we all get nervous.

839
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,300
I was too.

840
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,500
I ran away from the studio.

841
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,400
It's okay.

842
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,900
No.

843
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,200
The bar was a different story.

844
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Making mistakes were okay.

845
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,900
But, here.. amongst these big people..

846
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,600
You're not alone.

847
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,600
I am with you.

848
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,100
Please, come out.

849
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,000
I cannot sing.

850
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,600
Aarohi, I love you.

851
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,500
I love you.

852
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,400
I've waited too long for this day.

853
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,400
More than you.

854
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,900
Come out for me.

855
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,000
Please.

856
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,000
"I've small dreams."

857
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,400
"Dreams have songs."

858
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,800
"Songs have life."

859
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,000
"Love and affection."

860
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,700
"I don't dream any longer."

861
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,500
"That's without you."

862
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:11,400
"I'm finally saying,
what I didn't so far."

863
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:20,600
"The hear-t trusts you, more than me."

864
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,500
"I weave dreams about us,
in my empty moments."

865
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:30,000
"You're in love with me."

866
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:38,900
<i>"I'll</i> never ask you,
whether I want to or not."

867
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:47,500
"I want to live in your dreams,
because I want to." - Fantastic.

868
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,400
Really nice.

869
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,000
Ladies and Gentlemen.

870
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,000
Welcome to the Indian Music Awards.

871
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,300
Finally! - Uncle.

872
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,200
We're waiting for you.

873
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,200
Where's Rahul?

874
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,600
When you can't find Rahul anywhere..

875
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,400
...you must always check the bar.

876
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,600
But, it's such a big day of my life,
he should be with me.

877
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,300
I've been nominated.

878
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,000
I understand.

879
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Mom and dad are here.

880
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,700
<i>I'll just.</i>

881
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,600
Come. Please come.

882
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,200
Come on, he'll be here. Come on.

883
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,800
Please.

884
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
Aarohi! Aarohi!

885
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,200
Come here.

886
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,900
Looking for me?

887
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,800
You scared me.

888
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,000
Where were you? - Forget that.

889
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,600
How do you feel?

890
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It's useless.

891
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,100
Wonder where you keep disappearing to?

892
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,000
I was at the bar.

893
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,000
If you drink so much, how
will you recognize me in the crowd?

894
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,300
I will.

895
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,700
Amongst, thousands, million, billions.

896
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,700
I can forget myself, but not you.

897
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,100
When did you fall so
deeply in love with me?

898
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,200
Hi, ma'am!

899
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,700
I'm from CNTV Live.

900
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Do you mind if I
take a small interview?

901
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,700
Please. Just for five minutes.

902
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,500
No, right now I.. - Just a second.

903
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,300
Never do that.

904
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,900
Okay. Never do that.

905
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,200
Go. Time to touch the moon.

906
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,100
Go get them.

907
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,700
Ladies and Gentlemen. Moving
on the next award.

908
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,900
Nidhi Chaudhary for "Aa jara"

909
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,900
Listen. - Yes, sir.

910
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,000
Did you get the bottle from home?
- No, sir.

911
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,800
Then, why are you being a miser?
Pour some more.

912
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,100
Sorry, sir.

913
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,400
And award goes to..

914
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

915
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,300
She won!

916
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,400
Thank you.

917
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,100
The girl sings well.

918
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,200
She's very good.

919
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,600
I heard she was offered
to sing in films too.

920
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,300
But she refused.

921
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,500
She'll say yes.

922
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,500
Everyone wants to be a star.

923
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,700
Of course, she will be.

924
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,000
But, not a star, a maid.

925
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,400
What's that singer's name?

926
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,200
That star.

927
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,800
Rahul.

928
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,900
She'll be his maid.

929
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,400
And later, his nurse.

930
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,600
Come on. He loves her.

931
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,700
He's made her.

932
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,000
She made it this far because of him.

933
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,500
That's what I am trying to tell you.

934
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,800
The higher she climbs
the ladder of success.

935
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,400
"The lower she'll
fall because of Rahul.

936
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,200
She belongs to a poor family,
after all.

937
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,000
That's why RJ's taken her in.

938
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,500
So that he can make her serve him.

939
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,400
Keep her awake all night,
for his entertainment.

940
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,900
To vent out the anger of his failure.

941
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:01,000
And as days will go by,
he will star-t hitting her.

942
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,300
He'll beat her every day,
humiliate her.

943
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,000
And once he falls sick..

944
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,200
...she'll be cleaning his pukes.

945
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,500
Remember this.

946
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,100
Often, those who light the lamp..

947
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,200
...are the ones that douse it later.

948
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,100
There have been many
such stories in the industry.

949
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,000
Another glass of whiskey.

950
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,500
Rahul!

951
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,700
Rahul!

952
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,700
Rahul!

953
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,100
Rahul. What are you doing?

954
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,900
Get down.

955
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,900
Finally, you touched the moon.

956
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,100
You were looking very beautiful
on the big screen with the award.

957
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,100
Does this bottle
look nice in my hands?

958
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,900
It doesn't.

959
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,600
But what to do.

960
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,200
I just can't let go.

961
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,300
Rahul. - No, no, wait.

962
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,700
After I got my first
break without any struggle.

963
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,700
...I got fame, for-tune, status.

964
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,800
The world was at my feet.

965
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,800
But, I didn't know what to do.

966
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,100
I couldn't handle the fame..

967
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,500
<i>.</i> .OF HWY senses.

968
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,800
That was the condition yesterday.

969
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
...It's still the same today.

970
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,400
And it'll always stay that way.

971
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,000
Rahul. What are you doing?

972
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,800
What are you doing?

973
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,500
Why are you doing this?

974
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,600
We'll have to end this relation here.

975
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,400
Now.

976
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,600
Nothings lost yet.

977
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,900
We aren't so close.

978
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,000
We can live without each other.

979
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,800
You're successful now, Aarohi.

980
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,500
You've everything.

981
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,300
Go, live your life.

982
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,000
My habits have scared me.

983
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,900
I don't know my future.

984
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,000
What I might turn into.

985
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,900
How I may treat you.

986
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,400
It doesn't take long for
one to turn into the devil.

987
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
So, why should I hold you back?

988
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,200
I can't do this.

989
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,300
Then.. then"

990
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,700
Leave this habit.

991
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,200
Leave it.

992
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,600
It's no good.

993
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,600
I'll help you.

994
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,400
I'll help you leave it.

995
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,000
Just give me a chance.
- I can never leave it.

996
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,400
It's like a wife,
that won't ever leave me alone.

997
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,300
So, listen to me.

998
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,000
You'll be happier without me.

999
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,600
That means, you can live
with this habit, but not me.

1000
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,600
Rahul.

1001
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,600
Love is not a joke. - But my life is.

1002
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,200
But, you always had this habit.

1003
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,000
If you were so scared,
why did you come so close?

1004
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,400
You should've stayed away. - Exactly.

1005
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,400
Until now, I was my own enemy!

1006
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,800
And before I become a threat to you,
just go away!

1007
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
Fine.

1008
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,200
<i>L</i> am going.

1009
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,300
Away, from you and this success.

1010
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,100
Don't misjudge your success.

1011
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,800
Only a few fortune people get it.

1012
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,500
I know.

1013
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,600
And also that,
you were with me in my bad times.

1014
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,700
But if you're not with
me in my good times.

1015
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,300
"Then I don't want it.

1016
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,900
Aarohi!

1017
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,300
Aarohi! Aarohi!

1018
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,200
Aarohi, listen!

1019
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,300
"I can't live without you."

1020
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,400
"I don't exist without you."

1021
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,600
"I can't live without you."

1022
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:09,800
"I don't exist without you."

1023
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:15,100
"if I separate from you,
I'll lose myself."

1024
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,200
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1025
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,700
"You're my life."

1026
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,300
"My relief, my pain."

1027
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,500
"You're my love."

1028
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:13,400
"We can't stay away a moment."

1029
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,800
"I live only for you."

1030
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,300
"All my time is devoted to you."

1031
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,500
"I can't live a moment without you."

1032
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,800
"Each Dream's just for you."

1033
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,400
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1034
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
"You're my life."

1035
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,600
"My relief, my pain."

1036
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:57,000
"You're my love."

1037
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,100
Uncle one second wait uncle.

1038
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,400
Yes uncle don't worry.

1039
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,900
Aarohi! - Yes, mom.

1040
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,900
Dear, you're getting in
a live-in relation with him.

1041
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,500
Without marriage?

1042
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,100
What's the world going to say?

1043
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,600
This is my world..

1044
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,700
...that's it.

1045
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,700
"I lived only for you."

1046
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,700
"I've surrendered myself."

1047
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,800
"Your loyalty supported me."

1048
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,100
"It cured all my pain."

1049
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,400
"My destiny's tied with you."

1050
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,600
"You made me complete."

1051
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:39,200
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1052
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,800
"You're my life."

1053
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,500
"My relief, my pain."

1054
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:54,300
"You're my love."

1055
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,700
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1056
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,200
"You're my life."

1057
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:10,000
"My relief, my pain."

1058
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,500
"You're my love."

1059
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,500
Sir.

1060
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,200
Sir, Vivek's here to see you.

1061
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,100
He has won our heart.

1062
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,300
And today for his new song..

1063
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,400
...'YARA' he is going to be
honored with the national award.

1064
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,400
Now Aarohi's name will
be written in history.

1065
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,300
Hi.

1066
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,100
I came to apologize.

1067
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,400
What I did..

1068
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,800
I shouldn't have done.. - Forget it.

1069
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,000
Forget it.

1070
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,000
I thought you would still be angry..
- Forget it.

1071
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,100
What will you drink?

1072
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,800
Enough. Stop. What are you doing?

1073
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,800
Is there any work?

1074
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,400
What?

1075
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,900
I want to work.

1076
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,500
I am not alone.

1077
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,200
There is.

1078
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,700
There's a small-time producer.

1079
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,000
They want to record a song.

1080
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,800
Will you sing for them? - So what?

1081
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,100
Music can't be compared with money.

1082
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
This is just good.

1083
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,700
Let's do this.

1084
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,900
Let's just do this.

1085
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,100
You know what, you're back.

1086
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,200
You're back my friend.

1087
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,000
You're back.

1088
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,600
"It's not easy to be in love."

1089
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:26,300
"To shed tears."

1090
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,800
"Lovers are always struck with grief."

1091
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:36,500
"Not everyone's blessed with
this boon." - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1092
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,500
Sir, the pitch is going ?at.

1093
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,400
Please up it a little.

1094
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,600
One more. - Yes.

1095
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,000
Come on.

1096
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,900
"It's not easy to be in love."

1097
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,700
"To shed tears." - Stop! Stop! Stop!

1098
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,100
Sir, again pitch problem, sir.

1099
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,800
One more. - Okay.

1100
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,800
Yeah. One more.

1101
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,600
"It's not easy.." - Stop.

1102
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,400
Do you want me to down it a little?
- No, no need.

1103
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,300
Let's try again. - Yeah.

1104
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,500
My voice.. One more.

1105
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,000
Come on.

1106
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,500
What's wrong?

1107
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,900
Think it's funny?

1108
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,400
Can you sing this song?

1109
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,700
Can you?

1110
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,400
Then sing it. - Sir..

1111
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,100
Sing it..
- Sorry, sir. it.. Wasn't for you..

1112
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,900
The tune's so strange, and you..

1113
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,700
I need a break.

1114
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,700
Sorry.

1115
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,900
Rahul, I won't spare them.

1116
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,700
I swear they won't
know what came their way.

1117
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,100
Who do they think they are?

1118
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,100
Let's go inside.

1119
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,900
Come on, I'll show them.

1120
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,700
Come on.

1121
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,900
I've lost my voice.

1122
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,400
I couldn't sing.

1123
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,400
My vocal chords are fried.

1124
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,500
That's not true.

1125
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,900
It's okay.

1126
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,000
It happens.

1127
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,300
Let's try again. - I am finished.

1128
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:46,500
"You.. leave me.."

1129
01:21:54,300 --> 01:22:04,100
"That can never happen..

1130
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,400
...beloved."

1131
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,600
He's back again.

1132
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,400
These stars look
so ugly after they flop.

1133
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:29,900
"I always mention about you."

1134
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:40,500
"I'm always concerned about you."

1135
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:50,800
"I am what you are."

1136
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:01,500
"You're the one that
gave me my style."

1137
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,400
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1138
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,900
"You're my life."

1139
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,400
"My relief, my pain."

1140
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:23,600
"You're my love."

1141
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,700
"It's you.. it's you."

1142
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:34,300
"You're my pain, you're my cure."

1143
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,900
"My relief, my pain."

1144
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:45,300
"You're my love."

1145
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,600
Sorry.

1146
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,800
I tried, but I couldn't come earlier.

1147
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,100
How was the recording?

1148
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,800
Nothing happened?

1149
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,600
So, what did you do today? - Nothing.

1150
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I was listening to my songs.

1151
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,700
Trying to sing-

1152
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,500
You don't get them these days.

1153
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,800
You will.

1154
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,300
I will pray for you.

1155
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:42,700
You can do that later.

1156
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,100
But first, did you eat or..

1157
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,100
...were you singing
on an empty stomach?

1158
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,500
I am very hung!-

1159
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,600
Let's go out.

1160
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,700
Let's stay here. I've ordered food.

1161
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,800
It'll be here soon.

1162
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,100
Aarohi, there were few calls for you.

1163
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,300
Sehgal uncle called.

1164
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,500
He spoke to someone for you.

1165
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,400
There was a call from a talent show.

1166
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,300
For a judging job, or something.

1167
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,700
And from a magazine as well.

1168
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,700
For an interview.

1169
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,000
I asked him to call tomorrow.

1170
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,300
Rahul. - Yes.

1171
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,000
Look at me.

1172
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,200
Has anything changed?

1173
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,100
Nothings changed?

1174
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,900
Come here.

1178
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,000
How much? - 1560.

1179
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,200
1560.

1180
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,400
Keep the change. Thank you.

1181
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,900
Can I get an autograph? - Yes.

1182
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,600
Not yours, madam's.

1183
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,000
I'll call her.

1184
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,000
Aarohi, he wants your autograph.

1185
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Now. I'll give it later.

1186
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
These moments are priceless.

1187
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,700
They don't come back.

1188
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,000
Go.

1189
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,200
I'll do it, go.

1190
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,700
I'm a big fan, madam.

1191
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,000
I listen to all your songs, madam.

1192
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,700
All of them.

1193
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,700
<i>Name? - An.</i>

1194
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,300
<i>An.</i>

1195
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,900
I had a great desire to meet you.

1196
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,700
I'm really happy-

1197
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,100
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

1198
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,000
Due to your tax problems,
your accounts have been sealed.

1199
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,600
You've only few millions left.

1200
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,100
But, you can't withdraw them.

1201
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,700
I've struck a deal
for your house as well.

1202
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,400
It's a penthouse,
so it'll sell easily.

1203
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,000
It'll take some time.

1204
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,300
Sorry, sir.
But your card is networking.

1205
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,300
Just like that. - No problem.

1206
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,000
Thank you sir.

1207
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,900
We're not that bad.

1208
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:35,700
"It's you."

1209
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:42,600
"It's you."

1210
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,700
It's all over.

1211
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,300

What's all this?

1214
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,200
Nothing to drink.

1215
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,200
It's all over.

1216
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,400

01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,200
What are you doing?

1231
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,800
Nothings over yet.

1232

Nothings over yet. - It's all over.

1233

What happened to your voice?

1242

It's everything okay?

1243
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,000
Why are you sounding so low.

1244
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,800

I don't know.

1252
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,800
I'm just a little lost.

1253
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,300
Rahul you not alone.

1254
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,800

We'll come back tomorrow.

1256
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,000
You're not alone.

1257
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,700
I am not alone, dad.

1258
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,900
I am not alone.

1259
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000

Ladies and gentlemen it's pleasure

1261
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:40,300
It's the most important
day of my life.

1262
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:51,400
25 great years of long struggle,
pain, success, failures.

1263
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,900
Your love and good wishes.

01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,500
Leave me.

1277
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,100
What do you think?
- Don't create a scene here.

1278
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,300
You get out of here.

1279
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,800
"Go here, go there. Don't sit here."

1280
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,200
Rahul come on.

1281
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,300

I sung one hit song after another.

1283
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:18,900
Relax - What relax?

And, now they bloody

01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,500
I've been to many
such par-ties in my life.

1286
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,900
I am Rahul Jayekar.

1290
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,000
Aarohi.

01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,500
Let him go.

1296
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:56,100
"It's just you."

1297
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:05,300
"It's just you."

1298
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Sorry, SOFT'!-

1299
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,900
Don't do this.

1300
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,700
Stop it.

1301
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,800
You're always hovering around me.

1302
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,700
What am I doing? Why am I doing it?

1303
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,500
What am I doing? Why am I doing it?
- Am I asleep? Am I awake?

1304
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,500
I'm fed up of this.

1305
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,500
I was better-off before. - Rahul.

1306
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,200
I was happier alone. - Listen to me.

1307
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,300
I feel suffocated since you came here.

1308
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,200
What are you doing, Rahul?

1309
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,700
Get lost. - Rahul, listen to me.

1310
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,900
Just go away!

1311
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,900
Just go away!

1312
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,700
Rahul, open the door.

1313
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,700
Please.

1314
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,400
We all fall weak, Rahul.

1315
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,700
We're scared.

1316
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,200
I was too.

1317
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,900
I thought that was my life.

1318
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,000
Then, you came in my life.

1319
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,600
And changed everything.

1320
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,600
You cannot leave me alone
after giving me all this.

1321
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,800
I love you!

1322
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,100
I love you!

1323
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,300
This is what you've been waiting for.

1324
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,500
It's here.

1325
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,500
I am what you wanted to make me.

1326
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,800
At least, open the door for my sake.

1327
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,700
Please.

1328
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:58,600
At least, open the door..

1329
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,700
"Empty. your eyes."

1330
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:20,000
"I wish you.. could fill my eyes."

1331
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,400
Help me.

1332
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
"I wish you..
could fill my eyes." - Please help me.

1333
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,300
How can they disappear?
- I don't know.

1334
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,100
We've recordings lined up,
<i>shows</i> have been organized.

1335
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,400
Who is going to do it?

1336
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,300
Find out where they are. - Yes sir.

1337
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,300
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1338
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:16,200
"I swear I'll get better."

1339
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:27,000
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1340
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,500
"I swear I'll get better."

1341
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:38,200
"if you give me this gift."

1342
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:43,600
"if you give me this gift."

1343
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:49,300
"I'll forsake all happiness."

1344
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,000
"I'll die."

1345
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,300
"I'll die."

1346
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:06,000
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1347
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:12,500
"I swear I'll get better."

1348
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,900
"I want to spend the rest of my life,
leaning on your shoulder."

1349
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:39,600
"if my dream comes true,
I'll be so fortunate."

1350
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:45,200
"It'll be your tears, and my eyes."

1351
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,600
"if you give me your grief."

1352
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:01,700
"if you give me your grief."

1353
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,300
<i>"I'll</i> be filled with happiness."

1354

"I swear I'll get better."

1358
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:32,400
And now, I'd like to invite on stage.

1359
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,200
...the one that's
captivated our hearts.

1360
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,600
I would like to call upon,
our favorite RJ.

1361
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:45,100
That is Rahul Jayekar.

1362
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,800
Clap!

1363
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:50,900
RJ! RJ! RJ! RJ!

1364
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:57,300
RJ! RJ! RJ! RJ!

1365
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,900
"Whether in happiness, or grief."

1366
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,800
"The hear-t always called out to you."

1367
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,700
"You made me, you shaped me up."

1368
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,200
"The world looks up to God,
but you're my support"

1369
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:24,800
"All I need is you."

1370
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,900
"No matter what it is."

1371
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,100
"All I need is you."

1372
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,800
"No matter what it is."

1373
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,100
<i>"I'll</i> do it for you.

1374
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,000
"I'll die."

1375
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,500
"I'll die."

1376
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,400
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1377
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:05,000
"I swear I'll get better."

1378
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:10,500
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1379
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:17,400
"I swear I'll get better."

1380
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,000
The recording studio called yesterday.

1381
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,200
You didn't go for your recording.

1382
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,400
Rahul needs me, and..

1383
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,600
I want to look after him.

1384
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,200
If I stay busy,
who will look after him?

1385
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:51,200
He's going nowhere.

1386
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,000
You'll be at <i>loss,</i> because
you don't know what you have here.

1387
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:59,100
You can lose all this in a moment.

1388
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,100
I tried explaining it to him.

1389
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,200
I beg you.

1390
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,700
Don't test me.

1391
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,800
I'm tying you down, right?

1392
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:30,400
Don't do this, Aarohi.

1393
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,000
Don't miss your schedules.

1394
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,900
I'll stay here, with you.

1395
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,600
Otherwise you will be alone.

1396
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,400
You will do whatever you wish.

1397
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,600
I cannot take this risk.

1398
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,000
I won't break your trust this time.
- But, Rahul..

1399
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,300
And you won't waste your life for me.

1400
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,300
But, Rahul I..
- Aarohi, your failure.

1401
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,300
...will be the biggest
defeat of my life.

1402
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:23,300
I cannot see you
go down the same lane.

1403
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,300
You'll never be Rahul Jayekar.

1404
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,600
Not even for me.

1405
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,600
Promise me.

1406
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,000
Best of luck. Do well.

1407
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,400
I am right here.

1408
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,300
It's here just for you.

1409
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,400
Ma'am we ready for you.

1410
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,900
Lovely Aarohi Shirke.

1411
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,700
Okay?

1412
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,200
Yes I will come.

1413
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,000
See you.

1414
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Rahul Jayekar.

1415
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,100
What's up, buddy? - Nothing much.

1416
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,000
How are you?

1417
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,200
Rocking.

1418
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,600
What are you doing here?

1419
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,400
Watching the show.

1420
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,500
Good to see you.

1421
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,900
You're doing well. - Yeah.

1422
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,300
Rahul!

1423
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,500
Sorry. Beer?

1424
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,900
No, thanks. - Sure?

1425
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,600
Yeah. Quit!

1426
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,400
Pass me a diet coke.

1427
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,000
Diet coke, huh!

1428
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,600
Cheers.

1429
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,600
Cheers.

1430
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,600
Mr. Rahul.

1431
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,800
Kunal Basu, I'm a journalist.

1432
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,000
Okay?

1433
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,700
I want an interview.

1434
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,900
Exclusive interview.

1435
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,300
About your personal life,
etcetera, etcetera.

1436
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,100
Sorry, but I'm no
longer famous enough..

1437
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,200
...for people to read about my life.

1438
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,300
They know it all.

1439
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,000
Not about your love-life.

1440
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,100
I mean, the thing between
you and Ms. Aarohi.

1441
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,900
Few people know about it.

1442
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,300
I don't want to talk
about me and Aarohi.

1443
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,200
You don't understand.

1444
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:27,500
Aarohi's fans want to know
when she's getting married.

1445
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,600
I told you this is
my personal matter..

1446
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,200
...and I don't want to talk about it.

1447
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,800
Your personal life's
public property as well.

1448
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,200
No, it's not.

1449
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,500
Thank you.

1450
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,900
Mr. Rahul.

1451
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,800
You don't know what
people say about you two.

1452
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,600
That's nothing new.

1453
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:57,500
People also say that,
Aarohi used to sing in beer bars.

1454
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,300
And you supported her
just to have some fun.

1455
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,600
You used her.

1456
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:10,100
You made her your
concubine and left her.

1457
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,200
Who do you think you are?
- What are you doing?

1458
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:13,600
You dare hit a journalist.

1459
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,300
Who do you think you are?

1460
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,800
You ruined a girl's life.

1461
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,100
You sleep with that girl.

1462
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,900
You stay with her,
but you can't admit it.

1463
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:26,500
I'll have you arrested. Wait.

1464
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:29,300
You rascal.

1465
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:46,000
<i>9870541084.</i>

1466
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,400
Yes, that's my number.

1467
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,100
Save it. Okay.

1468
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
We're here for him.

1469
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,200
Him.

1470
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,200
Not possible.

1471
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,300
What a man.

1472
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,300
He was drunk.

1473
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:08,400
He created quite a scene.

1474
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,000
He beat-up a journalist.

1475
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,800
Then, he beat-up a taxi-driver.

1476
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,800
He smashed someone's car.

1477
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,900
That's not done.

1478
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:22,500
And what's the time now.

1479
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,800
You won't get bail now.

1480
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:33,500
I'll call Kamte. - Go ahead. Call him.

1481
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:36,700
The court will open at 11 am tomorrow.

1482
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,200
He'll be present in the court first.

1483
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,200
...only then he can get bail.

1484
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,200
He has to stay here tonight.

1485
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,800
Brother.

1486
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:48,000
Can I have a minute? - Sit.

1487
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,100
L.. - I know..

1488
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,000
You're Aarohi Shirke, right.

1489
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,600
Yes.

1490
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,800
Who's he?

1491
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,600
L--

1492
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,800
We're friends.

1493
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:11,200
We had a fight.

1494
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,300
I threatened to leave him.

1495
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,700
That got him worried and..

1496
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,700
Love story.

1497
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,300
Right?

1498
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:34,300
Please, you can keep this.

1499
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,900
What's this? - And let him go. - No.

1500
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,300
And let him go. - What's this? No.

1501
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,000
It won't happen again.

1502
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,400
I promise you, and..

1503
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:57,500
"It's you."

1504
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:04,900
"It's you."

1505
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,800
We'll go far away.

1506
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:45,500
Where no one knows us.

1507
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:53,500
I'll finish the contracts
that I signed, and leave.

1508
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:58,100
Without Rahul, I don't want anything.

1509
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:03,300
I wanted to be successful.

1510
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,800
"But not at this price.

1511
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,700
Not by losing him.

1512
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,800
You don't fall sick
along with the patient.

1513
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,100
Dear.

1514
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,000
If your love was his cure..

1515
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,600
"Then why didn't it work yet?

1516
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,600
He's dependent on his habits.

1517
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,500
His ?aws.

1518
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,800
He doesn't want to get anywhere.

1519
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,900
So, where will you take him?

1520
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,100
Not me.

1521
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:53,200
He'll take me, in his world.

1522
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,200
The place where he
stays day and night.

1523
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,000
And he's happy-

1524
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,900
His habits will be mine.

1525
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,300
His flaws will be mine.

1526
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,400
He cannot leave them, but.

1527
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,100
I can take them up.

1528
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:16,600
If this poison is his first love,
then I'll accept it too.

1529
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:22,000
I'll stagger along with him.

1530
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:33,900
Then, I might find him at some point.

1531
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:37,400
He might get fed up of his habits.

1532
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:43,100
He might come back and say "Aarohi,
I am tired".

1533
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:48,500
Then I'll say "Come..

1534
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,100
...let's go home."

1535
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,200
And, he'll come back.

1536
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:58,000
We'll come back, uncle.

1537
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:05,400
You've gone crazy.

1538
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,000
You don't know what you're saying.

1539
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,400
When did you get up?

1540
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:26,700
You kept crying all night.

1541
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:33,100
My love's made you sad.

1542
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:40,800
I was crying,
because I was missing you.

1543
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:43,100
I am right here.

1544
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,200
Just like that.

1545
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,500
Come closer.

1546
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:06,800
I came here to tell you.

1547
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,400
You can cry all you want.

1548
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:14,000
Your days of crying are over.

1549
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,400
I'll leave everything, Aarohi.

1550
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,500
I'll turn over a new leaf for you.

1551
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,500
Everything will be fine.

1552
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:23,800
You and me.

1553
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,700
You'll help me, won't you?

1554
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,200
Have I ever said no? - No.

1555
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,700
The day I saw you first, I realized..

1556
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,700
...why you came in my life.

1557
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,500
You've loved me a lot.

1558
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,300
Given me a lot of things.

1559
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:52,800
I gave you what was easy for me.

1560
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:57,400
You endured my difficulties,
my betrayal.

1561
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:00,700
Divided love.

1562
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,300
And I couldn't give
you your right place.

1563
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,600
But all that's going to change now.

1564
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:10,700
Right now. From this moment.

1565
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,600
Because Aarohi,
I am going to join a gym.

1566
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,800
That's going to be my daily program.

1567
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:19,700
Gym in the morning,
jogging in the evening.

1568
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:21,500
Proper diet. Aarohi.

1569
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:22,900
Really?

1570
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,400
Will you really.. - Yes.

1571
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:27,600
This time I am serious, Aarohi.

1572
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,600
Like I never was.

1573
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:32,700
<i>L</i> am going.

1574
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,900
Keep the food ready, and wait for me.

1575
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,500
Miss me.

1576
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,100
Rahul.

1577
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:52,300
I love you.

1578
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:56,300
Come on.

1579
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,600
I'll change all this.

1580
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:11,900
Aarohi.

1581
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,700
What?

1582
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,900
Nothing.

1583
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:21,300
Just like that.

1584
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:28,500
"Forget me. This is my final goodbye."

1585
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,200
"You've to live on.. without me.

1586
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:43,200
"This is your journey, your path."

1587
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:50,000
"You've to live on.. without me.

1588
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:57,500
"I pray you attain fame."

1589
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:05,000
"I pray you're blessed
with all the grace."

1590
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:11,900
"You've to live on.. without me.

1591
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:19,600
"Forget me. This is my final goodbye."

1592
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:27,800
"You've to live on.. without me.

1593
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:31,600
"You're my shore, my support"

1594
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:35,500
"You're the tune in my heart
my saga."

1595
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:42,800
"Be your own God."

1596
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:46,800
"I am like evening that's fading."

1597
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:50,600
"You're the new dawn."

1598
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:57,500
"You've to live on.. without me.

1599
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:04,300
"You've to live on.. without me.

1600
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:28,600
SIR EK BODY PANI ME SE NIKALA HAI.

1603
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,700
Aarohi where are you going?

1604
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:00,300
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

1605
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:03,800
Aarohi don't

1606
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:06,000
Aarohi - where are you going.

1607
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:38,200
Coward!

1608
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Coward!

1609
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,100
Coward!

1610
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:00,200
Coward! Coward! Coward!

1611
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,400
Coward!

1612
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,300
Coward!

1613
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:10,700
"It's you."

1614
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:21,100
"It's you."

1615
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:40,000
Where are you going?

1616
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,200
Anywhere?

1617
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,100
What do you mean?

1618
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:50,900
I mean far away.

1619
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,500
I'm leaving everything.

1620
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,100
But, that's not what Rahul wanted?

1621
02:05:57,900 --> 02:05:59,200
Rahul who?

1622
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,100
I don't know any person by that name.

1623
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:07,300
Aarohi, decisions taken in a rage,
always hum in the end.

1624
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:13,000
For the first time,
my decision hasn't hum me.

1625
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,600
Good.

1626
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,700
Very good.

1627
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,300
Please go.

1628
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:21,800
He should fade away.

1629
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:24,200
Die inside you.

1630
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,700
He was worth that.

1631
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:34,300
I tried stopping him.

1632
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,100
But he didn't stop.

1633
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,900
He said..

1634
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:42,700
"This is it".

1635
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:47,900
He sold your an, like your secretary.

1636
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,800
The little life that he had,
was just for you.

1637
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:57,200
But my friend died,
the day he hum you.

1638
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,500
The day he raised his hand on you.

1639
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,400
The day he saw you
at the police station.

1640
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,900
He knew.

1641
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,800
Drinking was his weakness.

1642
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,200
He had become your weakness.

1643
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:17,200
The biggest obstruction in your path.

1644
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,500
And so, he gave his life.

1645
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:25,400
So that you can live.

1646
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:27,900
So that,
you don't become another Jayekar.

1647
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:31,000
