1
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:36,918


2
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,681
Get up Zack.

3
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,379
Come on, I don't wanna be late from work.

4
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,494
- Get out!
- Jesus, why not close

5
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:23,354
the fucking door if
you're gonna take a shit?

6
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,795
- It was closed!
- No, it was closed over, it was not closed.

7
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,887
- Shut the fucking door!
- Okay, okay.

8
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,626
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.

9
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,214
We're going now.

10
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,940
Do you smell that? Is that the car?

11
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:15,057
- Oh, God.
- What?

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,219
- Oh, no.
- What?

13
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,106
- What?
- It's stuck in my balls.

14
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:23,502
What's happening?

15
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,000
- Pull over, pull over.
- Okay, alright!

16
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,435
Oh fuck.

17
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,095
I think I burned my ball hair off.

18
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,416
It's not funny.

19
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,492
Can you help me pick out
an outfit for tonight?

20
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,945
I'm working till six.

21
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:30,251
Well, I can try stuff on at the store.

22
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,322
The store? No, how about instead
you get a friend?

23
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,802
But you are my friend.
- I meant a girl friend.

24
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:23,472
- Can you work for me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

25
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,357
- Then you must come in the
next day, I tell you.

26
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,922
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?

27
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,763
It's the biggest mall shopping
day of the year.

28
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:36,442
And since the mall is just up in the
street, I would like you to come and work.

29
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,303
- On Black Friday?
- Oh yeah.

30
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,324
- And we work on Movie Monday too?
- Sorry?

31
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,236
How about "Nigger Tuesday"?

32
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,620
Nigger Tuesday?
Is this a new day holiday?

33
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,113
You come to brother and tell
him he gotta work on Black Friday

34
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,260
You got any idea how
racist that sounds?

35
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,726
Telling me to come here and work,
what do you think you own me?

36
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,810
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?

37
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,379
You thought to yourself: Oh I'm gonna for
this nigger, cause I put food on his table

38
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:03,714
and clothes on his little nigger baby
backs and he ain't gonna say shit.

39
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:05,686
- To say I'm a star.
- You shut up.

40
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,245
You're God damn right to say I'm a star.

41
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,869
Can't wait until the post office settle my disability
suit, cause Deann I will be out this mother fucker.

42
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:17,451
- You can kiss my ass.
- You know what? Fuck you, fuck you and suck cock.

43
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,533
The hell with you.
- The hell with you.

44
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,770
- Zack, my boy.
- Yeah?

45
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:32,428
A customer with a hair lip speak me say you've
been watching baseball here the other night.

46
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,235
Football.
And no, that wasn't me.

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,280
Maybe the hair lip makes
it sound like baseball.

48
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,513
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you
hear it with an accent.

49
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,079
Fuck you, okay?
One day I'm gonna put a camera there

50
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:48,345
and I can tell, I know, everything
you do when I'm gone.

51
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,839
Everything. Scratch your balls, take a shit.
Everything, I tell you. Okay?

52
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:54,941
Fucker.

53
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,479
I hear both of you mother
fuckers, I tell you.

54
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,323
- Why is he so fucking ice trunk?
- Fuck off, I tell you.

55
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,746
Very good, hmm?

56
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,000
Ghandi mother fucker telling me I gotta work
on Black Friday, and do some shit.

57
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:14,376
Like I don't wanna do some shopping too.
Biggest sales day of the year.

58
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,687
I'm getting me a flat screen TV,
you couldn't believe that.

59
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,834
That is actually my fault, I should tell
you. I asked for Friday morning off, so..

60
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,072
- Sorry about that.
- For what?

61
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,567
I actually just need
a lot of recovery time.

62
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,115
Tonight is me and Miri's ten-year-high
school reunion

63
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,673
I'm just gonna get fucking
alcohol poisoning.

64
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:29,985
- Reunion?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,161
- Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
- I know, isn't that fucked up when they do that?

66
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,433
Like, they say it is the
best chance to get everyone together.

67
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,893
People come back to the town for holidays..

68
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:40,680
But you know what? They can have it in the
middle of the summer at a fucking blow job contest

69
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,349
that I was judging,
and it would still be retarded.

70
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,929
- So why are you going there?
- Miri is making me go.

71
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:50,519
Listen to him, why are you always bend over backwards
for the girl, knowing she ain't getting annoyance.

72
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,582
We got a good thing going, man.

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,540
She pays out the rent, she does the dishes
she wakes me up in the morning.

74
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,397
Why complicate that with sex?

75
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,129
Besides man,
I've know her since the first grade.

76
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,100
You don't fuck someone you've met
in the first grade.

77
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,391
Excuse me, I've met my wife
in kinder garden

78
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,205
We got married in Senior year and she
has been the queen of my world ever since.

79
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:11,578
- But what if you could do it all over again?
- I would jerk off and live by myself.

80
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,842
- That woman is the ban of my existence.
- See!

81
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,408
Excuse me, can I get a cup of coffee?

82
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,364
- Black.
- Can't you see we're talking, White?

83
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,843
If you're gonna continue to emasculate me
with this barbie dress up shit

84
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:30,279
- I'm using your laptop.
- Don't forget to smack it when you turn it on

85
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,559
otherwise the screen doesn't come on.

86
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,155
- Why don't you spring get a new one of these?
- Same reason I don't spring for clothes

87
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,128
for tonight: I'm broke.

88
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,741
There's a chick who works at Teen Juice
at the mall, you know

89
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:45,285
And I gave her a good deal in Yearn's so
she's letting me borrow this stuff for tonight.

90
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:49,133
What?

91
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,487
A vibrator online.

92
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,241
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.

93
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,764
Look at the size of those fucking panties.

94
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,823
Shoot that shit, shoot it.

95
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,192
Who even knew Amazon sold
shit like this. This is incredible!

96
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,952
Those are fucking granny panties.

97
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,582
Okay, A: I don't appreciate you violating
the sanctity of my Amazon wish list page

98
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:13,599
And B: I'm not buying that thing on Amazon,
because turns out the over credit card they take

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,071
Oh shit.

100
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:24,158
I'm sorry guys, am I in the way?

101
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,021
You're fucking fagot alright.
Let's go to Starbucks.

102
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,632
And he throws like a bitch.

103
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,053
You know what else I throw: my nuts sacking
your coffees, so how does that taste fucker?

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,068
We saw your girl friend
in her under wear.

105
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,969
Well, too bad she's not my girl friend
you little fucker..

106
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:47,539
Are you still talking to me?

107
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,488
Just said I'm gonna look up
more fuck toys on Amazon.

108
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:56,299
Holy shit, at least they have
a flash light here too.

109
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:59,633
- What's that?
- It's a fucking pocket pussy

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,795
That is shaped like a flash light for
discretionary jacking off.

111
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,564
That when you get caught no-one thinks it's weird,
you're just a guy who likes to fuck his flash light.

112
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,956
- I'm totally buying this shit.
- Wow, if you got money to burn..

113
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,102
How about paying the electric bill?

114
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,219
- It's due already?
- Well, November's probably but I was talking about September's.

115
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,038
Tell me, this doesn't rock.

116
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,734
Kinda look like you're fucking Ronald
McDonald. That makes me want some McNuggets.

117
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:27,637
Why would you wanna buy a pocket
pussy anyway? That is so sad.

118
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:33,000
What? Excuse me, I forgot about the nobility
that a company is coming with a fucking vibrator.

119
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:40,481
Real, seal, action.. Oh my God, if you start
fucking little machines

120
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:41,874
I'm moving out.

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,834
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a little machine.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How come you get to fuck something with
a motor in it, and I can't?

123
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,883
Cause I've never met a man who can make

124
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:48,879
me come like a vibrator does.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,557
That is fucking bullshit.

126
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,551
...ball of jerkings in the bathroom?

127
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:01,428
Holy Jesus, you do not use
my jerkings to jack in our bathroom.

128
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:04,360
No you know what I do actually,
is I light bunch of candles

129
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,954
And I sprawl out on my sheets
and I listen to Sting.

130
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:12,246
Now I'm a guy.. Give me two popsicle sticks
and a rubber band, I'll find a way to fuck it

131
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,566
Like a filthy McGyver.
- Oh my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.

132
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:21,059
- How about this?
- I don't get why you're putting so much effort in this thing anyway?

133
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,640
I thought we were like, just gonna go sit
around and make fun of everybody.

134
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,266
Well, I can't wear anything that I've already
on and expect to bring home Bobby Long.

135
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:35,804
Bobby fucking Long? No way!
Didn't that guy call you Stinky Linky?

136
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:39,804
Yeah that was then, okay? Maybe now
he can save me a fortune in Amazon bills.

137
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,792
Maybe you can fuck our landlord, so we can
at least keep roof over our heads.

138
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:49,546
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.

139
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:53,837
Hey, I bought skates with last week's
pay check and I need those, to skate with.

140
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,529
And this week's I'll barely cover
the past two water bills so..

141
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,535
Is this sexy?

142
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:04,389
Yeah, in like to a catch a predator
kind of way it is pretty fucking sexy.

143
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,941
Then we're done.

144
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:10,654
Zack.

145
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,241
You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?

146
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:19,471
They shut it off.
- Oh shit, just..

147
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:23,844
Help me get this shit out off my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.

148
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:28,655
There's poo in there.

149
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,126
Not that part!
The back part of the toilet thing.

150
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:36,158
Take that cup there and then put in, there you
go. Here I'll just lean back if you could just

151
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,897
You know, pour it down like that.

152
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:43,045
Don't look, don't look.

153
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,988
Alright, one hour tops and then we're gone.

154
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,327
Or I had an idea, we could
just not go at all, which would rock.

155
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,927
Look, even though we're broke and we've never gone to
anything, we're still better than these people, right?

156
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:14,476
No, not at all. We're probably not even as good as most
of them, unless one of them is crackhead or something.

157
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,871
Just tell me I'm prettier
than when we graduated.

158
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:22,423
You look about the same.
Definitely not prettier.

159
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,933
But around the same.
I'm thinner though right, little?

160
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,426
Not really.

161
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:31,181
Well, good pep talk. Fuck!

162
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,262
- Tadaa!
- Tadaa.

163
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:50,660
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- No, sorry.

164
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,488
Zack Brown and Miri Linky.

165
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:56,355
- Are you the one they called Stinky Linky?
- Oh no, no-one ever called me that.

166
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,108
Oh great, what does yours say?

167
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,443
- What the fuck?! Come on,
I'm sure I had a nickname.

168
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,144
- Nothing?
- Alright, well you guys have a great time.

169
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:08,826
And before you go, don't
forget your copy of the Roving Roe-Ver.

170
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,841
- What the fuck is this shit?
- That is not shit.

171
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,016
That would be our bimonthly newsletter.

172
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,007
You know, it updates you on what
everyone's doing in their lives.

173
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,588
- Finally!
- I love your enthusiasm.

174
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,675
Here you go, write your e-mail
address down on that

175
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,719
and I'll be sure to add you to our
800-hundred-member strong mailing list.

176
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,837
We had 800 people in our graduating class?

177
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,280
Yes, and only 250 RSVP.

178
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,006
- Doesn't that suck, Mary?
- Miri.

179
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,953
- Are you married, Beths?
- I am. Two kids.

180
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,808
- Wow, that's beautiful.
- Awesome.

181
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,638
Wanna fuck me later?

182
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,841
- Oh no, I'm married.
- OK, cool.

183
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,250
Well, if you change your mind
I'll be there getting shit face.

184
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,452
Just so you know, I eat the pussy.

185
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:49,980
Tempting.. Again, no.

186
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:51,603
- Show we?
- Sir.

187
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:52,967
Bye Beths.

188
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:54,997
Think about it.

189
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,675
I love your pussy.

190
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,574
Can I get two beers, please?

191
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,430
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

192
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:47,888
Three beers.

193
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:49,831
Thank you.

194
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,455
Is that Zack?

195
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:55,035
Or am I Zack?

196
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:00,195
Never gets old, huh?

197
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,096
- The other Zack.
- In my world nobody calls me the other Zack.

198
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,582
Now that this guy is
not around anymore, huh?

199
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,823
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.

200
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:16,403
- What?
- Do not you remember?

201
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:20,259
Remember? I yelled at you when we passed
each other at the hall way.

202
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,781
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome, awesome.

203
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:25,826
- Awesome. God! You guys have so much
to catch up on.

204
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,647
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Bitch.

205
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:37,191
See that big blow up
picture they have of me?

206
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:42,270
My hair is terrible. I can't
believe I wore my hair like that.

207
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,778
It's before I knew about styling products.

208
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,277
Makes a big difference in life.

209
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,380
You live and learn though, right? I mean, ten years
ago. It's before we knew anything about fashion.

210
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,868
Back in the day. Or hairstyle.

211
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,493
Hey, stranger.

212
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,455
- Whoah, Stinky Linky?
- Yeah.

213
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:09,974
Although, it's just Miri now.
- Give me a hug.

214
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,091
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,209
Wow.

216
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:18,614
- How have you been?
- Great, great.

217
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:20,152
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.

218
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,638
Wow, that is not something that you
would've said to me ten years ago.

219
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:25,871
Well, I've grown up.

220
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:30,306
Yes. Yes you have. You just look..

221
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,307
Listen to you.. Thank you.

222
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,279
No don't thank me, just fuck me.

223
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:53,903
Roxanne.

224
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,806
Someone I like, what are the odds, huh?

225
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,685
Zack Brown, we had four
years Spanish together.

226
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,891
Why does no-one recognize me?
Am I thinner, is that it?

227
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,545
Look at him.

228
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,588
- Who?
- My stupid husband.

229
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:13,575
No fucking shit! John Butterfield, you
actually married John Butterfield!

230
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,763
- That's amazing!
- Don't ever get married, it sucks.

231
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:20,675
You stop appreciating each other and you
runs us up to talk about it first year.

232
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:25,025
But look at him now.
Flirting up with that

233
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,490
cheerleader named Monica Vahn.

234
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:31,838
You want me to maybe flirt with
you so he can see? Even it up a bit?

235
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,467
I don't wanna get even.

236
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,006
If I was gonna do anything I wanna wine up
the asshole.

237
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,697
You can give me a hand job
in the girls' locker room.

238
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:48,656
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck yeah!

239
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:50,976
Are you staying in town for a while?

240
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,616
Just tonight. I fly back to L.A. tomorrow.

241
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:57,623
Wow, Los Angeles! Gosh, Bobby Long.

242
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,682
Coming up in the world.
With Mrs. Long, I bet.

243
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:04,988
No, No, no,
No Mrs. Long for me.

244
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:08,792
- Can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

245
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,442
I think I need a drink.
Do you need a drink?

246
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,125
Cause I need a drink to say this.

247
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,589
- I've got a beer already so..
- Oh great, thank you.

248
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,098
I think there's a cigarette butt in there.

249
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,378
Yup.

250
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:29,451
Sorry about the elbow.

251
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:35,314
I can be only one.

252
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,749
A beer, please.

253
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:43,605
Thank you very much.

254
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,857
Oh Jesus Christ, my friend is making a total
ass of herself ending her old high school crush.

255
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,264
Oh God, that's so sad.

256
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,728
It's so Miri, that's what it is.
I'm Zack by the way.

257
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,875
Brandon.

258
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,807
Oh don't worry we weren't
at the same class or anything.

259
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:05,007
Okay, lucky you.

260
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:09,482
- Oh, you went Rover?
- Well, I went here. Let's just leave it at that, I guess.

261
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,368
- Do you have one of the large flown pictures of yourself hanging around here?
- I do.

262
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,948
Kind of, right there.

263
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,211
- Gorgeous.
- Good times.

264
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,473
What do you do? What brings you here?

265
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,430
Oh, I came with somebody who
went school here. Bobby Long.

266
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,735
No shit! That's who my friend is
hitting on right now! See, right there.

267
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,888
- Really?
- There the one dressed up like Hannah Montana.

268
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,181
In L.A. we call that look deglodion chŽek.

269
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,797
- L.A.? Los Angeles?
- California.

270
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,972
That's awesome man.
What do you do out there?

271
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,770
I'm an actor.

272
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,654
- Wow, that's really impressive.
- Thank you, thank you.

273
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:47,699
- And fucking movies?
- Fucking movies, pretty much.

274
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,298
Look at you.
What, anything I've seen?

275
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,140
- What movies?
- Oh, all sorts of movies with all male cast.

276
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,069
All male cast.
Like Glenn Gary and Ross?

277
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:03,415
Like "Glenn and Gary suck Ross' midi cock
and drop their hairy nuts in his eager mouth".

278
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,418
- Like a seakwell?
- Sort off.

279
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:12,981
It is a re-imagining.
- Ah, like the whiz.

280
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:16,954
More erotic and with less women.

281
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,800
No women, to be exact.

282
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:25,688
I apologize in advance
if I'm out of line here,

283
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,355
But are you in gay porn?

284
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,788
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?

285
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,225
I thought you recognized
me at first, that's why..

286
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:36,268
- Oh, okay I get it.
- You're not my demographic so I'm not insulted.

287
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,642
- Not really. Who is your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?

288
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,628
- I do.
- Then not you.

289
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:47,122
I came here tonight hoping to seduce you

290
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,760
and bring back to my apartment and sleep
with you

291
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:54,765
to get back at you for calling me Stinky
Linky all those years ago.

292
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:59,084
Wow, that is a weird revenge flat.

293
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:04,526
- You must be a terrible lay for that..
- What? No, I'm great. I mean I've had enough practice and everything..

294
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,635
Wow, that sounded not good.

295
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:12,208
I fuck a lot. That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either. Wow.

296
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,181
You're a lot funnier than I remembered.

297
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:20,012
Thank you. Gosh, you turned
out to be such a nice guy.

298
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:26,627
Wow, it's just.. you know,
it makes even easier to just say this..

299
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,845
Would you like to come back to my place and
maybe open a bottle of wine and..

300
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,714
have ourselves a high school reunion?
- I..

301
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:37,787
- Hello Miriam.
- Beat it, we're talking.

302
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:41,006
- I just wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.

303
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,094
Bobby's boyfriend.

304
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,864
- Bobby who?
- Bobby me.

305
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:46,691
Bobby Long.

306
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,343
Brandon is the star of such adult fair..
What was that one called again?

307
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,991
"You'd better shut your mouth
or I'm gonna fuck it"

308
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,601
That's right. I'm surprised I forgot that.

309
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:02,340
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, they are fucking with each other.

310
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,615
Oh my God.

311
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:08,081
- No!
- What?

312
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,880
- Granny Panties?
- Excuse me?

313
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:14,200
- How can you tell?
- This is so crazy.

314
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:17,882
I was literally just watching you like right
before we got here. This is so crazy.

315
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:21,308
This is you, right?
- My name's Granny Panties and

316
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,511
nobody wants to fuck me.

317
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:26,613
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass.

318
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:30,760
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I entered gay and ass, and it was the top hit.

319
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,544
It's had 200 thousand views in three hours.

320
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:36,933
Honey, you are like.. I'm actually jealous right
now, cause you are like super famous.

321
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,805
Baby, please take our picture.

322
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:43,312
I need a picture with Granny Panties.
This is awesome.

323
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,197
Alright, smile.

324
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,403
Did you get it? Oh thank you, baby.

325
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,101
- E-mail me that.
- Yeah, cause he's the worst photographer.

326
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:51,581
Okay, good.

327
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:53,379
- You're gay?
- Yeah.

328
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,860
And I'm on the internet wearing.. a diaper?

329
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,699
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh
and meet a celebrity?

330
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,440
- I'm gonna drink now till I pass out.
- Okay.

331
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,830
She'll be fine. So you guys
suck each other's cocks?

332
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:08,686
Oh, like crazy.

333
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:13,146
- Okay, that's enough.
- Oh, I'm embarrassing him.

334
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,074
I love when he gets embarrassed. He's not
living out loud you know, so he gets all like..

335
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:20,143
- You guys are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zackhary, we are.

336
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:24,695
Oh god, I just want..
I just wanna eat him up.

337
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,029
I can't keep my hands off him.

338
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,281
You know what, although he does most of
the eating in the sack, if you know what I mean

339
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,934
- In the sack and off the sack.
- Alright, that's enough. Look, you've drank too much.

340
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:37,674
You do this every time.
You can't contain yourself.

341
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:43,592
Oh, I'm sorry. And by containing myself,
you mean containing myself in the closet?

342
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,014
In the closet of denial?
Is that..? No, no, no.

343
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:50,551
- Oh shit, this is real.
- No, but this is exactly why you haven't

344
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:53,363
met my mother. Because you don't know how to
ease people into this situation.

345
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:55,794
- Baby.
- .. just force your way in, every time.

346
00:23:56,372 --> 00:24:00,343
Baby, I thought maybe for one second in
this town I could be myself.

347
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:04,692
I'm so sorry. No, you're right.. I should just
butch up and pretend that I don't love it

348
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,737
When you shove your dick in my mouth.

349
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:11,192
This is the best night of my life.

350
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,686
Am I making a spectacle, cause I could make a much bigger scene.
- Really are

351
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,114
I'm sorry. Pittsburgh, listen up Man-Rovers..
My name is

352
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:22,130
- Brandon St. Randy and I love Bobby Long.
- Fucking A!

353
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:25,577
Is that enough for you? Is that enough for a scene?
Cause I could start do a lot worst than that

354
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,536
And the reason, the reason you
haven't taken me to your mother's.

355
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,173
Your mother with a make-up and all her drinking

356
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,030
She's in the closet, too.

357
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:36,211
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought, I could be a conduit for you.

358
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,448
- Thank you.
- Are you being sarcastic?

359
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:41,522
- No, I'm not. Thank you.
- I love you.

360
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,634
- I'll e-mail you, Brandon.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.

361
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,995
And I will be patient with you,
I will be there on your journey.

362
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:53,332
I will be your ship up
the mountain of gayness.

363
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,349
Well, about to see what
Granny Panties is up to, huh?

364
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:29,625
Do you hear that?

365
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,949
What kind of evil fucks turn off your
power the day..

366
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,963
No, the night before Thanksgiving.

367
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:49,780
- Who does that?
- Can you get advance on your credit card?

368
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:54,842
Flash light. Back stab my 200-dollar women.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.

369
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:58,872
This is bad. If we don't come up some rent
we're gonna be locked out the apartment.

370
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:01,567
So, who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.

371
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,526
Which means, by the time we get home,
there's no heat either.

372
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,729
Well, I think it's time we put what we
always talked about into effect.

373
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,382
You're gonna have to start hooking.

374
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:15,195
You know, these are the exact circumstances
people find themselves in

375
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:18,295
right before they start having sex
for money.

376
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,877
Or making porn.

377
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,776
Sexy.

378
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,558
- Oh my God, yeah.
- What? You got an idea?

379
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,905
We could make a porno.

380
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,790
Not the idea I was looking for.
- What? No, yeah that is a fucking awesome idea.

381
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:45,052
Are you shitting me? That's a great idea.

382
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,981
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's Bobby Long's
awesome nice boyfriend

383
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:53,458
He said he makes a hundred grand a year, because
he shoots and distributes his own porno films.

384
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,502
If it's so easy, how come
everybody doesn't do it?

385
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,895
Because other people have
options and dignity. Which we do not have.

386
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,679
Which puts us in amazingly
adventitious position.

387
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:05,695
Fuck you, I have dignity.
- Where?

388
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,422
Is it hidden in your gigantic under pants
that are blasted all over the internet?

389
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:12,190
- Is that were you hide your dignity?
- Every woman has a pair of those period panties.

390
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:15,414
That's like a fact.
- OK, families.

391
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,166
I bet most people don't make porno,
because they have families.

392
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,096
But luckily, your parents are dead

393
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:23,850
Sorry. My grandparents are dead.
- Sorry.

394
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:26,604
Thank you.
So who we're gonna disappoint?

395
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:31,329
Porn has gone main stream now, it's like
Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks in it.

396
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:35,197
Look at Paris Hilton.

397
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:39,065
Now she's selling fragrances to Tween's.
And I'm pretty sure she's legally retarded.

398
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:42,545
- Tween's?
- Have you seen that Jul Francis guy who made Girl Gone Wild?

399
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:48,406
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot piece of shit
in the world, and he has a jet and a fucking island.

400
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:52,900
Look, there's gotta be a less extreme
solution to our financial whoas here.

401
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:56,478
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper out.

402
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,428
- I don't have bike.
- You could be a waiter.

403
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,658
No-one wants me around their food.

404
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,936
- Would you eat food that I gave you?
- Not if you gave me it, that's true.

405
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,111
Nobody wants so see us fuck, Zack.
- Everybody wants to see anybody fuck

406
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,502
I hate Rosie O'Donnell, but if someone said

407
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:16,373
"I got a tape of Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid", I
would be like why the fuck aren't we watching that right now?

408
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,910
- Cause she's famous, hello?
- So are you, you're fucking granny panties.

409
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:23,912
My underwear and your ass are famous, we're not.

410
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:27,768
- So who the f would want to watch us fuck?
- At least 800 people.

411
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,397
You jerk went to school?
Are you serious?

412
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:33,063
Of course, I'm serious. If you heard
this one we graduated with

413
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:35,618
Was in a fucking porno movie,
you watch it, right?

414
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,850
I'd watch the Brandon guy suck
a cock. I just met him.

415
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:40,785
With this mailing list, we have
almost a thousand people

416
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:43,364
That would definitely buy a porno we arranged, just to be like
"hey, I sit next to that guy in Civic's. Look at his fucking dick!"

417
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:50,757
We sold a thousand copies at 25 bucks
a pop. Bam! We have payed off our bills.

418
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:55,810
- So, what do you think?
- Nah, I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.

419
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:59,377
Oh, wow. Like you've never
done that before.

420
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:02,103
How many guys have you met in a bar,
taken home.. Banged..

421
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:05,725
with your mouth and then
never talked to again?

422
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:11,138
- That's what we call a stranger.
- Dude, I don't one night mouth fuck anybody that I pick up in bars.

423
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay, fine. You don't wanna fuck a
stranger in porno movie

424
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,695
For some weird reason..

425
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,218
I guess..

426
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,508
- We could fuck.
- Yuck.

427
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:28,001
- Fuck you.
- I mean, you're nice enough looking guy and everything..

428
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:31,217
Holy fuck, thank you. You're old
enough looking girl. How does that feel?

429
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:35,739
Dude, I'm just saying it would be weird and
wrong, you know, like fucking my brother.

430
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:38,755
Ok, seriously. We're just
talking about sex, okay?

431
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,741
And it's for a purpose,
if we're getting rich.

432
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,581
Only my dick and your pussy
would be doing something weird.

433
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,047
Our bodies and brains
would be acting.

434
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,188
And you just explain to your
private before hand.

435
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:53,324
Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash.

436
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:55,730
- Oh my God.
- What?

437
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:59,875
You're just doing this, cause you've
always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?

438
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:05,469
Yes, I've gone my whole life pretending
that I want nothing to do with you.

439
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:08,716
Just hoping, one day we'd be in such
dinar financial straight

440
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:12,775
So I could use it to
finally make my move on you.

441
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:20,373
- You're just being sarcastic.
- I am. See, I was pretending cry right there.

442
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:24,809
I guess it's not
gonna be like creepy.

443
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:29,358
Like if we just got way too drunk
one night and accidentally fucked.

444
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,925
No. We would be going in with the
understanding that it's..

445
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,185
- A business decision.
- Strictly a business decision.

446
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:37,180
It's a means to an end.

447
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:38,341
Right.

448
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,718
And by end, I mean I'll
be waxing your ass.

449
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:44,080
Oh fuck you! I'm not even
letting you see my ass.

450
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,473
I've seen your ass and the rest of you
naked around a billion times already.

451
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:49,908
Well, that goes both ways, buddy.

452
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:52,575
You've never seen my dick. Have you
seen my dick? You've never seen my dick.

453
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:57,437
Are you kidding! That part when
we went to, where you got blasted

454
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:01,468
And then we all watched you
try for like an hour.

455
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:05,323
Thanks by the way for fucking
letting me do that, thank you.

456
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,395
Oh God, we really do know
too much about each other.

457
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,033
This would really just
be one more thing.

458
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:15,353
I mean, look at us, it's Thanksgiving
we're hulling around flaming

459
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,976
Fucking garbage can like
a couple of steno bums.

460
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:24,369
I mean, this could give us chance to pay off our debt, pay our
bills, get a fucking nice apartment with a heat in it maybe.

461
00:31:28,998 --> 00:31:30,158
What is wrong?

462
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:36,388
Miriam Linky, will you have
sex with me on camera for money?

463
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:44,989
I will.

464
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,577
Who's the producer?

465
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:50,186
He's the guy who gets
to finance the movie.

466
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:51,896
Hell, what made you think I got
that kind of money?

467
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:54,178
We just need that. We just need
what you're about to spend on the flat screen.

468
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,561
And I can't get my flat screen! Fuck that.

469
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,051
No, no, no, no. Dude, with your kind
of profits, you can get two flat screens

470
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,573
you have one in your living room,
and one in your bath room.

471
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:04,162
One in the bath room?

472
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,054
That has always been my dream..
Watched it while I shit.

473
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,663
Everyone with an ass loves
to watch it while they shit.

474
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:13,273
- I'm gonna make that happen for you, man.
- I don't know, man.

475
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,678
What else does the producer do?

476
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:18,230
They help with the casting.

477
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,839
- What's casting?
- It's finding the people to be in the movie.

478
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:22,781
- Oh, so I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.

479
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:26,229
Like I can look at the titties
and make sure there ain't no moles on them?

480
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,020
- You can look both titties, man.
- Oh man..

481
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:32,789
I'm looking at the same busted
titties for the past almost 20 years.

482
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:36,653
- I'm due for another new tittie.
- Please, help us.

483
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:44,362
Yes! Yes, I love you.

484
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:48,886
Well, don't mind that smell.

485
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:52,687
But we had some homeless people
squatting in here. You know what,

486
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,689
they would avoid their balls
everywhere but the bathroom.

487
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,036
Anyway, you pick up the poop
and you got yourself a movie studio.

488
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,705
Or we could just shoot this thing
in your apartment?

489
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,995
No power. You wanna
pay the electric bill?

490
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:06,088
- You mother fuckers.
- We'll take it.

491
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,153
Come on, come on, come on.

492
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,956
Oh Jesus.

493
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:17,824
Come on.

494
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:22,502
Why the fuck do
I have to do everything?

495
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:30,566
Fucking God..

496
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,659
They fucking suck.

497
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:36,776
I'm gonna hate fuck
the shit out of you Reff.

498
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,781
- Dude.
- It's cool. He's my cousin.

499
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,620
Didn't you use to video tape the varsity
basketball games in high school, or something?

500
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:49,765
Just the away games. I did it,
cause I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.

501
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:53,736
- Which one?
- Every one who wanted to fuck a guy who taped the varsity games.

502
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:58,031
You still have your video camera?

503
00:33:58,442 --> 00:34:01,052
Who cares what the title is?

504
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,097
The porn I liked, when I was a kid, it was always like
a spoof of a popular movie. Like.. Edward Penis Hands.

505
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:13,569
- Okay, so we need a mildly clever dirty title, that sounds like
a real movie and will basically sum up what you're gonna say.

506
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,288
- "An American Werewolf and Brenda"
- "Fuck Back Mountain"

507
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:21,104
Too soon?

508
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,896
Next.

509
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:27,782
- Jerk my crayon
and let me color your white.

510
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:30,247
I need talking,
I need it now.

511
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:33,871
- I'm fucking you in the puss.
- I'm fucking you in the puss..

512
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:38,219
- It's puss as in pussy.
- Oh, because I was like..

513
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:40,672
Who would wanna fuck puss.

514
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:45,122
I want to slam my ham in
your canvaman. Scene.

515
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:50,262
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy is great looking too.

516
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:56,561
Hi, My name is Delaney and I'm
a producer, if you know what I mean.

517
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,965
Let's be honest, my first time.
You don't have to worry..

518
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:04,008
- I'm gonna touch you, nothing like that.
- Alright.

519
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:10,277
I have a wife, we're happy..
We're not happy but it's cool.

520
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:16,363
Just so you know, there will be some fucking but
uh.. We'll talk about that if you get the part.

521
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,973
- Okay.
- I mean, not we won't be fucking.

522
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,600
There will be fucking in the movie. Like I said I got
a wife and she don't play that shit. She's crazy bitch.

523
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:31,059
- Yup.
- It's my job as the producer to see what you got.

524
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:36,167
So.. To make sure you're
comfortable in any way.

525
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:40,371
You don't have to show me anything
you don't wanna show me, cause..

526
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:44,426
I love the movies.

527
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,006
- "Lawrence of a Labia"
- No.

528
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:50,369
- "Dawn of the Dick"
- Yeah, but how are zombies

529
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:54,108
doing it all sexy.
- I want to eat your brain

530
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,515
and your ass.

531
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,052
- Dude..
- Scifi, yeah!

532
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:03,589
Closing counters with
a turk from behind.

533
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,275
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses. Fucking keeping asses.

534
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:14,087
- What?
- We're making a porno

535
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,491
And we just need to know what you would
be or would not be interested in doing.

536
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,598
- If anything..
- No anal.

537
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,467
- Oh, definitely not anal.
- Anal and hugging.

538
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,961
- I don't do ass stuff.
- Anal.

539
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:28,904
Oh fuck.

540
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:31,370
Oh wait oral,
I like anal.

541
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:35,027
Okay, so do you have
any special skills?

542
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,207
Special skills?

543
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:40,774
I can get balling really quick,
and it sticks straight up.

544
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,933
- Is that really special skills?
- I think it is. Can you show us what you mean?

545
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,672
Sure.

546
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:55,412
Oh, that is special.

547
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,716
Yeah, you're hired.
Mr.. Who are you again?

548
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:00,979
Lester, Lester the Molester
Cocking Stuff.

549
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,582
Wow, that is the best porn
name I've ever heard, man.

550
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,278
I can have a porn name?

551
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,418
Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.

552
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:14,056
Are you Granny Panties?

553
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:15,947
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

554
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,615
The Granny Panties are
actually in the house, I'll get them.

555
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:21,432
"Star Sex II"
~ N3krA ~

556
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,114
We never made our "Star Sex I".

557
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,416
I guess we'll lose the "Star Sex III"
"The Search For Cock" then.

558
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,306
- Cock-ant
- What's that?

559
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,597
It's cuckoon with a cant.

560
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,236
So, Delaney told us you have
a special talent of some sort.

561
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:38,251
I don't know if I
call it a special talent,

562
00:37:38,627 --> 00:37:42,861
but it's a little something
I picked up during bachelor parties.

563
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,999
- It would probably be easier if I just showed you.
- The floor is yours.

564
00:38:01,563 --> 00:38:03,564
So a movie, huh?
That could be fun.

565
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:14,984
Fuck.

566
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:21,771
Her name Bubbles.

567
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:26,645
- "Vas-ion of the party snatches"
- It's like mad magazines.

568
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:29,837
Oh fuck you, okay. You try to think
of a good scifi porno title, it's hard.

569
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:33,663
There's gotta be one we haven't thought of.
That would say it all, not be ridiculously

570
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,586
filthy and off putting. And still
have in some recognition with our audience.

571
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:41,242
I got it!

572
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:44,803
- "Star Whores"?
- Yeah, funny right?

573
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,766
See, we figured this opens us
up to even bigger sales market.

574
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,970
Beyond the people
we went school with,

575
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:52,291
people who like comics and scifi.

576
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:53,770
Comics? Like Ziggy?

577
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:56,351
Ziggy? Is that even in fucking
papers anymore? No, man.

578
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:59,137
Fuck you. Ziggy is a comic.
It's right next to Family Circus.

579
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,125
No,like Spider Man and shit,
you know.

580
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,807
There's always a shit load of those
Star Wars nerds at those car-pic shows.

581
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,533
So we sell them a Princess Leia, that
they can really fuck and jerk off, too.

582
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,419
That would be me,
Princess Lay Her.

583
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,277
- Who am I planned?
- You, my friend, are the lead role of Luke the Guy Baller.

584
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:20,247
Oh man, he gonna be balling dudes?
I thought you said it was just boys on girls.

585
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:23,612
If I had to fuck a guy, okay,
but I would rather fuck a girl.

586
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:27,121
- What's wrong with you, boy?
- We'll change the name to uh..

587
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:31,500
to Sky Baller. I will be
Hung Solo. Delaney my friend,

588
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,615
- You are On Your Knees Bend Over.
- Man, I can't be in no porno movie

589
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,652
- My wife will kill me.
- Hump me, On Your Knees Bend Over, your my only hump.

590
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,858
On the other hand, fuck my wife.

591
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:44,727
Unfortunately, On Your Knees Bend
Over is not having sex in the movie,

592
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,250
but the drawings do.
ICUP and R2T fag.

593
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,733
- I robot.
- And Stacey over here is gonna play

594
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,659
Darth Vibrator.
- I'm the bad guy?

595
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:01,591
- It's not a guy, Zack.
- I know that, cause I'm not a fucking idiot.

596
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:05,919
In our movie, the Darth Vibrator
is a bad girl who wants to fuck

597
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:09,546
the galaxy, literally. And it's
up to Luke and Hung to stop her.

598
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:13,078
- With their cocks.
- See, you and me get to have sex then.

599
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:15,195
- Cool.
- Yeah, I know.

600
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:19,680
Hold up, so who are having
sex with who, in this movie?

601
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:22,288
I was about to say I was
having sex with Zack.

602
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,332
What? Hung Solo ain't never
had no sex with Princess Leia

603
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,050
In the Star Wars.

604
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,869
Oh, guys look, this isn't a
literal adaptation here

605
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,884
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.
Kind of like the Whiz.

606
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,379
With lots of anal.
- Cool.

607
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,371
I have a question. Do Princess
Lay Her and Luke Sky Baller have sex?

608
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,776
No. Because they're brother and sister. And
according to Miri brother and sister can't fuck.

609
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:54,145
But you actually said that this
wasn't literal translation so

610
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,727
that means, Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

611
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,058
Cause I would love to fuck and eat her
ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

612
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:03,522
Well, dream on Pall, cause
it's never gonna happen, okay?

613
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:05,617
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine.. Wait, what?

614
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:11,370
Yup. I mean, everyone else is having sex with
more than one person in this movie all the sudden

615
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:15,834
So, I think it's, you know, not
fair if I'm only fucking you.

616
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,691
Guys, read them up to yourselves.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

617
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:25,140
Look Mir, we got plenty of sex going on in
this thing already. You don't have to do that.

618
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,649
Zack, it's fine. I mean, I have slept
with way worse looking guys than Lester.

619
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,786
And I just want to do my part
for the movie like everyone else.

620
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:35,524
You're having sex in the movie already, so you
don't need to fuck someone else, you're good.

621
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:39,758
I'm only fucking you though so,
don't we need to vary it up

622
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:43,353
Keep it fair?
- Fair for who?

623
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,482
What are these blood diamonds
we're talking about. I mean, come on!

624
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:49,848
Fair for everyone else who is
fucking more than one person..

625
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:51,710
A.k. a you, in the movie.

626
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:54,295
I mean fine.
- Alright then.

627
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,310
- If you don't care.
- I don't fucking care if you fuck him.

628
00:41:57,544 --> 00:42:00,559
I don't give a shit. Like you said
fuck

629
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:04,443
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in out of space?

630
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:07,374
Maybe not bigger idiots.

631
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:14,681
Star Whores

632
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:22,324
Cut. Alright guys, that's it.

633
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,512
So everyone just make sure you
leave costumes, so we know

634
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:26,645
they're here for tomorrow, okay?

635
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,749
But mostly, everybody, thank you
so much for helping us get ready.

636
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:32,938
Cleaning this place out, building
the sets and sowing the costumes.

637
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:36,445
- It's really amazing, thank you.
- Seriously, thanks.

638
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:40,735
But this is just the beginning
guys. If Star Whores works,

639
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,521
And it will.
We're set up for..

640
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:46,361
"The Empire Strikes Ass"
- "The Return of the Brown Eye"

641
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:49,377
- "The Phantom Man Ass"
- And The Revenge of the Shit

642
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,696
The all anal final chapter.

643
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,161
- Okay.
- The Revenge of the Shit, you got it?

644
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,581
Yeah, no, we got it.

645
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,700
We'll talk about that one. We're gonna
have a lot of fun, but more importantly,

646
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:07,758
We're gonna make a lot of
fucking money, okay?

647
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,947
So get ready for greatness people.
Tomorrow we start

648
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:16,057
Alright. Good night, you guys.

649
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:22,932
- What?
- Nothing. I just think someone should

650
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:26,616
Knowledge how completely insane and
amazing this is. And it's all because of you.

651
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:29,137
Ah, no. It's just a porno.

652
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,210
You know what I mean.
You're really coming to your own.

653
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,841
Shut the fuck up.

654
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:39,898
So, speaking off coming in things,
ready for tomorrow?

655
00:44:40,393 --> 00:44:42,567
20 years finally getting to know
what it's like to have sex with each other.

656
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:46,249
Wow, you say that like you've been wondering
what it'd be like sleep with me for a while now.

657
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,017
Why the fuck do you think
I started hanging out with you?

658
00:44:50,597 --> 00:44:52,771
I knew it.
Here, help me.

659
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,825
Let's just promise that, this is not
gonna change anything between us, okay?

660
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:05,016
- Like what?
- I don't know. Some guys can't keep sex in prospective.

661
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:08,552
If anyone is gonna keep this in
prospective, it's you.

662
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:13,004
I don't want you to get all mooshie and gooey on me after
I give you the best orgasm you've ever had in your life.

663
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,708
Oh right, like you know
what you're doing down there at all.

664
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:18,813
I actually don't. Where's the clitoris,
is it in your ass?

665
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:23,309
Just so you know, make sure you kind of whoop it up
and act like I'm a stud, who knows what he's doing.

666
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:25,746
Just be a pall.

667
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:28,398
Oh, dude. I'm gonna
marital street the fuck out of this,

668
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,913
You watch.

669
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:34,084
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

670
00:45:34,986 --> 00:45:37,310
No really.. Thank you.

671
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:40,964
For everything.

672
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:44,381
You're welcome.

673
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,499
Less than 12 hours,
we make Monroewill history.

674
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:55,262
I hope nothing goes wrong.

675
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,449
It's a movie, what could go wrong?

676
00:46:12,428 --> 00:46:14,697
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

677
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:22,203
What the fuck is going on?

678
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:26,479
No, you gotta stop it now!
We rented this place for a month

679
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:29,013
From Mr. Jenkings.

680
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,227
Nah, sounds like your Mr. Jenkings
is full of shit.

681
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:35,664
I'm gonna kill that
lying old fuck!

682
00:46:35,972 --> 00:46:38,583
You're gonna have to go down to
Florida to do so. That's where he moved.

683
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,279
We got thousands of dollars of
equipment there, man.

684
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:41,546
Please.

685
00:46:41,843 --> 00:46:43,863
Hey, if you wanna shift trough
this ravel, be my guest.

686
00:46:44,277 --> 00:46:46,576
Hey, get that fucking
beam down!

687
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:05,887
I know this is probably the
last thing you wanna hear right now, but

688
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,572
If you don't get an advance
on your salary,

689
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:09,786
I don't think we're gonna
keep a roof over our heads.

690
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,751
I got an advance already-

691
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:14,806
Went it all on the costumes.
- So all our money is gone?

692
00:47:15,153 --> 00:47:16,748
All your money?

693
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:19,984
Never mind, what my wife is gonna do
to me when there ain't no new snow tires

694
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,982
But when she sees a charged
video camera-

695
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,774
Sorry I dragged you into
this, man.

696
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:26,806
I just wanted to
see some free titties.

697
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,549
That's all. But there's no
such thing as free titties..

698
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,768
Is there, Zack? Is there?

699
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:36,292
Fuck this noise.

700
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,482
Why we don't just get another
camera and shoot something else?

701
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:41,295
Where we gonna do that?
You got another sound stage?

702
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:42,681
What sound stage?

703
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,354
We had a shit covered garage
we turned into a sound stage.

704
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:47,691
We find some place new,
and we do it again.

705
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:49,127
How?

706
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,958
I'm broke, man.

707
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:54,751
No, make that I was broke..
Now I'm really tapped out.

708
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:57,397
I'll have to get another job just
to pay Delaney back, so please

709
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:01,387
tell me, how can I afford
to start over?

710
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,265
- What can I get ya?
- Yeah, can I get..

711
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,838
Too fucking late.
Cappuccino, $ 3.50.

712
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,256
Honestly, I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

713
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:13,624
I'm a total loser in every
single other aspect of my life.

714
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:16,873
What made you think, I could
do as simple as filming

715
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:19,934
People fucking. We have no money
left, no where to shoot, we have no sets

716
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,360
We have no fucking cameras. Here!

717
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:27,121
It's time I go back to my
old regular life

718
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,252
Where I'm a quiet fuck, who
does not cost anybody any money

719
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,491
And knows his God damn position
behind this fucking counter

720
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,893
Making cappuccinos for
this fucking guy.

721
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:45,584
Oh, yeah.

722
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,523
What are you doing?

723
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:56,667
Yeah.

724
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:04,581
Fuck yes!

725
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:33,618
You sneaky Indian mother fucker,
I tell you. Yes!

726
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:38,503
- Swallow My Cockacino!
- What?

727
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:40,663
That's it. That's the movie.

728
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:43,021
Why didn't I think it before.
We don't need sets

729
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:45,756
Or a stage.
Look at all this production value.

730
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,625
Waiting to have balls on it!

731
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:49,499
Hold up. You wanna shoot the
movie here,

732
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,320
- Where we work?
- Yes!

733
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:53,300
Fuck. Yes I do!

734
00:49:53,549 --> 00:49:55,125
Do you know how many stories
I have from working here?

735
00:49:55,382 --> 00:49:58,638
How many times I've been laid
right there after hours?

736
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,668
You've never got laid
here after hours.

737
00:50:00,924 --> 00:50:02,718
I know!
Thank you for reminding me.

738
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:04,510
But I always wish I had.

739
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,830
And that's what porno is.
A fantasy.

740
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:11,614
If taking the normal,
and making it abnormal

741
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,949
By fucking it.
- Don't do that.

742
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,725
Little dog don't like that.
- How the fuck did you get a camera?

743
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,982
By being a terrible,
untrustworthy employee.

744
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:21,569
That's how!

745
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:26,268
Give me a day, I'll bang out
a script. Meet me here after closing.

746
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:30,197
We're gonna load gism
all over this mother fucker! Peace!

747
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,208
I like that guy.

748
00:50:34,516 --> 00:50:38,574
But if he tries to fuck that little
dog tonight for real, I'm calling Humane Society.

749
00:50:41,046 --> 00:50:43,664
Called Bean-n-Gone, so get
the fuck out of here.

750
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,584
Vamos, Stacey. Is already recording

751
00:50:58,011 --> 00:50:59,477
Swallow My Cockacino,

752
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:01,045
Scene 12, take 1.

753
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,756
And action.

754
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:21,708
I'd like a double espresso,
so I could stay up all night,

755
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,945
Cause I'm in the mood to fuck.

756
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,191
I'm Hornista, so I love to fuck.

757
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,082
Would you like to fuck me?

758
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,530
Holy fuck. You mean, after
you're done with your shift?

759
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:34,760
I mean during my shift.

760
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:38,630
Keep going, keep going.

761
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:41,076
With your shaft.

762
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:53,475
Let us fuck!

763
00:51:58,687 --> 00:52:00,067
Music.

764
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:08,007
Okay, open up the
tamer guys. Let us see it.

765
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:12,574
More tongue.

766
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:17,408
Little less tongue.

767
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,958
See, I told you it's work.
Look, it's amazing.

768
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,771
Incredible.

769
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:18,722
Pull out of it actually.
No, not you Lester.

770
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,767
Can you slap ass
and not be a pervert, dude.

771
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:31,292
Yeah! Stir it.

772
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:45,488
Hey.

773
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:47,867
You guys still open?

774
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:52,823
No. We close at nine.

775
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:55,876
I need coffee
so I can drive home.

776
00:54:00,075 --> 00:54:02,067
That's a cute kitty.

777
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:17,763
You guys see the game?
I was at it.

778
00:54:20,036 --> 00:54:24,890
The quarter back was all
fucking..

779
00:54:26,365 --> 00:54:29,931
- All night!
- Okay, pall. Here, on the house!

780
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:33,403
- I love you, man
- Love you too. Have a good one, okay?

781
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:35,848
Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said have a good one.

782
00:54:39,304 --> 00:54:41,334
You and your little dog.

783
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:54,500
- Action!
- Oh, yes!

784
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:02,617
Oh God, this is good.

785
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:07,630
Take it! You take it!

786
00:55:08,135 --> 00:55:09,899
Take it Barry!

787
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,410
- Take it.
- I'm disturbed how turned on I am by this.

788
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:20,745
Oh shit, there's someone.

789
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:22,675
Okay, that's a wrap everybody.
Yeah!

790
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:28,095
Let's give a hand to hottest with the bodies
form last night. Stacey, Lester, Bubbles, Barry.

791
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:31,305
Okay. We come back tonight

792
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:35,142
We finish up the scene and
then we get to me and Miri stuff.

793
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,369
Again.. Amazing first
night everybody. Thank you so much.

794
00:55:41,983 --> 00:55:43,185
Let's us fuck.

795
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:48,777
- Hey, how did it look?
- How do you think it looked?

796
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:50,957
Looked like shit going
in other shit.

797
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,639
What an artist. That was
careless motto: shit going in other shit.

798
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:58,281
Oh man, I can't believe
you gotta work now.

799
00:55:58,558 --> 00:55:59,360
It's okay. You know what?

800
00:55:59,646 --> 00:56:01,234
Honestly, I don't think
I could sleep.

801
00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:04,526
I pretty like pumped up right now.
- Right? It was amazing.

802
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,181
It was awesome. I think the cast
and crew had a good time.

803
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,518
- We we're getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.

804
00:56:09,765 --> 00:56:11,970
I wanna keep shooting people
boning all fucking day.

805
00:56:12,308 --> 00:56:14,307
I don't think I've ever met
the ambitious Zack Brown before.

806
00:56:15,556 --> 00:56:17,736
Well, trying to pay the bill so..

807
00:56:17,991 --> 00:56:19,480
It's not a bad thing.

808
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:21,815
I think it looks good on you.

809
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:08,879
Come on, hurry!

810
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,755
Wait a minute, you guys
never did it before?

811
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:17,786
It's fine, you know..
We talked about it.

812
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,856
And it's just for the movie.

813
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:23,551
We're friends, you know.
We're just friends.

814
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,551
We will always just
be just friends so..

815
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:29,969
Listen, I have some extra
loop from last night..

816
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:33,634
I mean, I understand it's hard
to get wet when everyone's watching.

817
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:35,961
At least it was for Barry.

818
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,899
I don't know if I'm gonna need it
- Really?

819
00:57:39,217 --> 00:57:42,918
Yeah, I think I'm just..
Excited.

820
00:57:44,512 --> 00:57:47,505
Of the idea people watching,
not because of Zack.

821
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:50,680
Oh my God. Zack Brown could never
had that effect on me in a million years.

822
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:52,948
- Hello Miriam.
- Oh, hi..

823
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,079
- Your Face.
- Yeah. Weird, huh?

824
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:58,564
I don't think I've seen
your face since Senior year.

825
00:57:58,802 --> 00:58:01,732
I think, I made a mistake. I did it for
you, you know, so you didn't get a road rash

826
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:05,355
During our scene, but I should've asked first.
I look like fucking baloogle whale.

827
00:58:06,168 --> 00:58:10,336
- I think I'll be going now.
- Okay..

828
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:21,365
All I keep thinking, we should've
done a trial run a home.

829
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:23,603
- Oh my God, right?
- Yeah, I know.

830
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:29,355
- You're still cool to do it, right?
- Yeah, totally.

831
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,788
- Are you?
- Yeah.

832
00:58:33,649 --> 00:58:35,147
Honestly, I'm a little nervous
I guess. It's..

833
00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:37,922
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?

834
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:41,606
Yeah, you know. It's..
Our first time together.

835
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:48,512
Since our auspicious debut
on viral video.

836
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,919
- Yeah.
- That's a fuck load of pressure for a director.

837
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:53,811
As a director? Please.

838
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:55,731
What about the anxiety I'm
feeling as an actress?

839
00:58:56,105 --> 00:58:58,105
- Then I picked the right project.
- Yeah, right.

840
00:58:58,343 --> 00:58:59,702
What about this follow-up here?
I mean, Julia Roberts followed

841
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:02,036
Pretty Woman with Sleeping With
the Enemy, you know?

842
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:05,421
I'm following Granny Panties with
Swallow My Cockacino.

843
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:07,786
True. The only difference is, this
movie is about cock sucking

844
00:59:08,053 --> 00:59:10,886
- And her movie just sucked cock. Period.
- Yeah, the only difference.

845
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,621
The end was pretty rag.

846
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,287
I like that.

847
00:59:17,314 --> 00:59:21,681
She kills them..
- With a gun.

848
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,003
Yeah, it was so awesome.

849
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,437
So I guess we should do this.

850
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:31,160
I think we should probably wait

851
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:33,437
Just until I lose another 20-30 pounds.

852
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:37,051
- Stop it. You look good.
- Thanks.

853
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:42,449
So, what about me? How do I look?

854
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:47,253
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful so..

855
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:51,788
I guess it's not a big deal.
But you look amazing.

856
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:02,442
Okay. Let's go to make a pointer.

857
01:00:05,065 --> 01:00:07,871
Swallow My Cockacino.
Scene 8, take 1.

858
01:00:11,603 --> 01:00:14,704
Alright, settle. Action.

859
01:00:17,388 --> 01:00:19,221
Who could it be?

860
01:00:26,588 --> 01:00:27,998
- Hi.
- Hi.

861
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:31,204
I'm the delivery man, and
I have some cream for you.

862
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,473
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.

863
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:37,029
I work out. So..

864
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:40,476
Do you want me to give
you your cream now?

865
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:43,097
I've been waiting for it
all day.

866
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:49,138
- Oops.
- I spilled my cream.

867
01:00:50,308 --> 01:00:53,576
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind.

868
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:56,964
Especially if you spill
it on my face.

869
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,301
Let us fuck!

870
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,212
Let me see them, titties.

871
01:01:11,857 --> 01:01:14,601
Actually, you know what, sorry
I don't think we should show 'em.

872
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:16,965
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.

873
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:19,878
- Are you gonna take your shirt off?
- I ain't take my shirt off. I'm just gonna open it actually.

874
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:21,652
You're not gonna take it off?
Why not?

875
01:01:21,947 --> 01:01:24,768
My tits are bigger than yours for fuck sake.
It'd look weird. I don't wanna show that.

876
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:25,966
She's not gonna show her tits?

877
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:27,897
I shoved my cock in my asshole.

878
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:34,066
- Where's that delivery?
- I can't believe this.

879
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:37,057
I was delivering cream and
look what's happening.

880
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:39,394
Jesus, what is that? A rumba?

881
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:43,474
- What's a rumba?
- That akword movement.

882
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,717
Should we take your pants off?
- Yeah.

883
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:52,881
Oh, fuck. How does this work?

884
01:01:53,802 --> 01:01:55,545
You know what, I'll do it.
I'll do mine.

885
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:15,179
I'm gonna fuck you
with my pecker.

886
01:02:15,558 --> 01:02:18,951
Dude, that's really dirty.

887
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:20,722
- That's too dirty?
- Yeah, it offends me.

888
01:02:21,097 --> 01:02:24,179
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.

889
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:26,059
For my penis.

890
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:28,060
Be careful, Miri. Okay.

891
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:29,754
Just keep rolling.

892
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:32,846
Fucking cream is coming.

893
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:39,132
This is the worst porno
I've ever seen.

894
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:43,806
- Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.

895
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,789
Just leave 'em.
- It's really distracting.

896
01:02:58,203 --> 01:02:59,632
It's all good?

897
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,277
We'll start kissing on three, okay?

898
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,356
1, 2, 3. Go.

899
01:03:52,692 --> 01:03:53,751
- Deacon
- What?

900
01:03:54,026 --> 01:03:56,807
Did you see Lost this week? I missed it.
What happened?

901
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,036
Oh dude. They're on the island,
they off the island. Who can follow that shit.

902
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,458
I think they're in hell.
- Would you shut the fuck up.

903
01:04:57,929 --> 01:04:59,811
- Cut.
- That's it?

904
01:05:00,216 --> 01:05:01,574
It's over?

905
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:03,628
Ain't it supposed to
come with titties?

906
01:05:08,622 --> 01:05:11,252
Well, it wasn't what we adjusted
but that was nice.

907
01:05:11,813 --> 01:05:13,983
- You were so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack!

908
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,219
Thanks, Lester. Wasn't just
me though guys. Give it up

909
01:05:17,486 --> 01:05:19,408
For my radiant co-star here, Miri.

910
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:25,310
Show's over in here. Let's move
it on to a fourth lying scene.

911
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:27,288
Alright. Let's do it.

912
01:05:28,169 --> 01:05:29,427
- You look beautiful.
- I thought they would be

913
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,404
- Fucking hard.
- But it was pretty.

914
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:34,466
- Good job.
- Thanks.

915
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,672
- You're good Mir? You need anything?
- I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?

916
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,412
- Okay. I'll just be up there.
- Yeah.

917
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:51,005
- That was fun.
- Yeah. Fun..

918
01:06:37,236 --> 01:06:39,266
- Hey, are you alright?
- Yeah.

919
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:42,814
Just for tonight scene,
I'm ready to go when you are though.

920
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,564
You know, before we go..
I'm thinking

921
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:50,863
It's a good idea if we

922
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:53,760
Talk about what happened last night.

923
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:57,650
I mean, we don't have to but..

924
01:06:58,095 --> 01:07:00,692
Okay, yeah. I kind of dropped
the ball in that I guess, huh?

925
01:07:01,246 --> 01:07:03,554
- No, no. It's..
- To be honest..

926
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,059
It was.. I didn't know
how weird it would be for me.

927
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:10,545
Weird? Weird like how?

928
01:07:11,484 --> 01:07:15,094
Acting and directing at the same
time. It's a lot to process..

929
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:17,750
First time I thought my balls
didn't have enough hair on them.

930
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:22,512
- That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

931
01:07:23,905 --> 01:07:25,817
How are you feeling about it?

932
01:07:26,372 --> 01:07:27,997
I guess..

933
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:32,689
I feel like.. Like we..

934
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:37,649
- Holy fuck!
- The light is on!

935
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:39,076
Did you do this?

936
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,105
- No, I burned the bills how come..
- The water.

937
01:07:44,332 --> 01:07:45,717
Come on, come on.

938
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,758
Yeah!

939
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:50,936
- We can shower in our home again!
- We got liquid.

940
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:58,736
Greetings! Have you heard
the good news about

941
01:07:58,984 --> 01:08:00,737
Our Lord of savior
Jesus Christ?

942
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:02,520
Oh my God, did you
guys do this?

943
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,361
We got tired of you guys taking
showers at our places all the time.

944
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,162
So we took up a collection
amongs ourselves.

945
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:09,354
And shipped away
your a mountain of debt.

946
01:08:09,608 --> 01:08:11,955
You guys paid off our massive
utilities bills?

947
01:08:12,202 --> 01:08:13,531
How did you afford that?

948
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:15,076
I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.

949
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:17,075
And mistress Bubbles did a bachelor
party tonight which yours truly

950
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:21,057
Was a guest star. Thank you
very much.

951
01:08:21,908 --> 01:08:24,217
But don't get too excited, cause
we didn't pay off your whole bill

952
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:25,556
Just a month of each.

953
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:27,221
And they agreed to turn
everything back on?

954
01:08:27,365 --> 01:08:29,246
Yeah nine at night?
How does that work?

955
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,397
Stacey knows somebody that works
at power and light.

956
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,239
- You guys..
- This is amazing..

957
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:35,753
You didn't have to do this.

958
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,666
And you guys didn't have to
put us in your movie either.

959
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:39,576
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.

960
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:42,508
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.

961
01:08:42,774 --> 01:08:44,529
Guys, honestly..
I don't know what to say.

962
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,614
Well, you could start off by saying
we could take tonight off so we could

963
01:08:46,883 --> 01:08:48,768
Have our rap party right now.

964
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:51,620
Guys, we're not wrapped though.
We still have four days of shootings left.

965
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,868
Um, excuse me. In my producorial
capacity,

966
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:56,966
I'm shutting the movie down
for tonight

967
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,695
So we can get lost silly.

968
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,316
Go, go, go, go!

969
01:09:41,832 --> 01:09:43,613
- Yeah!
- Yes!

970
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:50,651
Is it just amazing after all those
years not knowing?

971
01:09:50,908 --> 01:09:54,543
It was.. weird. But good.

972
01:09:55,314 --> 01:09:57,653
I have my next scene with Zack tomorrow.
- You don't say?

973
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,832
But I'm little nervous.

974
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,680
- I was thinking about trying to get with him tonight.
- Really?

975
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:05,772
I mean if you don't mind.

976
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,504
You guys are just friends and all.
So I didn't think it would be a biggie..

977
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:10,089
It wouldn't be a biggie,
would it?

978
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:14,606
No, no. It's not a biggie.
Why? No.

979
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,301
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Stacey.

980
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:20,381
I'm not married to the guy so..

981
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:24,240
I don't know. You guys just looked
kind of intimate last night.

982
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:27,014
- We did?
- Yeah.

983
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:35,596
Well, we're just better
actors than I thought, I think.

984
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,380
You know what? If you want to get
with him, you should just go and ask him.

985
01:10:40,687 --> 01:10:43,013
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah?

986
01:10:43,263 --> 01:10:44,398
- Yeah.
- For real? You don't mind?

987
01:10:45,986 --> 01:10:47,200
Cool.

988
01:10:51,757 --> 01:10:53,970
All the quarters are on the ground.

989
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:05,323
Come on, you guys playing
or what?

990
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:46,840
Well, I'm bummed. But I totally get it and
it's no problem to work with Lester again.

991
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:49,750
- He has a nice cock.
- Oh. Well, you're a trooper Stass.

992
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:54,886
Oh, but if I start making weird faces during the
scene, it's just cause I've been constipated all day.

993
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:58,789
Oh shit. We don't have to shoot
this scene tonight.

994
01:12:59,024 --> 01:12:59,934
No I want to.

995
01:13:00,195 --> 01:13:01,580
It feels great when you're
constipated.

996
01:13:01,818 --> 01:13:03,510
It totally loosens yo up.

997
01:13:04,302 --> 01:13:06,786
I use exlax, but good to know.

998
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,123
Okay. Never thought I'd have
that conversation.

999
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,771
So are we starting with Lester
and Stacey tonight,

1000
01:13:13,006 --> 01:13:14,771
Cause we were supposed to start
with Lester and Miri.

1001
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:17,215
Oh, yeah. We're not gonna do
that anymore.

1002
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:19,244
I don't think Miri's gonna..
wanna..

1003
01:13:24,788 --> 01:13:26,293
Do that.

1004
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:33,312
So where are we shooting this?
Over here?

1005
01:13:33,866 --> 01:13:36,165
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.

1006
01:13:37,866 --> 01:13:39,621
Our scene is tonight, right?

1007
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:43,293
Can I talk you for a minute
in the back?

1008
01:13:44,769 --> 01:13:46,474
Sure.

1009
01:13:49,749 --> 01:13:51,034
What do you want me to shoot
here, Zack?

1010
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:54,015
Just start with the close-ups of
Lester and Stacey. Give me a second!

1011
01:13:55,243 --> 01:13:57,045
What an artist.

1012
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,104
Did I do something wrong to you?

1013
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:04,805
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here for the same reason you're here.

1014
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:06,848
To make the movie.

1015
01:14:07,431 --> 01:14:10,096
Okay, just like for your own
personal information..

1016
01:14:11,107 --> 01:14:13,276
You're acting really
fucking weird right now.

1017
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:15,715
I'm acting weird? Cause I think
you're acting fucking weird right now.

1018
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,156
How exactly am I acting weird?

1019
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:20,572
Well, for one thing, you've been
trying to keep me from fucking

1020
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,720
Anybody but you since we
started this thing.

1021
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:25,940
Maybe, I was thinking
about your feelings.

1022
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,019
Were you thinking about my feelings
last night

1023
01:14:28,248 --> 01:14:29,319
When you were banging Stacey, cause

1024
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,468
that would be really sad for Stacey?

1025
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,321
She told me, that you told her
that it was okay.

1026
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:38,558
I told it was okay,
to ask you.

1027
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:45,414
Holy shit. I get it!
I fucking get it.

1028
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,365
It was a test. That whole
fucking thing was a test. Is that it?

1029
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,719
If it was, how do you think
you did?

1030
01:14:52,514 --> 01:14:56,406
We had a discussion. We actually
had many discussions..

1031
01:14:56,783 --> 01:15:01,477
About how, it was just sex
and how we wouldn't let it get weird.

1032
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:04,912
- Then I'm not acting weird.
- No, you're acting like a jealous

1033
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,557
- Fucking girl friend is what he fuck you're acting like.
- I'm not your girlfriend.

1034
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:09,537
- Oh, I know that.
- And you're not my boyfriend

1035
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,915
So why the fuck are we having
this conversation right now?

1036
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:15,519
Because you're about to
fuck Lester to spite me!

1037
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:18,153
- It seems like.
- Did you fuck Stacey to spite me?

1038
01:15:18,441 --> 01:15:21,172
No, you fucked her just like you
fucked every other stupid bitch

1039
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,501
And never gave a shit
how I felt about it.

1040
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,541
- That was before
- Before what?

1041
01:15:25,839 --> 01:15:29,274
Don't fucking pretend, that the
other night you and me there..

1042
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:33,105
That that didn't mean anything to you.
That you didn't feel it too.

1043
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:38,115
Oh, you're not getting all gooey
on me here, are you Zack?

1044
01:15:38,402 --> 01:15:40,891
You know what? If you were
any other bitch,

1045
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,910
I wouldn't give a rat's ass about, I would
tell you to go fuck yourself right now,

1046
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,615
Because, I fucking hate this
game playing shit.

1047
01:15:48,187 --> 01:15:50,287
But you, you mean
more to me than that.

1048
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:52,583
So I'm just gonna lay this out
on the front street.

1049
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:55,965
I know you feel something big, something
real the other night when we were together

1050
01:15:56,221 --> 01:15:58,927
Because I felt it too.

1051
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:01,619
We tried to fuck, and instead

1052
01:16:01,897 --> 01:16:03,313
We wound out making love.

1053
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:04,987
So if this is it what you
need to hear

1054
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:06,858
In order to keep you
from fucking Lester.

1055
01:16:07,107 --> 01:16:08,612
If this is what you need, fine.

1056
01:16:08,968 --> 01:16:11,048
Here it is. I'm gonna say it.

1057
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,236
I love you, Miri.

1058
01:16:18,803 --> 01:16:22,021
- Happy?
- Oh Jesus.

1059
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,152
You better get hold of yourself,
Zack, cause we just fucked.

1060
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,623
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?
- But you did.

1061
01:16:38,091 --> 01:16:42,493
You know what.. Oh shit.

1062
01:16:44,207 --> 01:16:45,891
What?

1063
01:16:50,129 --> 01:16:53,710
Alright guys, don't forget
I'm down here watch that pull out, huh?

1064
01:16:57,066 --> 01:16:59,237
This is some damn good coffee.

1065
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:01,941
Hey man, where are you going?
- Get the fuck out of here.

1066
01:17:02,266 --> 01:17:03,930
We gotta finish this movie.

1067
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:15,695
Can you believe this shit?

1068
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,190
- Do you believe this shit?
- What the fuck just happened in there?

1069
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:20,984
I'll tell you what just
happened in there..

1070
01:17:21,459 --> 01:17:24,065
That chick frosted me,
like a fucking cake!

1071
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:04,985
Three Months Later...

1072
01:18:07,462 --> 01:18:09,950
Seriously, we shoot the
shit out of this bitch.

1073
01:18:11,466 --> 01:18:13,734
- Cock shots?
- Cock shots.

1074
01:18:27,214 --> 01:18:28,976
We shot you in the balls!

1075
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:33,340
Well, it's my job to get
shot in the balls so..

1076
01:18:33,765 --> 01:18:34,996
Excuse me..

1077
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:36,914
Didn't you use to work in the
Bean-N-Gone coffee shop?

1078
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,489
I sure shit hope this
pays better, I tell you.

1079
01:18:45,944 --> 01:18:48,517
So why don't they just shoot
you with a puck?

1080
01:18:48,756 --> 01:18:52,201
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what does paintball gotta do with hockey?

1081
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,460
Nothing, I guess..

1082
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,616
So, ain't no prices or..?

1083
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,723
In the balls.

1084
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:09,971
Yeah, they sure are. It's a living though..

1085
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:11,693
Oh, you get the checks I've been senting you?

1086
01:19:11,911 --> 01:19:13,407
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

1087
01:19:14,773 --> 01:19:18,446
Well, I didn't save you from
the brutal tongue lashing though, huh?

1088
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:22,121
Well, you know, the wife never found
out about the camera, cause

1089
01:19:22,419 --> 01:19:25,023
- I payed off the bills.
- How did you manage that?

1090
01:19:25,965 --> 01:19:29,311
- Because now I'm rich.
- No way!

1091
01:19:29,825 --> 01:19:33,407
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred and sixty large, son.

1092
01:19:33,672 --> 01:19:35,664
Nice man! Congratulations.

1093
01:19:35,952 --> 01:19:38,201
It's a beautiful day, thank you very much.
- I thought you made that all thing up.

1094
01:19:38,456 --> 01:19:41,041
It's very real,
you can believe it.

1095
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,745
No, she's spending off.

1096
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:50,815
Well, since you ain't
gonna ask me..

1097
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:55,677
I just go ahead and tell you.. No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

1098
01:19:56,668 --> 01:19:59,727
Oh. I suppose you weren't
gonna ask about your movie either.

1099
01:19:59,975 --> 01:20:01,213
Look, that's why I came down here,
cause

1100
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:03,163
I need you to come and
take a look at it.

1101
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:05,440
- I'm not interested, man
- Well, you better get interested,

1102
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:07,739
Cause you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?

1103
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:13,211
- The story doesn't make sense.
- The story?

1104
01:20:14,361 --> 01:20:16,470
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?

1105
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:19,313
It's a movie, dog. And a movie's
gotta have an ending.

1106
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:23,344
- Which we don't have at the moment.
- Credits.

1107
01:20:23,749 --> 01:20:25,748
- There's your fucking ending.
- Do me this favor, okay?

1108
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:29,125
When you're done getting your
nuts blown off,

1109
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:33,848
come back to humble Mornoewill
to my crib for couple hours.

1110
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:37,253
Check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

1111
01:20:39,537 --> 01:20:42,161
I'll tell you what. You do that,
you don't know me shit no more.

1112
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,815
- Really?
- Really.

1113
01:20:45,251 --> 01:20:46,922
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

1114
01:20:48,448 --> 01:20:50,892
Maybe I should leave the
patch on, huh?

1115
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:53,644
You got some extra ones?

1116
01:21:04,307 --> 01:21:06,606
- Hey honey.
- Where the fuck you've been?

1117
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:10,006
- And who the fuck is this now?
- Would you calm down woman? God damn!

1118
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:14,879
You already left one white boy
down in my basement.

1119
01:21:15,156 --> 01:21:17,203
What if that mother fucker
was grabby on me?

1120
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:21,563
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- Oh, what in the fuck was that supposed to mean?!

1121
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:25,967
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you!
- White boys love me! White boy?

1122
01:21:26,986 --> 01:21:29,424
- I said white boy!
- Yeah?

1123
01:21:29,739 --> 01:21:32,464
- You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?
- Should I say yes?

1124
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,207
- Say yes.
- Yes.

1125
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:40,644
Why don't you uh..?
Head down stairs..

1126
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:43,229
- It's through this hall way.
- Nice to meet you.

1127
01:21:43,536 --> 01:21:45,093
You too.

1128
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:48,254
What the fuck are
you looking at?

1129
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:50,610
Why you gotta be up in here
yelling at me in front of my director?

1130
01:21:50,923 --> 01:21:52,519
- Oh, he's the director?
- Yeah.

1131
01:21:52,785 --> 01:21:54,480
I didn't know he's the director.

1132
01:21:54,765 --> 01:21:57,332
Okay, well, why don't he direct my
ass into a new mother fucking husband.

1133
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,925
How about that shit?

1134
01:22:00,718 --> 01:22:04,007
Oh, don't nobody want them saggy ass balls!
- Saggy balls?

1135
01:22:04,304 --> 01:22:06,304
Look how saggy ass titties
you got run around here?

1136
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:08,898
Oh, then mother fucker we match!

1137
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,686
Oh shit.

1138
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:18,487
- Where's my paintball gun at?
- Look at you, editor and DP

1139
01:22:18,794 --> 01:22:19,912
You got your shit covered, man

1140
01:22:20,218 --> 01:22:23,139
Please, don't ever say shit
covered to me again.

1141
01:22:25,071 --> 01:22:28,134
Roll the film for the man please,
so we can see what he thinks.

1142
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:32,380
Just jump to it though, I ain't
gotta all night. The bitch is on me.

1143
01:22:33,499 --> 01:22:35,827
Nigga Rich Productions, classy

1144
01:22:36,124 --> 01:22:38,441
- Yeah, Dream Works was taken.
- Was it?

1145
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:40,917
Plus it sounds like underground
gay fuck club.

1146
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:42,970
"I met a guy at Dream Works"
Yeah.

1147
01:22:43,265 --> 01:22:46,545
Alright, so we got Lester
and Stacey fucking.

1148
01:22:47,664 --> 01:22:50,085
And then we got Barry and
Bubbles fucking.

1149
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,966
And then this boring bullshit.

1150
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:00,889
Okay, just go to the
next scene would you?

1151
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:05,762
- Ah, what next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

1152
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:09,703
- We never shot it.
- Why not?

1153
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:11,548
Because, after you left that night

1154
01:23:11,796 --> 01:23:13,853
Miri came out of the back room
and said she couldn't do it.

1155
01:23:14,271 --> 01:23:17,212
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So..

1156
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:21,720
- Wait.. So Miri..?
- Never fucked nobody.

1157
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:24,494
Just you.

1158
01:23:25,296 --> 01:23:28,000
Now, I wonder why she did that.

1159
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,932
You see, there was the time when I
was just a bitter old fuck

1160
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:36,723
Making coffees.

1161
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:38,783
And stacey was just a lap dancer.

1162
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:41,128
And Barry and Bubbles didn't
know each other.

1163
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:43,368
And this fool here, hell, I don't
even know what he was!

1164
01:23:44,247 --> 01:23:46,851
- A white supremacist.
- Ah, fuck you.

1165
01:23:47,298 --> 01:23:49,029
Then two people come along

1166
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:51,268
And showed us something,
we didn't know existed.

1167
01:23:52,122 --> 01:23:53,574
A world of possibilities

1168
01:23:53,852 --> 01:23:56,546
Where plain old people, just like us

1169
01:23:57,052 --> 01:23:58,944
Can do something special.

1170
01:23:59,796 --> 01:24:03,177
Even if it's someone filming
people fucking.

1171
01:24:13,556 --> 01:24:15,372
Sometimes..

1172
01:24:16,422 --> 01:24:18,464
We just need someone to
show us something

1173
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:20,852
We can't see for ourselves.

1174
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,356
And it will change for ever.

1175
01:24:36,153 --> 01:24:38,985
So as you can see,
our movie ain't got no ending.

1176
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:42,621
And every movie needs an ending, don't it?

1177
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:49,199
Thanks.

1178
01:24:50,913 --> 01:24:54,634
Delaney, you're a slick cupid mother fucker

1179
01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:59,696
Ain't love grand?
- Why the fuck is this white boy doing in our God damn house?

1180
01:25:00,798 --> 01:25:02,708
Sometimes.

1181
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:23,597
- No, get out!
- I'm sorry.. Close the door for once.

1182
01:25:23,954 --> 01:25:26,280
- It was closed over
- Just close the fucking door, Zack

1183
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:30,678
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

1184
01:25:32,176 --> 01:25:34,966
But when we got into my room, you know
what we did? We talked about you

1185
01:25:35,323 --> 01:25:36,720
And us

1186
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:40,522
And how things were different and
how I was too much of a fucking pussy

1187
01:25:41,624 --> 01:25:44,376
To just tell you how I felt about you.

1188
01:25:45,108 --> 01:25:49,487
And I know, I know that's only because
of all the stupid shit we said about

1189
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:52,673
how we wouldn't let sex change us,
but it did

1190
01:25:52,952 --> 01:25:56,507
It changed me.
That has to be love, right?

1191
01:25:58,001 --> 01:25:59,121
It has to be love, and..

1192
01:26:00,678 --> 01:26:03,073
Just so you know, I can't go back
being just friends anymore

1193
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:05,113
because..

1194
01:26:05,885 --> 01:26:07,184
I just can't.

1195
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:11,828
And I think you feel the same way.

1196
01:26:13,146 --> 01:26:17,016
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester

1197
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:22,925
What's up, Zack?

1198
01:26:33,086 --> 01:26:35,817
You know what? I do not care
that you're fucking Lester, okay?

1199
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:39,918
How's that? Because I don't wanna
be with anyone but you

1200
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:43,570
So I will wait for ever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life.

1201
01:26:44,293 --> 01:26:47,484
Because I love you and I have
for as long as I can remember

1202
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:50,562
And I would rather die than be
without you, Miriam Linky.

1203
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:53,225
Miri's lastname is Linky?

1204
01:26:54,236 --> 01:26:56,128
You're gonna fuck a guy who
doesn't know your lastname?

1205
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,316
Or that you beat Cole Rothen
in the sixth grade? - I know that

1206
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:00,952
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like,

1207
01:27:01,278 --> 01:27:04,625
had we gone, but we decided not
to and we got drunk alone instead.

1208
01:27:05,495 --> 01:27:07,773
Or that you wash your hair
in the toilet.

1209
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,992
- We're not fucking, Zack
- Or that you're not fucking Zack

1210
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:11,101
- What?
- Yeah I mean, I asked her to fuck me

1211
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:12,817
but she wouldn't do it.

1212
01:27:13,074 --> 01:27:15,245
Then I even tried to talk her in
to give me the fucking Dutch Rider

1213
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,562
Shut me down on that, too.

1214
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:21,324
- And the Dutch Rider is..?
- You don't know what Dutch Rider is?

1215
01:27:21,701 --> 01:27:25,205
Oh look, you grab your dick, and then
you have someone else work you arm

1216
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:26,876
Let me show you

1217
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:28,935
You grab my arm, I'll grab my dick
You grab my arm

1218
01:27:29,182 --> 01:27:30,849
now work it. Work my arm.

1219
01:27:31,244 --> 01:27:33,262
See that shit?
Work it up and down.

1220
01:27:33,522 --> 01:27:35,462
See? It's like someone else
striking you off.

1221
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,147
And of course, there's the
double Dutch Rider.

1222
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:40,213
Which I grab my dick, you grab
your dick,

1223
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:42,284
you work my arm, I'll
work your arm.

1224
01:27:42,521 --> 01:27:43,345
Same time

1225
01:27:43,582 --> 01:27:44,967
Same time, it's like jerking off
together but not gay

1226
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:46,828
We're not touching dicks

1227
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:49,124
Each other's dicks anyway,
I'm touching my own dick.

1228
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,925
You're working it, and I'm
loving it.

1229
01:27:52,211 --> 01:27:53,927
It feels good. Try me, come on.

1230
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,917
Sorry to change the subject on
you Lester, but

1231
01:27:57,868 --> 01:28:01,729
If you're not fucking Miri, why
is your dick out right now?

1232
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:04,879
Cause I live here now and I like to be naked.
- Huh?

1233
01:28:06,919 --> 01:28:08,614
When you moved out, she couldn't afford
to pay the rent by herself

1234
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:12,179
so I moved in to help.
- But who's keeping her room?

1235
01:28:12,756 --> 01:28:14,993
That's my room now, she moved in your
old room.

1236
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:17,776
She changed rooms?

1237
01:28:18,053 --> 01:28:20,915
Yeah, she said she did it, cause
she missed the smell of yours or some shit.

1238
01:28:23,786 --> 01:28:25,618
I don't smell anything.

1239
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:27,659
But you know what? That probably
means she loves you.

1240
01:28:30,614 --> 01:28:32,677
- Goodnight, Zack
- Good night

1241
01:28:37,402 --> 01:28:38,964
Do you?

1242
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:44,547
- Why are you crying?
- Because I missed you so much!

1243
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:50,185
I love you.

1244
01:28:55,008 --> 01:28:56,373
- I love you, I love you
- I love you

1245
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:00,574
I don't mean to alarm you, but I think
I just jerked off Lester a little bit.

1246
01:29:01,843 --> 01:29:03,968
- The Dutch Rider?
- Yeah, it's genius, right?

1247
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:06,762
If you ask me that, I say I will Dutch
Rider you for the rest of our lives.

1248
01:29:07,454 --> 01:29:08,843
Oh, good.

1249
01:29:09,604 --> 01:29:11,642
I'm getting tired of fucking
the flash light.

1250
01:29:11,938 --> 01:29:13,781
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

1251
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,743
- How did it feel like?
- Feels like fucking a flash light.
