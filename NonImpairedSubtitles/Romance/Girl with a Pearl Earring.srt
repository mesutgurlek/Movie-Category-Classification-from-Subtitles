1
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,601
Woman: Griet.

2
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:50,771
Leave that.

3
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,515
- Griet?
- Father.

4
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,242
Father: Do you remember?

5
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,078
You watched me paint it.

6
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,362
I never thought our family
would come to this.

7
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:55,204
Food may be strange
to your stomach.

8
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:02,114
Keep clear of their Catholic prayers.

9
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,608
Or if you must be with them
when they pray...

10
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:07,144
stop your ears.

11
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,864
- Girl #1: Give it.
- Girl #2: I got Cornelia's too.

12
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:26,093
- Give it back.
- Stop it!

13
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,668
Girl #1: You did not get it.
I did.

14
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,139
Do you know the house
of Master Vermeer?

15
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:36,302
Tell Tanneke
the new maid is here.

16
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,234
Woman: You took your time.
Lose your way, did you?

17
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,769
Young mistress is out
this morning.

18
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,274
I'm to show you round.

19
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,176
Water for the table.

20
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:15,278
Take water from the canal
for laundry.

21
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,181
It's clean enough
this side of town.

22
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,685
Soda...
coppers, boiler...

23
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,554
sand and soap.

24
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,082
In cooking kitchen you're to help
serve and clear,

25
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,924
buy fish and meat...

26
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,556
when young mistress
don't want to.

27
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,032
You'll take your meals
with me and the children.

28
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,193
That's your sleeping place.

29
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,268
Scour the pots and pans.

30
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,834
Young mistress and master sleep
and have company here.

31
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:46,881
You'll get used to it.

32
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,546
You're to clean in there.

33
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,017
Not now!

34
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,393
He's painting.

35
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,376
(mice squeaking)

36
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,394
(light tapping)

37
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,042
(water boiling)

38
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,880
(clucking)

39
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,289
Good morning, madam.

40
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:17,722
Don't speak till
you're spoken to.

41
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:22,296
Tanneke showed you what needs
to be done? The laundry and so on?

42
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,634
Yes, madam.

43
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:28,040
This is only a trial.
Nothing is settled yet.

44
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,131
I...

45
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,136
my husband does...

46
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,434
Go in.

47
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,480
Go in.

48
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,954
Disturb nothing.

49
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,149
Leave all just as it is.

50
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:55,422
Open the shutters,
you can't work in the dark.

51
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:57,348
You're not the first to forget
your manners in front of his paintings.

52
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,019
Tell me, girl...

53
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,819
do you think it finished?

54
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,759
Three months.

55
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:11,060
Another three before he's satisfied,
no doubt.

56
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,563
Well get along, girl.

57
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,832
You're not paid
to stand gawping all day.

58
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,338
Man: Good to see you.

59
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,347
- Tanneke: Are you well?
- Man: Yeah.

60
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,012
- Can we go?
- Here's my man.

61
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:35,545
Paul.

62
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,751
This is Griet,
the new maid.

63
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:38,952
She'll fetch the meat now.

64
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,085
So, Griet...

65
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,924
what takes your fancy?

66
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,897
Nothing is too good
for this family?

67
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,399
An ox tongue
and a dozen chops.

68
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,061
Pieter...

69
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,002
chops...

70
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,028
In the book again?

71
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:58,212
There you are.

72
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,411
This meat's not fresh.

73
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,555
The mistress won't like it.

74
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,587
Pieter.

75
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,225
Get the parcel
on the cart.

76
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,948
That's better.

77
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,421
We'll see you again, Griet.

78
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,686
Yes.

79
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,126
Woman: No!

80
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,797
Man: I'll take that.

81
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:01,642
Make way now.

82
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:07,179
- What is it?
- Bankrupt.

83
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:11,150
They've lived next door
for as long as I can remember.

84
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,683
The shame.

85
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,515
Lost everything.

86
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,088
Watch out for young mistress.

87
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,721
She hates money troubles.

88
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,330
She'll turn spiteful at this,
you mark my words.

89
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:37,343
Mistress: The last time you said it was
done you kept it another six months!

90
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,743
Man: It will be done soon.

91
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,646
Mistress: Oh yes, soon.
But when is soon?

92
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,741
Next month, next year?

93
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,115
It's all the same to you,

94
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:48,087
if your children starve
and your wife is dressed in rags.

95
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,784
When you sit up there
and suck at your paintbrush...

96
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,486
Man: You're being ridiculous.
I'm going out.

97
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,687
Mistress: No, Jan,
don't you dare leave.

98
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:57,459
(steps, slamming door)

99
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,362
One year it got so bad,
they had to sell some of their jewels.

100
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:06,999
You could imagine
how that pleased her.

101
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,099
She smashed half the china...

102
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:11,872
went to spoil
one of his precious paintings.

103
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,246
Well, he's a temper on him too
for all he's so quiet.

104
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,652
She's not set so much as a foot
in his studio from that day to this.

105
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,558
(door opens, steps)

106
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,127
(woman screaming in pain)

107
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,102
(screaming)

108
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,075
There you are.
Fetch some water.

109
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,475
Hail Mary, Mother of God,

110
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,911
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

111
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:23,075
Tanneke: Six babies. Why does
she have to make such a racket?

112
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,550
Woman: Just get on with the work.

113
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,813
- Push!
- (screaming)

114
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:31,516
Woman: I need more rags, girl.

115
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,083
Woman: More rags.

116
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:37,427
(panting)

117
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,524
(screaming)

118
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,091
Woman: Push, push!

119
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,330
Woman: Good, that's good!

120
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,132
Mistress: Oh, Jan,
isn't he just like you?

121
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,436
Woman: Johannes, that's it.

122
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,979
Look at him,
he's your little brother.

123
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,174
(blessing in Latin)

124
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,114
(baby crying)

125
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:09,122
Take this to the house of your master's
patron, Pieter van Ruijven.

126
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,374
Man: To the left.

127
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,046
Man: Open up,
there's a lady coming in.

128
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:36,922
That's it.

129
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,689
Van Ruijven:
So, finished at last.

130
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,398
Honored guest.

131
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:53,600
It's the old woman's idea to combine
the birth feast and the viewing.

132
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,369
She is a tight fist.

133
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,572
I won't turn out
for small beer and biscuits, tell her.

134
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,673
Me and the brat
deserve a proper feast.

135
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:10,217
You have a very wide eyes.

136
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,691
What do they call you?

137
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,560
- Griet.
- Griet?

138
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,997
Griet.

139
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,171
Your master is a fine painter,
Griet.

140
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,936
The finest in Delft.

141
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:29,976
He's painted me.

142
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:33,911
Perhaps that will be
my epitaph.

143
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,448
Look at that dress.

144
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,822
You can almost stroke
the satin.

145
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,953
And the wine winkling
through the glass.

146
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,396
Can you imagine yourself
in such finery, Griet?

147
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,664
She loved it, you know.

148
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,506
Lace and satin pressed tight
against the plump little bubbies.

149
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:08,481
The silk, heavy on her thighs.

150
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,210
The gentlemen watching.

151
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,445
My God, she was happy.

152
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,683
She thought she was somebody.

153
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:18,749
All dressed up like a lady.

154
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,525
Green as grass,
mind you.

155
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,392
She had only worked there
a few months

156
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,925
before Master Van Ruijven
brought her over to be painted.

157
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,633
Got her into that fine red dress.

158
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,177
Poured wine down her
like he was forcing a goose.

159
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:39,645
That dress
can't have stayed on long.

160
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,980
She was carrying his by-blow
before the painting was dry.

161
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:52,624
He thinks we don't know
how to celebrate a birth, does he?

162
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,042
Tanneke: Come on, keep up.

163
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,682
Butcher: Come on now, my little one.
I've got a lovely apple for you.

164
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,889
The price was three guilders,
I'm sure of that.

165
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,366
Three guilders...
thank you.

166
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,393
(knocking)

167
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,923
Why are you here?

168
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,562
A nice greeting, when I brought
the meat order just for you.

169
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,472
Better carry it through.

170
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,370
Not even a smile
for my pains?

171
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,473
Not today.

172
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,112
Come on.

173
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,217
I'll put it in the book, then.
Owed by Griet...

174
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,454
one smile.

175
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,414
Man:
And don't they look marvelous?

176
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,814
Welcome,
Master Van Ruijven.

177
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,155
Van Ruijven: Mistress Thins.

178
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:24,876
(applause)

179
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,782
Friends and neighbors,

180
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,788
our honored guest,
Master Van Ruijven...

181
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:36,585
not only
are we gathered tonight

182
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:39,217
to celebrate the safe delivery
into this world,

183
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:42,456
praise be to God,
of little Franciscus,

184
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:47,526
but also to rejoice
at another birth,

185
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:52,369
a new masterpiece
from the hand of my son-in-law

186
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,270
Johannes Vermeer.

187
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,527
Is this Indian yellow?

188
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,398
Distilled from the urine
of sacred cows

189
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,967
fed only on mango leaves.

190
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,415
You've glazed my wife
in dried piss.

191
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,485
It was the right color.

192
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,516
No stinting, eh?

193
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:54,296
I cannot bear the suspense
a moment longer, Master Van Ruijven.

194
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,393
Pray tell us
what you think.

195
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,904
This is good.

196
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:04,774
Color and perspective is true,
the illusion... is perfect.

197
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,508
All this skill lavished
on my dear Emilie.

198
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:13,577
Why...

199
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:18,217
it's almost as if...
she were thinking.

200
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:21,750
And have you considered
the subject for your next commission?

201
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,992
We cannot expect you to give up Emilie
for so long again.

202
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,523
Considered? It's already in hand.
Didn't I tell you?

203
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,729
A coming fellow
from Amsterdam.

204
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,330
Studied under
Rembrandt van Rijn,

205
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:33,930
though, who hasn't
these days?

206
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:41,512
"A Merry Company by Candlelight,"
candlelight being his forte.

207
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,218
So, have you decided
what to daub next, Jan?

208
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,348
Have you found inspiration up
in that room of yours?

209
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:55,761
Is there another patron in Delft
with pockets as deep as mine?

210
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,162
I've not yet found a subject.

211
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,655
(thunder roaring)

212
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,893
(baby crying)

213
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,011
Yes?

214
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,990
About the studio, mistress.

215
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,355
Should I clean the windows?

216
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,955
You don't need to ask me
about such matters.

217
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:04,986
It's just...

218
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,594
it may change the light.

219
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,309
Of course.

220
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,914
Wash them.

221
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,419
(gasping)

222
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,557
Stay as you were.

223
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,367
By the window.

224
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,675
Drop it.

225
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:42,817
Just...

226
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,832
You can go.

227
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,631
(bells tolling)

228
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,685
Priest: Brothers and sisters...

229
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,387
welcome to the house
of the Lord God.

230
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:51,955
Let us lift up our hearts
and voices together

231
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:55,490
to give Him thanks and praise
for our safe passage...

232
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,985
Father, mother,
this is Pieter,

233
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,319
our butcher's son...
the family's butcher.

234
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,791
Sir, mistress,
I'm glad to meet you.

235
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:24,354
So, the butcher...
that's a good trade.

236
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:27,798
Griet is the hardest to please
of all our customers.

237
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:31,600
Aye, she gets that from me.

238
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:35,532
There now, I forgot.

239
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,600
We must speak with
Willem Jansson.

240
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:40,475
Griet, you go on
with Pieter there.

241
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,416
- Man: Good morning.
- So Griet...

242
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,890
where is that smile
you owe me,

243
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,587
when I have been so clever
as to track you down?

244
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:00,231
You had nothing better
to do.

245
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,406
Woman #1: Shocking.
She should know better.

246
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:14,913
Woman #2:
She should at her age.

247
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:21,812
When I saw you with Tanneke I thought
you were a little Catholic girl.

248
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:31,554
He started a new painting.

249
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,700
There's no buyer.

250
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:38,226
He won't even let me see it.

251
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,136
But he's working again.

252
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,504
It usually takes him longer.

253
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,120
Man: Good.

254
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:36,254
Very good.
Keep it level all the time.

255
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,141
Do you know what it is?

256
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:34,049
A camera obscura.

257
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,865
Look into the glass.

258
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,484
Here. Put this on.

259
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,508
(gasping)

260
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,061
You can see?

261
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:27,568
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry about the robe.

262
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,971
What did you see?

263
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:34,174
I saw the painting.

264
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,241
But...

265
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,052
how did it get in there?

266
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:50,719
See this?

267
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,992
This is called "a lens."

268
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,560
Beams of reflected light
from that corner pass through it...

269
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:01,330
into the box...
so that we can see it here.

270
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,238
Is it real?

271
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,506
It's an image.

272
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:09,174
A picture made of light.

273
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:13,845
Does the box show you
what to paint?

274
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:22,953
It helps.

275
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:33,330
Girl #1: You didn't get me.
I got you.

276
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,771
Girl #2: No, you're cheating.

277
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:36,809
Girl #1: Oh, do we have to play this?

278
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,202
Girl #1: So...

279
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,113
- Girl #1: Stop it.
- Girl #2: Oh, look Cornelia.

280
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,377
There.

281
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,579
Now you're it.

282
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,781
- I've got it.
- I've got it.

283
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:50,811
Yes I can.

284
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:52,256
- No way.
- It's mine.

285
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,817
- No.
- I'll catch it.

286
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:56,385
Man: Cornelia!

287
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,234
I won't tell you again.

288
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,595
Woman: Girls, come inside.

289
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:07,663
- Why?
- Come on. Don't make a fuss.

290
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:41,305
It's dirty now.

291
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:41,131
(giggling)

292
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,010
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Shh...

293
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,615
Stay.

294
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,381
Lead white.

295
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:42,323
From the cupboard.

296
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,390
Please let me see your hair.

297
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,770
What color is it?

298
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,465
Brown.

299
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:31,866
Straight or curly?

300
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,208
Neither.

301
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:36,977
Long?

302
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:40,474
- Very long?
- No.

303
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,988
My mother will expect me home.

304
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:49,517
She knows where you are, Griet.

305
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:07,273
- (steps)
- You're looking at it?

306
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:11,682
Well...

307
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,948
Nothing is the right color.

308
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:18,322
This is the base color.

309
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,985
It gives the tone...

310
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,655
shadow in the light.

311
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,721
And when it's dry...

312
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:27,960
I glaze over it with blue, but...

313
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,764
thinly, so that
the black shows through.

314
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,706
Look, Griet.

315
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,076
Look at the clouds.

316
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,186
What color are they?

317
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,861
White?

318
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,992
No...
not white.

319
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:11,841
Yellow.

320
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:18,315
Blue...
and grey.

321
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,387
There are colors
in the clouds.

322
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,897
Now you understand.

323
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,620
Thinking about
your butcher boy?

324
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,141
Come.

325
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:32,521
This... is ruby shellac.

326
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:42,966
Gum arabic.

327
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,904
Wine skin.

328
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:56,007
This will make verdigris.

329
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,374
Malachite.

330
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:04,851
Vermilion.

331
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,793
That...

332
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,762
linseed oil.

333
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:19,131
Bone black.

334
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:22,072
An you grind it with a muller,
like this.

335
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:32,845
You try.

336
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,295
Twist from the shoulder.

337
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:53,229
It's like this.

338
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,610
- (baby crying)
- Mistress: Griet!

339
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,476
The child needs a draught.

340
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,924
My mother will not be content
till one of them dies from her meanness.

341
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:49,950
Come on.

342
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,589
You will need...

343
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:03,536
On the master's account.

344
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:19,124
- Griet.
- Sir?

345
00:44:20,993 --> 00:44:23,120
I want you to get something
for me, too.

346
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:25,886
I want some colors.

347
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:31,000
My wife need not know.

348
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:39,134
This is too thin.

349
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:02,493
Did you get the lapis?

350
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:08,461
You can mix the colors.

351
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:11,762
Mix the colors?

352
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:14,866
Sir, I haven't time.

353
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:18,376
Make time.

354
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,227
(baby crying)

355
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:44,259
(snoring)

356
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:50,635
Mistress: Nurse!

357
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:54,110
- Nurse.
- Nurse: I'm coming.

358
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:00,918
Mistress: Nurse! Come on!
Quickly.

359
00:47:32,484 --> 00:47:35,180
How much longer is the wet nurse
to be with us, mistress?

360
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:37,812
I don't know.

361
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,086
A month or so.

362
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,286
No, Cornelia,
not my pearls.

363
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:43,920
A month or more.

364
00:47:46,966 --> 00:47:47,955
Why?

365
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,025
What's it to you?

366
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,867
Well, she's eating us out of house
and home for a start.

367
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:55,396
She must eat for the baby.

368
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:59,706
All I'm saying is, I can't cook
twice as much and have no sleep at all.

369
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:01,975
Tell her to be quiet, then.

370
00:48:02,014 --> 00:48:04,380
If I could just go back to the cellar...

371
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:05,781
Well, you can't.

372
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,283
Griet has your place.

373
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:18,355
Why not move Tanneke back?

374
00:48:24,105 --> 00:48:26,164
Put a mattress in the attic
for Griet.

375
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,572
Tanneke can sleep soundly...

376
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:33,008
and Griet can clean the studio
before she comes down in the morning.

377
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:38,949
My jewels.

378
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,447
You always have my jewels
up there to paint.

379
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:45,720
She...

380
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:48,426
You lock up at night,

381
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,327
open it in the morning.

382
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:05,678
There.
Are you satisfied, Tanneke?

383
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:07,180
Yes, mistress.

384
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:35,935
Got it.
I win again.

385
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,562
No, we are drawing.

386
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:39,698
- Well, I do.
- No you don't.

387
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:46,803
No need to go
to the fish market tomorrow.

388
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:49,315
Mistress wants eggs.

389
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,114
No...

390
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:59,058
she cannot abide the smell
when she's with child.

391
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,792
So soon?

392
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,199
As if there weren't enough mouths
to feed already.

393
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:11,193
Still...

394
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:13,939
what can you do, eh?

395
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,565
Men.

396
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:58,414
Marvelous.

397
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:02,785
No, Jan.

398
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:09,221
(laughing)

399
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,901
Why did you move the chair?

400
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:18,502
She looked trapped.

401
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,612
(distant thunder)

402
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:40,857
Maria: Griet!

403
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,927
Are you up there?

404
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,950
One of my tortoiseshell combs
is gone.

405
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:20,136
Mistress:
She's nothing but trouble.

406
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,411
Griet: Master, I did not do it.

407
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,384
Help me.

408
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:47,125
Tanneke: Please.
Let me look for you.

409
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:49,294
Maertge: Papa?

410
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:51,861
- Father?
- Tanneke: Don't!

411
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:54,032
Leave it alone. I'll find it.
Please, sir.

412
00:57:54,107 --> 00:57:56,268
Mistress: What's going on?
What are you doing?

413
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:01,236
Stop it!

414
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,509
For heaven's sake,

415
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,278
you're scaring the children.

416
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:08,552
What are you doing?

417
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,366
Cornelia.

418
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,981
(groaning)

419
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:50,024
She's dishonest.

420
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:52,827
Always sneaking around.
Shirking her work.

421
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:57,263
Tanneke has complained of it.

422
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:59,465
Creeping upstairs all day long.

423
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:04,034
My daughter is right,
there has been too much sneaking about.

424
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:06,170
I only took her
out of charity.

425
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:09,181
- If I thought she'd be...
- With another child due

426
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,945
we need the extra help.

427
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:13,077
Fit in all your work

428
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,578
and do not slack
or it will be the worst for you.

429
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,423
I shall invite Master Van Ruijven.

430
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,429
Johannes must have
a new commission.

431
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:27,197
Get back to work.

432
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,283
Van Ruijven: All these girls.

433
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:55,853
The boys will soon
be swarming around like flies.

434
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,091
I tell you, if I was
a few years younger...

435
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:01,464
A connoisseur in everything,
Master Van Ruijven.

436
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:06,700
But you should be faithful
to one mistress above all others...

437
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,600
Art.

438
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:13,612
Your name will surely be famed
as one of the great patrons.

439
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,013
With your exquisite taste,

440
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:21,043
your subtle understanding
of allegory and allusion...

441
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:24,717
No, no, stop it, stop it. My God, woman,
you could sell sour milk to cows.

442
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:27,192
Now what is it you want?

443
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:28,785
A group painting.

444
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,389
Yourself and Emilie.

445
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,524
Your lovely daughter too.

446
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:36,764
Or...

447
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,101
a merry company.

448
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,868
Wine...

449
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,875
a good meal on your table.

450
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:45,878
Your friends all about.
Music.

451
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:49,075
- And dancing.
- It's better. Better, better.

452
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:50,583
I'll take your bait.

453
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,949
The picture, several figures.

454
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:57,320
A merry gathering,
but no family portrait.

455
01:00:57,357 --> 01:01:02,522
And if I'm to spend
tedious hours sitting

456
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:06,089
I want something
I can rest my eyes on.

457
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:08,966
I think she ought to be
in the painting.

458
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,471
A tavern scene.
It will make a change for you.

459
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,407
Griet could come and serve me.

460
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:19,443
Look at her, man.

461
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:22,346
How hard is it
to paint a pretty girl?

462
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:25,980
Can I have her?

463
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:00,411
Griet, there's been talk
of you.

464
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:04,653
I've done nothing.

465
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:09,219
Van Ruijven's cook says
you're to be painted with her master.

466
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:13,631
You'll have heard about him and the maid
that was painted before?

467
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,000
- You shouldn't believe gossip.
- Oh, I don't.

468
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:23,533
I'll tell Pieter
you asked after him.

469
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:27,146
Liver?

470
01:02:27,214 --> 01:02:28,681
Griet.

471
01:02:28,715 --> 01:02:30,410
You've heard?

472
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,576
I heard.

473
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:35,047
No smoke without fire,
they say.

474
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:39,790
- Is that what you think?
- No.

475
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:43,853
You're only a maid,
what can you do?

476
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:48,093
- I must get back.
- Don't walk away. Listen to me.

477
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,596
Just remember who you are.

478
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,710
Don't get caught up
in his world.

479
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,508
I am only a maid,

480
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:03,141
but I would never give in
to Master Van Ruijven.

481
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:04,980
I wasn't talking
about Van Ruijven.

482
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:19,962
Van Ruijven:
Ah, you girl, Griet.

483
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,558
Come here.

484
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:24,263
What were you doing today?
I missed you.

485
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:27,095
We both did.

486
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:31,634
I hear you've been of great use
to your master, pretty Griet.

487
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:34,908
All that grinding and stirring, eh?

488
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:39,545
Master and maid.

489
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:42,054
It's a tune we all know.

490
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:47,457
And you can practice together now
that we've made our bargain. Eh, Jan?

491
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:50,992
You won't forget, will you?

492
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:53,758
Good.

493
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,724
- What should I...?
- No.

494
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:31,102
No. I already... already begun
a group painting.

495
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:36,833
You're not to sit with Master
Van Ruijven, that much is agreed.

496
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:40,979
Thank you, sir.

497
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:45,484
I'm to paint you alone.

498
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:06,797
My daughter must not hear
of this other painting in her condition.

499
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:13,744
It's to hang
in his private cabinet.

500
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:17,907
He's no fool,
mind you.

501
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:21,250
An he won't be taken for one,
so don't think otherwise.

502
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:26,685
You're a fly in his web.

503
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,689
We all are.

504
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:43,242
Man: You've to admit, my friend,
French swords are the best.

505
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,717
Tomorrow morning.

506
01:05:53,987 --> 01:05:55,921
I cannot, I have work.

507
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:58,390
Find a way.

508
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:23,716
The front of your cap,
fold it back.

509
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:44,332
Take off your cap.

510
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:52,310
No, sir.

511
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:54,210
I cannot.

512
01:06:54,247 --> 01:06:56,977
Cannot?

513
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,484
I will not.

514
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,680
I need to see
your face.

515
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:03,712
The cap covers too much.

516
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:14,860
There's some cloth
in the storeroom.

517
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,836
You know, I've a mind to go up there
one day and surprise him

518
01:08:28,908 --> 01:08:30,205
in the act.

519
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,980
But you said yourself
it's very dull.

520
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:38,347
Oh, not with Emilie

521
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:41,615
when he's alone with some
young beauty.

522
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,654
Have you ever notice how
he never bothers with old women?

523
01:08:46,693 --> 01:08:49,526
Only the young pretty ones.

524
01:08:49,562 --> 01:08:51,223
On their own.

525
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,027
You'll have to wait then.

526
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:57,530
He makes only one painting
at a time.

527
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:00,505
Is that so?

528
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:46,244
Mistress: Jan?

529
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:51,454
Jan?
My necklace.

530
01:10:36,903 --> 01:10:39,098
Haven't you finished yet?

531
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:54,614
I'll be in my studio
until dinner.

532
01:11:08,234 --> 01:11:09,963
Open your mouth.

533
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,267
Sir?

534
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:17,036
Open your mouth.

535
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:22,741
Less.

536
01:11:26,452 --> 01:11:28,647
Now lick your lips.

537
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:42,432
Again.

538
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:02,745
Again.

539
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:06,088
(steps, door closing)

540
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:08,889
Girl:
Got you, got you, got you!

541
01:12:41,994 --> 01:12:43,859
Wear these.

542
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:00,743
Good.

543
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:13,252
Look, Griet.

544
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:17,624
Point of light in the shadow of the neck
leading the eye.

545
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:18,652
Jan.

546
01:13:27,306 --> 01:13:28,671
Sir.

547
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:31,801
- Do not ask this of me.
- It's needed.

548
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:34,210
The composition,
it's not balanced.

549
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,181
I've seen you paint
with no one there.

550
01:13:36,215 --> 01:13:38,479
You want me to imagine
how the earring would look?

551
01:13:38,518 --> 01:13:40,179
My ears are not pierced.

552
01:13:48,895 --> 01:13:51,193
She'll find out.

553
01:13:57,103 --> 01:13:58,832
This has to be, Griet.

554
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,630
See for yourself.

555
01:14:20,393 --> 01:14:22,759
You looked inside me.

556
01:15:21,888 --> 01:15:23,253
I've got you!

557
01:15:25,057 --> 01:15:27,753
Now hold still.
I want to look at you.

558
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:30,656
Now, girl...

559
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:34,188
tell me how you get on
up there.

560
01:15:34,233 --> 01:15:36,599
Has he found his composition?

561
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:39,662
Do you move him?
Do you inspire him?

562
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:44,005
Tell me, has the master's brush
unlocked the secrets of your heart?

563
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:51,373
Ripe as a plum...
still unplucked.

564
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,247
What's he playing at?

565
01:15:54,253 --> 01:15:58,553
He made a bargain with me.
He's painting you at my pleasure.

566
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:07,522
- No!
- I've waited long enough.

567
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:10,195
What a great fool he is.

568
01:16:11,537 --> 01:16:13,266
Don't fight.

569
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:20,137
No! No!

570
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:22,009
Woman: Griet?

571
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:28,209
Not a word.

572
01:16:28,254 --> 01:16:30,381
You'll lose your place.

573
01:16:33,893 --> 01:16:35,690
He won't look at you again.

574
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:38,261
Woman: Griet!

575
01:16:41,534 --> 01:16:43,331
Ah, there you are, my dear.

576
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:46,497
The maid
kept me talking with some...

577
01:16:46,539 --> 01:16:48,439
cock and bull story.

578
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,512
Well, girl?

579
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:34,243
What's to be done?

580
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:38,212
Master Van Ruijven
wants his paintings...

581
01:17:38,257 --> 01:17:40,282
and he will bear no more delay.

582
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:44,552
If he crosses Van Ruijven over this...

583
01:17:44,597 --> 01:17:46,690
he will lose him.

584
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:48,893
Then what?

585
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:16,919
My daughter is out for the day.

586
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:21,633
Do it now.

587
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:12,450
You do it.

588
01:20:59,124 --> 01:21:00,421
Look at me.

589
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,723
Now turn your head,
not your shoulders.

590
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,497
Look at me.

591
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:13,705
There, that's it.

592
01:22:22,908 --> 01:22:24,068
I'll see you later.

593
01:23:15,361 --> 01:23:17,158
Don't rush away,
Griet, please.

594
01:23:20,332 --> 01:23:22,232
Leave the house.

595
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:25,134
Join me and Paul
in the meat market.

596
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,899
- I must get back.
- I'll fetch your things,

597
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:28,304
I'll send someone.

598
01:23:28,374 --> 01:23:29,864
No.

599
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:34,777
Our own life, Griet...
answering to no one.

600
01:23:36,548 --> 01:23:38,413
Marry me.

601
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:47,045
(fast-paced steps)

602
01:24:49,354 --> 01:24:51,447
(loud, distant arguing)

603
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,222
Mistress: Laughing at me
in my own house.

604
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:58,821
I will see for myself.
No one will stop me.

605
01:24:58,864 --> 01:25:01,355
There is nothing to see.
You're making yourself ridiculous.

606
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,492
Maria: Calm, my dear.

607
01:25:02,534 --> 01:25:05,059
Mistress:
I will not be calm!

608
01:25:05,104 --> 01:25:06,799
Am I a child?!

609
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,170
Does no one speak the truth to me
in my own house?

610
01:25:10,242 --> 01:25:13,734
By all the saints, if you would stop
screaming for a moment, I can explain.

611
01:25:13,812 --> 01:25:14,938
More lies?!

612
01:25:15,013 --> 01:25:18,449
I don't want to hear
any more of your lies, Mother.

613
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:20,985
I have a right to know.

614
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:31,085
So.

615
01:25:33,966 --> 01:25:35,695
No more hiding now.

616
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:37,895
Here I am.

617
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:41,771
I want to see this painting.

618
01:25:44,376 --> 01:25:46,173
There's no point.

619
01:25:46,245 --> 01:25:48,679
No point?!

620
01:25:50,482 --> 01:25:53,645
I am too stupid to look
at a painting now?

621
01:25:56,922 --> 01:26:00,221
She can't read!
You know that?

622
01:26:00,259 --> 01:26:02,784
Sit down.
You'll exhaust yourself.

623
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:03,886
Why can't I look?

624
01:26:03,929 --> 01:26:07,023
It's just a commission. Gone
in a few days. You need never see it.

625
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:12,127
They are just paintings.

626
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:15,698
Pictures, for money.
They mean nothing.

627
01:26:24,616 --> 01:26:27,414
Is it true she wore my pearls?

628
01:26:35,561 --> 01:26:37,586
How could you?

629
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,292
How could you?

630
01:26:54,046 --> 01:26:55,911
Show me this painting.

631
01:26:55,948 --> 01:26:57,813
You'll make yourself ill.

632
01:26:57,849 --> 01:26:59,749
You show me.

633
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:29,614
It's obscene.

634
01:27:40,726 --> 01:27:42,853
Why don't you paint me?

635
01:27:42,894 --> 01:27:44,486
Because you don't understand!

636
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:47,589
And she does?

637
01:27:55,173 --> 01:27:56,265
(screaming)

638
01:28:15,427 --> 01:28:18,794
No!
Get out of here!

639
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:25,962
Get out of my house!

640
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:12,271
(steps)

641
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:58,043
I've come
to the right place, then.

642
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,414
Tanneke?

643
01:32:04,022 --> 01:32:05,649
This is for you.
