00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,045
Donna:
Every story starts somewhere.

2
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,319
And mine begins in a small town
called silver springs, nevada.

3
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,491
My mother was an ex-show girl.

4
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,723
Emphasis on the "ex."

5
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,957
There's my father.

6
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,468
He came by for the beer.

7
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,733
Whoa. Oh, my god.
Look at this.

8
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,900
Oh, my god!

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,410
Happy birthday, donna

10
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,570
whoa, whoa

11
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,978
i didn't get to blow out
my candles.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,415
But i do remember my wish.

13
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,748
That i could get as far away

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,482
from silver springs
as possible.

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,636
Well, that didn't happen.

16
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,040
Come on, sweetie.

17
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,870
My mom, always optimistic,

18
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,916
was on her fourth
husband, pete.

19
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,577
Come on, baby.
Come on.

20
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,815
Rodne y:
Ugh. What happened?

21
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,119
Rodney. His son.

22
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,320
No need for dna testing
on that one.

23
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,359
I still had my mind
on a different life

24
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,696
beyond silver springs.

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,828
Then i met tommy,
the high school quarterback.

26
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,565
Boy, was he a great kisser.

27
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,335
Together, i knew
we were going places.

28
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,310
He went as far as
assistant manager at big lots

29
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,472
and used his pull to get me a
job in the luggage department.

30
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,847
This is the best bag
money can buy. Bar none.

31
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:02,285
You've got the nylon twill
with dupont protective coating.

32
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,414
This is the bag you use
when you fly?

33
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,322
Well...

34
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,452
i've actually never been
on an airplane,

35
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,997
but if i ever get to go on one,

36
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,501
this thing is gonna follow me
around like my own little dog.

37
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,468
My birthday came,

38
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,903
and i didn't have to make
the same old wish.

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,203
Tommy and i had found
our way out.

40
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,571
Hey. I caught you.

41
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,135
Donna. Hey.

42
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,374
I thought you didn't get off
till 8:00.

43
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,043
I got becky to cover for me.

44
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,617
Oh.

45
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,421
Oh!

46
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,822
Now that you're here...

47
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,485
let me have the card.

48
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,051
No, no.
It's silly.

49
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,030
Just forget about it.
It's actually kind of corny.

50
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,363
Hey, i brought that dress
that you like.

51
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,867
Want to watch me change?

52
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,927
- No, hey, donna.
- Ah!

53
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,801
Don't read that.

54
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,670
Come on.
I like things that are corny.

55
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,708
You're breaking up with me?

56
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,478
In a birthday card?

57
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,010
Why?

58
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,385
Well, they don't make
breaking-up cards.

59
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,390
[Gasps]
I thought that...

60
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,392
we had plans.

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,088
[Sighs, groans]

62
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,327
Donna, don't take this
the wrong way.

63
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,835
I decided to take
somebody else to tucson.

64
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,165
Somebody else?

65
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,603
Yeah.

66
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,603
Linda from lawn chairs.

67
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,305
Actually, it's brenda
in barbecues.

68
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,346
Look, donna,
you're a great girl.

69
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,849
Really, you are.

70
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,148
But with this promotion
and transfer to tucson,

71
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,451
i just need to
shake things up a bit.

72
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,354
Business is business.

73
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,655
Come on, donna.
Face it.

74
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,025
You're a small-town girl.

75
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,690
You belong here.

76
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,995
Announcer: We're back
with more "pure oxygen,"

77
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,433
talking to sally weston.

78
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,764
Can you tell our viewers

79
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,032
the moment you decided
to change your life?

80
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,733
I left my job at big lots

81
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,299
and thought about becoming
an alcoholic.

82
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,676
Just kidding.

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
[Sighs]

84
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,880
But then something happened.

85
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,443
There i was
with garbage in front of me.

86
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,148
The worst moment of my life.

87
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,123
I thought,
"what am i gonna do?"

88
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,183
For a second i was real scared.

89
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,059
Since i was a girl,
all i heard from people was,

90
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,860
"you are nothing.
Nothing is what you deserve."

91
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,867
But that night
something clicked.

92
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,995
And i just knew
i was worth something.

93
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,005
From a little girl
in west texas

94
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,064
to the world's most famous
flight attendant.

95
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,236
Author of "my life in the sky."
Can we get a shot of that?

96
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,438
Motivational speaker.

97
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,413
I'm curious.
Why'd you pick flying?

98
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,508
No matter how much i love
that sleepy little town,

99
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,883
none of my dreams
were waiting down there.

100
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,616
They were waiting up there.

101
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,649
And frankly, people,
no matter where you're from,

102
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,924
no matter who people
think you are,

103
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,932
you can be whatever you want.

104
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,534
But you got to start right now.

105
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,230
Right this second, in fact.

106
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,704
But how?

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,605
You should start
by buying my book.

108
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,735
I agree.
But you can't have my copy.

[Tires screech]

112
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,693
I took sally's advice.

113
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,399
Sure, sierra airlines wasn't
the biggest and the best.

114
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,307
It was the smallest
and the absolute worst.

115
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,005
But everybody
has to start somewhere.

116
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,044
Donna, why do you want to be
a stewardess?

117
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,211
Well, for all
the travel opportunities.

118
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,584
And for the excitement.

119
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,216
We're a budget airline.
We fly from laughlin to fresno.

Once a week to bakersfield.

We got five planes.
We fly gamblers and drunks.

122
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,466
Right.

123
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,128
I want to provide
those gamblers and drunks

Put your hands on your knees.

166
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,640
They don't want them
flailing about if we crash.

167
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,209
I'm gonna teach you

00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,957
easy as 1-2-3

00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,330
as simple as do-re-mi

a-b-c

175
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,138
1-2-3, baby,
you and me, girl

176
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,231
it's just like a roller coaster.

177
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,603
You ever been
on a plane before?

178
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,669
Well, yeah.

179
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,009
I mean, you know.

180
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,777
Sometimes it helps
if you don't look down.

181
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,480
[Breathing heavily]
I'm doing great.

[Whirring loudly]

183
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,957
Shit!

184
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,586
- It's just the wheels.
- We lost the wheels?

185
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,357
No, donna. Relax.

186
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,455

I am relaxed!

We're gonna crash!

Oh, my god!
We're gonna crash!

Sherry:
Thank you. Fly with us again.

197
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,552
- Enjoy the sights.
- Thanks.

198
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,506
How you doing?

199
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,910
I was terrible.

200
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,178
I couldn't walk.
I spilled the coffee.

201
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,946
I totally freaked out
the passengers.

202
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,545
It wasn't exactly
a frozen lake up there.

203
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,787
Turbulence is tough.
You'll get the hang of it.

204
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,088
Am i gonna get fired?

205
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,891
- I'm gonna get fired.
- Nobody's getting fired.

206
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,228
Really.
You're gonna be a pro.

207
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,063
You're going places.

208
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,093
You think?

209
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,606
I'm a pilot. It's my job to know
where people are going.

210
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,274
One for you.

211
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,753
Put your seat
in the upright position.

212
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,960
Ma'am, would you put
your tray table up?

213
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,998
To fasten your seat belt,
insert the metal fitting.

214
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:10,229
Before long, i was flying
full-speed ahead.

215
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,362
I even got my own trainee.
Christine.

216
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,100
There wasn't a lot to do
on weekends.

217
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,165
There was always tanning
at lake havasu.

218
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,371
I can't believe your boyfriend
owns this whole houseboat.

219
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,744
If you don't marry him,
i am gonna kill you.

220
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,216
First of all, sweetie,
herb ain't asked me.

221
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,219
Oh, my god!

222
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,254
What's wrong?

223

[Laughs]
My clasp broke.

224
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,887
There's some safety pins in
a shoebox in the bedroom closet.

225
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,552
Christine:
Go topless.

226
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,824
You are a very bad
influence on me.

227
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,593
Thank you.

Hey, sherry.
Herb around?

232
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,608
Don't know.
Might be inside.

233
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,811
What'd he do?
Take a leak in the lake?

234
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,014
The guy ran off with my
flare gun and never returned it.

235
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,321
Well, you have my permission
to teach that man a lesson.

any backup.

Do i look like a herb?

No, ma'am.
You look nothing like a herb.

I'd appreciate it

if you could find it
in your heart to forgive me.

all lined up.

that i would look for the thing
that would make me most happy.

to the gift shop

327
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,583
and get a toblerone.

328
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,415
Right.

329
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,320
You know what?

330
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,590
What?

331
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,597
We are as good as they are.

332
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,791
- We are?
- We are?

333
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,664
We don't have to spend our lives

334
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,260
working at sierra
for some weaselly ex-bookie.

335
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,829
You know,
i once worked for pan am.

336
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,772
Three whole months.

337
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,276
Uniforms were natural fiber.

338
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,471
What happened?

339
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,945
They went bust.

340
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,914
So you started working
for sierra?

341
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,508
I needed a job.
Nobody else was hiring.

342
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,314
Well, they're hiring now.

343
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,889
Royalty airlines job fair.

344
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,861
This weekend at the
marriot hotel in san francisco.

345
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,132
You guys,
this could be so good.

346
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,863
Who's in?

347
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,134
Oh, oh

348
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,473
livin' on a prayer

349
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,012

350
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,548
we can make it, i swear

351
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,207
oh, oh

352
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,650
livin' on a prayer

353
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,485
ohhh, we're halfway there

354
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,047
oh, oh

355
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,116
livin' on a prayer

356
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,025
take my hand

357
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,189
we'll make it, i swear

358
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,925
oh, oh

359
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,559
livin' on a prayer

360
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,702
woman:
This is our brochure.

361
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,574
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

362
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,274
"No person may serve
as a flight attendant

363
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,340
unless that person
has demonstrated

364
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,409
to the pilot in command

365
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,888
familiarity with
the necessary functions

366
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,551
to be performed in..."
oh, my god.

367
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,617
You dot your i's
with little hearts?

368
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,026
That's so cute.

369
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,497
Yeah, well,
it's my trademark.

370
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,261
That and my hickeys.

371
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,001
Well, a girl's got to have
a skill.

372
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,065
I was excited to be interviewed
by the legendary john whitney.

373
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,407
He had been with royalty
a long time.

374
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,604
Hi.

375
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,375
I'm john whitney.

376
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,017
Maybe a little too long.

377
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,450
This one.

378
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,614
Head of the royalty flight-
attendant trainee program.

379
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,785
Tell me, why do you want to work
for royalty airlines?

380
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,389
I believe that i have a lot
to offer your airline.

381
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,093
Because the planes are...

382
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,602
they're so much bigger.

383
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,571
Oh. My gum.

384
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,076
Why do you want to work
for royalty airlines?

385
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,838
Oh, well...

386
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,403
[chuckles]
I've got a lot of answers.

387
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,540
I just got to think
of the right one.

388
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,380
Take your time.
Collect. Gather. Go.

389
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,216
Because i'm organized
and efficient.

390
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,883
I worked for sierra airlines,
you know.

391
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,392
I put that down there.

392
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,257
Yeah, right above hooters.

393
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,421
Hooters.

394
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,589
Right. Oh, yes.

395
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,997
If there is a task,
i will not stop

396
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,627
until i have completed it
perfectly.

397
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,136
Did i say "organized"?

398
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,002
- Got a question for you.
- Okay.

399
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,167
What's your tolerance level
for pain?

400
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,733
Physical pain.

401
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,008
Like, sexual pain?

402
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,276
Would you consider yourself
a people person?

403
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,181
Oh, definitely.
Big people person.

404
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,413
- Not just big people.
- Not just giants.

405
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,579
- You got it.
- Okay.

406
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,591
To learn and to follow through
with all the tasks.

407
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,524
I'm just gonna say a few words.

408
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,584
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,129
Didgeridoo.

410
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,630
Scooby doo-doo.

411
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,166
Tectonic plates.

412
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,600
Tectonic plates.

413
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,658
Dishware.

414
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,501
- Do you handle surprises well?
- [Both laugh]

415
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,234
Do you handle surprises well?

416
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,606
[Both laugh]

417
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,110
I scared you, didn't i?

418
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,646
No, no.

419
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,808
It has always been my dream
to work for the best.

420
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,147
And i think you guys
are the best.

421
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,346
That's just terrific.

422
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,219
You're terrific, how about?

423
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,290
No. This one.

424
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,955
It's called strabismus.

425
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,899
There's no business
like "strobusiness."

426
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,560
I get to make jokes.

427
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,139
Does anything frighten you?

428
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,903
Oh, you mean the eye?

429
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,471
I didn't notice.

430
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,611
Oh, my god.

431
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,520
You're kidding.

432
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,253
That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

433
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,352
But this is so unfair.

434
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,455
You're a better flight attendant
than we'll ever be.

435
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,863
I'll be fine.

436
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,460
I been thinking about
quitting anyway.

437
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,267
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

438
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,503
We're gonna miss you, too.

439
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:58,075
Study hard.
And make me proud.

440
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,014
Congratulations
to donna jensen.

441
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,184
Getting into
the royalty learning center.

442
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,528
[Sighs]
I'm nervous.

443
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,464
People say it's really hard.

444
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,265
A lot of people don't make it
past the first two weeks.

445
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,067
I don't want to be one of them.

446
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,231
Are you kidding me?

447
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,207
They would have never
picked you

448
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,403
unless they thought
you could handle it.

449
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,242
You're smart. You're beautiful.
You're charming.

450
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,645
You're gonna do great.

451
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,648
Wow!

452
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,117
You give one hell of a pep talk.

453
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,020
I got a lot of that back home.
My parents are big cheerleaders.

454
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,617
Sally always says that the
greatest asset somebody can have

455
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,059
is having people
who believe in them.

456
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,926
Who's sally?
Your aunt?

457
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,124
She's kind of like a friend.

458
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,598
[Donna laughing]

459
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,194
- Oh.
- Yeah.

460
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,536
Oh, you know, we're gonna have
a little goodbye party

461
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,838
friday night
from 7:00 to whenever.

462
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,434
Oh, yeah.

463
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,743
Well, i'm probably
not gonna make it.

464
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,347
Why not?

465
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,546
I can be happy for you
that you're leaving for an hour.

466
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,920
But 7:00 till whenever,
the smile won't last.

467
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,620
Yeah, our timing is
kind of terrible, huh?

468
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,994
I had a really good time,
and i was hoping you'd be a jerk

469
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,092
so i wouldn't feel like i was
missing out by moving to texas.

470
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,534
Well, i'm parked out there.

471
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,542
Yeah, i'm...

472
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,542
right.

473
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,908
So...

474
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,950
[sighs]

475
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,718
The only kiss we got here
is a goodbye kiss,

476
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,887
which, as kisses go,
not my favorite.

477
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,227
So...
[clears throat]

478
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,229
- Goodbye, donna jensen.
- Bye.

479
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,635
Good luck in school.

480
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,763
Oh, thank you.

481
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,831
Don't run with scissors.

482
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,812
Why can't all choices
be simple?

483
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,045
Why can't they all be
window or aisle?

484
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,314
Coffee or tea?

485
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,822
Not career or romance.

486
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,858
John:
B. That's a fun one.

487
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,484
Now take off.
[Laughs]

488
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,886
- Hi.
- Hi.

489
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,158

Would you like to ride

Oh, i'm sorry.
How about you, randy?

Just consider me
one of the girls, mr. W.

00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,910
This is a really big house
you have, mrs. Weston.

Oh, that is a cute story.

542
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:08,424
Jack was flying to maui to build
the kaanapali towers resort.

543
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,859
I was serving him.
This was first-class.

544
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,387
He must have pushed
that call button 20 times.

545
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,061
"More warm nuts.
More warm nuts."

546
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,401
No man alive could eat
that many warm nuts.

547
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,033
So then,
when i saw this huge pile

548
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,476
of warm nuts under his seat,
it hit me.

549
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,412
It wasn't the nuts he wanted.
It was me!

550
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,177
All: Oh!

551

Where have you been
all my life, mr. Man?

552
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,518
What was it like, mrs. Weston,
when you started flying?

00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,218
Sally, please.

554

Oh, it was wonderful.

The exotic cities.

Nope. Not all.

those international routes?

- You have to have seniority.
- Should i apply now?

560
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,445
And even then, you have to
speak several languages

561
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,447
and serve impeccably.

562
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,609
Oh, but it was worth it.
It was different then.

People dressed for flights.

564
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,679
It was like every night
going to the opera.

565
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,815
Every night was...

566
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,591
magic.

It's everything i wanted.

573
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,144
You can have everything you
want, too, if you stay focused.

574
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,882
Follow your head,
not your heart.

Mm-hmm.

654
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,670
And on a more personal note,

655
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,044
i have actually felt
a polar bear's nuts. Yeah.

656
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,343
Quite toasty warm.

657
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,405
[Buzzer]

658
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,008
Get those masks on!

659
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,280
Louder!

660
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,790
[Muffled] there's
an oxygen mask up above you

661
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,256
on a hidden shelf.

662
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,385
Before helping the people
who love you...

663
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,396
john:
We learned to keep our heads,

664
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,627
to stay calm, and to not get
freaked out, okay?

665
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,861
Just remember
the h.a.i.t. Principle.

666
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:29,339
Disgruntled passengers are
hungry, angry, lonely, tired,

667
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,272
and have a skewed vision
of the world.

668
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,934
Okay.
So that's h.a.i.t.s.

669
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,809
Hungry, angry, lonely, tired,
skewed vision.

670
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,075
H.a.i.t.s.v.w.

671
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,911
Go!

672
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,712
"Asses the window..."

673
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,050
okay. Stop.

674
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,590
Christine: What?

675
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:52,061
It's assess the window.
Not "asses" the window.

676
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,759
You put the wrong em-phasis
on the wrong syl-lable.

677
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,664
...with a skewed world view,

678
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,637
so really,
it's v.i.c.t.i.m.s.w.v.

679
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,934
But you get my point.

680
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,238
Assess the window!
Is it good to go?

681
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,971
Drop! Drop!

682
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,844
Remove your shoes!
Don't take anything with you!

683
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,177
Whoa! Yes.

684
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,946
Eleven seconds!
The trainee record!

685
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,455
[Cheers and applause]

686
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,019
[Mumbling]

687
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,590
What's the matter?

688
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:30,191
Who am i kidding?
I'm never gonna fly a 747.

689
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,328
Headed right
for royalty express.

690
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,668
Probably wind up in cleveland.

691
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,834
Christine, stop being so hard
on yourself.

692
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,038
- You just have to concentrate.
- That's easy for you to say.

693
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,673
You're headed for new york
and london.

694
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,377
I am not smarter than you, okay?

695
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,513
Who cares, anyway,
what to do in a water landing?

696
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,523
They don't land
in the damn water.

697
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,717
They crash.

698
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,888
People always say that
everyone's good at something.

699
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,331
That everyone has
some sort of hidden skill.

700
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,237
What if i don't?

701
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,035
What if there's nothing
that i'm good at?

702
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,303
What about your hickeys?

703
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,503
Yeah.

704
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,915
Oh. Come on.

705
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,146
Would you stop
beating yourself up?

706
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,746
You are gonna get through this.

707
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,415
Here's what we're gonna do.

708
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,824
Dry those little eyes.

709
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,324
Where'd you get these?

710
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,164
Oh, from sally weston's house.

711
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:43,071
There's a whole bunch of them.
Aren't they cool?

712
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,072
You stole them?

713
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,044
No.
They're guest soap.

714
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,704
We were guests.

715
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,839
They were there for us.

716
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:58,344
Yeah, to use, you know?
Not to take.

717
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,513
Come on.
Everybody does it.

718
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,888
It's no big deal.

719
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,792
Excuse me.
Didn't you read chapter 7?

720
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,298
- Chapter 7.
- Employment and ethics.

721
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,233
If you get caught
stealing anything,

722
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,270
you will get fired like that.

723
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:17,797
You're not mad at me, are you?

724
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,575
No.

725
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,830
Yes!

726
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,299
[Bell rings]

727
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,564
Time's up.

728
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,163
Pencils down.
Books closed.

729
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,766
Remember to write
your identification number

730
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:56,279
on the front of the exam booklet
and pass it forward.

731
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,084
So, how'd you do?

732
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,781
New york, here i come.

733
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,117
[Applause]

734
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,919
Sally:
Thank you.

735
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,756
Thanks so much for listening.
Thank you.

736
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,992
Can i get my picture with you?

737
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,660
I would love that.
Where do you want to do it?

738
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,135
- Okay.
- Can you get the "r" in it?

739
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,501
Say "royalty."

740
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,871
Repeat after me.
First-class international.

741
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,706
Donna:
First-class international.

742
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,742
Woman: Cincinnati.
That's not that bad.

743
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,979
Man:
Miami! I got miami!

744
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,118
Oh, my god!

745
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,522
Oh, my god!
I can't believe it!

746
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,686
[Cheering, laughter]

747
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,195
Hey, donna!

748
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,290
I got new york.
[Laughs]

749
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,733
There must be some mistake.

750
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:55,636
Ms. Jensen, try and take this
news with the poise and grace

751
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,539
that one associates
with royalty airlines.

752
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,840
We expect our employees to
behave in a professional manner

753
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,142
and to handle setbacks
with integrity.

754
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,149
Screw integrity!

755
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,084
I am not going back to commuter!

756
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,178
Donna:
Oh, my god.

757
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,190
I can't believe
this is happening.

758
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,850
This cannot be happening.

759
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:19,054
John: Royalty express,
although commuter,

760
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,361
is still a member
of the royalty family, okay?

761
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,333
It's not my destiny.

762
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,233
I want my destiny.

763
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,566
Well, i'm sorry.

764
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,607
But you'll be eligible
to reapply after one year.

765
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,937
One year?

766
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,501
I was the best in my class.
You were there.

767
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,707
I've seen it a hundred times.

768
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,375
You peaked too soon.

769
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,248
I don't understand.

770
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,912
How do i explain this?

771
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,014
You're what we
in the trainee business call

772
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,683
a "peak-too-sooner."

773
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,386
Yeah.

774
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,326
It happens.

775
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,763
I aced that test.
I want to see it.

776
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,233
- That's not procedure.
- Call sally weston.

777
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:02,136
- She'll tell you.
- Sally weston.

778
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:05,334
Although an excellent mentor,

779
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,536
she has no authority
in these matters.

780
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,806
- That is bullshit.
- Want to know what's bullshit?

781
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,371
Eye exams!
That's what's bullshit!

782
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,714
I wanted my destiny, too,
you know!

783
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,050
I wanted to be
a flight attendant, but no!

784
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:22,149
There's a shit stick out there
called procedure, ms. Jensen!

785
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,625
And i'm here to tell you

786
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,561
that everyone gets hit
with the shit stick!

787
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,224
Eye exam! Eye exam!
Eye exam!

788
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,133
[Breathing heavily]

789
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,831
Forgive me.
[Chuckles]

790
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,635
Dr. Tim at the center says
when i get like this,

791
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,505
i need to refocus.

792
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,637
So just give me a second, okay?

793
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,609
[Bell rings]

794
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,516
[Chanting softly]

[Exhales deeply]

796
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,357
Better. Okay.

797
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,957
Look, you can fly
royalty express for a year,

798
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,092
or you can leave the airline.

799
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,671
Where am i going?

800
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,900
Let me have a look here.

801
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,011
Welcome to cleveland
hopkins international airport.

802
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,142
Remain seated until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop

803
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,812
and the captain has turned off
the "fasten seat belt" sign.

804
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,015
We know you have a choice
when you travel.

805
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,526
We thank you for choosing
royalty express.

806
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,730
I don't know if i mentioned it.
I'm glad i'm working with you.

807
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,062
In cleveland!
Don't you love it?

808
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,226
Terminal tower.
Lake erie.

809
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,167
It's like paris,
except everybody speaks english

810
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,966
and they're 30 pounds
overweight.

811
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,973
We are gonna look so thin.

in the daytime,

813
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,368
you can greet them with
"bonjour!"

814
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,709
Donna: Bonjour!

815
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,147
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

816
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:58,154
If you are talking to a man,
you usually add "monsieur."

817
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,484
Bonjour, monsieur.

818
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,081
Bonjour, monsieur.

819
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:06,118
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Bonjour, monsieur.

820
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,234
Good afternoon.

821
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,998
Welcome aboard
royalty express flight 27.

822
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,404
Two in the rear
and two in the front.

823
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,103
- Cheese sandwich for you?
- Thanks.

824
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,508
Cheese.

825
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,103
We have one cheese left.

826
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,707
- Bologna or cheese?
- Whatever.

827
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,885
Can i take this chair?

828
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,725
Sure.

829
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,059
- Hey!
- What?

830
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,723
You told me to take it.

831
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,893
Ted!

832
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,596
Hey, donna.

833
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,399
Oh, my god!

834
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,064
I'm great.

835
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,868
Oh. You didn't ask me
how i was.

836
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,913
No, but now that you told me.

837
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,415
What are you doing
in cleveland?

838
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,213
I live here.
Around the corner. Yeah.

839
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,550
This is royalty's hub.

840
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,385
Well, express.

841
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,788
You're kidding.

842
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,984
Mary: Ted.

843
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,587
Oh, one sec.

844
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,223
That's my partner, mary.

845
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,925
Hello.

846
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,491
Hi.

847
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,662
Wow.

848
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,069
She's pretty.

849
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,834
Oh, no.
My school partner.

850
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,141
Oh.

851
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,311
I'm in law school.

852
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,472
Oh, my god!

853
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,345
That is so great.

854
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,407
It's unbelievable, huh?

855
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,680
So i've got one year
in cleveland.

856
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,619
Then i can reapply.

857
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,785
I've been here for six weeks,
and it's not so bad.

858
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,851
Well, you're basically
halfway there

859
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:48,558
if you're just really,
really bad at math.

860
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,667
So, why'd you go back
to law school?

861
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,965
I had dinner
with this incredible woman

862
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,973
who was charging after
her dreams and not hiding out.

863
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,271
I thought to myself,
"i could do that."

864
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,141
So i'm here now for a year.
It's flying by.

865
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,045
I really miss my family,
which is uncool.

866
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,709
So please don't tell anybody
i told you.

867
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:08,877
I promise.

868
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,614
Okay, here's how i look at it.

869
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,816
Cleveland is like this
great, big, giant waiting room.

870
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,325
All we have to do
is put in our year

871
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,224
and somebody's gonna call
our name.

872
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,059
Cleveland's like this great,
big dentist's office,

873
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,723
and we're next on the list.

874
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,563
Exactly.

875
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,897
Now all we have to do

876
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,632
is think about something
to occupy our time.

877
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,932
Mm-hmm.

878
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,271
Hmm.

879
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,516
For once in my life,
i have someone who needs me

880
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:43,349
someone i've needed so long

881
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,187
for once, unafraid,
i can go where life leads me

882
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,853
somehow
i know i'll be strong

883
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,090
for once, i can touch

884
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,327
what my heart
used to dream of

885
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,063
sometimes, just when
you brace yourself

886
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,661
for a really bumpy flight,

887
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,334
it's amazing how the skies
can suddenly clear.

888
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,274
But between my busy schedule

889
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,835
and the extra job ted took
to pay for school,

890
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,006
i spent too many nights
ordering pizza

891
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,175
and watching tn t.

892
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,850
[Knock on door]

893
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,252
Just a minute.

894
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,957
Small cheese pizza
with everything.

895
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,724
$8 even.

896
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,401
Just call me a sucker
for a man in uniform.

897
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,965
I cannot believe
we got this route.

898
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,411
Oh, my god.
A real business class?

899
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,812
[Laughs]

900
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,317
And guess what i get to do
in half an hour.

901
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,148
- Bake cookies.
- Oh, my god.

902
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,053
You are so not
royalty express material.

903
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,148
I can't believe on a test
you're as bad as me.

904
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,453
You studied like crazy.

905
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,552
Get out of here.

906
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,263
The more i think
about that test,

907
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,900
the more convinced i am
that something got screwed up.

908
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,911
I might hire a lawyer
to check into it.

909
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,106
Hey, you could help me out
with that.

910
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,809
I'm not a lawyer.

911
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,350
Well, you're gonna be.

912
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,851
You think so, huh?

913
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,182
Mm-hmm.

914
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,490
How is it that
you believe in me so much?

915
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,360
- Somebody's got to.
- [Chuckles]

916
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,431
Check out 3b.

917
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,972
Isn't he cute?

918
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,871
Aside from the headphone hair.

919
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,139
When i asked him to put his tray
in its upright position,

920
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,543
he said, "that too?"

921
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,376
I mean, hello.

922
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,177
And those arms.
My god.

923
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,377
He's like something
out of "men's health."

924
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,649
Well, i'll root for you
even though it's against policy.

925
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,953
You rat me out and i'll stop
letting you do my paperwork.

926
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,926
All i want is a little
of what you've got with ted.

927
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,054
Oh, god.
He is great.

928
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,794
Did i tell you he wants me to
meet his family for christmas?

929
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,336
And that's bad news why?

930
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,167
For me, anything that ever
has to do with family

931
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,332
is always bad news.

932
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,874
Please.
Don't make me cry.

933
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,740
The thing is, randy,
i've always been this girl

934
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,144
from silver springs
that everybody's said,

935
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,741
"you're never gonna do anything,
never gonna get out of here."

936
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,548
I just worry that
if i fall in love with ted,

937
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,883
what's gonna happen

938
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,014
to everything i've worked
so hard for?

939
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,389
Okay. Fine.
Don't fall in love with him.

940
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,860
That's kind of why
i'm having the problem.

941
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,692
It just takes willpower.

942
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,198
You didn't fall in love
with me, did you?

943
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,030
You're gay.

944
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,902
But it still took willpower,
didn't it?

945
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,215
Thanks, donna.

946
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,719
Mr. Stewart:
Come over here, justin.

947
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,652
Okay. Who's next?

948
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,711
Ted: Grandma!

949
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,887
- It's from me and ted.
- What?

950
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,792
[Shouting]
She can't hear very well!

951
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,125
It's from donna and me!

952
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,392
Thank you, dear.

953
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,130
What is it?

954
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,195
It's an all-in-one
remote control!

955
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,867
Now you don't have to fuss
with all those gadgets anymore!

956
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,310
Thank you, dear.
Oh, merry christmas, ted.

957
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,979
Thank you, donna.

958
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,949
Now it's your turn.

959
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,950
You said we weren't
gonna do presents.

960
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,250
Just open it.

961
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,088
He said we weren't
gonna do presents.

962
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,787
Ted:
I said that.

963
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,989
- Oh, my god.
- What do you think?

964
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,793
- You like it?
- It's so beautiful.

965
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,458
It has two time zones.

966
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,399
If a passenger asks you
what time it is,

967
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,063
you can think about me.
[Laughs]

968
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,333
I love it.

969
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,238
Mr. Stewart:
She's a great gal.

970
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,401
I think so.

971
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,605
Oh, you're not out
of the woods yet, donna.

972
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,045
You got one more present.

973
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,447
- From all of us.
- [Laughter]

974
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,083
It's the annual
stewart family uniform!

975
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,419
[Laughter]

976
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,789
I got you a medium.

977
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,294
- I hope you like it baggy.
- Thank you.

978
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,992
Time for the team photo!
Everybody get over by grandma.

979
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,465
- Come on, donna.
- Jensen, get in here.

980
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,596
It's a family picture.

981
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,265
Oh, no, donna.
Don't be shy.

982
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,501
Come on, donna.

983
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,372
- It's flashing.
- Quick!

984
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,542
Ted:
Quick. Smile.

985
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,142
All: Cheese.

986
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,018
Well, you survived your first
stewart family christmas.

987
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,458
It was good.

988
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,190
I never knew a family
could be like that.

989
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,165
No fighting.
No yelling.

990
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,636
Normally, that "everyone
dressing the same" thing

991
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,969
would kind of freak me out.

992
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:08,774
But i even like
that dorky red sweater.

993
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,951
Is that all that's going on
in that head of yours?

994
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,691
I'm just not used to all that,
you know?

995
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,036
Dan.

996
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,073
Hi, donna.
How's life treating you?

997
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,405
All right. I want to get
a confirmation for tomorrow.

998
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,466
Sure.

999
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,773
[Typing]

1000
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:46,475
We got you going to pittsburgh
on flight 285 at 0800.

1001
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,950
Any chance of that dallas route
opening up?

1002
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,078
Let me have a look.

1003
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,060
Sorry.
Nothing yet.

1004
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,755
All right.
Well, thank you.

1005
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,764
Have a good trip, donna.

1006
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,790
Oh, my god.
Christine?

1007
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,531
Donna!

1008
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,969
Oh, my god!

1009
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,807
Oh, my god!

1010
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,809
What are you doing
in cleveland?

1011
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,869
My new york-i.a. Flight had
mechanical problems,

1012
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,812
so they dumped us here
for the night.

1013
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,315
Oh, right.

1014
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,409
God.
Look at your hair.

1015
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,454
Oh, yeah, i know.

1016
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,455
I'm going for
a more classic look.

1017
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,956
Goes better with chanel.

1018
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,255
Right.

1019
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:34,593
I have the sweetest little
apartment on west 73rd street.

1020
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,962
Oh, you would be
so proud of me.

1021
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,093
You know what, ted?

1022
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,466
If it wasn't for donna,

1023
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,506
i would've never made it
through basic training.

1024
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,404
Oh, now,
that's not really true.

1025
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,442
It is.

1026
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,909
Actually, just last week,

1027
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,344
i was thinking about
how well you trained me.

1028
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,349
I was on the new york-to-chicago
flight, right?

1029
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:57,513
This guy gets on.
He has this huge musical case.

1030
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,920
He's trying to stuff it
into the overhead compartment.

1031
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,427
Clearly the thing is too big.
He refuses to check it.

1032
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:08,760
So i thought, "what would
donna do right now?"

1033
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,562
So i politely said to him,

1034
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:15,264
"either you check it
or you deplane."

1035
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,337
That's not what i would do.

1036
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,500
What do you mean?

1037
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,238
Well, you must,
as a flight attendant,

1038
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,873
offer the option of buying
another seat at half price

1039
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,314
for that oversized item.

1040
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,852
It's section 23.4
of the manual.

1041
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,787
Well, i can't remember
everything.

1042
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,448
[Laughs]

1043
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,924
But you should've
remembered that one.

1044
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,018
It was the last question
on our exam.

1045
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,524
Say, christine, do you have
any of those little wings?

1046
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,727
My nephew's been begging me
for some.

1047
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,827
They don't have them
on express.

1048
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:48,996
Let me look.

1049
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,666
Let's see
what we've got in here.

1050
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,175
Whoa.
[Clears throat]

1051
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,508
Oh, i love these.

1052
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,810
Love it, love it.

1053
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,907
I have so much garbage in here.

1054
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,111
Ah. Here we go.

1055
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,619
Future pilot.

1056
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:05,950
Thank you.

1057
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,649
Enjoy.

1058
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,157
There.

1059
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,217
We could do shots
if you want to.

1060
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,852
Let's do shots.

1061
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,988
Want to?

1062
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,269
Sally: Paris.
First-class international.

1063
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,078
Paris.
First-class international.

1064
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,239
[Airplane engines roaring]

1065
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,846
I think i'm doing very well
at express.

1066
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,983
But i just can't
stop thinking there was

1067
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,584
some kind of mix-up
with my test.

1068
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,562
Some kind
of computer malfunction.

1069
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,098
Those things mess up.

1070
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,658
They lose luggage or send bags
to the wrong city.

1071
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,499
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1072
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,698
The tests are hand-graded.

1073
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,537
Oh, right.
I forgot about that.

1074
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:00,598
I'm sorry.

1075
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,043
I'm sure there's nothing
you can do anyway.

1076
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,104
Who says
there is nothing i can do?

1077
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,945
I am sally weston.

1078
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,008
I invented this.

1079
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,546
Before me, they just pointed.
True story.

1080
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,789
Wow.

1081
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,427
I did speak to john.

1082
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,430
I asked him
if i could see my test.

1083
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:22,988
I begged him.
He said no.

1084
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,331
I asked him if you could see
the test, and he said no.

1085
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:29,429
Don't you worry about john.
Did you see me on "oprah"?

1086
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,600
I scared the hell out of that
little wiener dr. Phil.

1087
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,507
It's test 1047.

1088
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,945
Hello.
It's sally weston.

1089
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,742
Oh, my god.

1090
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,648
Oh, my god.

1091
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,851
What is it, donna?

1092
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,292
This isn't my test.

1093
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,357
It's my number.
It's number 1047.

1094
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,732
But it isn't mine.
Look at those little hearts.

1095
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,103
Time's up.
Pencils down. Books closed.

1096
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,642
Remember to write
your identification number

1097
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,009
on the front of the exam booklet
and pass it forward.

1098
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,604
So, how'd you do?

1099
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,149
New york, here i come.

1100
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,620
I can't believe it.

1101
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,623
I trusted her.
She was my best friend.

1102
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,626
Oh, my god.
These answers.

1103
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,787
No wonder we sent you
to express.

1104
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,694
We were being nice.

1105
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,063
I can't believe
she'd steal my test!

1106
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,062
Wait a minute.

1107
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,730
That night i had you kids
over for dinner,

1108
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,365
someone took my airplane soaps.

1109
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,433
Oh, my god.

1110
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,775
She is probably
stealing us blind.

1111
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,974
Hell, i'll bet she's got
a whole closetful

1112
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,311
of airline property.

1113
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,375
Headsets. Booze.
Kosher meals.

1114
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,647
There's two things
we've got to do.

1115
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,519
We got to get you retested.
There's a group next week.

1116
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,992
If you do as well as i think,
we can reassign you right away.

1117
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,222
How soon can you leave
cleveland?

1118
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,992
I'd just have to talk to ted.

1119
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,760
Who's ted?

1120
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,696
This really great guy
that i'm seeing.

1121
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,636
Oh.

1122
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,004
Well, i'm afraid you've got
a decision to make.

1123
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,733
Yeah.

1124
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,543
Well, what would you do?

1125
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,549
Well, i know what i did.

1126
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,710
And so do you,
if you read my book.

1127
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,550
But, honey, it's your life.
It's your decision.

1128
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,948
Right.

1129
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,584
Well, i'll call you later.

1130
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,128
I've got a flight
back to cleveland at 4:00.

1131
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,289
You said there were two things.

1132
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,060
