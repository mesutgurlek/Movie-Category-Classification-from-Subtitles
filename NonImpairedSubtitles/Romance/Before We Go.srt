1
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,941
<i>Hey, man, where are you?</i>

2
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,576
<i>Still at Grand Central.</i>

3
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:05,044
<i>She there?</i>

4
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:07,313
<i>She's here.</i>

5
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:10,516
<i>But she's with some guy.</i>

6
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:14,287
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

7
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,622
<i>You still coming?</i>

8
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,190
<i>I don't know.</i>

9
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:19,092
<i>Okay, well...</i>

10
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:21,428
<i>I'm gonna text you
the address.</i>

11
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,197
<i>I really hope you come.</i>

12
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,918
Oh, shit!

13
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:37,933
Excuse me!

14
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,182
Excuse me!

15
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,527
No, no, no, no, no, no!

16
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,693
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

17
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:18,861
Thought you might
want that back.

18
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:21,229
- Thank you.
- I think it's broken.

19
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:24,199
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

20
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,334
Due to Port
Authority Security regulations,

21
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:29,203
the station is now closing.

22
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,871
It will reopen at 5:30 a.m.

23
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:32,972
Um... excuse me,

24
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:36,743
um, what does that mean,
that "the station is closing"?

25
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,077
That means you gotta leave.

26
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,212
No trains till the morning.

27
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:41,914
But I can't
wait that long, um...

28
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,749
There's a line
for cabs out front.

29
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,816
Okay, but I don't need a cab

30
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:45,817
because I missed my train, um...

31
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,219
The station doors

32
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,220
will close in five minutes.

33
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,821
Can I use this ticket
at another station?

34
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:51,889
It won't help.

35
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:54,358
Penn Station's closing, too.

36
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,194
You sure you're okay?

37
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:38,096
I'm o... I'm okay.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,235
Can I ask why
you're standing outside?

39
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,173
They closed the station.

40
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:51,809
You planning on
standing out here all night?

41
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:53,844
My purse was stolen.

42
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:54,945
Oh, damn.

43
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:57,780
Yeah, I was in some bar,
so, now, all I have

44
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,983
is this $13 train ticket
and my broken phone.

45
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,999
Shit.
Sorry.

46
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,253
It's okay.
I'll figure something out.

47
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,490
I don't need your pity.

48
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:10,125
Well, I wasn't gonna offer pity.

49
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,928
I was gonna offer
to split a cab.

50
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,295
You can't help me.

51
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,763
No, come on,
let me do a nice thing.

52
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:18,365
You got your purse stolen,
I got like...

53
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,500
80 bucks, give or take.

54
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:21,434
How far you going?

55
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,837
Boston, give or take.

56
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,807
So, north of Harlem.

57
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,943
All right. Hang on.

58
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,810
Excuse me.

59
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,479
Hey. See this lady?

60
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,748
She's got to get to Boston
in a big hurry.

61
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,101
No. New Haven.

62
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,761
New Haven...
and she got her purse stolen.

63
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:40,634
It's an emergency.

64
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,909
When you get her home to
New Haven, she'll cut you a big check.

65
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:43,820
You know what you're saying?

66
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,155
Drive all night,
half the morning.

67
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:46,123
I know.
Come on, man.

68
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,859
You see how she's dressed?
What kind of purse was it?

69
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:49,926
- Prada.
- It's Prada?

70
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,361
Prada.
It was a Prada purse.

71
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:53,130
She's good for it,
plus a big tip.

72
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:55,798
It's gonna be over a grand.

73
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,900
Get the... You serious?

74
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,069
200 miles,
at $2.50 a mile, is $500.

75
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:02,504
Times two,
because I'm deadheading back.

76
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,472
- Add in your Mass Pike tolls,
twice. - All right.

77
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,375
All right, all right, all right.
I got it.

78
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,841
And you want me to trust her?

79
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:08,876
No, no, no, you can't pay.

80
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:11,012
It's okay.
You'll send me a check tomorrow.

81
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,081
How do you know
I'll send you a check?

82
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,250
When have you not paid me back?

83
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,484
Your card is declined.

84
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,286
All right. It's all right.
Sometimes happens.

85
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:23,523
I got another one.
I never use this one.

86
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,358
Probably because it's expired.

87
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,026
You can read and add...

88
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:29,060
how are you a cab driver?

89
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,996
Hey, look, asshole,
your girlfriend is stuck.

90
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:35,500
No New York cabbie is licensed
to operate in Massachusetts.

91
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,435
So no one
is gonna take the risk.

92
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:38,335
All right. All right.

93
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,871
You know what?
I can call a friend.

94
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,457
It's embarrassing.
It's dead.

95
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:48,278
Oh, my God.

96
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,913
Do you have anything
at all that works?

97
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:52,047
Oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,582
I didn't realize I was
taking up all the space

99
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,984
at the front of the line of guys
trying to help you.

100
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,554
You know, there are other things
I could be doing,

101
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:01,026
- surprising as it may seem.
- Okay.

102
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,224
Well, I'm sorry
for holding you up.

103
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,593
Well, the feeling's mutual.

104
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,127
Hey, honey, sorry I'm late.

105
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,999
That happens,
just stare straight ahead,

106
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:53,501
keep walking strong.

107
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:58,539
- Thank you.
- Sure.

108
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,607
I'm sorry about back there,

109
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:02,476
'cause I was rude
and I shouldn't have been rude.

110
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:03,577
It's okay.

111
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,045
I get it.

112
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:06,981
Shitty nights all around.

113
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:07,981
Believe it or not, this morning,

114
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:11,184
I actually had
working credit cards.

115
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:16,889
So what do you want to do?

116
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:20,625
You want to get
a hotel room or something?

117
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,659
Excuse me?

118
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:25,397
No, not, not...
Jesus.

119
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,297
Not for us, for you.

120
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:30,134
In case you don't have friends
in the city.

121
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,571
I don't have friends in the city
and I don't have a cell phone.

122
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,473
And then my I.D.
and my credit cards

123
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,541
were in that purse,
so I am screwed.

124
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,677
Okay.

125
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,612
Want to go try
and find your purse?

126
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:46,415
What, like the person who took
it is just gonna put it back?

127
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:49,585
Well, no, but sometimes,
they just take the cash.

128
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,351
Dump the purse.

129
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:53,087
You check the trash barrels
at the bar?

130
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,422
No. No.

131
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:57,391
What bar?
You remember the name?

132
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:00,928
Um... Yeah, it began
with an "L. "

133
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,028
Um...

134
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,462
I... I can't remember.

135
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,264
It was down...
it was downtown.

136
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,300
Downtown.

137
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:09,268
Well, that's on my way.

138
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,536
It's on your way?

139
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,105
Want to come with me,
have a little adventure?

140
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:14,706
Find your purse?

141
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,144
Okay.

142
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,112
Okay.

143
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:23,247
Let's go.

144
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,015
Where are you going?

145
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,350
Downtown is south.

146
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:28,452
Right.

147
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:31,455
Downtown.

148
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,197
I'm Nick, by the way.

149
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,399
Oh, hey, I'm... I'm Carrie.

150
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,667
Carrie.

151
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,337
It's nice to meet you, Carrie.

152
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,080
Anything?

153
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,014
All right.

154
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,982
I got an idea.

155
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:09,554
Hasn't turned up, sorry to say.

156
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,421
But you never know.

157
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:11,657
Yeah, that's what
the police said.

158
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:14,659
Funny, they're
usually so helpful.

159
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:17,195
But then they told me about
these guys that will

160
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:18,529
lift purses
out of certain places

161
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:21,098
and that, sometimes,
the bartender

162
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,399
knows something.

163
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:26,202
I guess saying shit is easier
than doing actual police work.

164
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:27,403
Right.

165
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:29,296
Right, that's true.
But, uh...

166
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,674
I bet there'd be a pretty
handsome gratuity in it

167
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:35,745
if, uh, something popped
into your brain.

168
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,713
- Prada, you said?
Uh-huh.

169
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,514
It does have sentimental value

170
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:43,218
and I would pay a lot
to get it back.

171
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,121
Give me a sec.

172
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,190
Sentimental value.
Nice touch.

173
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,592
It's true.

174
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,593
I appreciate you doing this.

175
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:55,729
I know that you weren't planning
on spending your night

176
00:10:55,731 --> 00:11:00,266
rummaging through filthy
garbage bathroom trash cans.

177
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,301
<i>Well, I didn't plan not to.</i>

178
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:06,505
Well, what about all the other
things that you could be doing?

179
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:11,575
Well, you didn't say trash can
treasure hunts were on the menu.

180
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,578
I'm actually in town for
an audition... tomorrow.

181
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,579
I was in Grand Central Station,

182
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:21,317
just kinda... trying to piece
together what I want to play.

183
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,086
So, trumpet?

184
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:24,521
Yeah.

185
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,456
I don't think that I've seen
anyone play trumpet

186
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,457
since eighth grade band.

187
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,259
Well, we're still around.

188
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:34,062
We just don't, uh, march
as much as we used to.

189
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:35,530
- Jazz.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:37,765
- You listen?
- I like it. I like jazz.

191
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,665
I... I don't know it.

192
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,635
- I know "My Funny Valentine. "
- A classic.

193
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,336
I actually did it one year
at summer camp.

194
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:46,573
I serenaded Jonathan Weinstein
from behind a tree.

195
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:49,076
Jonathan Weinstein
behind a tree.

196
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:51,143
What was your encore?

197
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,311
A strip tease to...

198
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,315
Oh, wow. Brave.

199
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,416
So embarrassing!

200
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,384
Brave!

201
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,151
He ran away.

202
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,588
And... that was the end
of my jazz career.

203
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,722
Yeah.

204
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,191
Well, that's a shame.

205
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,525
What was the next career?

206
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,560
- I'm an art consultant.
- Really?

207
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,463
I'm actually in the city
buying a painting.

208
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,797
Oh, yeah? What's the piece?

209
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,799
I don't know if you'd know it.

210
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,102
Well, that's probably true.

211
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,705
Um... who's
your favorite painter?

212
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:24,340
Or would I not know him,
either?

213
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,308
No, no.
But if I did tell you that,

214
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,409
I'd lose all credibility.

215
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:30,112
Oh, come on! You got to now.

216
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,680
You're stupid.

217
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,682
Well...

218
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,183
we may be in luck.

219
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,418
Took a little persuasion.

220
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,854
Had to call in a favor or two.

221
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,589
So, I just have to go
to this address and...?

222
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:45,358
- That's a shitty neighborhood.
- What, you think, uh,

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,528
guys on Wall Street
were lifting purses?

224
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,429
Well...

225
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:52,564
thank you.

226
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:56,334
I hope I was helpful.

227
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,803
Extremely.

228
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:03,206
I think that he wants gratitude.

229
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,827
Group hug?

230
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,694
Big kiss?

231
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:09,679
I believe the words were
"handsome gratuity. "

232
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:12,516
Right.

233
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:16,152
You take credit cards?

234
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:20,588
Okay, so it's-it's
this way, right?

235
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:23,658
All right, you talked me into it...
I'm coming with you.

236
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,326
Thank you, but really,
you have your thing and...

237
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:27,461
It's all right. It's late.

238
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:29,164
You're going
to a shitty neighborhood.

239
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,798
I'm not gonna let you go alone.

240
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,566
Besides, it's this way.

241
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:34,301
Are you sure you don't mind?

242
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:36,870
Positive. Come on.

243
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,574
I'm sure that my husband
will really appreciate

244
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,742
your helping me.

245
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:46,244
It's incredibly generous of you.

246
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:48,446
You didn't have to do that.

247
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,447
What?

248
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,315
The husband thing.

249
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,217
Well, I didn't mean
to distrust you.

250
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,921
It's just you're being so nice.

251
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:57,922
Nice.

252
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,824
Well... don't mention it.

253
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:05,295
So, what was this thing that
you were headed to tonight?

254
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:08,797
Is it something to do
with the audition or...?

255
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,465
No, not really.

256
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,602
Well, kind of.

257
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,870
You know...

258
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,573
you know when you can't
make up your mind

259
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,374
about whether or not
you should do something?

260
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:23,844
And you ask the universe
"If I'm supposed to do this,

261
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,613
give me a sign"?

262
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,782
And is the audition
the thing or the sign?

263
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,883
The sign.

264
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:33,252
There's this really
influential band...

265
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:34,321
Duke Terry?

266
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,722
- No...
- It's all right.

267
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,224
He's this amazing piano player.

268
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,392
Lost his trumpet player
about a month ago

269
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:45,363
and I love the guy's music
and I thought... why not?

270
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:48,233
And... the thing?

271
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:51,001
- "The thing"? - The thing that
you needed the sign...

272
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh, the thing! Right, right.

273
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,907
That's, uh...

274
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,374
a wedding.

275
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:00,477
Are you gonna
break up a wedding?

276
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,311
No.

277
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:03,613
No, it's complicated.

278
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:06,515
There's just someone
I wanted to see.

279
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,617
The bride?

280
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:10,552
Nope.

281
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:11,886
The groom?

282
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,723
No.

283
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,757
But what about you?

284
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,561
I'm guessing the purse was
the gift from your husband?

285
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,999
Think you might be
missing some hardware.

286
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:30,270
I have a ring,
but I'm not wearing it

287
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,738
because it's being repaired
back in Boston.

288
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,040
Okay. Whatever you say.

289
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,509
You don't believe me?

290
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,979
It's none of my business.

291
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,470
All right, this is it.

292
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:13,389
Jesus. You know what?
Let me do this.

293
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:14,944
What'd you say it was...
a black Prada bag?

294
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:16,268
I think we should
call the police.

295
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:19,227
Yeah. They'll be right over.
How's next Thursday?

296
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,880
Anything specific
about the bag?

297
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,784
Yeah.
On the inside flap

298
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:27,753
are the initials B.D.
in kid's handwriting.

299
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:29,855
"B.D. " Why B.D.?

300
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,757
My stepson wrote it.

301
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,559
My name is Brooke.

302
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,894
Brooke Dalton.

303
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,329
Oh, my God!

304
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,929
Why'd you tell me it was Carrie?

305
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,097
I don't know!
Carrie Bradshaw!

306
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,734
We're in New York, it's late,
you're a stranger... I froze.

307
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,634
Well, when I get back,

308
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,870
we really got to work
on our communication, Brooke.

309
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,672
Two blocks that way,
there's a bar

310
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,840
called Gaffney's...
wait for me there, all right?

311
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,042
Wait! How much cash do you have?

312
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,344
I don't know.

313
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,345
That's a personal question.

314
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:57,112
Maybe 40 bucks?

315
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,980
You're gonna do something crazy.

316
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:01,683
Thank you for not saying
"stupid. "

317
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:02,516
That means a lot.

318
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:05,419
You're gonna grab it
and run, aren't you?

319
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,420
Uh... I don't know.

320
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,023
It's exciting, though, isn't it?

321
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,492
Go.

322
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:27,505
You the one lost the purse?

323
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:32,477
Yeah, and without it,
my whole outfit falls apart.

324
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,924
<i>Hello, Four Seasons Atlanta.</i>

325
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:52,862
<i>Uh, Michael Dalton's
room, please.</i>

326
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,965
One moment, please.

327
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,465
Hello?

328
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,900
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

329
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,034
What's going on?
You okay?

330
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,603
Yeah, I'm okay.
I just couldn't sleep.

331
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:05,139
And I, I just wanted
to tell you that I love you.

332
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:07,674
Oh, honey, I love you, too.

333
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:08,775
How's New York?

334
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,410
Did you make the buy?

335
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,579
Yeah, I made the buy.

336
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:14,832
For 225.

337
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:17,190
Yeah. It's been
going on so long.

338
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,584
I'm just glad it finally closed,
you know?

339
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,919
Yeah, right. Of course.

340
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,453
Well, congratulations.

341
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:22,721
Did you get my message?

342
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,590
- No. What? My phone
actually broke. - Oh, shit.

343
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,426
I was wondering
why you called the hotel.

344
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,195
Well, there's
a little change of plans.

345
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,963
And I'm gonna be
on the first flight out.

346
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,599
So I'll be home by 8:00
and we can have

347
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:37,701
a little, uh,
celebration breakfast?

348
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:39,569
That's so early.
It's 2:00 a.m.

349
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,004
Don't you just want to relax?

350
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:42,105
Weren't you on a later flight?

351
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:44,440
No, it's all right.
I can sleep on the plane.

352
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,575
I don't want to stay here
any longer than I have to.

353
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:47,743
<i>Baby, you work so hard.</i>

354
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,578
<i>Why don't you
just stay and relax?</i>

355
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,612
<i>And then we can have
a nice breakfast later</i>

356
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:52,580
<i>when you're rested?</i>

357
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,681
Brooke, the flight's booked.

358
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:55,616
What's going on?
You okay?

359
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,586
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just tired.

360
00:18:58,588 --> 00:18:59,587
<i>Aw, poor baby.</i>

361
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:01,189
<i>Well, let me
let you go to sleep.</i>

362
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,123
<i>And I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

363
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,593
<i>- Okay.
- I love you.</i>

364
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,201
All Prada. All tonight.

365
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:19,587
- Tyler said you knew the bag.
- Right.

366
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,073
Well, the lady's credit cards
would make it more helpful.

367
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,174
We don't do wallets, man.

368
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:26,677
Because that would be
beneath you.

369
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:32,082
Let's go with this one.

370
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,216
Special today... $900.

371
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,851
What do you mean?

372
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:36,652
That's the number I gave Tyler.

373
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,020
Yeah, and I paid him.

374
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,755
What, is this a shakedown?

375
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:42,058
Call him.

376
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,860
Aw, this is great!

377
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:44,626
You call him.

378
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,928
He says I didn't pay you
and I get screwed!

379
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,974
I'm so sorry.

380
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,009
I feel like an idiot.

381
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,511
You have your thing
and now you look all...

382
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,246
Homeless?

383
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,046
No.

384
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,981
Tough?

385
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:11,850
No, let's stick with homeless.

386
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,019
I'm sorry that
I sent the cops in.

387
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,186
I... I just thought that...

388
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:18,022
Thought that I couldn't get
beat up all by myself.

389
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,624
No. I assumed you can do that.

390
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,292
I just thought that you were
in over your head.

391
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:23,628
What's it take

392
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,930
to win a little trust
with you, Ms. Bradshaw?

393
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:30,100
Well, the purse is out.

394
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,601
What now?

395
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:32,768
No, it does matter.

396
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,638
It was over
when I missed that train.

397
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,872
What was over?

398
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:38,706
My marriage.

399
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,976
I had to be home before him.

400
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:43,177
Oh.

401
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,212
He doesn't know
you're in New York?

402
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:49,117
No, it's... it's complicated.

403
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,585
Got it.

404
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:56,188
What is that supposed to mean?

405
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,624
Well, it's not rocket science.

406
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,293
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

407
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,094
You got to get home
before your husband does.

408
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,896
He doesn't know
you're in New York.

409
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:08,034
Are you accusing me
of having an affair?

410
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:10,035
No, it's just...

411
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,003
You know, I'm calling it
like I see it.

412
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,705
It's not a problem.
It's okay.

413
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,273
People are human.
They make mistakes.

414
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,074
Okay, Einstein.

415
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,577
If I was having an affair,
why wouldn't I just

416
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,645
call my boyfriend
and have him bail me out?

417
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,913
I don't know.

418
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,915
Maybe he doesn't know
you're married.

419
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:31,054
Oh, God! Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait.

420
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:31,955
What? What do you want?

421
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,722
Look, thank you for your help,
but it's over.

422
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:35,057
You can go back
to whatever you were doing

423
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,992
before I came along
and I ruined your night.

424
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,192
Wait, please, stop! Stop!

425
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:39,360
You didn't ruin my night, okay?

426
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:40,795
I was hiding out
in Grand Central

427
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,964
trying to avoid this...

428
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,065
Look.

429
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,665
My night was shit
before you showed up.

430
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,968
It's gonna be shit after
you leave. But your night?

431
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,302
If we can get you home
and save your marriage,

432
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:52,005
well, then...

433
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,841
you know, that would
make me a hero.

434
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:58,677
Not gonna pass that up, am I?

435
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,647
Look, I don't mean to... pry.

436
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,822
But it seems to me, the issue is you
got to get home tonight, right?

437
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,218
Yes.

438
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,652
All right, let's work this out.

439
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:09,920
What time do you have
to be home by?

440
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:12,623
- At the very latest, at 7:00.
- Okay. Well...

441
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,292
that means we got
to leave by 3:30,

442
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,227
4:00?

443
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:19,229
We have time.

444
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:26,002
<i>Manhattan?</i>

445
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,202
<i>Name of business.</i>

446
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:30,038
<i>Carmel Car Service.</i>

447
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,106
Carmel Car Service.

448
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,841
Hey, how much to Boston
if we leave within the hour?

449
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:34,909
That's $447.

450
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:37,078
That's the best you can do?

451
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,679
Includes everything.

452
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,114
Okay, thank you.

453
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,215
What'd they say?

454
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:42,850
$447... all in.

455
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,084
Can we raise that?

456
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:45,084
Yeah, I think so.

457
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,285
I got a buddy at my thing.

458
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:49,422
Really? Because
that would be amazing.

459
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,957
Well, don't thank me yet.

460
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,725
Am I dressed okay for a wedding?

461
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:55,794
Well, it's probably
just a reception by now.

462
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,263
I'm pretty sure
my friend's still there.

463
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:14,376
Oh, thank you.

464
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,780
Wow. You're actually good.

465
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:20,916
No offense.

466
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,051
None taken.

467
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:24,286
Is that the song
you're gonna play tomorrow?

468
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,721
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

469
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:27,822
I think you should.

470
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:32,193
I mean, if I know anything
about Duke What's His Face,

471
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,894
he's gonna like that song.

472
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,095
Duke Terry.

473
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,730
Yeah. We'll see.

474
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:40,132
I jammed with his bass player
a couple months ago in D.C.

475
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:41,735
This guy Lucas Wells.

476
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,836
He liked my shit.

477
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,336
That's wonderful.

478
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:46,005
Yeah. Anyway... enough about me.

479
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,176
Your story by contrast is
far more compelling.

480
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,776
Oh.

481
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,011
My turn. Okay.

482
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,946
Uh... I'm pretty
straightforward.

483
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:57,748
I'm a normal girl
with one brother.

484
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,817
A husband who works in finance.

485
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,220
Who I conveniently cannot
provide a photograph,

486
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,988
'cause my phone is broken.

487
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,989
Conveniently.

488
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,391
How'd you guys meet?

489
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,424
I was in London,

490
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:11,292
- um, working at Sotheby's.
- Big shot.

491
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:13,730
Yeah, after a few
years in London,

492
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:16,198
I started getting this...

493
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,065
I don't know.

494
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:19,367
<i>Th-The French have
this word, dépaysement,</i>

495
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:20,501
um, disorientation,

496
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:23,804
like the feeling of not being
in your home country.

497
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:26,208
And I had...

498
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,110
a hard time making
friends in London, and...

499
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:33,379
Aw, that's so sad.

500
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:34,247
And so my boss was like,

501
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:36,750
"Do you want to go
to Boston for this show?"

502
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,383
And Michael was there.

503
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:41,019
Right.

504
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,955
Have you ever had a feeling

505
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,956
and just known
somewhere in your bones

506
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:49,094
that somebody was gonna play
a major part in your life?

507
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,195
Yeah.

508
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:56,533
Anyway, he... his wife had,
uh, just left him

509
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:58,935
for this guy
that we know, and, uh...

510
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,904
at that point,
she'd taken the kids.

511
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,005
And so the last thing
he wanted was

512
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,039
to get involved with someone.

513
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,442
Well, for the record,
I can't imagine you being

514
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,545
the last thing
any man would want.

515
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:13,516
Thank you.

516
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:15,283
So I, uh...

517
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:17,485
I bought the painting
that my boss wanted,

518
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:20,155
and I sent it back without me,

519
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:23,323
and I've not been
to London since.

520
00:25:23,992 --> 00:25:26,160
A lot of complications there.

521
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,194
Brave girl.

522
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:31,832
The funny thing is, I remain
proud of it to this day

523
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,267
that I was...

524
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:39,805
...the girl who recognized
love and jumped.

525
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:47,378
<i>So if I know my friend,
he'll be at the open bar.</i>

526
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,512
<i>Hopefully, we can get you home.</i>

527
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:52,550
<i>Is the person that you
came to see gonna be there?</i>

528
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,153
<i>With our luck, probably.</i>

529
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:09,297
Is it that bad?

530
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,132
What?

531
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:14,468
Whatever's waiting
for you up there.

532
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:16,437
Oh.

533
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,472
It's nothing.

534
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:32,117
It's an ex... ex-something.

535
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:38,556
And does the ex-something
have a name?

536
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:41,492
Hannah.

537
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:44,328
I haven't seen her in a while.

538
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,266
Was it a bad breakup?

539
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:51,334
Are there any other kinds?

540
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,314
Did they just have sex in here?

541
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:08,883
It's better not to know.

542
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,484
But yes.

543
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:31,570
Is this it?

544
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:32,603
Good question.

545
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:36,507
I really only know Danny
and the groom.

546
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:49,352
Do you know that person?

547
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:54,490
No.

548
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:56,158
No, I do not.

549
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,427
Are you sure that
you're up for this?

550
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,095
Yeah.

551
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,163
Yes, yes, yes.

552
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:04,966
- Don't feel badly.
- No, I don't feel badly.

553
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,135
<i>I feel bad.</i>

554
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:09,636
Did you just do that?

555
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:11,171
Did you just correct my grammar?

556
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:12,706
Oh, stop it, I was teasing.

557
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,407
Have I done that already?

558
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,374
You've been dying to.

559
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,009
That's an interrupted
verb phrase.

560
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,011
I've been silently
correcting you all night.

561
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:19,979
Don't make that face.

562
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,480
Well, glad to know that we're
at the point in our relationship

563
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:24,483
where you feel comfortable
doing it out loud.

564
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:26,018
And it's all downhill from here.

565
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,719
That's funny...
I feel like I missed

566
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,254
all the good uphill stuff.

567
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:31,022
Oh, thank you.

568
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:33,157
And what is PWC?

569
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,259
Oh, shit.

570
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,194
Yeah, are we in the right place?

571
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:39,729
I don't even think
this is a wedding.

572
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,531
Jesus, it's about time.

573
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,433
Where's the rest of the band?

574
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,634
You're an hour late.

575
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,918
Traffic.

576
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,171
I'm sorry, but I'm here.

577
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:50,505
To hold down the fort,
so to speak.

578
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:52,641
What am I supposed to do
with one saxophone?

579
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,643
- It's a trumpet.
- Oh, my God.

580
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,311
And my singer,
she's amazing.

581
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,146
This is bullshit, I'm not paying
five grand for that.

582
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:01,682
Well, of course not,
of course not.

583
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:03,616
But we will need $600 up front.

584
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,419
In case the rest
of the boys don't show.

585
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:07,287
Out of the question.

586
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,257
Okay, enjoy your deejay's
playlist.

587
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:13,806
- Yeah.
- $350... $500.

588
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,327
That's ten percent,
that's fair.

589
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,596
Fine, now get up
and start playing

590
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:18,697
while I get the cash.

591
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:22,133
You can use 1107 as a green room
if you need to store your stuff.

592
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,668
Great.

593
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:26,737
- No, no. Nick.
- Come on.

594
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,605
I don't sing.

595
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:31,109
That's not what I heard.

596
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,477
No, there's no way
I can do this.

597
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,378
Yes, you can.

598
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,446
Besides, we need vocals
to sell it.

599
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,514
You want to get home, don't you?

600
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:40,483
Just pretend it's a room full
of Jonathan what's-his-names.

601
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,784
Weinsteins.

602
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:42,551
Yeah.

603
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,486
A room full
of Jonathan Weinsteins.

604
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:46,321
Just keep your clothes on.

605
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,188
Nick, I can't.

606
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,191
All right, but if you got
to take them off,

607
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:51,058
save it for the finale.

608
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,095
I don't think they'll be able
to follow that up.

609
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:55,497
Showtime, people.

610
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:58,699
The one-of-a-kind musical
stylings of...

611
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:01,702
Nick Vaughn on trumpet,
Brooke Dalton on vocals.

612
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:03,169
Kicking off this set

613
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:07,373
with a smoky, wistful
"My Funny Valentine. "

614
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:12,183
No, no, stop that.
Come on, let's go.

615
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:14,485
Oi, you two!

616
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:19,756
- Oh, my God, that was insane.
- You were amazing.

617
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,291
- That was crazy.
- Wait, w-w-wait.

618
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:23,325
The green room.

619
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:24,693
This way.

620
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,766
Hello? Go ahead.

621
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,902
I got to call Danny, find out
where the hell this guy is.

622
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:36,337
But your phone died.
Do you remember the number?

623
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,206
What, you don't memorize
all your emergency contacts?

624
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:42,409
I don't think I get in
as many emergencies as you do.

625
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,482
Danny, it's Nick,
where the hell are you, man?

626
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:50,384
Listen, you gave me
the wrong address.

627
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,885
Um, this is gonna sound strange.

628
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,188
I need 450 bucks.

629
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,755
Long story, life or death.

630
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:57,522
Give me a call.

631
00:32:57,524 --> 00:32:59,891
But my phone died, so just leave
a message, okay?

632
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:01,493
All right.

633
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:03,761
Do you think he'll get
the message in time?

634
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,796
I don't know.

635
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,567
I got another idea.

636
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,302
Should I be worried?

637
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,203
Concierge, how may
I help you, Mr. Childers?

638
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,228
Yes, I need a car to take
my guest to Boston right away.

639
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,526
And would you like
your regular car service?

640
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:22,952
- Yes. - And how would
you like to pay?

641
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:24,436
Can we charge
it to the room?

642
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,171
That should not be
a problem, Mr. Childers.

643
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:27,719
- Oh, it's a yes.
- Great.

644
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,075
- Give me ten minutes, sir.
- Thank you.

645
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,686
Are you crazy?

646
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:31,987
Do you think that's gonna work?

647
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:32,853
I don't know.

648
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:34,522
We'll find out in ten minutes.

649
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,524
I like your, uh, shiny trumpet.

650
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:37,692
Oh, why, thank you.

651
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,426
I hope it's worth enough.

652
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,227
For bail.

653
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:41,528
When we get arrested.

654
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:43,830
Well, should be.

655
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:47,399
I bought it with a shiny
engagement ring.

656
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,539
So talk to me
about these pieces.

657
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,008
Is this done by your famous
London artist guy?

658
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,842
Oh, well, how did you know?

659
00:33:57,844 --> 00:34:00,945
Well, you can tell you need
to know quite a bit about art

660
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:01,913
in order to appreciate it.

661
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,380
You're an asshole.

662
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:04,781
Do you know
the most interesting thing

663
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:07,284
about hotel art is not
the actual art itself,

664
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:10,586
obviously, but it's
what's behind it.

665
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,588
- What, like a safe?
- No.

666
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,956
Have you heard
of hotel graffiti?

667
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,458
- No.
- This comedian started it

668
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,859
when his TV didn't work
in his hotel room.

669
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:19,662
He just started doodling on,
like, the back of paintings.

670
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:20,962
And it caught on from there.

671
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:24,699
So fingers crossed.

672
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,034
Oh, my...

673
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,535
Wow.

674
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:29,903
- Oh...
- What?

675
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:31,372
How can you not appreciate that?

676
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:33,906
It's the best one
I've ever seen.

677
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:37,678
"Gotta go,
the hookers are here. "

678
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,713
We probably shouldn't touch
anything in this room.

679
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,623
Hi, we ordered a car
for Mr. Childers.

680
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,891
Oh, yes, he's just here.

681
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:55,359
We got your regular driver.

682
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,460
Except you're not Mr. Childers.

683
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,562
No, I'm Mr. Bradshaw.

684
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:01,065
I was sent down
with Mr. Childers' guest.

685
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,300
Oh, uh, certainly, sir.

686
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:05,502
Just give me a second
to ring the room.

687
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:06,903
That won't be necessary.

688
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:09,405
You know, it's not that late,
and I feel like a drink.

689
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,674
Is that place
on Halston still open?

690
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,574
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

691
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:13,542
- Want to go?
- Yeah.

692
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

693
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:16,811
Sorry, guys.

694
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:20,082
<i>All right, we're not dead yet...
we still have time.</i>

695
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:24,352
Time, but neither money
nor a plan.

696
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,488
What we need is a time machine.

697
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,790
Well, we kind of have one.

698
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:33,059
A few years ago, they turned
all these public pay phones

699
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:34,460
into time machines.

700
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:35,861
You pick one up, dial 1993,

701
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:37,930
and a New Yorker will come on

702
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,764
and tell you exactly
what was happening

703
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:42,001
on that corner 20 years ago.

704
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:43,369
It was funny.

705
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,904
I don't even need
to call that far back.

706
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:49,341
I just need to call yesterday.

707
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,444
Well, let's try.

708
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:57,747
What would you tell yourself?

709
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:10,826
Brooke, it's you
from the future.

710
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:11,927
She doesn't believe me.

711
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:14,496
Well, of course; you got to
tell her something secret,

712
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:16,764
something only you two
would know.

713
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:23,837
So you know that tiny scar
that you have on your forehead?

714
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,407
The one that you tell everyone
you got hiking in Argentina,

715
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:32,611
but you actually got
at a Hanson concert in college.

716
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:35,581
This is my favorite story
already.

717
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,750
Shh. It's collect.

718
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:41,119
So Pam made you crowd-surf,
and you ended up

719
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,653
hitting the guardrail

720
00:36:42,655 --> 00:36:45,822
and spending
the whole night in the E.R.

721
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,559
Okay, oh, good,
you believe me now.

722
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:49,994
Okay, so whatever you do,

723
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:53,663
don't talk to any strangers
in Grand Central.

724
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,165
Ouch.

725
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,767
Actually...

726
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,069
just skip New York altogether.

727
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:02,505
Stay home, get a movie,
order takeout,

728
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:04,038
have a bubble bath
and go to bed.

729
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,675
Because everything will be fine
in the morning.

730
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:10,912
All right.

731
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,782
Yeah, but then
you wouldn't have met me.

732
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:17,084
I still haven't decided
if that's

733
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:19,720
a good thing or a bad thing.

734
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,621
All right.

735
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:23,689
What else do we got?
Let's think.

736
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:26,092
You're not gonna
get off that easy.

737
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:26,958
No, no, no.

738
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,963
I don't mess with the physics
of space and time.

739
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:31,898
Hanson.

740
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,099
All right. All right.

741
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,066
Give it to me.

742
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:37,068
But I don't want
to do yesterday;

743
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,936
I want to do 2004.

744
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:45,508
Nick, hey, it's me.

745
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,478
You from the future.

746
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,779
He bought it. Idiot.

747
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,614
Listen, when the Red Sox
make the World Series,

748
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:56,119
take all your money
and put it on them to win.

749
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:58,554
Yes, I know it sounds crazy.

750
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,622
Do it.

751
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:02,124
Okay. Bye.

752
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:03,958
- That's it?
- That's it.

753
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,626
Everyone knows
when you got a time machine,

754
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:07,061
the first thing you do
is gamble.

755
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:08,962
I wasn't aware of that.

756
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,664
And...

757
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,867
that didn't work.

758
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:15,802
Oh, shit, what about a bus?

759
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:18,171
But they don't even
run at night.

760
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,139
No, like a Chinatown bus.

761
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,840
They run all night
and they're cheap.

762
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,041
They're, like, 80 bucks.

763
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:23,542
- Do we even have that much?
- No.

764
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:27,612
It's got to be easier
than $500, though.

765
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:03,143
Well...

766
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:08,982
Did our best,
but we are almost out of time.

767
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,751
What if we just
call your husband

768
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,553
and tell him you're in New York?

769
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,554
We could make up a good reason.

770
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:16,588
He already knows about New York.

771
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,092
Well, he doesn't need to know
what you're doing here.

772
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,828
He knows that, too.

773
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:28,032
Well, then why do you
have to beat him home?

774
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:31,936
What? Is there something you got
to do before he gets there?

775
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:32,836
Look, whatever it is,

776
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,304
he's an idiot if he can't
put it past him.

777
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,006
And you're not the type of girl
to marry an idiot.

778
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,108
'Cause even if there were
something that I needed to do

779
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,876
when I get back, I'm still not
gonna make it back in time.

780
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,913
All right, so let's figure out
a way to make it okay

781
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:46,148
that you didn't do
whatever it is you had to do.

782
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,984
Look, you may have
already thought of this,

783
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,785
but can someone else do it?

784
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,954
Whatever it is?

785
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:58,759
I'm out of coins.
Are you out of coins?

786
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:08,635
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

787
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:09,902
Hello?

788
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:11,170
- Pam, it's Brooke.
- Brooke.

789
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,873
I'm so sorry to call this late.
Did I wake the baby?

790
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,874
No, no. Are you okay?
What's going on?

791
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,342
<i>I don't know how to say this,</i>

792
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:19,144
but I need a huge favor,
and I need it now.

793
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:21,178
Of course, of course, anything.

794
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,746
<i>Okay, so go to my house,</i>

795
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:24,048
and in the backyard
there's a key

796
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,583
in the magnet box
by the pool filter.

797
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:28,085
Take the key
and go in the back door.

798
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:31,021
The alarm code is 4242.

799
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,356
Go up to the bedroom.

800
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:34,090
On the bed is a letter.

801
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:35,825
And it's addressed to Michael.

802
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,727
<i>Take it home and save it for me
when I get back.</i>

803
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,162
But listen, promise me
that you won't read it.

804
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:43,265
Of course I won't, Brooke.
You have my word.

805
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:45,199
Okay, it's 4:00 a.m. now.

806
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,934
How much time do I have?

807
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:49,705
You have three hours.

808
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:55,309
Is there any way I could use
the phone after she's done?

809
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:57,877
It's as good as done, Brooke.

810
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,212
I love you.

811
00:40:59,214 --> 00:40:59,980
Thank you.

812
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:01,748
I love you, too.

813
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,339
- Call me in an hour.
- Okay.

814
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,252
Everything's gonna be
okay now, I promise.

815
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:08,153
Okay.

816
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,222
- Bye.
- Bye.

817
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:35,745
You know, I think this is
the first time I've seen you

818
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:36,679
look genuinely happy.

819
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:39,948
Well... and for the record,
this is relieved.

820
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,883
Happy is different.

821
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:43,918
Well, I'm glad it worked out.

822
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,790
And for the record, you could
never cheat on anybody.

823
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:55,129
Are you the kind of guy
who idealizes women, Nick?

824
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:57,664
That's a dangerous habit.

825
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,798
Well, I'm a dangerous guy.

826
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,001
Yeah, that's why you got
smashed in the nose.

827
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:04,369
Did Danny leave you
a voice mail?

828
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,371
Yeah.

829
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:07,406
He left me the wrong address.

830
00:42:07,408 --> 00:42:10,741
His dyslexia really kicks in
when he's been drinking.

831
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:11,842
Where is it?

832
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:15,379
I don't think it matters.
I'm probably not gonna go.

833
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,348
I think we should just
keep walking around.

834
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,418
I hear Central Park's
really safe this time of night.

835
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,688
Wow.

836
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,755
It can't be that bad.

837
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:28,757
Has it got something to do
with the ex, Hannah?

838
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,359
'Cause I'm happy
to offer my services.

839
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:34,195
I'm all dressed up,
nowhere to go.

840
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,097
It's okay. It's late.

841
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:38,033
I think that you're
underestimating me.

842
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,967
I would make a great bodyguard.

843
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:42,270
Or spiritual advisor.

844
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:45,439
I can be your Jiminy Cricket.

845
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:49,443
She's there with somebody.

846
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:52,178
I see.

847
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,312
Well, I mean, you helped me.

848
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:58,016
I mean, you saved my marriage.
And that makes you kind of...

849
00:42:58,018 --> 00:42:59,085
- A hero.
- A hero.

850
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:02,354
And heroes are not afraid
to face their exes.

851
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:03,354
Don't worry, I'll come.

852
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:06,057
We can pretend to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

853
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,125
That'll make her jealous.

854
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,359
She'll know you're not my type.

855
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:11,095
Oh, my God.

856
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:14,131
I was just brainstorming.

857
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,066
Maybe she'll think
that I changed you.

858
00:43:17,068 --> 00:43:19,001
That will drive her crazy.

859
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:21,270
Will you,

860
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:25,942
Nick Vaughn, be my...

861
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:27,008
Carrie Bradshaw's...

862
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,880
...Brooke Dalton's
pretend boyfriend?

863
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:35,483
Man.

864
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:05,276
I hope this is the right place,
'cause I only know one song.

865
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,180
Nick!

866
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,482
- Hey, man!
- Hey, man.

867
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:14,884
Hey, hey, I tried
to get your money, man,

868
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:18,420
but I could only get, like,
350 bucks; I hope it's enough.

869
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,822
Wow.

870
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,189
Hi.

871
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,190
Hey.

872
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,191
I'm Brooke.

873
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,260
- I am Danny.
- Thank you for your help, Danny.

874
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,263
- My pleasure.
- But you can keep the money.

875
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,063
We're okay now.

876
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,098
I feel bad.

877
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,800
We got it all squared away.

878
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:32,534
What?

879
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,101
I sold a kidney to get this.

880
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:35,936
I mean, it wasn't mine,
but what am I gonna

881
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:37,271
tell the hooker
when she wakes up?

882
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:38,172
Danny.

883
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:40,306
Kidding!
She's not gonna wake up.

884
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,208
Wow! We there already?

885
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,576
I'm embarrassing him.

886
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:45,177
Would you like a drink, Brooke?

887
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:48,247
Danny, you're hitting
on a woman who's taken.

888
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:50,016
Oh.

889
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:52,117
I see.

890
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,051
Oh, no, not like that.

891
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,586
No, no.
It's not... it's not for us.

892
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:56,454
I'm staying
in Danny's room tonight.

893
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:57,388
- Do me a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

894
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,490
Promise me you won't piss
in the closet this time.

895
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:00,925
I could promise you
no such thing.

896
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:03,359
In fact, I may or may not
have had a lot to drink.

897
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:04,961
What I'm trying
to figure out right now

898
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,863
is if I've had
too much to drink tonight.

899
00:45:06,865 --> 00:45:10,567
Then I realized that if one can
ask oneself that question,

900
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:13,403
then the answer
must definitely be no.

901
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:15,170
- Right?
- Danny studied philosophy.

902
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:18,874
And my latest theory is
that not all women at a wedding

903
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:21,075
who are taken
are actually taken.

904
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:22,944
You know what I mean?

905
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:26,113
Oh, it depends on
your definition of taken.

906
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:55,473
Hey, Brooke, are you sure
I can't get you a drink?

907
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:56,875
I'm fine, thank you, Danny.

908
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:58,609
- I'm sure.
- All right.

909
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,143
Dave!
Dave!

910
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:02,412
You shifty bastard.
How you doing, man?

911
00:46:02,414 --> 00:46:05,548
Your wife lost a lot of weight.
Jesus!

912
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,251
Do you want me to step outside?

913
00:46:08,253 --> 00:46:11,186
Don't move.

914
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:17,592
Hi.

915
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:24,999
Wow.

916
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:33,038
Hannah Dempsey, Brooke Dalton.

917
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,106
Hey, nice to meet you.

918
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:35,274
Hi, so nice to meet you.

919
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:39,444
Um, traffic was so bad
all the way from Philly,

920
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:41,647
I... I thought I
had missed you.

921
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:42,481
You did?

922
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:44,416
I mean, you did. You did.

923
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:45,283
You did miss me.

924
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:48,286
But you're here now, so...

925
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,120
Yes, yes.

926
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:52,289
I actually thought
I was gonna miss you, too, um...

927
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:55,158
which I did...

928
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,259
till now.

929
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:58,661
We could keep this banter up
for minutes.

930
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:00,597
- Hours.
- We're only this quick

931
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,098
when we're together,
though, so...

932
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,533
Otherwise,
I'm almost boring.

933
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:13,641
Um, so are you...
are you working or...?

934
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:15,242
Oh, no, this...

935
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:16,043
Yes.

936
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:19,012
He's auditioning
for Duke Terry tomorrow.

937
00:47:19,014 --> 00:47:20,681
Nick!

938
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:21,515
Well...

939
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,317
That's... that's amazing.

940
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:26,186
He played with Lucas Wells
in D.C.,

941
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:27,553
and Lucas loved his shit.

942
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:30,389
I bet he did.

943
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:32,958
Okay, spill it.
Tell me all about it.

944
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,159
Here you go, babe.

945
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:39,134
- Oh, um... Cole, this is Brooke.
- Hey. - Hey.

946
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,779
- Brooke. - Good to meet you.
- And this is Nick. - Nick.

947
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,501
Hi.

948
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,570
Nick is auditioning
for Duke Terry tomorrow.

949
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,439
Oh, yeah? Oh!

950
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:49,707
- The jazz guy. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

951
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,507
We saw him live in Philly
a bunch of times.

952
00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:53,009
That's amazing, great.

953
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:54,677
Thank you.

954
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,545
Um...

955
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:58,647
Hey, I know it's getting
kind of late, but would you guys

956
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:01,583
want to go get a cup of coffee
somewhere or...?

957
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,384
Um, you know, I wish we could.

958
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:05,120
We're late for something,
though. I'm sorry.

959
00:48:05,122 --> 00:48:07,022
- We were just stopping in.
- Right, right.

960
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:09,290
Well, I...
we don't want to keep you.

961
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,392
But, um, if something frees up,

962
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:14,328
I'm at the, the Soho Grand.

963
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,161
Okay.

964
00:48:15,163 --> 00:48:17,063
Um, it was really
nice to meet you.

965
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:18,465
Nice to meet you, too.

966
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:20,100
- Pleasure.
- Okay.

967
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:22,735
- Bye.
- Bye, Cole.

968
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,445
I don't know why we had
to run out of there.

969
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:37,081
Who's running?

970
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,050
That was running.

971
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,718
Trust me, I know.

972
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,154
I'm the poster girl for running.

973
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:46,655
Running is easier.

974
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,560
God.

975
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:56,399
I haven't seen her in six years.

976
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:59,167
You were fine.

977
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,568
No, I wasn't.

978
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,803
That was awful.

979
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,303
It was embarrassing.

980
00:49:03,305 --> 00:49:05,272
I'm sorry you had to see that.

981
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:07,808
You'd think after six years
of rehearsing that moment,

982
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,145
I'd have something
more interesting to say.

983
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:12,246
I don't think she noticed.

984
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:14,815
And she probably
rehearsed it, too.

985
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,386
Six years?

986
00:49:21,388 --> 00:49:25,524
How'd you guys meet?

987
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:28,759
Sophomore year.

988
00:49:28,761 --> 00:49:29,727
Georgetown.

989
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:33,431
I was pre-med
if you can believe that.

990
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:34,365
I don't.

991
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:36,233
But I have a good imagination.

992
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:38,169
Oh, my heart was
never really in it.

993
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,570
Spent all my free time
playing music

994
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:42,839
and going to shows.

995
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,607
Hannah was the first one
to recognize that.

996
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,543
Made me stay true to it.

997
00:49:47,545 --> 00:49:50,446
Good girl.

998
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:54,583
And she got into...
graphic design.

999
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:58,086
Which was the first thing
that she really loved.

1000
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:01,656
Well, she loved you, too, right?

1001
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:05,826
Sometimes I wonder
about that part.

1002
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:11,363
But rarely more
than 50 times a day.

1003
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:14,233
So, what happened?

1004
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:16,502
She got a job offer.

1005
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:18,137
In Philly.

1006
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:21,106
And being the pre-med genius
that I was,

1007
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:25,210
I thought it was the perfect
time to... you know.

1008
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:28,445
Oh, no.

1009
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,848
So I bought a ring.

1010
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,851
Cost me a fortune.

1011
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:38,355
I was clutching
this thing all day.

1012
00:50:38,357 --> 00:50:40,323
My hand was cramping.

1013
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:44,260
We got home
to our apartment in D.C.

1014
00:50:44,262 --> 00:50:46,128
And my heart was pounding.

1015
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,829
It was beating out of my chest.

1016
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:48,630
I was sweating.

1017
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,732
It wasn't nerves, you know.

1018
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:52,800
It was...

1019
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,635
excitement.

1020
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:56,237
I was really excited.

1021
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,304
I was really...

1022
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:02,610
I was really happy.

1023
00:51:02,911 --> 00:51:05,912
And I walked in
and I saw her and...

1024
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:09,548
I just knew something was...

1025
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,383
different.

1026
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:15,353
I think it's like
that French word of yours.

1027
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:18,556
<i>- Dépaysement.
- Yeah.</i>

1028
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:22,593
She said...

1029
00:51:22,595 --> 00:51:26,330
she thought it was
a good time for a break.

1030
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:29,533
That's terrible.

1031
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:32,369
What did you do?

1032
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:35,738
What could I do?

1033
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,873
Beg? Cry?

1034
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,574
Didn't.

1035
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:41,309
Didn't do any of it.

1036
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,546
Just... sat there.

1037
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,914
Devastated.

1038
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:49,551
God, I was so completely...

1039
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,618
Blindsided.

1040
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,388
Yeah.

1041
00:51:56,457 --> 00:51:57,924
That was it.

1042
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:00,726
Till tonight.

1043
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:04,122
It's funny.

1044
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:07,699
I got to the city at noon and I
just couldn't leave the station.

1045
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,401
I just couldn't do it.

1046
00:52:09,403 --> 00:52:12,637
Stuck in the middle
till you got stuck with me?

1047
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,806
Am I stuck with you?

1048
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:16,373
Sorry to tell you.

1049
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:19,843
Sounds bad when you
put it like that.

1050
00:52:21,278 --> 00:52:22,545
I'm sorry.

1051
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:23,279
For what?

1052
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:25,682
For letting you sit out here
and talk about it for so long

1053
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,517
and not making you go back.

1054
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,485
Oh, no.

1055
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:31,354
No, that's not happening.

1056
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,256
You didn't come
all the way to New York

1057
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:35,791
for a sign to do nothing.

1058
00:52:35,793 --> 00:52:37,826
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd be alone.

1059
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:40,228
Not like in a depressing way.

1060
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,229
In like a romantic way.

1061
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:42,263
A girl like that is never alone.

1062
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:44,832
So you can't use that
for an excuse.

1063
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:46,766
And there was
something between you.

1064
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:47,834
You saw it and I saw it.

1065
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:49,670
That doesn't mean anything.

1066
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:51,005
It means something.

1067
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:52,806
It means you have a chance.

1068
00:52:52,808 --> 00:52:54,241
For what... to get slammed?

1069
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:58,410
Haven't you felt slammed
every day since the ring thing?

1070
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:00,246
And you don't know the odds.

1071
00:53:00,248 --> 00:53:01,413
Could be one in a trillion.

1072
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:02,848
It could be one in two.

1073
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,482
Anyway, this is about regret.

1074
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,884
And those odds are always 100%.

1075
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:09,453
There was a spark, Nick.

1076
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:12,857
And that guy she was with?

1077
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,559
Cole?

1078
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:16,526
I've seen that guy all my life.

1079
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:19,029
You're worth a thousand Coles.

1080
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,465
What happened to a trillion?

1081
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,734
He was tall.

1082
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,736
She might not even be with him!

1083
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:32,374
<i>She said, "I am staying
at the Soho Grand. "</i>

1084
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:36,578
You're not gonna
ask her to marry you.

1085
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,547
What if I ask her
to get married by mistake?

1086
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:46,419
God. Why is it
that any one decision

1087
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:50,423
always seems too small to be the
biggest decision of your life?

1088
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:52,824
I don't know.

1089
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:54,661
But sometimes you have to just

1090
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:57,496
make the choice and jump.

1091
00:53:59,399 --> 00:54:03,934
You're right. You're right.

1092
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,305
I'll do it.

1093
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,472
Oh, God.

1094
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:13,310
Are you planning on holding
my hand the whole time?

1095
00:54:13,312 --> 00:54:14,344
No.

1096
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:17,414
Give me your trumpet.

1097
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,364
So?

1098
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:16,365
She's happy I came back.

1099
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:17,666
We're going to lunch tomorrow.

1100
00:55:17,668 --> 00:55:19,601
- See?
- The three of us.

1101
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:21,402
She invited that guy?

1102
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:22,571
Of course not.

1103
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,005
She invited me?

1104
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:25,440
Nope.

1105
00:55:25,442 --> 00:55:28,676
Nick, will you stop
and talk to me?

1106
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:30,411
She's pregnant.

1107
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:32,980
But it's good, though,
you know why?

1108
00:55:32,982 --> 00:55:35,081
You know what she said?

1109
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:38,017
She said she's happy
I'm auditioning for Duke

1110
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:41,120
'cause she always
believed in me.

1111
00:55:41,122 --> 00:55:43,923
I'm so sorry.

1112
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,458
Sorry you're an idiot?

1113
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,394
Well, me, too.

1114
00:55:48,396 --> 00:55:50,028
Are you okay?

1115
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,463
Well, because if you're not,
I really don't know

1116
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:53,931
what I'll do with the guilt.

1117
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,567
Well, then I'm miserable.

1118
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:05,776
It's probably the most okay
I've been since she's left.

1119
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:11,080
Because at least I know
something concrete, you know?

1120
00:56:11,848 --> 00:56:15,917
Instead of having years
of fantasies and...

1121
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:18,453
possibilities...

1122
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:20,922
I know it's over.

1123
00:56:20,924 --> 00:56:24,858
So... thank you for that.

1124
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,060
Okay.

1125
00:56:27,062 --> 00:56:31,665
I'm still waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

1126
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:38,805
She said she's
never been so happy.

1127
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:46,811
But I guess I got
to be grown up.

1128
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:49,548
Got to be okay
with not being okay.

1129
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,882
Which completely sucks.

1130
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:56,187
So... thank you for that, too.

1131
00:56:56,189 --> 00:56:59,122
Well...

1132
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,691
what do you want to do now?

1133
00:57:01,693 --> 00:57:05,661
We've covered every
crucial topic in our lives.

1134
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:08,096
What's left?

1135
00:57:08,098 --> 00:57:11,199
Small talk.

1136
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,671
Come on.

1137
00:57:16,673 --> 00:57:17,905
It's past my bedtime.

1138
00:57:17,907 --> 00:57:21,042
I think we're both running
on fumes at this point.

1139
00:57:21,044 --> 00:57:22,242
I know and I feel bad!

1140
00:57:22,244 --> 00:57:23,243
You have your audition tomorrow.

1141
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,911
I feel like you should
be sleeping

1142
00:57:24,913 --> 00:57:26,613
- or practicing or...
- Nah.

1143
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:29,582
I don't think
it matters anymore.

1144
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:30,649
What does that mean?

1145
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:32,184
I don't think I'm gonna go.

1146
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:35,448
But that's why you came
to New York.

1147
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,819
To ask the stars
for a sign or whatever,

1148
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,925
- and the audition was
your sign. - I know.

1149
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,660
But the girl was the thing.

1150
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:44,282
No, I'm not gonna let you
get away with that.

1151
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:45,963
I heard you play,
and you loved it.

1152
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:47,197
Remember?

1153
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,001
Kind of feel like
it doesn't love me back.

1154
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,082
Let's do it.

1155
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,917
Come on, we've talked
about our past.

1156
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,118
Let's talk about our future.

1157
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,286
We can get a sign for your sign.

1158
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,055
Come on, you don't take
this seriously, do you?

1159
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:16,289
It's a scam.

1160
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,025
They tell you something vague.

1161
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,126
Your brain fills in the rest.

1162
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,896
Well, I don't expect the psychic
to solve both our problems.

1163
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,098
I think you're
taking it too seriously.

1164
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,833
Well, then what's the point?

1165
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,600
The point is, so what?

1166
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:29,935
I don't need to know my future.

1167
00:58:29,937 --> 00:58:31,603
I'm gonna live it anyway.

1168
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:36,741
You don't have to believe it
for it to make an impact.

1169
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:40,978
All right.

1170
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,680
Okay.

1171
00:58:42,682 --> 00:58:44,815
Are they even open?

1172
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:50,186
Oh!

1173
00:58:50,188 --> 00:58:51,954
Hello.

1174
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:53,656
You're good.

1175
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:55,624
Did you know we were coming?

1176
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:56,559
What?

1177
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:57,859
Oh! Oh, no.

1178
00:58:57,861 --> 00:59:00,061
No, it's trash day.

1179
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:02,064
Do you want a reading?

1180
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:04,799
We don't have any money.

1181
00:59:04,801 --> 00:59:05,833
I know.

1182
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,735
I had trouble sleeping.

1183
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:09,937
So I can use some company.

1184
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:11,939
Come on in.

1185
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:13,740
All right.

1186
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:15,075
He knows?

1187
00:59:15,077 --> 00:59:17,944
Should I be impressed
or offended?

1188
00:59:17,946 --> 00:59:19,211
<i>Okay.</i>

1189
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:20,813
Who wants to go first?

1190
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:21,846
Don't you use

1191
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:25,284
tarot cards or a crystal ball
or something?

1192
00:59:25,286 --> 00:59:26,085
Oh, I used to.

1193
00:59:26,087 --> 00:59:28,653
My wife thought
it made the customers

1194
00:59:28,655 --> 00:59:31,323
more comfortable if they saw me

1195
00:59:31,325 --> 00:59:34,058
actually doing something.

1196
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,993
But the truth is,

1197
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:38,696
all I really do is look at you.

1198
00:59:38,698 --> 00:59:40,863
Tell you what I see.

1199
00:59:40,865 --> 00:59:44,100
Where's your wife now?

1200
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,135
She passed.

1201
00:59:46,137 --> 00:59:47,103
Oh.

1202
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:48,638
I'm sorry to hear that.

1203
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,074
It's all right.

1204
00:59:51,076 --> 00:59:53,609
Okay, who's first?

1205
00:59:53,611 --> 00:59:55,110
- Oh, him fir...
- Start with her.

1206
00:59:55,112 --> 00:59:58,012
Okay, I'm seeing...

1207
00:59:58,014 --> 01:00:01,782
a trumpet! You're
a musician of some kind!

1208
01:00:01,784 --> 01:00:04,050
Your gift is truly staggering.

1209
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:06,052
Works every time.

1210
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:07,622
Even the skeptics.

1211
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,958
All right... young lady.

1212
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:17,830
What are we going
to do with you?

1213
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:19,999
You're at a crossroads, my dear.

1214
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:23,301
You think you know exactly...

1215
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:25,003
what your problem is,

1216
01:00:25,005 --> 01:00:27,972
and you're exactly wrong.

1217
01:00:27,974 --> 01:00:29,807
Why is that?

1218
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,376
You think you're trapped

1219
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,877
by what's happening to you.

1220
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:36,813
Actually, you've got choices.

1221
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:39,849
You're just afraid
to look at them.

1222
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:43,386
Okay. What are they?

1223
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:45,254
You could walk away.

1224
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:46,988
From what?

1225
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,423
I don't know.

1226
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:51,227
But you do.

1227
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:53,862
We can always walk away.

1228
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,197
And sometimes you should.

1229
01:00:57,766 --> 01:01:00,901
You could have a future
with our boy, here.

1230
01:01:00,903 --> 01:01:06,105
And no, I don't say that
to every couple who walks in.

1231
01:01:06,107 --> 01:01:07,674
Nick is a terrific guy,

1232
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:11,176
but I'm actually married
to somebody else.

1233
01:01:11,178 --> 01:01:15,048
You asked me about your choices.

1234
01:01:15,782 --> 01:01:18,016
I stand by what I see.

1235
01:01:18,018 --> 01:01:21,086
But what if the things that...

1236
01:01:21,088 --> 01:01:22,420
really matter...

1237
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:25,356
what if those choices
aren't up to me?

1238
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:28,892
You know the most important
thing I learned,

1239
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:32,128
after all my years of marriage?

1240
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:36,466
After an entire life
with one person?

1241
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:37,701
What's that?

1242
01:01:37,703 --> 01:01:42,237
That you can't allow
the people you love

1243
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:45,907
to determine how you love.

1244
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:50,144
Easier said than done.

1245
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:52,345
Sorry.

1246
01:01:52,347 --> 01:01:54,381
No refunds.

1247
01:01:56,018 --> 01:01:58,185
Would you mind
if I used your phone?

1248
01:01:58,187 --> 01:02:02,422
Oh, well, there's... there's a
phone in the room down the hall.

1249
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:06,025
Might give you
a little more privacy.

1250
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,059
Okay, thank you.

1251
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:08,861
Give Nick and I

1252
01:02:08,863 --> 01:02:11,429
a moment to chat.

1253
01:02:11,831 --> 01:02:13,998
Picking up
any Powerball numbers?

1254
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,836
I don't do races, roulette,

1255
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:19,003
or Powerballs.

1256
01:02:19,005 --> 01:02:20,138
- This your wife?
- Yes.

1257
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,506
She's beautiful.
Where was this taken?

1258
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,875
We danced our way
through something else.

1259
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:33,448
Hello.

1260
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,783
Hey. It's me.

1261
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,017
Oh, my God, Brooke.

1262
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:37,119
I've been trying to call you.

1263
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:38,453
I couldn't get the letter.

1264
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,988
There was no key.

1265
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,756
What?!

1266
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,325
It's in the magnetized box,
by the pool filter.

1267
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,826
No, it wasn't.

1268
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:46,761
I went over there,
and I found the box,

1269
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,862
but there was no key inside.

1270
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,498
Someone must've taken it
and not put it back.

1271
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,098
Um...

1272
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,299
Uh, you can break it;
break in.

1273
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:55,535
I know!
That's what I tried to do.

1274
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:56,402
I went to the back door,

1275
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:57,770
where I thought
no one could see,

1276
01:02:57,772 --> 01:03:00,139
and I found a rock,
and I broke the back window,

1277
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,274
but the alarm went off.

1278
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:02,041
I panicked.

1279
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:03,143
I'm so sorry, Brooke,

1280
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:04,376
but I panicked and ran.

1281
01:03:04,378 --> 01:03:05,310
Okay, okay.

1282
01:03:05,312 --> 01:03:06,779
It's okay, honey.
You tried.

1283
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:08,180
I'm so sorry.

1284
01:03:08,182 --> 01:03:09,881
It's okay. It's okay.

1285
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:12,884
It's already 5:00 a.m.,

1286
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:16,052
so why don't you
just get some sleep?

1287
01:03:18,023 --> 01:03:19,523
All right.

1288
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:20,490
Okay.

1289
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:21,824
Bye.

1290
01:03:23,861 --> 01:03:28,430
Believe me, I'd sure try,
if she was around.

1291
01:03:28,865 --> 01:03:32,101
I was at this party,
just after college,

1292
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:33,868
and the music came on.

1293
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,238
It was "Moon River. "

1294
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,940
And then...

1295
01:03:38,942 --> 01:03:40,240
here comes this girl...

1296
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:45,146
the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen!

1297
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:46,079
She comes up to me...

1298
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:51,185
and just drags me right out
onto the dance floor.

1299
01:03:51,187 --> 01:03:52,351
I tried to...

1300
01:03:52,353 --> 01:03:55,154
I had no idea how to dance.

1301
01:03:55,156 --> 01:03:57,089
But it didn't matter.

1302
01:03:57,091 --> 01:04:00,892
I would've made an absolute
fool out of myself

1303
01:04:00,894 --> 01:04:05,529
just to spend
one minute with her.

1304
01:04:06,164 --> 01:04:08,200
And I did.

1305
01:04:08,202 --> 01:04:10,568
And it all started...

1306
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,170
with a song.

1307
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:17,240
Wow.

1308
01:04:17,242 --> 01:04:19,509
You guys seemed perfect.

1309
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:21,344
Well, Nick...

1310
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:24,847
there is no perfect.

1311
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:27,582
There will always be struggle.

1312
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:32,321
You just have to pick
who you want to struggle with.

1313
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,142
You okay?

1314
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,280
He's only clairvoyant.

1315
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,381
What does he know?

1316
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,050
I feel so marginalized.

1317
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:10,086
He didn't even talk
about my future.

1318
01:05:13,258 --> 01:05:16,158
I don't suppose you want to take
a crack at it, do you?

1319
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,661
I know that
you're trying to cheer me up,

1320
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:20,229
and I appreciate it.

1321
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:22,230
But this is a huge tangled mess,

1322
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:25,367
and I'm sorry
I dragged you into it.

1323
01:05:28,103 --> 01:05:30,504
So would that be a no?

1324
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:34,975
You really want
to know your future?

1325
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,544
Maybe not.

1326
01:05:40,915 --> 01:05:45,684
You're a working musician
until your lips fall off.

1327
01:05:45,686 --> 01:05:47,619
You're revered.

1328
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:48,387
You have a...

1329
01:05:48,389 --> 01:05:51,156
- Maserati?
- A dog...

1330
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:54,392
functioning credit cards...

1331
01:05:55,661 --> 01:06:00,131
Fall in love with a woman
who deserves you.

1332
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:03,134
And she trusts you.

1333
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:09,939
Well, if I ever got that lucky,

1334
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:13,642
I probably wouldn't plan on
letting her down.

1335
01:06:22,484 --> 01:06:26,287
My anniversary
with Michael is August 17.

1336
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:29,289
And this year, I decided
impulsively to surprise him.

1337
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:30,958
He was in Atlanta.

1338
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,726
So I open his computer to check

1339
01:06:32,728 --> 01:06:35,027
when his last meeting
will be, and...

1340
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:37,563
this e-mail pops up...

1341
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:39,065
flagged urgent,

1342
01:06:39,067 --> 01:06:42,668
"tonight. "

1343
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:45,404
It was about a meeting,
all right.

1344
01:06:45,406 --> 01:06:48,540
It was the Ritz-Carlton,
room 1216,

1345
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:52,276
at midnight, signed "L. "

1346
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,546
And over the months
that followed...

1347
01:06:55,548 --> 01:07:00,516
he would address her as Lynn
and she would sign back...

1348
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:06,723
"Linny. "

1349
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,758
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

1350
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,696
I just read the e-mails over
and over, like a novel.

1351
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:22,535
He would tell her things
from the heart.

1352
01:07:22,537 --> 01:07:24,438
Things...

1353
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,274
Worries...

1354
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:30,710
Funny things.

1355
01:07:31,712 --> 01:07:35,447
Things that you tell someone
that you love.

1356
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:37,783
And your marriage?

1357
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:43,788
It was seemingly unchanged.

1358
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,658
Except that... every look,

1359
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,294
every joke...

1360
01:07:51,662 --> 01:07:54,498
every time we made love...

1361
01:07:55,299 --> 01:07:57,566
...became lies.

1362
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:00,669
And I was paralyzed.

1363
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:03,571
I couldn't confront him,
you know?

1364
01:08:03,573 --> 01:08:04,572
This is my life.

1365
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:05,507
It's my marriage.

1366
01:08:05,509 --> 01:08:11,346
This is my world and this is
my one chance at love.

1367
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:17,051
But then it stopped.

1368
01:08:17,053 --> 01:08:19,653
He said he felt guilty.

1369
01:08:21,755 --> 01:08:24,524
So maybe he chose me.

1370
01:08:25,225 --> 01:08:29,695
And then, two days ago,
he goes to Atlanta.

1371
01:08:29,697 --> 01:08:34,132
And I open the computer
and there it was...

1372
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:37,569
there was an e-mail
from her saying...

1373
01:08:38,671 --> 01:08:41,305
"I hear you're gonna be in town.

1374
01:08:41,307 --> 01:08:44,241
Are you free tomorrow night?"

1375
01:08:44,243 --> 01:08:45,309
And I went crazy,

1376
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:48,845
and I wanted
to tear out his eyes.

1377
01:08:51,782 --> 01:08:54,184
So I wrote him a letter.

1378
01:08:54,318 --> 01:08:55,318
I told him everything I knew

1379
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,487
and all the lovey things
he wrote to her and...

1380
01:08:57,489 --> 01:08:59,455
all the mean things
I wanted to say to him.

1381
01:08:59,457 --> 01:09:02,858
I mean, I dreamed of writing
that letter for months.

1382
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,794
And then, the grand finale,
I took my engagement ring,

1383
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:10,297
my wedding ring and I put them
in the... envelope,

1384
01:09:10,299 --> 01:09:14,502
and I left it on the bed,
on the pillow.

1385
01:09:14,504 --> 01:09:20,140
Only, now, he's coming home
instead of going to see her.

1386
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:28,746
When I was sitting
in that bar...

1387
01:09:30,116 --> 01:09:34,251
I suddenly realize
that I love Michael and...

1388
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,154
all these moments
came flooding back to me.

1389
01:09:36,156 --> 01:09:39,556
You know,
all the moments we shared.

1390
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:48,131
And... the lifetime of moments
that lay ahead and...

1391
01:09:48,565 --> 01:09:51,267
I realized that
I'd thrown it all away.

1392
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:54,636
I don't think
you've thrown anything away.

1393
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:56,839
I did.

1394
01:09:58,207 --> 01:09:59,841
You haven't seen the letter.

1395
01:10:01,245 --> 01:10:03,878
There's no coming
back from it.

1396
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:11,880
I could've talked to him or
forgiven him or worked it out.

1397
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:18,925
But I can't
come back from that venom

1398
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,628
and that hatred
and that ugliness.

1399
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:28,399
And so...

1400
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:30,835
I knew I had to get back home,

1401
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:33,870
so I could destroy
the evidence.

1402
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:37,741
And I jump up...

1403
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:41,278
to grab my bag,
and I turn around...

1404
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,648
Only it wasn't there.

1405
01:11:18,477 --> 01:11:21,379
Sometimes I think
about her skin.

1406
01:11:21,381 --> 01:11:24,883
I think about
if it's softer than mine.

1407
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:27,285
Brooke, don't do that.

1408
01:11:27,986 --> 01:11:30,754
I hate him for that.

1409
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:34,791
But you love him.

1410
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,928
What if he loves her more?

1411
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,231
I'd say that's a long shot.

1412
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:44,700
It's possible, isn't it?

1413
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,536
It's possible that
you could meet somebody

1414
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:48,570
who's perfect for you,

1415
01:11:48,572 --> 01:11:51,672
even though you're committed
to somebody else.

1416
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:52,640
No. No.

1417
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,275
See, I think if
you're committed to somebody,

1418
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:57,578
you don't allow yourself to find
perfection in someone else.

1419
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:02,315
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

1420
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,017
Well, if it's
what you want to hear,

1421
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,855
I think you already
made up your mind.

1422
01:12:12,425 --> 01:12:17,762
I think he's gonna find that
letter and call you immediately.

1423
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:21,299
Well, what if you're wrong?

1424
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:25,002
Well, then you face the music.

1425
01:12:26,771 --> 01:12:29,840
But at least you were brave.

1426
01:12:29,842 --> 01:12:30,774
You didn't run.

1427
01:12:30,776 --> 01:12:34,377
You held up your end
of the bargain.

1428
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:40,815
I think he's gonna be
begging you to forgive him.

1429
01:12:40,817 --> 01:12:42,617
I think he made a mistake.

1430
01:12:42,619 --> 01:12:44,686
And I think he knows it.

1431
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:49,690
We love who we love.

1432
01:12:49,692 --> 01:12:51,526
Sucks.

1433
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:02,669
Uh, I'll be right back.

1434
01:13:04,537 --> 01:13:08,340
Uh, is-is there
a bathroom back here?

1435
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,974
Yeah.

1436
01:13:32,562 --> 01:13:34,395
Taxi!

1437
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:39,368
What, I don't get a letter?

1438
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,335
- I have to go.
- Where?

1439
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:41,502
Are you people getting in,
or what?

1440
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:43,104
- This woman doesn't have
- He doesn't get out,

1441
01:13:43,106 --> 01:13:44,572
any money,
she's gonna stiff you.

1442
01:13:44,574 --> 01:13:45,772
call the police.
Give me one second,

1443
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:47,774
I will handle this.
I'm gonna go to JFK, and then

1444
01:13:47,776 --> 01:13:49,343
I'm gonna wake up
my mom in Indianapolis,

1445
01:13:49,345 --> 01:13:51,011
and I'm gonna stay there
for a while, and I don't know.

1446
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,945
I'll figure something out
from there. Maybe London.

1447
01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:54,780
London? What are you
talking about, Brooke?

1448
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:55,681
How are you gonna fly?

1449
01:13:55,683 --> 01:13:57,384
You don't have an I.D.,
you don't have money.

1450
01:13:57,386 --> 01:13:59,518
- I don't know.
- I'm out of here.

1451
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,387
Oh, great, thank you.

1452
01:14:01,389 --> 01:14:04,163
- I'm not gonna let you run.
- Why you?

1453
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:07,187
- Because I think I know who
you are. - And who's that?

1454
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:09,326
You're the girl
who recognized true love

1455
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:11,354
- and jumped for it.
- I can still be that girl.

1456
01:14:11,658 --> 01:14:13,130
But maybe I picked
the wrong guy.

1457
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:14,131
Nobody said I was smart.

1458
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:16,065
Yeah, well, five minutes ago,
you said you loved him.

1459
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:18,434
<i>Five minutes ago,
you said I loved him.</i>

1460
01:14:18,436 --> 01:14:20,571
I haven't said it
for a half hour.

1461
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:22,805
There's got to be
a better way to do this.

1462
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:24,107
What is it? You got
any bright ideas?

1463
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:26,109
You got another one
of your fucking bright ideas?

1464
01:14:26,111 --> 01:14:27,143
No, I don't, I don't.

1465
01:14:27,145 --> 01:14:28,810
But right now,
I'm the best advice you have.

1466
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,747
Well, if that doesn't tell you
everything you need to know.

1467
01:14:31,749 --> 01:14:32,614
Meaning?

1468
01:14:32,616 --> 01:14:34,548
Meaning if all I've got
is life advice

1469
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,951
from a stranger that
I met four hours ago,

1470
01:14:36,953 --> 01:14:38,386
then I'm in big trouble.

1471
01:14:38,388 --> 01:14:40,488
You quit med school
to be a musician, right?

1472
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,823
And now you're willing to blow
off the biggest audition

1473
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:45,959
of your life because the girl
you loved didn't choose you?

1474
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:49,062
See, it hurts, doesn't it, Nick?

1475
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:52,097
Who needs to face the music now?

1476
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:53,665
The only thing
that is stopping you

1477
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:55,067
from being the biggest loser
in New York

1478
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:58,069
is the fact that
I haven't left town yet.

1479
01:15:03,077 --> 01:15:06,144
Okay. Okay.

1480
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:11,815
Look, I hate when people
use this expression,

1481
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:13,617
so I'm sorry I'm about to,

1482
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:15,118
but can we just breathe?

1483
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,186
Can we just breathe?

1484
01:15:19,089 --> 01:15:20,956
It's been a long night.

1485
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,924
<i>We got a couple hours</i>

1486
01:15:22,926 --> 01:15:25,728
<i>before we got to get you
on your train.</i>

1487
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:30,131
<i>I think I know somewhere warm
we can go unwind.</i>

1488
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:52,083
Danny?

1489
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,856
Where do you think he is?

1490
01:15:58,858 --> 01:16:01,559
He's probably
passed out somewhere.

1491
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:03,194
You can go first.

1492
01:16:03,196 --> 01:16:03,993
Thank you.

1493
01:16:03,995 --> 01:16:06,796
I'm gonna order room service.
You hungry?

1494
01:16:06,798 --> 01:16:07,764
I'm starving.

1495
01:16:07,766 --> 01:16:08,799
What can we afford?

1496
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:11,568
Well, I was gonna charge it
to the room.

1497
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,970
I think we have a $300 budget.

1498
01:16:13,972 --> 01:16:15,205
Okay.

1499
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:17,139
Surprise me?

1500
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,644
Nick?

1501
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:25,480
Yeah.

1502
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,117
I'm sorry about all those things
that I said earlier.

1503
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:33,753
I guess I got
a little defensive.

1504
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:37,824
Define "defensive. "

1505
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,859
Um...

1506
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:42,228
Abusive?

1507
01:16:43,563 --> 01:16:45,197
Cruel?

1508
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:49,934
Complex.

1509
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:53,838
Okay.

1510
01:16:54,607 --> 01:16:56,241
Sorry.

1511
01:17:28,202 --> 01:17:31,271
What are you doing?

1512
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:05,754
I can't.

1513
01:19:05,756 --> 01:19:07,656
I'm sorry...

1514
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:09,625
I'm sorry.

1515
01:19:12,894 --> 01:19:15,196
At least you waited a few hours.

1516
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,632
That way, I don't feel
like a rebound.

1517
01:19:20,768 --> 01:19:24,203
Did I mention
that you were charming?

1518
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:26,640
You phrased it differently.

1519
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,142
What was that?

1520
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:30,474
"Biggest loser in New York"?

1521
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,824
Sorry.

1522
01:19:45,671 --> 01:19:47,902
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

1523
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,183
<i>"Thank you for your stay,
please help us improve. "</i>

1524
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:56,318
"Appearance. "

1525
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,086
Fair.

1526
01:20:58,088 --> 01:21:00,021
Not the... fair. Blonde.

1527
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:03,024
<i>Light-skinned, fair.</i>

1528
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,626
<i>"Cleanliness. "</i>

1529
01:21:06,219 --> 01:21:08,195
Much improved.

1530
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:11,493
"Decor. "

1531
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:16,502
Well, the art needed some work,
but we fixed that shit.

1532
01:21:17,404 --> 01:21:20,239
<i>"Would you be
likely to return?"</i>

1533
01:21:20,241 --> 01:21:22,307
<i>Let's leave that one blank.</i>

1534
01:21:22,309 --> 01:21:23,274
<i>Good idea.</i>

1535
01:21:23,276 --> 01:21:26,444
"How would you rate
your overall stay?"

1536
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:33,350
Exceeds expectations.

1537
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:57,071
How can one of the worst
nights of my life

1538
01:21:57,073 --> 01:21:59,140
also be one of the best?

1539
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:02,303
I don't know.

1540
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:07,756
I feel that we met
in Grand Central for a reason.

1541
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:16,020
I think that we were meant
to find each other.

1542
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:27,431
Want to know the real reason

1543
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:29,199
I stuck with music
all those years?

1544
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:32,435
'Cause Hannah wanted you to?

1545
01:22:32,437 --> 01:22:34,537
Not really.

1546
01:22:35,005 --> 01:22:38,908
I dreamt that one day, I'd be
playing with someone like Duke,

1547
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,209
and Hannah would walk in...

1548
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:44,213
And she'd see what she lost.

1549
01:22:44,215 --> 01:22:46,281
No.

1550
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:50,051
She'd want to try again.

1551
01:22:53,955 --> 01:22:55,322
I think we both had some things

1552
01:22:55,324 --> 01:22:58,825
we've been putting off
for way too long.

1553
01:23:08,202 --> 01:23:11,937
Say what's in your head.

1554
01:23:13,606 --> 01:23:16,974
I want to see
if I'm good enough.

1555
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,611
But not for her, for me.

1556
01:23:22,012 --> 01:23:24,981
Say what's in your head.

1557
01:23:24,983 --> 01:23:26,550
I want to smash him.

1558
01:23:26,552 --> 01:23:27,984
Good.

1559
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:29,919
Deserves it.

1560
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:35,357
But you love him.

1561
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:38,594
But I love him.

1562
01:23:39,962 --> 01:23:41,629
I do feel like I have to go back

1563
01:23:41,631 --> 01:23:45,166
and see what we're willing
to do about that.

1564
01:23:47,302 --> 01:23:50,538
Because I would never
forgive myself

1565
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:53,440
if I didn't fight for it.

1566
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:56,977
It's time to stop running,

1567
01:23:56,979 --> 01:23:59,211
but for now,

1568
01:23:59,213 --> 01:24:03,349
let's enjoy this
for a little while longer.

1569
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,693
Nick.

1570
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:33,361
It's you again.

1571
01:25:33,363 --> 01:25:37,699
Listen, I want to give you
one more piece of advice.

1572
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:41,234
You're gonna be
playing one night...

1573
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,537
Grand Central... thinking
of every reason in the world

1574
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:47,606
to not go see the girl
that broke your heart.

1575
01:25:48,642 --> 01:25:52,978
Then you're gonna meet somebody.

1576
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,280
And now at first,

1577
01:25:55,282 --> 01:25:59,050
she's gonna seem... icy.

1578
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:03,688
You're gonna know right away
she's trouble.

1579
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:05,022
She's gonna take all your money.

1580
01:26:05,024 --> 01:26:08,692
You're probably gonna get
punched in the face.

1581
01:26:08,694 --> 01:26:10,727
But, uh...

1582
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:12,261
stay with her.

1583
01:26:12,263 --> 01:26:17,065
You're gonna need her a lot more
than she needs you.

1584
01:26:21,372 --> 01:26:23,705
And at the end of the night,
you're gonna want

1585
01:26:23,707 --> 01:26:25,507
to say some things, but don't.

1586
01:26:25,509 --> 01:26:28,709
Don't ruin it.

1587
01:26:28,711 --> 01:26:33,347
It's nothing she doesn't
already know.

1588
01:26:33,349 --> 01:26:37,450
Just give her a kiss.

1589
01:26:37,452 --> 01:26:41,153
Wish her good luck.

1590
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:42,722
And, uh...

1591
01:26:42,724 --> 01:26:44,391
thank her.

1592
01:26:44,393 --> 01:26:48,027
Thank her for showing you
that you can love

1593
01:26:48,029 --> 01:26:52,263
more than one person
in this life.

1594
01:26:59,137 --> 01:27:01,104
Oh, wait!

1595
01:27:01,106 --> 01:27:02,773
Um, Nick?

1596
01:27:02,775 --> 01:27:04,741
It's Brooke.

1597
01:27:04,743 --> 01:27:09,279
Don't pay your credit card bill
that month.

1598
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:15,084
Okay.

1599
01:27:16,219 --> 01:27:20,488
He said he wasn't
planning on it.

1600
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:37,573
Good luck.

1601
01:27:37,575 --> 01:27:40,576
Thank you, Nick.
