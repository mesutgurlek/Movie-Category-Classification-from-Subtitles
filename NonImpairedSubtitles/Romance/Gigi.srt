1
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,842
Bonjour, monsieur.

2
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,838
Bonjour, madame...and company.

3
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:48,970
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:52,928
As you see, this lovely city
all around us is Paris.

5
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:57,181
And this lovely park is, of course,
the Bois de Boulogne.

6
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,725
Pardon me.

7
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,692
Who am l?

8
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,533
Well, allow me to introduce myself.

9
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:12,121
l am Honoré Lachaille.

10
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,120
Born: Paris.

11
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:15,457
Date:

12
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:17,876
Not lately.

13
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,795
This is 1 900.
So let's just say. . .

14
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,126
. . .not in this century.

15
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:24,964
Circumstances:

16
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,343
Comfortable.

17
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,636
Profession:

18
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:31,391
Lover and collector
of beautiful things.

19
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:33,640
Not antiques, mind you.

20
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,481
Younger things.

21
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,188
Yes, definitely younger.

22
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,985
Married?
What for?

23
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,157
Now, please don't misunderstand.

24
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:50,737
Like everywhere else,
most people in Paris get married.

25
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,331
But not all.

26
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,960
There are some who will not marry
and some who do not marry.

27
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,086
But here in Paris,
those who will not are usually men. . .

28
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:04,917
. . .and those who do not
are usually women.

29
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:09,221
Now, for example,
here we find exhibit A:

30
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,135
The married kind.

31
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,016
These ladies stood their ground
And won

32
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,477
And I salute them, every one

33
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,818
Here are some others to behold

34
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:26,231
For whom the bells have never tolled

35
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,279
Oh, what a poor, defenseless pair

36
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,824
In those pathetic rags they wear

37
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,852
And there is the future.

38
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,064
Someday, each and every one of them. . .

39
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,568
. . .will either be married. . .

40
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,659
. . .or unmarried.
How adorable they are!

41
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,915
Each time I see a little girl

42
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,285
Of 5 or 6 or 7

43
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,876
I can 't resist the joyous urge

44
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,924
To smile and say thank heaven

45
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,877
For little girls

46
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,971
For little girls
Get bigger every day

47
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,811
Thank heaven for little girls

48
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,184
They grow up
In the most delightful way

49
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:47,236
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing

50
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,493
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling

51
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,455
Thank heaven for little girls

52
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,375
Thank heaven for them all

53
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,291
No matter where
No matter who

54
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,459
Without them
What would little boys do?

55
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,803
Thank heaven

56
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,346
Thank heaven

57
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,719
Thank heaven

58
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,974
For little girls

59
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,893
This story is about a little girl.

60
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,568
lt could be any one of those girls
playing there. But it isn't.

61
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,649
lt's about one in particular.

62
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:33,535
That one.
Her name is Gigi.

63
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,281
Gigi!

64
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,957
What you have to look forward to!

65
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,369
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing

66
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:50,212
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling

67
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,548
Thank heaven

68
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,222
For little girls

69
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,058
Thank heaven for them all

70
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:00,883
No matter where
No matter who

71
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:04,397
Without them
What would little boys do?

72
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,234
Thank heaven

73
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:09,737
Thank heaven

74
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,912
Thank heaven

75
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,364
For little girls!

76
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,514
Hello, Grandmama.

77
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,270
Gigi, where have you been?

78
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,771
Playing in the park.
l had to, Grandmama.

79
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,820
My foot fell asleep in class.
lt wouldn't wake up.

80
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,986
Did you forget what day it is?

81
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,775
lt's Tuesday.

82
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:58,113
Aunt Alicia!
Well, l'd better run.

83
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,071
You cannot go to your Aunt Alicia's
looking like that.

84
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:04,705
Put your coat on.
Let me comb your hair.

85
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,032
Yes, Grandmama.

86
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:11,498
l hate this coat.
lt makes my legs feel so long.

87
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:14,042
Yes, your legs are long.

88
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:16,294
You know. . .

89
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:20,925
. . .sometimes l'm sorry
you never learned to dance.

90
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:25,604
But l want to, Grandmama.
Why don't you let me take lessons?

91
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:28,056
No. Not the same mistake twice.

92
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:31,852
Your mother took singing lessons,
and look where she ended up.

93
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:36,692
Slaving away at the Opéra-Comique
in ridiculous little roles.

94
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,659
-She seems happy.
-Happy!

95
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,662
l went to see her one night.
l couldn't even find her.

96
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,159
ln the first act. . .

97
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:45,326
. . .she was behind a tree.

98
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,917
ln the second act. . .

99
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,871
. . .behind a tenor.

100
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,469
Mama's awake.
lsn't it early?

101
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,757
She's on this afternoon.
If I Were King.

102
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:05,344
That's more than she does
in the whole opera.

103
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,980
And when l think of
that delightful old gentleman. . .

104
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,977
. . .with all those flour mills.

105
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:13,266
Who?

106
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:14,976
Nothing.

107
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:19,278
You go to school every morning.
You see your Aunt Alicia once a week.

108
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,818
That's all the lessons you need.

109
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,656
When the time comes,
you'll be ready.

110
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,995
Ready for what, Grandmama?

111
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,576
Enough. Now run.

112
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,585
-Goodbye, Grandmama.
-Goodbye, Gigi.

113
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:54,981
--more powerful, monsieur.
Sixty kilometers an hour!

114
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,981
There's nothing faster on the road,
monsieur. Not here or in America.

115
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,859
Your uncle is here, monsieur.

116
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:04,487
Of course, the smaller is
a first-rate machine, monsieur.

117
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,953
Naturally, the larger one
is more expensive.

118
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,707
l'd be happy to
demonstrate both.

119
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:12,666
l beg your pardon, Monsieur Gaston.
Your father wanted me to ask you. . .

120
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,629
. . .did you, by any chance, buy the
Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée Railroad?

121
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,719
The Paris-Lyon-Méd--?
Yes, yes, l did.

122
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:22,763
According to this morning's
opening at la Bourse...

123
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,640
. . .it's gone up 1 2 points.

124
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,007
l thought it would.

125
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,973
Monsieur Lachaille, about the car.

126
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,472
Send it over in the morning
with the bill.

127
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,649
Yes, monsieur. Thank you.
But which one?

128
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,938
My dear fellow, l don't care.
Either one.

129
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,822
l'm sorry l kept you waiting, Uncle.
Why didn't you come upstairs?

130
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,489
l was afraid l'd meet
my brother and sister-in-law.

131
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,903
-You would have.
-l have to tell you. . .

132
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,823
. . .your parents bore me to death.

133
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,539
-Me too.
-But l've known them longer. . .

134
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,792
. . .so they've been boring me longer.

135
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,125
After you.

136
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,205
Your father is actually quite unique.

137
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,253
He was a bore at the age of 5.

138
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:05,885
All he has to say is, ''Hello,''
and l can barely keep my eyes open.

139
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:07,387
Armenonville.

140
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,559
l waited for you at the embassy
last Sunday. What happened?

141
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,525
The thought of another embassy tea
paralyzed me.

142
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,150
lnstead, l had tea with an old friend
Madame Alvarez.

143
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,403
-Madame Alvarez?
-Yes, you know her.

144
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,778
Or knew her once, didn't you?

145
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,207
-Does she say l did?
-l think she's mentioned it.

146
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,120
Then l suppose l did.

147
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:37,414
lt's the one place in Paris
where l can go and relax.

148
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,963
Whose luncheon are you
taking me to today?

149
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,586
Henri Trouvère.

150
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,290
We have to go.

151
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,264
l'm meeting a heavenly creature there.

152
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:49,302
You're still young, Uncle, aren't you?

153
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,803
Not compared to her.

154
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,351
But l must say,
l am compared to you.

155
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:57,933
Maybe it's the women you go with.
How old is Liane?

156
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,356
About 30.

157
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:02,904
That may be it.
Youth is the thing, Gaston.

158
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,612
Youth!
Stay close to the young. . .

159
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,569
. . .and a little rubs off.

160
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:08,983
l'm bored.

161
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,159
Bored?

162
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:15,543
Look at all the captivating
Fascinating things there are to do

163
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:17,493
Name two

164
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,536
Look at all the pleasures

165
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:22,834
All the myriad of treasures
We have got

166
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,547
Like what?

167
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:28,049
Look at Paris in the spring
When each solitary thing

168
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:31,101
Is more beautiful than ever before

169
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:35,269
You can hear every tree
Almost saying, ''Look at me!''

170
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,016
-What color are the trees?
-Green!

171
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,602
-What color were they last year?
-Green!

172
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,603
-And next year?
-Green!

173
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,356
It's a bore

174
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,982
Don 't you marvel at the power
Of the mighty Eiffel Tower

175
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,987
Knowing there it will remain evermore

176
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,821
Climbing up to the sky

177
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:52,538
Over 90 stories high

178
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,207
-How many stories?
-Ninety!

179
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,040
-How many yesterday?
-Ninety!

180
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,917
-And tomorrow?
-Ninety!

181
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:59,587
It's a bore!

182
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,297
The river Seine

183
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,090
All it can do is flow

184
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,800
But think of wine

185
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:05,965
It's red or white

186
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:10,052
-But think of girls
-It's either yes or no

187
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:13,848
And if it's no or if it's yes
It simply couldn 't matter less

188
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,265
But think of a race

189
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,347
With your horse in seventh place

190
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:18,934
Then he suddenly begins

191
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,146
And he catches up and wins
With a roar!

192
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:23,724
It's a bore!

193
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,814
Life is thrilling as can be

194
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,484
Simply not my cup of tea

195
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,235
It's a gay, romantic fling

196
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,821
If you like that sort of thing

197
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,697
-It's intriguing
-It's fatiguing

198
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:33,821
It's a game

199
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,414
It's the same dull world
Wherever you go

200
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:40,409
Whatever place you are at

201
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,706
The Earth is round

202
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,128
But everything on it is flat

203
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,715
Don 't tell me
Venice has no lure

204
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,766
Just a town without a sewer

205
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,176
The Leaning Tower I adore

206
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,720
Indecision is a bore

207
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,108
But think of the thrill
Of a bullfight in Seville

208
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,068
When the bull is uncontrolled

209
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,942
And he charges at the bold matador!

210
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,949
It's a bore!

211
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,569
Think of lunch beneath the trees

212
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,362
Stop the carriage, if you please

213
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:14,954
You mean you don 't want to come?

214
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:16,658
The thought of lunch leaves me numb

215
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,946
But I implore

216
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:19,870
Oh, no, Uncle.

217
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,621
It's a bore!

218
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,210
Goodbye, Honoré.

219
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,675
Come in.

220
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,015
-Mamita.
-Gaston!

221
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,766
What a wonderful surprise.

222
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:46,485
How do you feel today, dear Mamita?

223
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:50,022
Fine, Gaston.
And the better for seeing you.

224
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:53,822
You've gotten a trifle thinner,
and it's most becoming.

225
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,029
-You think so?
-Oh, yes.

226
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,073
Come and sit down.

227
00:14:58,582 --> 00:14:59,862
ln your chair.

228
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,323
Thank you.

229
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:04,870
What beautiful material.

230
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,500
Very chic!

231
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,879
Just the sort of thing
Honoré used to wear.

232
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,336
A bit more conservative, perhaps.

233
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,883
Would you like a sweet?

234
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:20,511
No, thank you. But l would love a cup
of your chamomile tea.

235
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,011
But of course.

236
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,142
More than just one, l hope.

237
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,558
Do you have a telephone yet, Mamita?

238
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,277
No, not yet.

239
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,360
Not until Gigi is old enough
to have secrets and admirers.

240
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,452
But there's one upstairs
if it's important.

241
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,203
lt's not important.

242
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,451
Gigi's not at home?

243
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,707
No. This is Tuesday.

244
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,461
The day she has luncheon
with her aunt Alicia.

245
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:50,717
How is your sister?
l haven't seen her for quite a while.

246
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,587
l don't wonder.

247
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:56,214
She never sets foot out of
her apartment or her past.

248
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:58,761
And quite a past it was. . .

249
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,215
. . .so she says.

250
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,435
According to the stories
Honoré tells me. . .

251
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,604
. . .what she says is quite true.

252
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,099
Aren't you afraid of
her influence on Gigi?

253
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:08,522
Not at all.

254
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,696
She finds Gigi a trifle backward. . .

255
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,447
. . .which is true. . .

256
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,282
. . .and she educates her.

257
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,910
Educates her?

258
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:20,946
Last week, she taught her
to eat cold lobster. . .

259
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,451
. . .to perfection.

260
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,244
What in heaven's name for?

261
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,243
She says it's extremely useful.

262
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,036
Marvelous.

263
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,505
lt's so good to be here.

264
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,552
lt's always a pleasure
to watch the rich. . .

265
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,428
. . .enjoying the comforts of the poor.

266
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,137
Especially you, dear Gaston.

267
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:48,024
How does your sister look?
Still as young as ever?

268
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,398
Yes, Alicia is always the same.

269
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,648
Living in the past
must agree with her.

270
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,944
When l think. . .

271
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:57,522
. . .it was in. . .

272
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:59,569
. . . 1 859. . .

273
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,993
. . .she went off with her first sultan.

274
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:04,240
Then came her Duke of Milan. . .

275
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,998
. . .her King of Spain,
her khedive, her maharajah.

276
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,952
She's remarkable looking. . . .

277
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,355
Good day, Charles.

278
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:38,280
Mademoiselle.

279
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,158
What are we having for lunch?

280
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:41,900
Ortolans.

281
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,820
Oh, dear!
Are they difficult?

282
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,494
Slowly, Gigi. Slowly.

283
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:53,079
The racing season is over.

284
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,049
Good day, Aunt Alicia.

285
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,666
Now let's go into luncheon.

286
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,297
Yes, Aunt Alicia.

287
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:02,970
Today you will learn to eat ortolans.

288
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:23,696
What are ortolans, Aunt?

289
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,704
Exquisite little birds.

290
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,785
Most people attack them like cannibals.

291
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,077
You must learn to eat them properly.

292
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:32,617
Bad table manners. . .

293
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,248
. . .have broken up more households
than infidelity.

294
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,551
Did you work hard in school today?
What did you study?

295
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:47,799
History.

296
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,303
Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.

297
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,762
How depressing.

298
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,897
-What else?
-English.

299
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,188
English?
l suppose we must.

300
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,777
They refuse to learn French.

301
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:02,031
Who are your friends?

302
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:06,153
Ortolans should be cut in two
with a quick stroke of the knife.

303
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,582
There must be no grating
of the blade on the plate.

304
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,998
Now bite up each piece.

305
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,219
The bones don't matter.

306
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,222
Go on eating while you
answer my questions.

307
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,145
But don't talk with your mouth full.

308
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,356
Well, you can do it.
lf l can do it, you can.

309
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,233
What friends have you made?

310
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,769
None.

311
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,984
l'm always on my own.

312
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,784
Why does Grandmama stop me
from accepting invitations?

313
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,416
She's right for once.

314
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,117
You'd only be invited
by ordinary people.

315
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:56,833
What about us?
Aren't we ordinary people?

316
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:59,877
Why are we different?

317
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:03,584
They have weak heads
and careless bodies.

318
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,714
Besides, they are married.

319
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,594
But l don't think you would understand.

320
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:11,053
Oh, yes, Aunt, l understand.

321
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,396
We don't marry,
is that it?

322
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:19,563
Marriage is not forbidden to us.

323
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:22,394
But instead of
getting married at once. . .

324
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:25,449
. . .it sometimes happens
we get married. . .

325
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:26,531
. . .at last.

326
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,580
Enough. We must finish lunch
and get on with your lessons.

327
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,500
Now, go on.
Go on, go on!

328
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,799
Without knowledge of jewelry,
my dear Gigi. . .

329
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,805
. . .a woman is lost.

330
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,302
Do you remember Madame Dunard,
who was here the other day?

331
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,436
Did you notice that rope
of black pearls around her throat?

332
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,183
Yes! lt was beautiful.

333
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,852
Dipped.

334
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:03,027
Dipped. Given to her
by the man she loves. . .

335
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:05,694
. . .whose love is obviously
beginning to cool. . .

336
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:07,741
. . .and she doesn't know it.

337
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,869
lt's just a matter of time now.

338
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,865
Now, let us see what you remember.

339
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:17,782
What is this?

340
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,498
A marquise diamond.

341
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:23,328
A marquise-shaped diamond.

342
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,542
This?

343
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:28,341
This is. . .

344
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,423
. . .a topaz?

345
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:32,881
A topaz?

346
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:35,676
Among my jewels?
Are you mad?

347
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:39,557
lt's a yellow diamond
of the first quality.

348
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:43,102
You'll have to go a long way
to see one like it.

349
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:46,564
-This?
-An emerald.

350
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,069
How beautiful.

351
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:49,653
Do you see that blue flame. . .

352
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,406
. . .darting about in the depths
of the green light?

353
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,490
Only the most beautiful emeralds. . .

354
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:58,040
. . .contain that miracle
of elusive blue.

355
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,701
-Who gave it to you, Aunt?
-A king.

356
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:02,913
-A great king?
-No, a little one.

357
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,331
Great kings do not
give very large stones.

358
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:06,423
Why not?

359
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:09,801
ln my opinion, it's because
they don't feel they have to.

360
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,131
Who does give the valuable jewels?

361
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,179
Who?

362
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,925
Oh, the shy, the proud.

363
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:19,311
And the social climbers.
They think it's a sign of culture.

364
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,765
But it doesn't matter
who gives them. . .

365
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:25,145
. . .as long as you never
wear anything second-rate.

366
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,903
Wait for the first-class jewels, Gigi.

367
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:31,363
Hold on to your ideals.

368
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,075
Come over here to the light, Gigi.

369
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:39,787
Open your mouth.

370
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,077
With teeth like that. . .

371
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:47,342
. . .l could have devoured
all Paris and most of Europe.

372
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,338
But l can't complain.
l had a good bite of it.

373
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:54,719
Tell your grandmama
to get you some astringent lotion.

374
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,883
You don't use face powder, do you?

375
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:59,432
-Grandmama won't let me.
-l should hope not.

376
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:02,565
You have an impossible nose,
a nondescript mouth.

377
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,146
Your cheekbones are too high.

378
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:09,312
But we can do something
with the rest of you.

379
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,238
Your teeth, your eyes. . .

380
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,692
. . .your eyelashes, your hair.

381
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:14,907
We can. . .

382
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,698
. . .and we will.

383
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,865
You must learn to choose cigars.

384
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,372
Aunt, but l don't smoke cigars.

385
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,619
Of course you don't smoke cigars.

386
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,830
But a man does.

387
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:29,501
Everything l teach you. . .

388
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,545
. . .has a good reason.

389
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:36,348
Love, my dear Gigi. . .

390
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,928
. . .is a thing of beauty,
like a work of art.

391
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,972
And like a work of art,
it is created by artists.

392
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:48,066
The greater the artist,
the greater the art.

393
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:52,188
And what makes an artist?

394
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:54,699
Cigars and jewelry?

395
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,993
You are from another planet.

396
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,582
Get on with your work.

397
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,092
A necklace is love

398
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,225
A ring is love

399
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:24,560
A rock from some obnoxious little king
Is love

400
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,766
A sapphire with a star is love

401
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:31,186
An ugly black cigar is love

402
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,564
Everything you are is love

403
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:38,278
You would think it would embarrass
All the people here in Paris

404
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:41,028
To be thinking every minute of love

405
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,795
I don 't understand the Parisians

406
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,465
Making love every time
They get a chance

407
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:01,016
I don 't understand the Parisians

408
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,895
Wasting every lovely night on romance

409
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,060
Anytime

410
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:09,273
And under every tree in town

411
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:12,561
They're in session two by two

412
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,026
What a crime

413
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,524
With all there is to see in town

414
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:20,823
They can 't find something else to do

415
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,123
I don 't understand how Parisians

416
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,671
Never tire of walking hand in hand

417
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:32,082
But they seem to love it

418
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,048
And speak highly of it

419
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,760
I don 't understand

420
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:39,258
The Parisians!

421
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,894
l don't understand the Parisians!

422
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:04,945
When it's warm

423
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:07,531
They take a carriage ride at night

424
00:26:08,418 --> 00:26:10,992
Close their eyes and hug and kiss

425
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:12,870
When it's cold

426
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:15,088
They simply move inside at night

427
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:18,791
There must be more to life than this

428
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:23,098
I don 't understand the Parisians

429
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,721
Thinking love so miraculous and grand

430
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,854
But they rave about it

431
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,892
And won 't live without it

432
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,603
I don 't understand

433
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:37,489
The Parisians!

434
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:41,404
Stop.

435
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,210
What are you doing there?

436
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:54,871
Gaston. . .

437
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,507
. . .do you make love all the time?

438
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:58,672
l beg your pardon?

439
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:01,127
-Do you make love all the time?
-Heavens, no.

440
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:04,348
The only people who make love
all the time are liars.

441
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:06,764
Was that the subject
of your lesson today?

442
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:10,726
-How did you know l was having a lesson?
-l just came from your house.

443
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:15,266
Too bad l wasn't there. We could've
played cards, and l could've beaten you.

444
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:16,820
But you cheat.

445
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,314
l can, but with you,
l don't have to.

446
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:21,274
You watch your tongue, my girl.

447
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,442
-l'm not your girl.
-Thank you for that.

448
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,823
lf l have a little girl, l'll see
to it she's more respectful than you.

449
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,285
-Come with me.
-Where?

450
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,537
-To the lce Palace.
-l don't skate.

451
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,824
-l'll buy you a drink.
-l don't drink.

452
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,579
-A sweet one.
-Are you going to skate?

453
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:37,004
No, but l'm calling
for Madame d'Exelmans.

454
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:38,793
Liane? Your lady love?

455
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,630
No, thank you.
l've had enough of that for today.

456
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:43,505
l'm not going to woo her on ice.

457
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,590
Come along before l spank you.

458
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,094
You wouldn't dare!

459
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,803
Oh, l wouldn't, eh?

460
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:20,997
Sit down.

461
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:24,376
Sit down.

462
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:27,132
Haven't you ever seen
an ice rink?

463
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,380
Never.

464
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:32,932
Grandmama says going out distracts one
from more serious matters.

465
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:35,349
A barbotage for the lady.

466
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,107
-What's that?
-Quiet.

467
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,233
Champagne for me. Well-iced.

468
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:40,690
Yes, Monsieur Lachaille.

469
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:47,320
ls that the scandalous
Madame d'Exelmans?

470
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,537
Yes, that's she.

471
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,211
Tell me, Gigi, the way
you express yourself. . .

472
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:00,173
. . .does your grandmother
ever hear you talk this way?

473
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:01,959
She never listens to me much.

474
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:05,925
Which reminds me, she mustn't know
l was here with you.

475
00:29:06,138 --> 00:29:09,092
And why not?
What's wrong with being with me?

476
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,760
lt isn't you. lt's here.

477
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,591
l told you.
This isn't serious matters.

478
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:17,222
And just what are serious matters?

479
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,982
l don't remember it all by heart.

480
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:22,400
One mustn't read novels;
they depress you.

481
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:24,735
Don't wear powder;
it ruins the complexion.

482
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,908
Don't wear corsets;
they spoil the figure.

483
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,868
What do you think of Liane?

484
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:40,077
She's pretty.

485
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:41,708
Yes, she is.

486
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:43,079
But. . . .

487
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:44,955
But what?

488
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:46,959
Common.

489
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:48,925
Common?

490
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:55,686
How do you mean ''common''?
Ordinary common or coarse common?

491
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,677
Ordinary.

492
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:01,644
And coarse. Well, l really must go.
Please come soon.

493
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:04,571
-Thank you for the drink.
-lt was a pleasure.

494
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:12,323
Hello, my darling.

495
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,287
You waltz divinely.

496
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,951
Thank you, my love.

497
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:22,085
l'll let you know
when l'll be in for my next lesson.

498
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:23,583
Yes, madame.

499
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,798
l thought we'd meet Honoré
at Maxim's and--

500
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,083
Darling.

501
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:35,514
At Maxim's?

502
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,141
Thank you. . .monsieur.

503
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:41,691
Dreadful man.

504
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:44,142
You seem to have lessons
with him often enough.

505
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:47,320
He's an excellent teacher.
l made amazing progress.

506
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:51,819
But he's so conceited.
So superior in an inferior way.

507
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,406
l can't stand him.

508
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:54,991
Shall we go?

509
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:08,666
Gaston and Liane are joining me
here at Maxim's tonight.

510
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,798
l'm giving a small party. . .

511
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:15,804
. . .in honor of a heavenly creature
l met this afternoon.

512
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,055
She's--
Pardon me.

513
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:20,678
She's the sister
of the heavenly creature. . .

514
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,062
. . .l gave a party for last night.

515
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:26,813
What a marvelous place Maxim's is!

516
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,355
Not only gay and beautiful,
but in one thing unique:

517
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:33,736
ln Maxim's, everybody minds
his own business.

518
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:38,490
No one is the slightest bit interested
in whom one is with.

519
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:54,627
There's that wretched man
Louis de Latour

520
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,921
With his latest horrible amour

521
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:01,354
Isn 't she a mess
Isn 't she a sight

522
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:04,263
Let's invite them out tomorrow night

523
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:20,320
Honoré Lachaille
Honoré Lachaille

524
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,574
With another twinkle in his eye

525
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:27,172
Isn 't it a shame
Isn 't it a crime

526
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,921
Seeing him so happy all the time

527
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:44,225
There's Gaston Lachaille
With his little friend

528
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:47,638
Is that passion never going to end

529
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,974
Did you see her ring?
Not a bagatelle

530
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,652
Dear Liane is doing very well

531
00:33:26,815 --> 00:33:29,057
She's a lovable one tonight, isn 't she?

532
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:31,440
What is she up to?

533
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:34,983
She's so gay tonight

534
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,152
She's like spring tonight

535
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,577
She's a rollicking
Frolicking thing tonight

536
00:33:40,912 --> 00:33:43,783
So disarming
Soft and charming

537
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:46,532
She is not thinking of me

538
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:49,828
No, she's not thinking of me

539
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,708
In her eyes tonight

540
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:54,467
There's a glow tonight

541
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,886
They're so bright they could light
Fontainebleau tonight

542
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:00,754
She's so gracious
So vivacious

543
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:04,050
She is not thinking of me

544
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:06,604
Bless her little heart

545
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:10,274
Crooked to the core

546
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,735
Acting out a part

547
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,530
What a rollicking, frolicking bore!

548
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,326
She's such fun tonight

549
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:23,120
She's a treat tonight

550
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,830
You could spread her on bread
She's so sweet tonight

551
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,291
So devoted
Sugarcoated

552
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:32,964
That it's heartwarming to see

553
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,673
Oh, she's simmering with love

554
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:37,509
Oh, she's shimmering with love

555
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,470
Oh, she's not thinking of me

556
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:00,742
She is not thinking of me

557
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,319
Someone has set her on fire

558
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:07,488
Is it Jacques, is it Paul or Léon?

559
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,409
Who 's turning her furnace up higher?

560
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:14,792
Oh, she's hot
But it's not for Gaston!

561
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:17,880
Oh, she's gay tonight

562
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:19,879
Oh so gay tonight

563
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:23,133
A gigantic romantic cliché tonight

564
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:26,345
How she blushes
How she gushes

565
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:29,094
How she fills me with ennui

566
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,057
She's so ooh la la la la

567
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:33,809
So untrue la la la la

568
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,773
Oh, she's not thinking of me

569
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:47,366
l knew she was up to something.

570
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:50,410
l knew it. There had to be
a reason for last night.

571
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,328
But what was l to do?

572
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,163
Trail after her? Spy on her?

573
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,913
-Sniff around like a bloodhound?
-Of course not.

574
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:00,630
Heaven knows, l'm not jealous.
Thank you for that.

575
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,261
Why should l follow her?

576
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,760
No reason at all.
What did you do?

577
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,510
l hired detectives.

578
00:36:07,017 --> 00:36:09,093
And the results are nauseating.

579
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:14,061
The Riverton Agency just telephoned me
that she and her oily acrobat. . .

580
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:18,902
. . .arrived a half an hour ago
in a cozy little inn at Honfleur.

581
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:20,026
Well.

582
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,525
Without skates.

583
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:23,282
Most disagreeable.

584
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,108
Come, my boy.
You're not the first.

585
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,452
This sort of thing
has happened before.

586
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:30,199
And to some very good people.

587
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:33,459
Alfred de Musset,
Victor Hugo, Napoleon.

588
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,994
Even to me.
lsn't that true, Manuel?

589
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,841
Yes, indeed, sir.
Many, many, many times.

590
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:40,370
Well, not that many.

591
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,044
But a skating instructor.

592
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:45,257
A skating instructor!

593
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:47,720
lt is always a skating instructor.

594
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:49,635
Or some such specimen.

595
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:52,640
-lsn't that true, Manuel?
-Absolutely, sir.

596
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:55,434
Remember dear little
Madame Dumelle. . .

597
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:58,392
. . .and Marmaluc the Terrible Turk?

598
00:36:58,652 --> 00:36:59,767
There you are.

599
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:01,985
A wrestler from the Folies Bergère.

600
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,860
There was Madame Laura
and the swimming coach.

601
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:06,362
Hurry up, Manuel.

602
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:09,402
And Madame d'Albert
and the riding master.

603
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,206
Mademoiselle Monique
and the weight lifter. . .

604
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:13,497
. . .Madame Bocher and the plumber.

605
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:16,040
That's enough, Manuel.
You've made your point.

606
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:17,961
Here, put this in your mouth.

607
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:22,165
One can't be a Don Juan
to one's valet, can one?

608
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,051
l only keep him to prevent him
from talking to others.

609
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:28,635
Oh, come, Gaston, cheer up.

610
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:32,555
Cheer up? l couldn't be
in better spirits.

611
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,307
Good. l'm delighted
the deadly affair is over.

612
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:38,684
The woman was common.
Plainly and unmistakably common. . .

613
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:41,901
. . .from her painted toenails
to the top of her bleached head.

614
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:44,781
l'm glad to be rid of her.
What do we do today?

615
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:47,986
What do we do?

616
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,742
We're going to Honfleur, naturally.

617
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:53,493
Are you mad?
l never want to see her again.

618
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,405
Of course you don't.

619
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,580
But you're not going to
let a woman have the last word.

620
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,587
Where is your sense of honor?

621
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,498
Your male patriotism?

622
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:03,587
Nonsense.

623
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,419
Listen to your uncle, Monsieur Gaston.
He's an old campaigner.

624
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,007
How would you end it?

625
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,094
l'll write her a note.

626
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:17,062
There is no way of writing it
without it reeking of wounded pride.

627
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:19,100
Victor Hugo couldn't pull it off.

628
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:21,775
Then l'll telephone her.

629
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,521
And what would you say?

630
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:27,777
''Liane, you deceived me
with a skating instructor.

631
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,941
l never want to see you again. ''

632
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:33,700
You'll sound like
a jealous schoolboy.

633
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:35,825
That's impossible.

634
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:37,703
That's true.

635
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,751
That's true.
What do l do?

636
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,130
You go to Honfleur
and throw her out like a man.

637
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:45,873
That's a bore.

638
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:48,295
A bore? Not at all.

639
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:49,966
lt's pride.

640
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:52,467
Just imagine your chagrin

641
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,384
When she sees you wander in

642
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,801
And you find her
With that slippery señor

643
00:38:57,854 --> 00:38:59,183
What a moment supreme

644
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,018
When she totters with a scream

645
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:02,513
-What will she do?
-Scream.

646
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,354
-What did yours do?
-Scream.

647
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:06,438
-What do they all do?
-Scream.

648
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:08,149
It's a bore

649
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:09,817
But think of the bliss

650
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:11,485
Of the pleasure you would miss

651
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,369
When she topples in a heap

652
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:16,372
And you leave her there to weep
On the floor

653
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:18,196
It's a bore

654
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,244
You must catch her if you can

655
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:21,913
For the dignity of man

656
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,794
Take advantage of the chance

657
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,455
You owe it, sir, to France
This is war!

658
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:28,416
All right

659
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:30,296
But it's a bore

660
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,859
Turn it around and leave it there.

661
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,045
They are there.

662
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:25,353
Terrible-looking rodent, isn't he?

663
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,603
Terrible, but typical.

664
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,978
Those chaps all look alike.

665
00:40:31,572 --> 00:40:33,780
She looks older in the daylight.

666
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,286
Much older.
l don't envy him.

667
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:38,617
Neither do l.

668
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,578
She never kissed me like that.

669
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:44,910
-How is she kissing him?
-Wholeheartedly.

670
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:46,159
What do you expect?

671
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:49,091
You're legitimate.
He's forbidden fruit.

672
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:50,751
When do we make our move?

673
00:40:51,009 --> 00:40:51,875
Wait, wait.

674
00:40:57,348 --> 00:40:58,379
Come on.

675
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:09,730
Monsieur Lachaille, what a surprise.
l am honored.

676
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,189
Don't be.
Come on, get up!

677
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:14,317
Wait, wait!
You are making a mistake.

678
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:18,654
lt was just a coincidence,
my meeting madame here.

679
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,530
lt was a coincidence,
l suppose. . .

680
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:22,698
. . .that your lips
just happened to meet. . .

681
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,499
. . .in a long, ardent, passionate--

682
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:25,996
You keep out of this.

683
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:29,872
l don't want any discussions.
For 1 000 francs, this never happened.

684
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:32,843
You leave the lce Palace
and disappear. Forever.

685
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,504
-But--
-No ''buts. ''

686
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,594
You're coming with us now.

687
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,673
We'll take you to
the nearest railroad station.

688
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,135
1 000 francs?

689
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:09,753
There is nothing more to be said.
Goodbye, madame.

690
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:12,881
From the bottom of my heart, goodbye.

691
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:18,213
Gaston, my love.

692
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:41,900
What happened?

693
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,405
Liane d'Exelmans has committed suicide.
Again!

694
00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:48,827
l'm sorry, girl.
What did you say?

695
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,627
l didn't know he left her.

696
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,627
My word!

697
00:42:58,428 --> 00:42:59,590
Of course.

698
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:03,216
Call me as soon as you hear anything.
Anything at all.

699
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,344
How marvelous!

700
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:07,310
Paris agog.

701
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:10,475
Why didn't you tell me that Gaston
and Liane had broken up?

702
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:13,851
l didn't know it.
lt must've happened over the weekend.

703
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,653
When was the suicide?

704
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:17,737
-Last night.
-How did she do it?

705
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:20,617
The usual way,
insufficient poison.

706
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:22,653
Say, how many times
has she done it now?

707
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:23,902
Good evening, Manuel.

708
00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:26,152
Good evening, Honoré.

709
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,581
Gaston, my boy.

710
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:31,127
Congratulations.

711
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:33,169
Your first suicide.

712
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,583
What an achievement.
And at your age.

713
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:39,456
Like everyone in Paris,
we were just talking about you.

714
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,297
Thank you, Honoré.
l came over to--

715
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:42,718
May l add mine, sir?

716
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:45,055
Thank you, Manuel.
l came over to get a--

717
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:46,719
lt was a stunning victory.

718
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:48,175
-Where is the champagne?
-lt's ready, sir.

719
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:51,349
l came over to get away
from the telephone.

720
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:54,727
l can imagine.
Any news from the corpse?

721
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:58,443
Fully recovered, according to
late morning editions.

722
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,114
And how do you feel?

723
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:02,358
Oddly enough, l'm not quite sure.

724
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:03,572
Make a guess.

725
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:05,612
Well, l'd say edgy.

726
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:07,366
Edgy?

727
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,912
Almost depressed. l don't know why.

728
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,792
There must be a reason.

729
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,036
l suppose it's to be expected.

730
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:18,590
l'm told Verdi felt that way after
the first performance of Aida.

731
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,671
-Get a glass for yourself.
-l have one, sir.

732
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:24,336
To you, Gaston.

733
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,925
May this be the first of many.

734
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:37,265
What about tonight?
Where do we go? What do we do?

735
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:41,145
l don't know. l should consider
what l do next very carefully.

736
00:44:41,364 --> 00:44:45,991
l've been weighing the idea of
going to the country for a while.

737
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:49,699
You mean, leave Paris?

738
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:51,458
Yes. Why not?

739
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:53,292
Why not?

740
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,666
That's the one thing
you mustn't do.

741
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:59,456
Do you want people to think
you're despondent? Disturbed?

742
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:01,756
lf you leave, they will, you know.

743
00:45:01,968 --> 00:45:06,677
No, no. That would be snatching
defeat from the jaws of victory.

744
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:11,428
No, no, no. For the next few weeks,
you should be out every night.

745
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,720
Maxim's, Moulin Rouge,
Pre Catalan.

746
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,355
The Pre Catalan is closed.

747
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:17,891
Open it!
You must be carefree.

748
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,027
Devil-may-care.

749
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:24,646
A different girl every night.
Keep them guessing who's next.

750
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:26,652
Play the game.
Be gay. . .

751
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:29,483
. . .extravagant, outrageous.

752
00:47:10,472 --> 00:47:11,587
Grandmama!

753
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,596
lmagine. Gaston bought out
the opera last night. . .

754
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:18,980
. . .and brought the entire company
to his house for a performance.

755
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:21,811
l'll go.

756
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:29,109
Gaston, how are you?
You look all in.

757
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,029
-ls your grandmother home?
-Yes, she is.

758
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:33,740
ls that gold?

759
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,532
The handle, yes.

760
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,114
You must be very rich to have
a gold handle on your cane.

761
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,202
Gaston, what a nice surprise.

762
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:42,079
Don't let me disturb you, Mamita.

763
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:44,252
l was just preparing dinner.

764
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,833
Smells awfully good.

765
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:49,834
lt's just a pork cassoulet.

766
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:54,547
lt was impossible to
get any goose this week.

767
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:57,887
l'll have them send you
a brace from the country.

768
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:01,183
l brought you some caramels.

769
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,017
Thank you, Gaston.

770
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,309
Gaston, you spoil her so.

771
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:08,568
The champagne is for you.

772
00:48:11,074 --> 00:48:13,566
You spoil me too.

773
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:16,948
Be careful.
You'll ruin your hands.

774
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:18,913
l have a manicure every morning.

775
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:20,618
What a nuisance.

776
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,915
-Not like that.
-No?

777
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,164
Like this.

778
00:48:28,426 --> 00:48:29,504
All right.

779
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,133
-Where are you going with that tie?
-Let's not talk about it.

780
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,509
l'm having a small party
for 200 at the Eiffel Tower.

781
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:42,144
-Are you going away?
-Yes, for the weekend. Trouville.

782
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:45,766
A little sea air before the
next round of parties.

783
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,564
-ls Trouville by the sea?
-Yes, you little idiot.

784
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:51,351
You expect to find sea air
in the mountains?

785
00:48:51,614 --> 00:48:54,533
Don't make fun of me.
l've never been to the ocean.

786
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:57,943
What will you eat
for dinner tonight?

787
00:48:59,623 --> 00:49:02,328
Filet of sole with mussels,
for a change.

788
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:05,993
And a lamb filet with truffles.

789
00:49:06,422 --> 00:49:09,127
lt's always the same.
lt can't compare. . .

790
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:12,083
. . .with your grandmother's cassoulet.

791
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:16,259
Why don't you stay
and have some with us?

792
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,344
-l wish l could.
-Why not?

793
00:49:25,023 --> 00:49:27,230
All right, l will.

794
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:29,727
But people are waiting for you.

795
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:33,314
My car's downstairs. l'll send
the chauffeur with my apologies.

796
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:34,813
My uncle will be the host.

797
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,363
Honoré? He'll do it very well.

798
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:42,406
l'm dying to take a ride
in your beautiful automobile.

799
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:44,750
Let me deliver it.

800
00:49:45,043 --> 00:49:46,418
lf you want to.

801
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:49,755
Tell the chauffeur to take this
to my uncle's house.

802
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:52,543
-Go quickly.
-Thank you.

803
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,085
l can't wait to see
the face of the janitress.

804
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:58,299
And after dinner, we'll have
a serious game of cards.

805
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:00,050
And l'll beat you, as usual.

806
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,177
And you'll cheat, as usual.

807
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:10,639
Gaston, Gigi takes advantage of you.

808
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:12,978
Let her, let her, Mamita.

809
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:14,567
lt amuses me.

810
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,292
How is Honoré these days?

811
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:28,998
The same.

812
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:31,662
A life devoted to the chase.

813
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:36,082
We've missed you, Gaston.
We haven't seen you since the suicide.

814
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:38,799
Yes, l've had quite a
full schedule lately.

815
00:50:39,472 --> 00:50:40,587
So l've read.

816
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,716
You always do things
in the grand manner.

817
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,854
Your parties have
filled the newspapers.

818
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:51,391
Sometimes the cure is more
painful than the illness.

819
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:54,315
But l have to do it.
lt's expected of me.

820
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:56,228
Poor Gaston.

821
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:59,439
You're in a difficult position,
aren't you?

822
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,402
Yes, Mamita, yes.
Very difficult.

823
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:05,906
See, the whole of Paris
is watching me.

824
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:08,124
What are you talking of?

825
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,249
The whole world is watching you.

826
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:16,003
Yes, it's quite a responsibility.

827
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,420
Quite a responsibility.

828
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:29,974
Discard two.

829
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:34,066
Ten pounds of sugar.

830
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:39,281
Those aren't very high stakes.
Your sugar isn't that good.

831
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:41,147
l'd rather play you for candy.

832
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,576
lt's the same thing,
only sugar is healthier.

833
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:46,657
You just say that
because you make it.

834
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:49,495
Gigi, l heard that.
Where are your manners?

835
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,584
lt's all right, Mamita.
lt's all right.

836
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:59,297
lf l lose, what would you really like?
Silk stockings?

837
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:02,091
No. Silk stockings
make my legs itch.

838
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:03,303
l discard one.

839
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:06,593
What l would really like
is a Nile green corset. . .

840
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:09,806
. . .with rococo roses embroidered
on the garters.

841
00:52:12,482 --> 00:52:15,234
Or a new role for the player piano.

842
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:17,977
Or. . . .

843
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:19,686
Or what?

844
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:21,532
A look at the ocean.

845
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,990
All right.

846
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,743
lf l lose, l'll take
you and Mamita to Trouville.

847
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,201
l heard that too.

848
00:52:35,922 --> 00:52:38,081
Don't worry, Gaston.

849
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,010
Win or lose, Gigi, you will not impose
us on poor Gaston for the weekend.

850
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,049
May l have a glass of champagne?

851
00:52:46,308 --> 00:52:49,558
Are you losing your mind?
Of course you may not.

852
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,650
Discard three.

853
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:08,943
Discard one.

854
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,537
Now, let's see.

855
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:17,506
Cards are a matter of logic.

856
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:22,377
l know what l have. . .

857
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:25,508
. . .and l know how many you've drawn.

858
00:53:26,057 --> 00:53:30,267
According to the percentages,
you undoubtedly have an ace.

859
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:34,222
You discarded a 1 0
and a five. . .

860
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:35,933
. . .and a queen. . .

861
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:37,525
. . .and a three.

862
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:42,102
You, therefore, must have two aces.

863
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:45,944
Two aces and something smaller.

864
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,526
That's very interesting.

865
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:52,613
Therefore. . .

866
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:54,830
. . .l win.

867
00:53:55,669 --> 00:53:58,041
And therefore, you lose.

868
00:53:59,464 --> 00:54:02,465
But you cheated.
Where did you get that fourth king?

869
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:04,302
l won, l won, l won!

870
00:54:04,553 --> 00:54:07,044
Why, you gypsy!
You thief!

871
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:09,381
You're a muttonhead.
Do we go to Trouville?

872
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:11,800
Yes, yes. You go to Trouville.

873
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:14,802
Grandmama, we go to Trouville.

874
00:54:15,229 --> 00:54:16,855
lt's out of the question.

875
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:19,599
Not at all. l'd love it.
Believe it or not. . .

876
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:22,439
. . .l have a better time
with this outrageous brat. . .

877
00:54:22,696 --> 00:54:25,448
. . .than anybody in Paris.
lt'll be marvelous fun.

878
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:28,741
What time tomorrow will we get there?
Can I watch you play roulette?

879
00:54:29,035 --> 00:54:32,203
May I stay up late for supper?
Is it awfully, awfully upper?

880
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:34,288
Gigi, you'll drive us wild

881
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,416
Stop, you silly child

882
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:42,081
Is everybody celebrated
Full of sin and dissipated?

883
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:45,509
Is it hot enough to blister?
Will I be your little sister?

884
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,925
Gigi, you are absurd

885
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:50,588
Now, not another word

886
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,595
Let her gush and jabber

887
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:55,173
Let her be enthused

888
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,353
I cannot remember
When I have been more amused

889
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:03,317
-Stop it!
-The night they invented champagne

890
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:05,321
It's plain as it can be

891
00:55:05,572 --> 00:55:07,114
They thought of you and me

892
00:55:07,366 --> 00:55:09,488
The night they invented champagne

893
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:11,901
They absolutely knew

894
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:13,788
That all we'd want to do

895
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,079
Is fly to the sky on champagne

896
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,664
And shout to everyone in sight

897
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:24,123
That since the world began
No woman or a man

898
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:28,381
Has ever been as happy
As we are tonight

899
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:35,051
The night they invented champagne

900
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:39,516
It's plain as it can be
They thought of you and me

901
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:42,104
The night they invented champagne

902
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,445
They absolutely knew that
All we'd want to do

903
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,986
Is fly to the sky on champagne

904
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,364
And shout to everyone in sight

905
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,370
That since the world began

906
00:55:55,622 --> 00:55:56,997
No woman or a man

907
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:00,582
Has ever been as happy
As we are tonight

908
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:21,563
Why, there's Gaston.

909
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,396
l didn't know he would
be at Trouville.

910
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,936
Who's that child he's with?

911
00:56:30,698 --> 00:56:34,234
Me, l'm here on
very important business.

912
00:57:08,737 --> 00:57:10,112
There she is.

913
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:00,741
Riding is important.

914
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:02,578
Go.

915
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:34,193
Chérie...

916
00:58:35,408 --> 00:58:39,191
. . .l must tell you that you upset
all my plans for the weekend.

917
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:41,362
-May l?
-Please.

918
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:44,700
How did l do that?

919
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,332
l came prepared for battle. . .

920
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:50,705
. . .and an old wound
prevented me from charging.

921
00:58:50,964 --> 00:58:54,167
l don't think she
was your type anyhow, Honoré.

922
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:56,300
-You were watching me?
-Force of habit.

923
00:58:56,553 --> 00:59:00,087
When a pretty woman came by,
l always had to watch you.

924
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:02,431
What good fortune
brings you to Trouville?

925
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:04,143
l came with Gaston and Gigi.

926
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:05,301
You did?

927
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,931
Gigi is my granddaughter.

928
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:09,022
No, not your granddaughter.

929
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:13,567
Oh, yes. Time does not
stand still for all of us, Honoré.

930
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:20,659
Don't be nervous!

931
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:26,948
Gaston is such a dear man.

932
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:30,791
So sweet of him to bring
little Gigi and show her Trouville.

933
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:33,788
She's having a glorious time.

934
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:36,002
And so is Gaston.

935
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:39,089
l haven't seen him
this chipper in years.

936
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:45,595
We had good times too. . .

937
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:47,009
. . .didn't we?

938
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,437
Come to think of it,
those last days we spent together. . .

939
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,181
. . .were by the sea, weren't they?

940
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:54,482
Were they?

941
00:59:55,154 --> 00:59:56,696
Of course they were.

942
00:59:56,906 --> 01:00:00,404
On the Riviera.
The pink villa.

943
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:03,862
-l only remember the blue villa.
-Which was that?

944
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,285
The one belonging to the soprano.

945
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:09,950
You knew.

946
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:11,247
But of course.

947
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:14,415
But l thought you left me
because of that Austrian count.

948
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:15,835
But of course.

949
01:00:16,174 --> 01:00:17,373
But you didn't.

950
01:00:20,011 --> 01:00:22,633
l'll tell you about
that blue villa, Mamita.

951
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:26,798
l was so much in love,
l wanted to marry you.

952
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,258
Yes, it's true.

953
01:00:28,603 --> 01:00:31,308
l was beginning to think of marriage.

954
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:33,936
lmagine!
Marriage, me.

955
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:36,942
No. l was really desperate.

956
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:40,114
l had to do something.
And what l did was the soprano.

957
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,820
Thank you, Honoré.

958
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:45,609
That is the most charming and endearing
excuse for infidelity. . .

959
01:00:45,828 --> 01:00:47,406
. . .that l've ever heard.

960
01:00:48,164 --> 01:00:50,407
But l've never forgotten you.

961
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:53,325
Not the last evening we spent together.

962
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:58,252
l can remember everything
as if it were yesterday.

963
01:00:59,217 --> 01:01:00,497
We met at 9

964
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:01,924
We met at 8

965
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:03,377
I was on time

966
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:04,843
No, you were late

967
01:01:05,557 --> 01:01:06,387
Ah, yes

968
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:08,806
I remember it well

969
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:11,259
We dined with friends

970
01:01:11,605 --> 01:01:12,683
We dined alone

971
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:13,935
A tenor sang

972
01:01:14,273 --> 01:01:15,305
A baritone

973
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:17,023
Ah, yes

974
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:19,567
I remember it well

975
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:23,149
That dazzling April moon

976
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:26,200
There was none that night

977
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:29,406
And the month was June

978
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:31,989
That's right

979
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:33,532
That's right

980
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:37,044
It warms my heart
To know that you

981
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:40,631
Remember still
The way you do

982
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:43,000
Ah, yes

983
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:47,260
I remember it well

984
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:56,981
-How often I've thought of that Friday--
-Monday

985
01:01:57,318 --> 01:02:00,401
--night, when we had
Our last rendezvous

986
01:02:01,404 --> 01:02:04,939
And somehow I foolishly
Wondered if you might

987
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,534
By some chance
Be thinking of it too

988
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,071
That carriage ride

989
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:14,745
You walked me home

990
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:16,122
You lost a glove

991
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,795
I lost a comb

992
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:19,376
Ah, yes

993
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,540
I remember it well

994
01:02:22,968 --> 01:02:24,297
That brilliant sky

995
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:25,633
We had some rain

996
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:26,960
Those Russian songs

997
01:02:27,264 --> 01:02:28,674
From sunny Spain?

998
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:30,048
Ah, yes

999
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:32,219
I remember it well

1000
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,643
You wore a gown of gold

1001
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:38,560
I was all in blue

1002
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:41,902
Am I getting old?

1003
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:44,269
Oh, no

1004
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:45,980
Not you

1005
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:48,116
How strong you were

1006
01:02:49,285 --> 01:02:50,401
How young and gay

1007
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:52,277
A prince of love

1008
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:54,248
In every way

1009
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:56,538
Ah, yes

1010
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:01,956
I remember it well

1011
01:03:19,024 --> 01:03:20,518
-Where is she?
-ln the salon, madame.

1012
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:21,973
What's happened?

1013
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:24,352
What's so important you couldn't
tell me on the telephone?

1014
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:28,361
We have serious matters to discuss.
Collect yourself.

1015
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:31,536
l doubt if l'll ever be able to.

1016
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:34,905
Serious matters about what?

1017
01:03:35,165 --> 01:03:36,540
About Gigi.

1018
01:03:38,418 --> 01:03:42,000
You were at Trouville over the weekend
with Gaston Lachaille.

1019
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,215
lt was a dreadful mistake.

1020
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:47,171
Dreadful mistake?
What are you talking about, Alicia?

1021
01:03:47,385 --> 01:03:49,093
My dear sister. . .

1022
01:03:49,346 --> 01:03:53,130
. . .has it ever occurred
to you that Gigi. . .?

1023
01:03:54,183 --> 01:03:55,215
Well?

1024
01:04:00,524 --> 01:04:01,686
Gigi?

1025
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:04,147
Yes, Gigi.

1026
01:04:07,155 --> 01:04:08,649
lt isn't possible.

1027
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:11,321
Not if it's ruined at the
beginning through lack of tact.

1028
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:15,663
And when did l display any lack of tact?
lt was a most congenial weekend.

1029
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:19,746
So congenial that Gaston returned,
canceled all engagements. . .

1030
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:22,539
. . .and left Paris that same evening
for Monte Carlo.

1031
01:04:22,754 --> 01:04:24,628
He did?
For how long?

1032
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:27,088
For what they describe as
an extended stay.

1033
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:28,373
But why?

1034
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:30,260
lt doesn't matter why.

1035
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:33,679
lt may be a blessing in disguise.
lt gives us time.

1036
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:34,803
Time for what?

1037
01:04:35,057 --> 01:04:37,465
For Gigi's lessons, of course.

1038
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:40,136
See to it that she's here every day.

1039
01:04:48,112 --> 01:04:50,271
Do you really think. . .?

1040
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:53,903
lt's a chance.
But a chance that we must take.

1041
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,868
From now on, dear sister. . .

1042
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:58,873
. . .it's work, work, work. . .

1043
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:02,290
. . .lessons, lessons, lessons.

1044
01:05:09,718 --> 01:05:13,383
Pick up the coffeepot with one hand
and the cup and saucer with the other.

1045
01:05:13,597 --> 01:05:16,467
Always both.
Never the coffeepot alone.

1046
01:05:16,724 --> 01:05:17,887
Like this, Aunt?

1047
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:20,427
Your grip on the saucer
must be firm. . .

1048
01:05:20,646 --> 01:05:22,519
. . .but not obviously so.

1049
01:05:22,856 --> 01:05:25,347
The saucer must seem so much
a part of your fingers. . .

1050
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:28,728
. . .that one would think
it could only be removed by surgery.

1051
01:05:28,986 --> 01:05:30,315
Now pour. . .

1052
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:35,033
. . .and be sure the coffeepot is upright
before you take the cup away.

1053
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,534
There must be no drops.

1054
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:42,289
Now give it to me.

1055
01:05:45,003 --> 01:05:49,166
l don't take any, but be sure and
always ask about cream and sugar.

1056
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:51,209
Now serve yourself.

1057
01:05:51,468 --> 01:05:53,342
And remember the firm grip.

1058
01:05:53,553 --> 01:05:56,091
No, the coffeepot first!

1059
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:06,389
Now, you will try it once more.

1060
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,401
Remember, you will go
to the door properly. . .

1061
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:12,612
. . .turn, walk in properly
and sit down properly.

1062
01:06:12,823 --> 01:06:14,021
Now, go on.

1063
01:06:15,825 --> 01:06:20,037
And not like a marionette.
Keep your shoulders level.

1064
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:21,409
Now turn. . .

1065
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:24,322
. . .walk back and sit down.

1066
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,620
And don't flop into the chair.

1067
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:32,004
lnsinuate yourself.

1068
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:34,422
That's better.

1069
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:37,305
Now rise and exit the same way.

1070
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:39,097
Don't jump up!

1071
01:06:39,516 --> 01:06:41,011
Ascend!

1072
01:06:54,198 --> 01:06:57,198
Now, you hold the glass like this.

1073
01:06:58,535 --> 01:07:00,777
Charles, some more wine
for mademoiselle.

1074
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:08,576
Watch me.

1075
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:12,663
Try it.

1076
01:07:14,259 --> 01:07:15,540
Don't gulp it!

1077
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:19,253
Sip it. A little at a time.

1078
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:23,009
Fill mademoiselle's glass, Charles.

1079
01:07:26,855 --> 01:07:28,314
That's better.

1080
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:31,857
You have to fully enjoy the aroma.

1081
01:07:32,193 --> 01:07:35,694
Hold your first sip on the roof
of your mouth for a moment. . .

1082
01:07:35,906 --> 01:07:40,200
. . .and breathe through your nose.
Then you will feel the flavor.

1083
01:07:47,293 --> 01:07:49,535
Did you feel the perfume?

1084
01:07:53,006 --> 01:07:54,833
-No.
-Try it again.

1085
01:07:55,092 --> 01:07:56,835
A bad year will be sharp.

1086
01:07:57,093 --> 01:08:00,759
A good year, which this is,
of course, will waft.

1087
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:07,221
Marvelous!

1088
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:09,893
That will be all, Charles.

1089
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:01,796
Hello, Grandma--

1090
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:11,884
Hello, Gigi.

1091
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:13,343
Come in.

1092
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:19,394
How good to see you.

1093
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:21,986
l have a present for--

1094
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:25,400
What's the matter with her?

1095
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:26,855
Everything.

1096
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:30,036
Don't you look well!

1097
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:32,746
Did you have a nice trip?

1098
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:36,289
How was Monte Carlo this year?

1099
01:10:36,628 --> 01:10:39,747
Well, the sea is blue.
The palm trees are green.

1100
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:42,961
The sun is yellow.
lt all makes a lovely post card.

1101
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:45,092
Just as it should be.

1102
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:46,715
Actually, it's a bore.

1103
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:51,307
One has to be as rich as you
to be bored at Monte Carlo.

1104
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:54,552
l brought Gigi some caramels.

1105
01:10:54,812 --> 01:10:57,483
Really, Gaston,
you spoil her too much.

1106
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,232
Would you like a cup of chamomile tea?

1107
01:11:00,443 --> 01:11:02,103
Please. Please, Mamita.

1108
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,702
Look, Gaston.

1109
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,247
Four yards of material in the skirt.

1110
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:24,706
Well, don't l look great ladyish?

1111
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:27,507
You look like
an organ-grinder's monkey!

1112
01:11:29,765 --> 01:11:31,674
An organ-grinder's monkey?

1113
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:33,593
What happened to your
little Scotch dress?

1114
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:36,259
And that ridiculous collar!

1115
01:11:36,897 --> 01:11:38,557
And what's wrong with that collar?

1116
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:41,686
lt makes you look like
a giraffe with a goiter.

1117
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,781
With all the talk
there is about you, Gaston. . .

1118
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:50,738
. . .l've never heard it said
you had any taste in clothes.

1119
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:53,823
Have you gone mad? How dare you
speak to Gaston like that?

1120
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,073
Apologize.
Apologize at once!

1121
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:58,865
l certainly will not.
This is a beautiful dress.

1122
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:00,040
Gaston, please.

1123
01:12:00,253 --> 01:12:02,459
l beg of you, wait.
She'll apologize.

1124
01:12:02,672 --> 01:12:05,709
ls this the education she gets
from you and your sister?

1125
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:08,174
My congratulations to you both.

1126
01:12:10,889 --> 01:12:11,968
What have you done?

1127
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:15,266
Why did he fly off the handle?
He knew l'd answer him back.

1128
01:12:15,476 --> 01:12:16,972
You ungrateful little thing.

1129
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:20,142
How can you be rude to Gaston
when he's been so good to us?

1130
01:12:20,357 --> 01:12:22,812
And just when
we were trying so hard. . .

1131
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:25,686
. . .to make an elegant
young lady out of you.

1132
01:12:25,904 --> 01:12:28,525
To show you off
to your best advantage.

1133
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:32,068
You must admit, one doesn't have to
turn oneself inside out. . .

1134
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:34,366
. . .for an old friend like Gaston.

1135
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:35,996
lt's silly.

1136
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,200
lt's absolutely silly.

1137
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:14,111
l've decided your new dress
may not be as bad as all that.

1138
01:13:14,744 --> 01:13:17,911
l didn't see it properly,
and perhaps l was a bit cruel.

1139
01:13:18,123 --> 01:13:20,495
To prove it,
l'll take you for a drive. . .

1140
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:23,116
. . .for tea at the Reservoirs
in Versailles.

1141
01:13:23,336 --> 01:13:25,330
-Would you like that?
-l'd love it!

1142
01:13:26,423 --> 01:13:29,507
Gaston wants to take me
to tea at the Reservoirs.

1143
01:13:30,427 --> 01:13:33,594
You've come back, Gaston.
How tolerant you are.

1144
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:34,961
l hadn't really gone.

1145
01:13:35,223 --> 01:13:37,548
We're going to tea
at the Reservoirs.

1146
01:13:37,809 --> 01:13:38,924
No, you're not.

1147
01:13:39,311 --> 01:13:40,687
l'm sorry, Gaston.

1148
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:42,684
What do you mean?

1149
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:43,929
Grandmama, please.

1150
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,230
Gigi, go to your room
for a moment.

1151
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:49,189
l have to talk to Gaston
about something.

1152
01:13:49,445 --> 01:13:50,394
No, Grandmama.

1153
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:52,814
Gigi, do as you're told.

1154
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,369
Mamita, what does this mean?

1155
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:02,871
Something has changed here lately.

1156
01:14:03,084 --> 01:14:04,364
l can feel it.

1157
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:06,958
Sit down, Gaston.

1158
01:14:16,973 --> 01:14:18,052
Please.

1159
01:14:23,855 --> 01:14:26,607
Gaston, you know my friendship for you.

1160
01:14:26,858 --> 01:14:29,230
My friendship and my gratitude.

1161
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:32,063
But l must not forget my duty.

1162
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:37,108
Gigi's mother has neither the time
nor the mind to take care of her.

1163
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:40,702
And Gigi isn't just another girl.
She's special.

1164
01:14:41,331 --> 01:14:42,410
Of course.

1165
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:45,377
For years, you've been giving her
candies and trinkets. . .

1166
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:46,826
. . .and she adores you.

1167
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:51,666
Now you want to take her in your
automobile to the Reservoirs for tea.

1168
01:14:52,676 --> 01:14:55,132
lf it were just you and l,
l would say:

1169
01:14:55,345 --> 01:14:58,796
''Take Gigi wherever you want. ''
l would trust her with you anywhere.

1170
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:02,640
But there are others, Gaston.
You are known everywhere.

1171
01:15:02,894 --> 01:15:05,432
For a woman to
go out with you alone now. . .

1172
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,138
. . .with the eyes of Paris on you. . . .

1173
01:15:08,692 --> 01:15:10,648
Are you trying to make me believe. . .

1174
01:15:10,943 --> 01:15:13,899
. . .that if Gigi goes out with me,
she'll be compromised?

1175
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,569
Let us say she would be labeled.

1176
01:15:17,075 --> 01:15:20,859
A young girl who goes out with you
is no longer an ordinary young girl.

1177
01:15:21,121 --> 01:15:23,160
Not even a respectable young girl.

1178
01:15:23,414 --> 01:15:25,407
Mamita, this is absurd.

1179
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:29,415
As far as you are concerned,
it would be just another news item.

1180
01:15:29,629 --> 01:15:32,714
But in this case, l would not
have the heart to laugh. . .

1181
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:34,668
. . .when l read it in the newspapers.

1182
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:37,174
This is too ridiculous
to discuss any further.

1183
01:15:37,386 --> 01:15:41,172
l don't want to contradict you,
and l don't want to argue about it.

1184
01:15:41,392 --> 01:15:44,475
lf you feel you're protecting Gigi
from some cruel fate. . .

1185
01:15:44,686 --> 01:15:45,599
. . .that's your affair.

1186
01:15:45,812 --> 01:15:49,312
l understand responsibility to Gigi
better than you.

1187
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:54,360
l'll do all l can to entrust her
only to a man who'll be able to say:

1188
01:15:54,655 --> 01:15:58,403
''l'll take care of her.
l'll answer for her future. ''

1189
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:07,499
Now, can l get you
your chamomile tea, Gaston?

1190
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:10,325
No, thank you.
l have an appointment. . .

1191
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:12,378
. . .and l'm late already.

1192
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:15,751
But forgive me if l wonder, madame. . .

1193
01:16:15,926 --> 01:16:19,376
. . .whom you are keeping her for?
Some underpaid bank clerk. . .

1194
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,014
. . .who'll marry her and give her
four children in three years?

1195
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:24,387
You're upset.
Please--

1196
01:16:24,643 --> 01:16:28,723
To see her married in white in
a dingy little church to a plumber. . .

1197
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:31,097
. . .who'll only give her
a worthless name. . .

1198
01:16:31,274 --> 01:16:33,517
. . .and the squalor of good intentions?

1199
01:16:33,777 --> 01:16:35,735
Very well, madame.
Very well!

1200
01:16:35,988 --> 01:16:37,232
lf that's your ambition. . .

1201
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:40,816
. . .inflict your misery
in the name of respectability.

1202
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:43,744
l pity you!
l pity you all!

1203
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:50,622
Upset!

1204
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:52,586
What utter rubbish!

1205
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,355
Pierre. . .

1206
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:17,771
. . .do l look upset?

1207
01:17:18,488 --> 01:17:19,733
Yes, monsieur, you do.

1208
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:22,648
Upset!

1209
01:17:28,832 --> 01:17:30,113
Upset indeed!

1210
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:31,990
She's a babe

1211
01:17:32,502 --> 01:17:33,783
Just a babe

1212
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:35,504
Still cavorting in her crib

1213
01:17:35,922 --> 01:17:37,381
Eating breakfast with a bib

1214
01:17:37,715 --> 01:17:40,087
With her baby teeth
And all her baby curls

1215
01:17:40,886 --> 01:17:41,917
She's a tot

1216
01:17:42,596 --> 01:17:43,628
Just a tot

1217
01:17:44,264 --> 01:17:47,514
Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she

1218
01:17:47,767 --> 01:17:50,009
Doesn 't even know
That boys aren 't girls

1219
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:51,968
She's a snip

1220
01:17:52,605 --> 01:17:53,684
Just a snip

1221
01:17:54,315 --> 01:17:57,602
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys

1222
01:17:57,986 --> 01:18:00,228
Just a chickadee
Who needs a mother hen

1223
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:04,157
She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose

1224
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:07,154
She's too infantile
To take her from her pen

1225
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,249
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

1226
01:18:15,212 --> 01:18:17,086
In spite of all her youthful zeal

1227
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:19,583
She was exceedingly polite

1228
01:18:20,633 --> 01:18:22,591
And on the whole, a sheer delight

1229
01:18:23,554 --> 01:18:25,213
And if it wasn 't joy galore

1230
01:18:26,306 --> 01:18:28,180
At least not once was she a bore

1231
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:30,555
That I recall

1232
01:18:31,727 --> 01:18:33,138
No, not at all

1233
01:18:34,605 --> 01:18:35,638
She's a child

1234
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:37,098
A silly child

1235
01:18:37,735 --> 01:18:40,901
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven, how it shows

1236
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:44,025
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers
She has got

1237
01:18:44,283 --> 01:18:45,313
She's a child

1238
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:46,898
A clumsy child

1239
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:50,703
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn 't have a shape

1240
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,281
Where her figure ought to be
It is not!

1241
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,073
Just a child

1242
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:56,747
A growing child

1243
01:18:57,295 --> 01:19:00,414
But so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears

1244
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:02,916
I am certain
He will never call again

1245
01:19:03,802 --> 01:19:06,921
She's a scamp and a brat
Doesn 't know where she is at

1246
01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:09,297
Unequipped and undesirable to men

1247
01:19:12,435 --> 01:19:16,386
Of course, I must in truth confess

1248
01:19:16,982 --> 01:19:19,354
That in her brand-new little dress

1249
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:22,185
She looked surprisingly mature

1250
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,111
And had a definite allure

1251
01:19:26,115 --> 01:19:28,238
It was a shock, in fact, to me

1252
01:19:28,952 --> 01:19:31,159
A most amazing shock to see

1253
01:19:31,997 --> 01:19:33,455
The way it clung

1254
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:36,035
On one so young

1255
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:39,373
She's a girl

1256
01:19:39,754 --> 01:19:40,833
A little girl

1257
01:19:41,506 --> 01:19:44,508
Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do

1258
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,508
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower

1259
01:19:50,307 --> 01:19:51,338
Oh, no.

1260
01:19:57,857 --> 01:19:59,480
Oh, no.

1261
01:20:00,817 --> 01:20:01,848
But. . . .

1262
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:06,485
There's sweeter music

1263
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:08,490
When she speaks

1264
01:20:08,741 --> 01:20:10,201
Isn 't there?

1265
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,489
A different bloom

1266
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:15,324
About her cheeks

1267
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:17,625
Isn 't there?

1268
01:20:19,835 --> 01:20:21,413
Could I be wrong?

1269
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:23,458
Could it be so?

1270
01:20:24,174 --> 01:20:28,006
Oh, where
Oh, where did Gigi go?

1271
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:41,555
Gigi

1272
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:44,398
Am I a fool without a mind?

1273
01:20:45,028 --> 01:20:47,234
Or have I merely been too blind

1274
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:49,149
To realize?

1275
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,659
Oh, Gigi

1276
01:20:52,328 --> 01:20:56,325
Why, you've been growing up
Before my eyes

1277
01:21:00,918 --> 01:21:01,950
Gigi!

1278
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:06,753
You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl

1279
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,343
I knew

1280
01:21:10,595 --> 01:21:12,054
Oh, no

1281
01:21:12,389 --> 01:21:13,966
Overnight

1282
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:16,803
There's been
A breathless change

1283
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:19,771
In you

1284
01:21:21,064 --> 01:21:22,523
Oh, Gigi

1285
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:25,772
While you were trembling
On the brink

1286
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,647
Was I out yonder somewhere
Blinking at a star?

1287
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:32,945
Oh, Gigi

1288
01:21:34,035 --> 01:21:36,324
Have I been standing up too close

1289
01:21:37,038 --> 01:21:38,698
Or back too far?

1290
01:21:42,126 --> 01:21:43,834
When did your sparkle

1291
01:21:44,254 --> 01:21:45,832
Turn to fire?

1292
01:21:46,549 --> 01:21:49,418
And your warmth
Become desire?

1293
01:21:50,468 --> 01:21:52,426
Oh, what miracle

1294
01:21:53,347 --> 01:21:56,382
Has made you the way you are?

1295
01:22:02,355 --> 01:22:03,470
Gigi!

1296
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:13,731
Gigi!

1297
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:24,114
Gigi!

1298
01:22:32,594 --> 01:22:33,709
Oh, no

1299
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:37,508
I was mad not to have seen

1300
01:22:38,183 --> 01:22:40,306
The change in you

1301
01:22:43,897 --> 01:22:45,012
Oh, Gigi!

1302
01:22:45,524 --> 01:22:47,813
While you were trembling
On the brink

1303
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,312
Was I out yonder somewhere
Blinking at a star?

1304
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:54,943
Oh, Gigi

1305
01:22:55,992 --> 01:22:58,115
Have I been standing up too close

1306
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:00,531
Or back to far?

1307
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,453
When did your sparkle

1308
01:23:06,545 --> 01:23:08,039
Turn to fire?

1309
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:10,959
And your warmth

1310
01:23:11,383 --> 01:23:13,340
Become desire?

1311
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,126
Oh, what miracle

1312
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:20,308
Has made you the way

1313
01:23:22,352 --> 01:23:24,309
You are?

1314
01:23:39,744 --> 01:23:41,322
Mamita, are you alone?

1315
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:46,663
Good. l have an important
business matter to discuss with you.

1316
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,748
Now, let us recapitulate.

1317
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:57,844
To begin with, he said she would
be spoiled as no other--

1318
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:02,142
He said she would be spoiled
as no other woman has been before.

1319
01:24:02,392 --> 01:24:06,224
lt's all right, but it's vague.
l like everything spelled out.

1320
01:24:06,396 --> 01:24:08,270
Did he say precisely
where she would live?

1321
01:24:08,482 --> 01:24:10,888
He said a suitable house
on the Avenue du Bois.

1322
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,527
-You're sure?
-Of course.

1323
01:24:12,736 --> 01:24:14,528
Well, very good.
Servants?

1324
01:24:14,738 --> 01:24:16,647
Yes, he mentioned servants.

1325
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:18,317
What about an automobile?

1326
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:20,698
l think so. l'm not quite sure.

1327
01:24:20,952 --> 01:24:23,277
She must have an automobile
and a chauffeur.

1328
01:24:23,746 --> 01:24:26,832
l'm sure he didn't mean
to be evasive or ungenerous.

1329
01:24:27,084 --> 01:24:29,753
He suggested that you and l
and our lawyer. . .

1330
01:24:30,003 --> 01:24:33,337
. . .meet at his lawyer tomorrow
and draw it up in detail.

1331
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:37,124
You call him and tell him to
bring his lawyer to our lawyer.

1332
01:24:37,385 --> 01:24:39,544
We'll draw it up in detail.

1333
01:24:39,763 --> 01:24:41,886
You mustn't be suspicious, Alicia.

1334
01:24:42,099 --> 01:24:44,221
-Gigi doesn't know yet?
-How could she?

1335
01:24:44,476 --> 01:24:48,059
He just left. But he wants to
have dinner with her this evening.

1336
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:51,058
When you speak to Gigi,
be sure and stress. . .

1337
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:54,276
. . .the difficulties of the situation,
not the delights.

1338
01:24:54,486 --> 01:24:56,147
The role she will have to play.

1339
01:24:56,404 --> 01:24:58,148
She's a naive, thoughtless girl.

1340
01:24:58,365 --> 01:25:00,654
You must warn her not to
ask for the moon.

1341
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:02,072
Not only will he not give it--

1342
01:25:02,327 --> 01:25:05,446
Don't worry about her.
You think she's like you.

1343
01:25:05,705 --> 01:25:09,205
Actually, you don't know her.
There's no meanness in her at all.

1344
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,490
Thank you very much.

1345
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:12,910
l mean, she has no material ambition.

1346
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:16,172
l understand. He should
send a present before tonight.

1347
01:25:16,425 --> 01:25:18,167
Let me know what it is.

1348
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,755
Yes, l will.

1349
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,869
Won't you sit down?

1350
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:23,569
You know why l'm here?

1351
01:26:24,575 --> 01:26:25,690
Yes, l know.

1352
01:26:26,577 --> 01:26:27,954
Do you want to. . .

1353
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:29,867
. . .or don't you?

1354
01:26:31,082 --> 01:26:32,576
l don't want to.

1355
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,327
l don't know what you want.
You told Grandmama--

1356
01:26:37,588 --> 01:26:40,922
l know what l told your grandmother.
We don't have to repeat it.

1357
01:26:41,135 --> 01:26:43,756
Just tell me simply what
you don't want. . .

1358
01:26:44,304 --> 01:26:46,343
. . .and tell me what you do want.

1359
01:26:47,432 --> 01:26:48,677
Do you mean that?

1360
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:50,262
Of course.

1361
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:59,936
You told Grandmama that
you wanted to take care of me.

1362
01:27:00,195 --> 01:27:01,855
To take care of you beautifully.

1363
01:27:02,114 --> 01:27:04,355
Beautifully.
That is, if l like it.

1364
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:08,610
They've pounded into my head
l'm backward for my age. . .

1365
01:27:08,829 --> 01:27:11,154
. . .but l know what all this means.

1366
01:27:11,623 --> 01:27:15,122
To take care of me beautifully
means l shall go away with you. . .

1367
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:17,833
. . .and that l shall sleep in your bed.

1368
01:27:18,296 --> 01:27:19,624
Please, Gigi.

1369
01:27:19,922 --> 01:27:22,082
l beg of you, you embarrass me.

1370
01:27:23,886 --> 01:27:26,803
You weren't embarrassed to
talk to Grandmama about it.

1371
01:27:27,013 --> 01:27:30,347
And Grandmama wasn't embarrassed
to talk to me about it.

1372
01:27:32,685 --> 01:27:35,640
But l know more than she told me.
To take care of me. . .

1373
01:27:35,856 --> 01:27:38,856
. . .means that l shall have
my photograph in the papers.

1374
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:42,312
That l shall go to the Riviera.
To the races at Deauville.

1375
01:27:42,654 --> 01:27:46,402
And when we fight, it will
be in all the columns the next day.

1376
01:27:46,657 --> 01:27:50,906
And when you'd give me up,
as you did with lnès des Cévennes.

1377
01:27:51,163 --> 01:27:54,448
Who's been filling your head
with all these old stories?

1378
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:56,583
How do you know about that?

1379
01:27:57,919 --> 01:27:59,543
Why shouldn't l know?

1380
01:27:59,795 --> 01:28:01,420
You're world famous.

1381
01:28:02,007 --> 01:28:04,333
l know about the woman
who stole from you.

1382
01:28:04,552 --> 01:28:06,460
The contessa
who wanted to shoot you.

1383
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:10,261
The American who wanted to marry you.
l know what everybody knows.

1384
01:28:10,474 --> 01:28:13,390
These aren't the things
we have to talk about together.

1385
01:28:13,643 --> 01:28:16,847
That's all in the past,
over and done with.

1386
01:28:17,773 --> 01:28:19,017
Yes, Gaston.

1387
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,060
Until it begins again.

1388
01:28:26,948 --> 01:28:29,570
lt's not your fault
you're world famous.

1389
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,278
lt's just that l haven't got
a world famous sort of nature.

1390
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:39,160
When it's over, Gaston Lachaille
goes off with another lady.

1391
01:28:39,418 --> 01:28:42,336
And l have only to go into
another gentleman's bed.

1392
01:28:44,842 --> 01:28:46,465
That won't do for me.

1393
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:49,503
l'm not changeable.
That won't do for me.

1394
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:54,424
Grandmama and Aunt Alicia are on
your side, but this concerns me too.

1395
01:28:54,684 --> 01:28:57,520
And l think l should have
something to say about it.

1396
01:28:57,938 --> 01:29:00,475
And what l say is, it won't work.
lt won't work!

1397
01:29:10,326 --> 01:29:15,450
Are you trying to find a way
to tell me that l don't please you?

1398
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:17,122
That you don't like me?

1399
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:18,661
Oh, no, Gaston!

1400
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:21,415
Oh, no. l do like you.

1401
01:29:23,464 --> 01:29:25,919
l'm so happy when l'm with you.

1402
01:29:29,302 --> 01:29:32,054
Gaston, couldn't we go on
just as we are?

1403
01:29:32,305 --> 01:29:34,677
Maybe seeing each other
a little more often?

1404
01:29:34,891 --> 01:29:38,427
You're a friend of the family.
Nobody would think anything of it.

1405
01:29:38,729 --> 01:29:41,599
You could go on bringing me
licorice and caramels. . .

1406
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:43,564
. . .and champagne on my birthday.

1407
01:29:43,775 --> 01:29:47,190
And on Sundays, we can have
an extra special game of cards.

1408
01:29:47,445 --> 01:29:49,568
Wouldn't that be
a lovely little life?

1409
01:29:49,864 --> 01:29:51,609
A wonderful little life.

1410
01:29:51,992 --> 01:29:54,233
Except that you forget one thing:

1411
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:56,656
l'm in love with you.

1412
01:30:00,374 --> 01:30:01,785
You never told me.

1413
01:30:02,835 --> 01:30:04,746
l haven't known it very long.

1414
01:30:05,506 --> 01:30:08,257
l discovered it
when l was away from you.

1415
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,211
ln Monte Carlo.

1416
01:30:14,847 --> 01:30:17,256
You are a wicked man.

1417
01:30:19,895 --> 01:30:21,389
You're in love with me. . .

1418
01:30:21,604 --> 01:30:25,555
. . .and you want to drag me into a life
that will make me suffer!

1419
01:30:25,984 --> 01:30:30,481
You think nothing of exposing me
to all sorts of terrible adventures. . .

1420
01:30:30,739 --> 01:30:32,779
. . .ending in quarrels, separations. . .

1421
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:35,571
. . .pistol shots,
Sandomirs and poison!

1422
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:37,108
Please listen to me!

1423
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:40,325
l should never have
believed this of you. Never!

1424
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,917
What's the matter?

1425
01:30:44,294 --> 01:30:45,753
What's happened?

1426
01:30:46,338 --> 01:30:48,496
She doesn't seem to want to.

1427
01:30:48,715 --> 01:30:49,913
What do you mean?

1428
01:30:50,175 --> 01:30:52,002
l mean she doesn't want to!

1429
01:30:52,385 --> 01:30:54,377
Are you going out of your mind?

1430
01:30:54,637 --> 01:30:57,758
As God is my witness,
l explained it to her. Believe me.

1431
01:30:58,017 --> 01:30:59,926
You explained too much!

1432
01:31:00,186 --> 01:31:03,850
You've trained her to know
nothing but the sordid and the vulgar.

1433
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:07,812
But what about kindness,
sweetness, benevolence?

1434
01:31:08,067 --> 01:31:11,153
What of the tender heart
bulging with generosity?

1435
01:31:11,363 --> 01:31:14,696
These things exist too, madame.
Or have you never heard of them?

1436
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:28,377
Uncle! l'll tell you. . .

1437
01:31:28,713 --> 01:31:32,581
. . .Europe is breeding a generation
of vandals and ingrates.

1438
01:31:33,969 --> 01:31:35,379
Children are coming
into the world. . .

1439
01:31:35,636 --> 01:31:37,843
. . .with ice-covered souls
and hatchets in their hands!

1440
01:31:38,098 --> 01:31:42,012
And before they have finished, they'll
smash everything beautiful and decent.

1441
01:31:42,227 --> 01:31:43,258
Have a piece of cheese.

1442
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,433
No, thank you.

1443
01:31:44,729 --> 01:31:47,137
l envy you, Uncle.
l envy you, your age.

1444
01:31:47,482 --> 01:31:48,596
For you, it was different.

1445
01:31:48,858 --> 01:31:52,193
You've been clean and good,
and it's been appreciated.

1446
01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:55,530
But not anymore.
lt's over. All over.

1447
01:31:55,782 --> 01:31:58,154
l'm sorry to hear it.
A little salad?

1448
01:31:58,410 --> 01:31:59,441
No, thank you.

1449
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:02,862
lmagine this if you can:

1450
01:32:03,164 --> 01:32:06,534
Here is a girl, living in
a moldy apartment, decaying walls. . .

1451
01:32:06,794 --> 01:32:09,710
. . .worm-ridden furniture,
surrounded by filth.

1452
01:32:09,921 --> 01:32:11,084
You're ruining my lunch.

1453
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,961
Nothing to look forward to
but abject poverty.

1454
01:32:14,176 --> 01:32:16,630
My heart was touched.
l wanted to help her.

1455
01:32:16,928 --> 01:32:18,968
l offered her everything:

1456
01:32:19,223 --> 01:32:22,508
House, car, servants, clothes. . .

1457
01:32:23,601 --> 01:32:24,847
. . .and me.

1458
01:32:25,437 --> 01:32:26,136
And?

1459
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:28,015
She turned me down.

1460
01:32:29,106 --> 01:32:31,016
-Turned you down?
-Turned me down.

1461
01:32:31,275 --> 01:32:32,356
lt's impossible.

1462
01:32:32,653 --> 01:32:34,859
lt's not impossible.
lt just happened.

1463
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:39,027
Obviously, that disgusting apartment
she lives in has driven her mad.

1464
01:32:39,284 --> 01:32:40,992
Her grandmother was delighted.

1465
01:32:41,244 --> 01:32:42,987
-Grandmother?
-Yes, Mamita.

1466
01:32:43,246 --> 01:32:45,119
But Gigi--
No, no, no. Not Gigi.

1467
01:32:45,373 --> 01:32:47,532
She refused me.
She turned me down.

1468
01:32:47,793 --> 01:32:50,462
l was refused, rejected, rebuffed. . .

1469
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:53,213
. . .and repudiated.

1470
01:32:54,383 --> 01:32:58,426
They're a very peculiar family
with peculiar ideas.

1471
01:32:58,636 --> 01:33:00,760
l negotiated with them myself once.

1472
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:05,059
With me, one casual bit
of grazing in another pasture. . .

1473
01:33:05,393 --> 01:33:08,430
. . .and the gate was slammed behind me.

1474
01:33:09,772 --> 01:33:11,564
What did you do?

1475
01:33:11,816 --> 01:33:13,477
-l left immediately.
-Bravo!

1476
01:33:13,736 --> 01:33:15,563
The absolutely right thing to do.

1477
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:16,609
Of course.

1478
01:33:16,863 --> 01:33:19,864
And when she sends for you,
which you realize she will--

1479
01:33:20,116 --> 01:33:21,397
Of course.
l know she will.

1480
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,826
This is plainly a maneuver
for better terms.

1481
01:33:25,037 --> 01:33:26,497
Don't you go back!

1482
01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:28,576
l wouldn't go back
for anything in the world.

1483
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:32,452
After all, you behaved
like a perfect gentleman.

1484
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:34,041
No question about it.

1485
01:33:34,256 --> 01:33:37,042
You made your offer in good faith. . .

1486
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,839
. . .before any emotional advance.

1487
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:43,055
An act of the purest chivalry.

1488
01:33:43,306 --> 01:33:45,263
l don't know any other way.

1489
01:33:45,558 --> 01:33:49,686
And if she doesn't appreciate
the nobility of your conduct. . .

1490
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:52,934
. . .if she uses the beauty
of your nature. . .

1491
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:55,273
. . .as a weapon for bargaining. . .

1492
01:33:56,028 --> 01:34:01,152
. . .then she's obviously not worth
the chivalry or the nobility.

1493
01:34:01,491 --> 01:34:04,326
lt's no one's fault.
You're too good for her.

1494
01:34:05,244 --> 01:34:08,081
Do you know how long
it will take you to forget her?

1495
01:34:08,499 --> 01:34:11,250
By tomorrow noon at the latest.

1496
01:34:12,669 --> 01:34:16,418
Why not consult your little book
and meet me at Maxim's tonight?

1497
01:34:16,672 --> 01:34:18,001
Splendid idea.

1498
01:34:18,257 --> 01:34:19,882
l would suggest a redhead.

1499
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:23,179
Try Michèle. l saw her last night.
She looked heavenly.

1500
01:34:23,429 --> 01:34:24,628
l'll call her at once.

1501
01:34:24,889 --> 01:34:27,178
You should. She doesn't
have many good years left.

1502
01:34:27,434 --> 01:34:29,058
-See you at 9?
-Nine sharp.

1503
01:34:29,311 --> 01:34:30,508
Goodbye, Honoré.

1504
01:34:43,908 --> 01:34:45,023
Poor boy

1505
01:34:45,368 --> 01:34:46,482
Poor boy

1506
01:34:47,121 --> 01:34:50,571
Downhearted and depressed
And in a spin

1507
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:53,740
Poor boy

1508
01:34:54,544 --> 01:34:55,540
Poor boy

1509
01:34:56,129 --> 01:35:00,257
Oh, youth can really
Do a fellow in

1510
01:35:04,596 --> 01:35:07,965
How lovely to sit here
In the shade

1511
01:35:08,266 --> 01:35:11,350
With none of the woes
Of man and maid

1512
01:35:11,602 --> 01:35:14,854
I'm glad I'm not young anymore

1513
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,612
The rivals that don 't exist at all

1514
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:25,240
The feeling you're only 2 feet tall

1515
01:35:25,616 --> 01:35:28,488
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

1516
01:35:31,748 --> 01:35:33,373
No more confusion

1517
01:35:35,377 --> 01:35:37,535
No morning-after surprise

1518
01:35:39,046 --> 01:35:41,206
No self-delusion

1519
01:35:42,718 --> 01:35:45,635
That when you're telling those lies

1520
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:48,429
She isn 't wise

1521
01:35:49,933 --> 01:35:52,388
And even if love
Comes through the door

1522
01:35:53,186 --> 01:35:55,974
The kind that goes on forevermore

1523
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:00,937
Forevermore is shorter than before

1524
01:36:03,572 --> 01:36:06,738
Oh, I'm so glad

1525
01:36:08,452 --> 01:36:11,323
That I'm not young anymore

1526
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:20,915
The tiny remark that tortures you

1527
01:36:21,799 --> 01:36:24,918
The fear that your friends
Won 't like her too

1528
01:36:25,176 --> 01:36:28,427
I'm glad I'm not young anymore

1529
01:36:32,475 --> 01:36:35,181
The longing to end a stale affair

1530
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:38,725
Until you find out she doesn 't care

1531
01:36:39,274 --> 01:36:43,486
I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

1532
01:36:45,488 --> 01:36:47,611
No more frustration

1533
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:51,532
No star-crossed lover am I

1534
01:36:52,996 --> 01:36:54,704
No aggravation

1535
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:59,329
Just one reluctant reply

1536
01:37:01,254 --> 01:37:03,046
Lady, goodbye

1537
01:37:04,717 --> 01:37:07,966
The fountain of youth
Is dull as paint

1538
01:37:08,553 --> 01:37:11,341
Methuselah is my patron saint

1539
01:37:12,181 --> 01:37:15,883
I've never been so comfortable before

1540
01:37:19,063 --> 01:37:22,433
Oh, I'm so glad

1541
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:27,728
That I'm not young anymore

1542
01:38:05,777 --> 01:38:06,725
Yes, madame?

1543
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:09,352
Charles, l'm going out.

1544
01:38:10,032 --> 01:38:12,404
Order me a carriage immediately.

1545
01:38:18,165 --> 01:38:20,571
Yes, madame.
Right away, madame.

1546
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:44,350
Would you repeat that again, please?

1547
01:38:44,983 --> 01:38:46,690
She doesn't want to.

1548
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:48,896
She doesn't want to?

1549
01:38:49,153 --> 01:38:50,483
She doesn't want to.

1550
01:38:50,739 --> 01:38:53,065
Such stupidity is without equal. . .

1551
01:38:53,284 --> 01:38:56,486
. . .in the entire history
of human relations.

1552
01:39:04,044 --> 01:39:06,452
lt must be your fault.
lt must be.

1553
01:39:06,714 --> 01:39:10,414
You must've emphasized the difficulties
instead of the delights.

1554
01:39:10,634 --> 01:39:12,461
What did you say
to the little monster?

1555
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,838
Gigi is perhaps a little slow
about certain things. . .

1556
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:18,809
. . .but just because she's not
attracted to Gaston. . .

1557
01:39:19,018 --> 01:39:20,511
. . .doesn't make her a monster.

1558
01:39:20,727 --> 01:39:22,435
lt doesn't make her a princess.

1559
01:39:22,646 --> 01:39:23,844
What did you say to her?

1560
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:28,399
Did you tell her about love,
travel, moonlight, ltaly?

1561
01:39:28,776 --> 01:39:31,268
About hummingbirds
in all the flowers. . .

1562
01:39:31,488 --> 01:39:34,572
. . .and making love in a
gardenia-scented garden?

1563
01:39:34,824 --> 01:39:36,153
l couldn't tell her that.

1564
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:39,079
l've never been further
than the Riviera.

1565
01:39:39,371 --> 01:39:40,948
Couldn't you have invented it?

1566
01:39:41,247 --> 01:39:42,658
No, Alicia, l could not.

1567
01:39:42,915 --> 01:39:44,197
lt's incredible.

1568
01:39:44,501 --> 01:39:46,328
lncredible!
Where is she?

1569
01:39:46,587 --> 01:39:49,670
Perhaps l should talk to her
and tell her what she's missing.

1570
01:39:49,923 --> 01:39:51,547
lt's the glory of romance. . .

1571
01:39:51,883 --> 01:39:55,216
. . .forgetting everything in the arms
of the man who adores you. . .

1572
01:39:55,428 --> 01:39:59,676
. . .listening to the music of love
in an eternal spring.

1573
01:40:00,768 --> 01:40:04,350
-And when eternal spring is over?
-What difference does that make?

1574
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,398
lt makes a difference to Gigi.
And l'll tell you something:

1575
01:40:07,648 --> 01:40:10,104
l'm not sure l don't agree with her.

1576
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:14,395
You're a fool! And your
granddaughter takes after you.

1577
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:19,781
When l think of the time and effort
l've lavished on that idiotic child!

1578
01:40:36,427 --> 01:40:41,304
l received a note from Gigi.
She said she wanted to see me.

1579
01:40:41,558 --> 01:40:42,589
Of course.

1580
01:40:46,062 --> 01:40:47,261
Won't you come in?

1581
01:40:47,481 --> 01:40:48,594
Thank you.

1582
01:40:49,398 --> 01:40:50,478
You know my sister?

1583
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:53,694
My dear Mr. Lachaille.
What a pleasant surprise.

1584
01:40:53,904 --> 01:40:55,777
And how is your enchanting father?

1585
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,822
He has diabetes.

1586
01:40:58,074 --> 01:41:00,363
lf one is in the sugar business. . . .

1587
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:03,323
And your attractive mother?
Well, l hope.

1588
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:16,755
Gaston, l have been thinking.

1589
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:21,842
l'd rather be miserable
with you than without you.

1590
01:42:55,359 --> 01:43:00,020
Say a prayer
For me tonight

1591
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:03,980
I'll need every prayer

1592
01:43:05,076 --> 01:43:08,031
That you can spare
To get me by

1593
01:43:10,748 --> 01:43:13,204
Say a prayer

1594
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,750
And while you're praying

1595
01:43:16,671 --> 01:43:18,663
Keep on saying

1596
01:43:19,799 --> 01:43:21,923
She's much too young to die

1597
01:43:24,679 --> 01:43:27,170
On to your Waterloo

1598
01:43:27,766 --> 01:43:29,557
Whispers my heart

1599
01:43:30,893 --> 01:43:33,516
Pray I'll be Wellington

1600
01:43:34,106 --> 01:43:35,565
Not Bonaparte

1601
01:43:38,318 --> 01:43:40,357
Say a prayer

1602
01:43:40,987 --> 01:43:42,945
For me this evening

1603
01:43:44,323 --> 01:43:46,779
Bow your head and please

1604
01:43:48,037 --> 01:43:49,994
Stay on your knees

1605
01:43:52,165 --> 01:43:53,659
Tonight

1606
01:46:24,818 --> 01:46:28,317
l thought perhaps we might
go to Siena in July. . .

1607
01:46:28,571 --> 01:46:30,280
. . .beginning of the season.

1608
01:46:31,575 --> 01:46:33,733
And when do we go to Deauville?

1609
01:46:33,993 --> 01:46:35,618
At the end of August.

1610
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:39,074
lt isn't absolutely necessary,
if you'd rather not.

1611
01:46:39,332 --> 01:46:41,040
Don't say it. l'd love to go.

1612
01:46:41,292 --> 01:46:43,036
Especially to the casino.

1613
01:46:44,129 --> 01:46:46,370
You know how much l love to gamble.

1614
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:49,383
Would you like more coffee?

1615
01:46:49,926 --> 01:46:51,171
l'll do it.

1616
01:46:53,346 --> 01:46:57,641
Of course, the roulette wheel won't
be as easy to beat as you are.

1617
01:47:00,145 --> 01:47:01,425
Nor as easy to cheat.

1618
01:47:01,646 --> 01:47:04,268
You always knew that l cheated,
didn't you?

1619
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:37,677
Look.

1620
01:47:38,475 --> 01:47:39,175
What?

1621
01:47:39,393 --> 01:47:40,721
Madame Dunard.

1622
01:47:41,478 --> 01:47:43,554
How do you know Madame Dunard?

1623
01:47:43,855 --> 01:47:46,939
l know all about Madame Dunard.
Do you see her pearls?

1624
01:47:49,235 --> 01:47:50,351
Dipped.

1625
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,938
Dipped. Not worth a sou.

1626
01:47:54,783 --> 01:47:56,277
The poor thing doesn't know it.

1627
01:47:56,493 --> 01:47:58,485
lt's just a matter of time now.

1628
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,908
Would you like to dance?

1629
01:48:03,332 --> 01:48:04,744
l'd love to.

1630
01:48:07,504 --> 01:48:08,749
What an evening.

1631
01:48:09,214 --> 01:48:10,791
Don't you think so, darling?

1632
01:48:13,176 --> 01:48:15,583
Gaston, my boy, l waited for you.

1633
01:48:15,803 --> 01:48:18,889
-Good evening, Honoré.
-Good evening, Monsieur Lachaille.

1634
01:48:19,183 --> 01:48:20,759
Do you know what
we are going to do?

1635
01:48:21,017 --> 01:48:22,298
We are going to--

1636
01:48:34,948 --> 01:48:36,987
What's that in your breast pocket?

1637
01:48:38,118 --> 01:48:39,861
-l'm sorry.
-What is it?

1638
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:44,950
lt's a present for you.

1639
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,795
Wouldn't you like to see it?

1640
01:48:51,047 --> 01:48:52,590
Oh, no. Not now.

1641
01:48:53,508 --> 01:48:55,833
Later. l'd rather dance with you.

1642
01:49:07,813 --> 01:49:09,142
May l see it now?

1643
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,067
The present.

1644
01:49:18,658 --> 01:49:20,817
Gaston, that's beautiful.

1645
01:49:21,577 --> 01:49:23,534
They're simply beautiful.

1646
01:49:24,497 --> 01:49:26,241
Oh, what a color!

1647
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:31,084
Only the most beautiful emeralds
contain that miracle. . .

1648
01:49:31,296 --> 01:49:33,289
. . .of elusive blue.

1649
01:49:35,549 --> 01:49:37,092
What taste you have.

1650
01:49:38,262 --> 01:49:41,712
lf l may say so, much better
than your taste in clothes.

1651
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,893
-May l put it on?
-The clasp is a bit tricky.

1652
01:49:47,103 --> 01:49:49,558
Why not ask the lady
in the powder room to help?

1653
01:49:49,814 --> 01:49:51,689
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

1654
01:50:01,867 --> 01:50:03,944
My dear, dear, dear boy.

1655
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:07,622
How did it happen?
She changed her mind?

1656
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:09,656
Obviously.

1657
01:50:09,959 --> 01:50:11,370
How delicious!

1658
01:50:11,628 --> 01:50:14,499
Did you have to
improve the arrangement?

1659
01:50:14,965 --> 01:50:16,755
Please don't be vulgar.

1660
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,712
She looks adorable.

1661
01:50:20,137 --> 01:50:22,592
So fresh, so eager. . .

1662
01:50:22,972 --> 01:50:24,217
. . .so young.

1663
01:50:24,557 --> 01:50:27,927
lt's the sophisticated women
who get boring so quickly.

1664
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:31,555
What can they give you?
Everything but surprise.

1665
01:50:31,814 --> 01:50:33,689
But with someone like Gigi. . . .

1666
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,601
She can amuse you for months.

1667
01:50:37,404 --> 01:50:40,358
l'm so happy for you.
l can't wait to tell Manuel.

1668
01:50:40,574 --> 01:50:42,197
Good night. Good night.

1669
01:50:49,999 --> 01:50:51,375
l don't understand.

1670
01:50:51,584 --> 01:50:52,830
What's wrong?

1671
01:50:53,336 --> 01:50:55,246
lt's too early to go home yet.

1672
01:50:56,881 --> 01:50:59,634
l thought l was doing so well.
What's the matter?

1673
01:51:06,433 --> 01:51:07,808
l don't want to go home yet!

1674
01:51:08,143 --> 01:51:09,387
Please, Gaston.

1675
01:51:10,645 --> 01:51:13,647
Gaston, won't you tell me
what l've done wrong?

1676
01:51:15,234 --> 01:51:17,475
Gaston, do tell me. Please!

1677
01:51:25,201 --> 01:51:26,317
What's happened?

1678
01:51:27,538 --> 01:51:29,080
Gigi, what's happened?

1679
01:53:30,994 --> 01:53:32,369
May l come in?

1680
01:53:40,378 --> 01:53:41,659
Gaston, please.

1681
01:53:41,922 --> 01:53:43,998
No newspapers. No scandal.

1682
01:53:46,593 --> 01:53:49,629
Madame, will you do me the honor. . .

1683
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:51,169
. . .the favor. . .

1684
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:55,050
. . .give me the infinite joy
of bestowing on me. . .

1685
01:53:55,352 --> 01:53:57,392
. . .Gigi's hand in marriage?

1686
01:54:12,702 --> 01:54:13,865
Thank heaven.

1687
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:16,611
For little girls

1688
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:23,499
For little girls
Get bigger every day

1689
01:54:25,632 --> 01:54:27,090
Thank heaven

1690
01:54:27,592 --> 01:54:29,051
For little girls

1691
01:54:30,637 --> 01:54:33,673
They grow up
In the most delightful way

1692
01:54:35,809 --> 01:54:39,308
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing

1693
01:54:40,146 --> 01:54:44,358
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling

1694
01:54:45,568 --> 01:54:48,736
Thank heaven for little girls

1695
01:54:50,658 --> 01:54:54,607
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who

1696
01:54:55,537 --> 01:54:59,035
Without them
What would little boys do?

1697
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:02,371
Thank heaven

1698
01:55:03,754 --> 01:55:05,296
Thank heaven

1699
01:55:06,756 --> 01:55:08,548
Thank heaven

1700
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,125
For little girls
