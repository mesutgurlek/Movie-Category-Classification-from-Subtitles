He is afraid of his mother

366
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,074
The woman is a witch

367
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:06,764
She wont give his son to anybody
She will keep him like pickles in a jar

368
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,968
Come on line up, line up

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:28,008
The old woman cant cook her food

377
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,225
She is going crazy

378

384
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:18,448
Why is he being nosy?

385
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,265
I dont know

386
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,566
He said if he sees me looking at you

387
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,090

Dont distort the line

393
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:31,014
The lady has been waiting for half hour now

394
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:32,838

395

10 breads change everything

396
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,195
The bread is here!

397
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,487

Allah be glad with you

403
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,930
I will never forget this favour

404
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,172
It's no big deal, dear

405
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:12,129
Alright, bye bye

406
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:20,073
I would become a skeleton
if we waited in line with you every day

407
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,242
Is the sugar over?

408
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,329
Dont mind it

409
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:24,952

410
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:36,152

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,145
you are a cucumber man

413
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,304
if your voice is good

414
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,237
what did the crazy girl like in me then?

415
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:47,148
Look boy, you will get yourself in trouble
because of that girl

416
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,723
Check everything before bed

417
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,577
You are not yourself these days

418
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:52,954
Dont worry

419
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:55,057
I will make the tea in the morning

420
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,140
Before you come

421
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,874
Good night

422
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:58,552

425
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,964
Mashallah

426
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,751
That prick didnt come to meet me officially

427
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:26,504
It' s been 3 days

428
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,816
What happened?

429
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:32,902
Dont make us kill

430
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,687
Do not speak of the superior again
Do you understand?

431
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,544
Allah make him fall

432
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:38,687
He said he cant marry me before
his mother dies

433
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,471
Should we kill his mother dad?

434
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,796
Go away you son of a donkey

435
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:45,151
He is fooling you idiot

436
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,059
Look, if i see him around you

437
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,612

438
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:52,380
Get up take your sister to work

439
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,165
Keep your eyes on this girl

440
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,646
If the superior disturbs her

441
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,526
Shoot him

442
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,842

Over there

460
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:42,082
He dare get near you

461
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,802
He cant do anything

462
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,046
Dont worry

463
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:52,264

so?

472
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,383
Tell your superior we take men's livers
out of his body

473
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,781
My brother stayed 6 months
(in prison)

474
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:41,848
Now i see who ate those 10 breads

The motherfucker played with my sister

479
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:52,307
Then he called it quits

480
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,463
Why dog!

481
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,545
If we were back in the hometown
we would kill him

482
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:56,974
but he is a superior here

483
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:58,294
Son of a donkey kicks my ass too

484
00:23:58,294 --> 00:23:59,462
Shoot him

485
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:00,823
Easy to say

486
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:04,549
Give it

487
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:06,109
Take it easy

488
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,741
Shoepaint

489
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:18,744

491
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:23,821
Who were those?

492
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:27,059
Lady Hacer's brothers

493
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,777
What do they want?

494
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:37,062
They are not in a good mood

495
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:39,211
Why?

496
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:41,442
Hacer!

497
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,928
Girl, Hacer!

498
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:46,856
Yes, Selma sister

499
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:50,583
Girl, when they come from school,
take the kids to the park

500
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,673
They wont let you work in peace at home

501
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:54,924
Sure, sure

502
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:11,823
Didnt i tell you not to walk around this
street when this girl is here?

503
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:12,755
You did

504
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:13,390
Fuck off

505
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,505

506
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:15,850
Yes sir

507
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:17,942
She will go to the park

508
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:20,008
The flower of my two eyes

509
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:57,424
Welcome to the park of our municipality

510
00:25:58,068 --> 00:25:59,540
We find it nice

511
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:28,045
Do not bother you

512
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:31,788
We have to play with other people's kids

513
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,970
It's the struggle to make a living

514
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,937
What can you do?

515
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:36,979
difficult

516

967
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,793
wait a minute

968
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,150
dad told me not to let you in

969
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,851
one sec

970
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:46,172
take these at least

971
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:48,662
give them to my fiancee

972
00:49:48,662 --> 00:49:51,157
it contains very valuable candies

973
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,067
guess this is the tradition

974
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:57,365
they make the groom wait in cold

975
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,384
he's waiting outside

976
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:04,305
you see, we make the groom wait outside

977
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:05,363
because of you

978
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:06,432
let him wait

979
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:08,423
who does he think he is?

980
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,932
he is a street cleaner i command

981
00:50:09,932 --> 00:50:11,112
talk mother

982
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:17,517
i swear

983
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,452
i have always liked Hacer

984
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:21,266
she is very skilled

985
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,536
and a nice lady

986
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:24,409
so we thought

987
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,832
We decided to ask for her
with Allah's commandment

988
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,061
go check that

989
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:33,727

990
00:50:34,354 --> 00:50:36,236

993
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,472
my father is talking business inside

994
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:46,541
man, is it acceptable to make
a mighty groom shake like a dog?

995
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:55,407
he is crying off, dad

996
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:57,571
well, i cant make the guy wait longer

997
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,546
we made our decision

998
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:01,914
we want to put the rings on

999
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:03,309

1000
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:04,612

1004
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:12,630

1011
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:29,889
