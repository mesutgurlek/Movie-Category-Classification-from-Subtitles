Come on, come on, come on.
All right, here we go.

MAN: Take a seat, buddy!

4
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,444
Come on.
It was a good play.

5
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,051
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

6
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,285
I don't know. Is it gonna
be like this all day?

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,657
I don't know.
It's up to you.

I have no room to sit.
I got no room to sit.

9
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,918
I'm sitting next to
a guy who's sitting

10
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,430
like he's at home
on the toilet
with his legs spread.

11
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,056
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

12
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,498
I am relaxed.
Look how I'm sitting.

13
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,729
Why are you
sitting like that?
Because... What do you think?

14
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,964
Why'd you wake me up
for this shit?

15
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,767
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
Sweating in the sun
like a Tijuana whore.

VENDOR: Ice-cold soda!

18
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,908
Get your soda here!

19
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,008
VENDOR: On the right.
Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,418
Hey, hot dog guy,
can I get six hot dogs
down here, please?

21
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,012
Right away.
GARY: And make it right,
please.

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,251
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup
and the relish.

23
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,758
Don't make me
hit you up for more.

24
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,624
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

25
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,129
We will.
Then why are you
getting hot dogs?

26
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,429
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

27
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,328
Do you want
one of the hot dogs?

28
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,234
GARY: You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

29
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,329
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

30
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,634
No. Thank you.
You can have one.

31
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,038
That's okay.
Go ahead.
You can have a hot dog.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,098
No, I don't want one.
Excuse me, sir?

33
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,541
Would you mind
passing the lady
one of the hot dogs?

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,669
I'm good, thanks.
You don't have to share.

35
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,508
You can have your own.
Thanks. That's really
nice of you.

36
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,878
Just have one, please.
Okay, give me a hot dog.

37
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,918
Somebody give her a hot dog.
I got... The big guy can't
eat all of them. Have one.

38
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,919
Have you ever had one before?
A hot dog?

39
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,455
At the ballpark?
I have. I believe I have.

40
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,581
Okay, good.
Thank you.

41
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,488
Well, enjoy this one.
Thanks.

42
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,657
Do you like mustard?
No, I'm okay.

43
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,356
It's much better
with a topping. Here.

44
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,359
I'm just kidding,
I'll give you two.

Cheers!
Thanks.

47
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,272
We'll share it.

48
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,240
It's a good dog.
I like the hot dog. I know.

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,206
That's nice.

50
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,113
You have a problem
with me eating a hot dog,
guy?

51
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,776
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

52
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,753
I'll smack him
in his head.
No, just leave him alone.

53
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,535
Hey, you want
to go get a drink?
No.

54
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,435
I'm with somebody, sorry.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,773
Who? The guy with
the tucked-in shirt
and the visor?

56
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,643
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not
your brother, then.

57
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,908
Who is this guy?
He's not my brother.

58
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,973
Who's this...
I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

59
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,518
Who are you?
I don't know.
I'm kidding with you.

60
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,611
Who's the guy with
the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

61
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,882
Uh, it's...

62
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,254
I'm going.
Do you think
you'll marry him?

63
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,122
What?
'Cause I know
you've thought about it.

64
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,685
The first time
you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

65
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,221
"I wonder if I could marry
this guy in plaid shorts who
tucks his shirt in. No way."

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,927
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

67
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,663
"I had a lot to drink
tonight. I'm kissing
the tucked-in guy."

68
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,103
My point is, if you're
not gonna marry him...
Yeah.

69
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,333
...and if it's not forever,

70
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,002
then you really don't have
anything to lose in
taking me up on my offer.

71
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,944
Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
Okay. Me, too.

72
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,981
Okay.
To where? On an
ice-breaking first date?

73
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,778
Well, no, I don't think...
Listen.

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,715
If you want to stay
off the market
while you're with

75
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,186
I'm-not-the-one-
but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

76
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,654
But for all you know,
I just offered you

77
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,214
a get-out-of-bored-Iove-
for-free card
with no strings attached.

78
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,725
God, you're crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

79
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,625
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

80
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,027
and then they go,
"It's genius."

81
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,792
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

82
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,925
They burned that witch.
And guess what, then they got
warm and they ate good stuff.

83
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,833
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

84
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,303
'cause I'm not good on dates.
No. You know what?

85
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,237
I'm better just to kind of
hang out and,
if we don't have fun,

86
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,296
I might go my separate way.
Okay.

87
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,037
I'm not committing
to anything. I'll go hang out
with you for a little bit.

88
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,976
That's not gonna happen.
But I can't say for sure.

Hi, honey.
Hi.

125
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,366
Christmas was months ago.
Don't remind me.
I miss it so much.

126
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,402
Yeah, I know.
But today is not a holiday.

127
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,373
I know for a fact
that people like
my spirit on the phone

128
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,273
and they dig the energy
that I give them.

129
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,212
Okay. I'm just saying,
I don't think Marilyn Dean
will "dig" the energy.

130
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,114
Oh, no.
She's the one that told me
to be creative. So...

131
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,744
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday
coming?

132
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,310
The Fourth of July,
is that what's next?

133
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,049
Well, if you want
to get technical,
there's Memorial Day,

134
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,148
there's Flag Day.

135
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,990
Some people recognize
Father's Day as a holiday.
I don't.

136
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:20,624
I get it. I get it.
Well, on those days
you can say, "Happy Holidays."

143
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,611
Can I be honest with you?
Please.

144

Other than taking
an art history class
in college,

145
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,559
which I pretty much
slept through, I don't have
the first clue about art

146
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,326
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

147
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:58,398
I mean, I don't see the point
in buying something that
I could have done myself.

148
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,572
Yeah. I completely agree
with you.

149
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,142
You know, an art teacher
of mine once said,

150
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,704
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have."

151
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,250
You know, don't worry
about who the artist is
or how much it's worth.

152
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,221
I mean, you have to live
with it every day. You have
to walk by it every day.

153
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,817
You know, you have to
really love it. You have
to really appreciate it.

154
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,690
It's kind of like
picking a mate.

How's it going?

a lot happening.
I know.

159
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,971
Very exciting.

160

Oh, careful. That's really...
That's very hot.
Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,570
Yep.
Jesus.

162
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,741
Hey, honey,
you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

163
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,307
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.

164
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,785
Got a lot of nice stuff.
Got a pizza.

165
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,923
All kinds of stuff.
Terrific.

166
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,721
I just need you
to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

Gary?
Yeah?

170
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,797
Oh, come on! Really?
You got three lemons.

171
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,169
What my baby wants,
my baby gets. You know that.

172
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,837
Yeah, but I wanted 12.
Baby wanted 12.

173
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,176
Why would you want 12 lemons?

174
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,078
Because I'm making
a 12-lemon centerpiece.

175
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,178
So, no one's actually
even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

176
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,713
Yeah. They're just
show lemons. Shown in
the center of the table.

177
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,952
I'm glad you find that
amusing,

178
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,222
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

179
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,764
Well,
can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

180
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,924
I'm not gonna use
a drinking...

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,661
We could have
a smaller version
of a centerpiece.

182
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm not gonna use
a drinking glass
for our centerpiece.

183
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,895
You know what?
I've got an idea.

184
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,168
Why don't we go ahead and
scratch the centerpiece idea
altogether,

185
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,106
because the chicken
that burnt my mouth

186
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,076
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon
on top of it.

187
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,673
Guess what? Now we've made
a better meal versus something
visually nice to look at.

188
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,749
What are you do...
What's happening here?
What are you doing?

(STAMMERING) Oh, I had
such a long day on the bus.

for the last three hours.

Come on. Help set the table.

195
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,095
GARY: Sweetheart.
What?

196
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,367
You've done such a great job
already. Don't you want
to finish it yourself

197
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,931
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

198
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,874
Set the table.
Listen to me.

199
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,141
Do you think that
when Michelangelo, right,

200
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,774
was painting
the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

201
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,580
"Hey, guys, you know,
I did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels,

202
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,780
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

203
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,914
"And maybe
you could help me...
Give me a brush

204
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,119
"and you guys can
grab brushes, and we can all
make a great chapel." Uh-uh.

205
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,391
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know
what the results were?

206
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,863
A masterpiece.

207
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,661
Okay. It's the Sistine Chapel,
not the Sixteenth,

208
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:50,334
and I bet when Michelangelo
asked for 12 brushes,
they didn't bring him three.

209
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,969
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting
to drain me,

210
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,208
and now I'm gonna have to
watch the highlights later
to see what I missed here.

211

Down time's important.

212
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,685
Gary, please just
take a shower, okay?
Down time's important.

213
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,980
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

214
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,250
I don't want the doorbell
to ring. I'm then forced
to answer the door,

215
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,291
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

216
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,450
Yeah.
Okay?

00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,462

that this inning's over...

a shower of mine take
more than four minutes?

Would you please
just let my parents in?

225
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,833
I gotta jump in the shower.
What?

GARY: Well, seeing how
our families haven't
had many opportunities

230
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,485
to get to know one another,
we figured, what better way
than to break some bread?

thank you for coming
and enjoy the meal.

those Feng Shui books

236
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,472
that I sent to you
to good use.

237
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,071
This place is
so well balanced.
Thanks, Mom.

238
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,140
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

240
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,048
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

241
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,986
if we had a pool table.

242
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,526
Gary, we've already
discussed that.

243
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,395
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

244
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,659
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table
because...

245
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,598
Gary.
Yeah. You could take
the dining room table,

246
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,828
go ahead and move her
in the living room.

247
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,029
BROOKE: Really?
GARY: Plenty of room.

248
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,902
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

249
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,942
How do you...
I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

250
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
Eat on it.
We'd have no furniture
in the living...

251
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,603
Where's the furniture go?
All I'm saying is,

252
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,170
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

253
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,307
Well, this isn't a dorm.
Look, baby,
I completely understand.

254
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,874
There's halls and stuff.
I mean, you can go...

255
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,580
We will wait
and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

256
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,020
Thank you.

257
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,595
The food is outstanding.
It is delicious food.

Norma Lee, who?

263
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,931
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

264
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,739
but would you like to buy
an encyclopedia?
LUPUS: I got a joke.
I got a joke.

265
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,042
(ALL CHUCKLING)
How's it going?
I got a joke for you.

266
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,845
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

267
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,484
All right, look,
I think we've had enough
with the jokes for tonight.

268
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,853
Thank you, though.
Let's just talk
with each other.

269
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,982
All right.

270
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,755
I saw that Three Brothers
article in the <i>Trib</i> this week.

271
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,353
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

272
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,368
Basically, our big goal is to
try to take Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

273
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,894
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

274
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,080
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

275
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,514
then we'll take it
to the squids.
Yeah.

276
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,150
Boats. Boats.
Oh, boats.

277
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,350
As soon as we control
the waterway, then we'll
bring in air supports

278
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,292
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

279
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,291
You know, Dennis,

280
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,196
the way your face lights up
when you describe
your ambitions,

281
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,134
it's really inspiring.

282
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,270
Oh, thanks.
Because I understand

283
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,174
how you feel that passion.

284
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,912
RICHARD: And sharing it
with other people, I think
that's what life's about.

285
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,212
I don't feel that about
boats and squibs... Squids?

286
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,445
ALL: Squids.
Sorry.

about singing.

Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

290
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,295
it's really
more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

291
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,270
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

292
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,009
And it's very hard
to describe the true magic

293
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,314
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

294
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,479
It's transcendent.

295
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,912
But it's still very real.

296
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,024
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

it'd be nice if you did
things that I asked.

if you did things without

get Brooke some flowers."

to take that to mean
that you do like flowers?

It's not about the dishes.

424
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,824

drop hints about the ballet?

00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,172
It's about the
person that you love
loves the ballet

433
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,237
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

434
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,407
Not when they're
at the ballet.

435
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,507
Okay. Forget the ballet!
Forget the ballet!
I will.

436
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,814
We don't go anywhere together.

437
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,019
We just went
to Ann Arbor together.
To Ann Arbor.

438
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,215
To the
Michigan-Notre Dame game.

439
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,724
You think screaming,
drunk kids and leprechauns
doing backflips, that's fun.

440
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,825
That's fun for me.
Come on, man.
I did that for you.

441
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,369
What do you...
How do you show up for me?

442
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,099
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

443
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,765
Come on. You...
I'm busting my ass

444
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,809
to be the best tour guide
in the damn city,

445
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,935
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

446
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,741
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

447
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,975
I want to work.
All I ask, Brooke,

448
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,142
is that you show a little bit
of appreciation.

449
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,846
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

450
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,584
instead of being attacked
with questions and nagged
the whole damn time.

451
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,456
You think that I nag you?
That's all you do!

452
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,960
All you do is nag me!

453
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,156
"The bathroom's a mess."
"Your belt doesn't match."

454
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,222
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out."

455
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,325
Nothing I ever do
is ever good enough!

456
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,428
I just want to be left
the hell alone!

457
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,806
Really? Is that
what you want, Gary?

458
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,212
Is that what you want?
Yeah.

459
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,306
That's what you want?
Yeah.

460
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,249
Fine. Great.
Do whatever the hell you want.

461
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,550
You leave your socks
all over this house,
dress like a pig,

462
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,157
play your stupid-ass
video game.
I don't care, I'm done.

463
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,723
What?
I'm done!
I don't deserve this.

464
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,663
I really do not deserve this.
I deserve somebody
who gives a shit.

465
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,431
I'm not spending one more
second of this life
with some inconsiderate prick!

466
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,261
You're a prick!

00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,720
Addie, it just became
so clear tonight

470
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,815
how much he takes me
for granted.

471
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,522
What happened?
BROOKE:
<i>Just the same old shit.</i>

472
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,790
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

473
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,958
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

474
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,627
and I just felt like
I had no choice.

475
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,261
No, sweetie,
you did have a choice, okay?

476
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,501
And it sounds like you
made the right one.
You respected yourself.

477
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:13,066
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up
with him.

478
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:17,137
I don't. I just want him
to say thank you. I want him
to want to do the dishes.

479
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,013
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

480
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,551
I want him to get me
12 lemons! You know...

481
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,127
I just want him to care
enough about this relationship
to want to work on it.

482
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,254
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

483
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,821
and I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.
No, Ad. Don't.

484
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,368
Please, I really don't
want to see anybody.
I really don't.

485
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,800
But, look, I'm worried
about you, okay?

486
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,065
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

487
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,937
And I don't want you
getting out your Clorox
and your rubber gloves,

488
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,978
and taking this out
on the kitchen.
Look, look, look.

489
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,545
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little
out of hand,

490
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:57,811
and hopefully
he's just gonna realize

491
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,325
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

492
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,190
He's gonna come home
and apologize.

You know,
do whatever you want to do.

496
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,065
I'm done with
the relationship.
Whatever.

497
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,372
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done
with the relationship?"

498
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,877
Well, you're obviously
hurt about it.

499
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,413
She got to you. You're hurt.
I'm not.

500
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,038
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
She hurt you.

501
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,275
Will you look at me?
I'm not heartbroken.

502
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,681
I'm a little shocked.
I'm a little surprised.

503
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,549
Gary, you're devastated.
Now, what's the name
of the guy she's doing?

504
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,350
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

505
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,550
What are you talking about?
Have you checked her e-mail?

506
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,683
I don't check e-mails.
I don't...

507
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,420
You can get a program
that records keystrokes.

508
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,019
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

509
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,555
You get a password, you check
her e-mail. You find out
everything about her.

510
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,931
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

511
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,594
that Stacy was
running around with.
Okay.

512
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,661
You are reading
a little too much
into this situation.

513
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,400
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

514
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,839
We had a fight
over the groceries
I brought home.

515
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,968
You're probably right.
She's probably not
sleeping with anybody.

516
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,375
No. Not what it's about.
Okay.

517
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,970
Maybe she's with
another guy, maybe not.
She's not.

518
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,481
I don't know.
I'm not Columbo. Okay?

519
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,213
But what we do know
is that she doesn't want
to be with you anymore.

520
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,357
I mean, I hate to be shitty
about it, and so cut and dry,
but let's face it.

521
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,486
She says she doesn't
want to be with you,
and I believe her.

522
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,588
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna
need a place to go

523
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,826
and lick your wounds
while you get your head
right over this thing.

524
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,026
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

525
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,126
You're gonna stay with me.

526
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,568
I'm not gonna hear it.
Look it...

527
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,629
I'm not moving
out of the place.
Oh, you're not moving out.

528
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,640
No. I put money in the place.
I put half my money
in the place.

529
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,074
You're obviously not
the one calling the shots
in this case.

530
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,135
Yeah, but I own the place.

531
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,373
With her.
Yeah.

532
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,210
But it's not up to her
who gets to keep
the goddamn place.

533
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,443
If you find out
who she's sleeping with,
maybe we could leverage it.

534
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,145
I want you to listen to me.
You listen to me.

535
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,585
I'm gonna leave you a key.
I don't need a key.

536
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,883
Why?
'Cause she's gonna put...

537
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,389
She's gonna move out
of the place, Johnny.

538
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,948
Did she say
she was moving out?
She will.
She's gonna move out.

539
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,654
Oh, she's...
I'm gonna keep the place.

I'm not moving
out of the place.

Your three points.

Gary, are you here
for couples bowling?
Yeah.

627
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,568
Well, don't you think
you and I should discuss
something first?

Okay. Great. No.

And since you and I
are no longer a couple,

631

because you have chosen

not to participate

get in the way of victory.

falling apart piece by piece

was pretty great.

721
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,501
Now, here's what I'd like
to do to you.

722
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,977
First, I'd like to
get you naked.

723
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,673
And then I'm gonna take
some Saran Wrap

724
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,477
and I'm gonna wrap you
up in it, head to toe.

725
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,641
Then I'm gonna
cut out two holes.

726
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,582
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe,
obviously.

727
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:49,778
And the other one...
Asshole.

728
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,515
It could be a gorgeous
evening for us, babe.

729
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,851
The pink is gorgeous.
Jesus, God.

730
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,857
Come here.
Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

731
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,222
There are our drinks.
You want your drink?

732
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,420
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
The L.G. thanks you.

733
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,522
Will you listen to me,
please? You're my brother
and I love you very much,

734
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,090
and maybe you do
get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

735
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,295
Arrested for what, babe?
Being awesome?

736
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,999
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes,
tell your jokes.

737
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,874
But sooner or later
you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

738
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:17,637
And jokes might
make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

739
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,513
I'm gonna go take a lap.

No, in my bedroom.

And I didn't say anything
to you, Brooke,

746
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,270
when you so arrogantly
claimed the bed
without asking me,

747

but you can't just waltz
into my room and turn it
into a damn art fair.

748
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,110
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

I don't care if you only
took an inch.

750

There might not be
a door here, but this
is my domain. Okay?

751
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,118
I don't go into your bedroom

Well, then what the hell
is that pool table
doing in the dining room?

Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

Not in my room.
Hey, what are you doing?

This is how I am

760

pretty strange.

to think about moving out.

No, I'm not moving anywhere.

but can we please
just leave it...

Problems? She slept with
the entire Arizona Cardinals

That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

I want you to listen to me

he won't get married.

he won't even have kids.

But then one day
his wife will come home,

00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,886

I'm fine, Brooke.

865
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,715
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

866
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,780
Okay.

867
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,486
If there's anyone
that should feel weird
about seeing people,

868
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,359
that's you, Tonya Harding.
Me? I'm gonna honor
my commitments.

869
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,795
Great.
Great.

870
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:42,991
Fine.
Fine.

871
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,897
Let's do that.
Let's do that.

872
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,060
Let's honor the commitment.

873
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,196
(WATER RUNNING)

874
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,041
Hey, there's no food in there!
BROOKE: So?

875
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,476
Well, people are gonna
be here in an hour.
What are they supposed to eat?

876
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,537
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

877
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,422
Oh, great.
Well, that's what we got.

878
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,355
We have only tap water
because, you know,
Gary didn't shop.

879
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,367
BROOKE: And we don't have
any ice either 'cause
he didn't fill the trays.

880
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,762
That's trash. It's your shot.
What is your name again?

881
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,930
Diane.
Diane.

882
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,097
GARY: Did you call?
JOHNNY O: I called the five.

883
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,765
Well, yeah,
but you didn't call
the second ball,

884
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,934
so that's trash,
so it's your shot.

885
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,943
GARY: You got to play
by the rules. It's your shot.

886
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,035
Hi.
Hi.

887
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,374
Andrew.
BROOKE: Oh, hi.

888
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

889
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,645
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

890
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,915
Who sent an invite to them?
I'm sorry.

891
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,925
These are very loyal friends
and they are always welcome
in my condo.

892
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:46,156
Oh, really? Why don't we
take it to a vote and see
who has the numbers this time?

893
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,561
GARY: All right.
Show of hands here.

894
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:51,499
Who thinks that these two
traitors should leave and
not be a part of game night?

895
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,661
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

896
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,934
Raise your hand.
I know I feel that way.
Who else?

897
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,099
GARY: Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

898
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,940
Come on. Thank you.
You, Miss? New girl.

899
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,143
Who's the girl?
What's her name?
What's her name?

900
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,877
The girl you're with.
What's her name?
Her name's Diane.

901
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,943
Oh, I'm sorry.
You might want to go ahead
and touch some sky.

902
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,888
Thank you. Come on,
Riggleman, please?
What are you doing?

903
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,187
No. We need the eight
to count towards
a running tally.

904
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,352
You know that. Come on.

905
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,486
Show her whose side
that you're on.
Put your hand in the air.

906
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,464
You know whose side I'm on.
You know we need eight,
though. Come on.

907
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,261
Put your hand down.

908
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,370
Please don't touch
my Ruffles.

909
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,702
GARY: Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

910
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,140
Don't eat them, please.
Thank you.

911
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,700
Oh, Gary.
They're mine.

912
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,006
Come on.
Here we go. All right.

913
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,843
RIGGLEMAN: Eyes front. Ready?
Hold on. Get the
timer going, please.

914
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,009
Ready?
GARY: Now I gotta do it. Go.

915
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,676
ANDREW: Okay.
It's a brick.

916
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,550
ADDIE: Square. Square.
Box. Box.

917
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,112
Corner. Corner.
A dot in the corner.

918
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,748
A house.
Home plate!

919
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,090
JEN: Football! Baseball!
Sports. A house.
ADDIE: A triangle.
It's algebra.

920
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,096
Okay, it's a house.
ADDIE: It's a house.

921
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,563
JEN: It's a house.
ANDREW: Two words.

922
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,190
JEN: Banana?
ADDIE: Chimney,
chimney, chimney!

923
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,997
A fruit. House. Fruit.

924
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,594
Oh, restaurant. Or...

925
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,037
ANDREW: No, chimney, chimney.
ADDIE: Smoke...

926
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,199
JEN: Oh, a house call.
House call!

927
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,674
(TIMER RINGING)
Oh! House call!

928
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,506
Yeah, well, I thought
it was a house call.

929
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,569
Like a hotel, then it hit me
it was a house.
ADDIE: Yeah!

930
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,615
You're terrific.
Absolutely terrific.

931
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:13,741
All right, beat that.

932
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,011
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

933
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,712
So let's stay focused.
Let's stay calm.

934
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,812
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

935
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,084
Let's get a mind-meld.
Let's try and get a mind-meld,
okay?

936
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,591
GARY: Here we go.
Let's go. Mind-meld.
I heard you!

937
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,126
Don't over-think it.
Mind meld.
ANDREW: Ready?

938
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,957
I heard you!
Well, just keep it simple.

939
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,121
Shush.

940
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,665
Ready? Wait. Go!
Here we go!
We're mind-melding.

941
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,394
Draw faster.
It doesn't have
to be beautiful,

942
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,833
just has to be
something we can get.
Shoe, shoe...

943
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,632
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

944
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,337
Shoeless Joe Jackson.
Draw something different.
No one's getting it.

945
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,068
Shoe. What, is that
a smaller shoe?
JOHNNY O: Baby shoe.

946
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,167
Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
JOHNNY O: Shoes.

947
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,836
Baby shoes.
Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

948
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,073
GARY: Smaller shoes.
DIANE: Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

949

Running Olympics.
JOHNNY O: Inside the shoe.

950
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,546
Inside a shoe. A bubble...
JOHNNY O: Lining.

951
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,814
Stop pointing at the shoe.
We're not...
No one's guessing shoe.

952
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,446
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

953
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,547
(TIMER RINGING)
Draw something different.
You...

954
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,115
Goddamn it!
No one's guessing shoe!

955
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,322
You drew a big shoe,
then a small shoe,
and no one got it.

956
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,662
You gotta draw something
different. Everyone said
"shoe" seven times.

957
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,497
It's a sock, asshole.

958
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,897
You call yourself an artist?
Yes!

959
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,599
A three-year-old with
a box of crayons could
do a better job than this.

960
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,404
I'm sorry, I don't have
the great talent of standing
on top of a big red bus

961
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,672
and pointing out architecture
that other great men
have built!

962
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:16,974
I'm the one who should
be sorry, Brooke.

963
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,776
I shouldn't sit here
and pick on your art.
No.

964
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,942
Because you got
the nuts part down,
Picasso.

965
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,610
GARY: All you have
to do is
cut off your frigging ear.

966
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,846
BROOKE: That's Van Gogh,
you idiot!

967
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,854
And your insults
are much more effective
when they're accurate.

968
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,048
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

969
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,250
I can talk to you
about anything that I want.

970
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,587
'Cause you couldn't even
draw a sock.

971
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,751
You don't do anything right!
You're a lazy...

972
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,055
Everyone said,
"Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

973
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,665
At first,
I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

974
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,827
something that you two
would work out and get past,

975
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,495
but after tonight
I think it's pretty clear

976
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,631
that you two genuinely
do not want to
get back together.

977
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,606
There's not a shot in hell.
Gary.

978
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,337
I'm just...
I got you.

979
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,675
As your friend
and as your realtor,

980
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:52,908
I'm not gonna
leave here tonight

981
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,610
until we decide
what to do about this condo,

982
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:59,018
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

983
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,419
Gary?

984
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,462
Well, the only logical thing
that I can think of

985
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,003
is for her to move out
of the condo,

986
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,837
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty
as compensation for

987
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,138
the labor that I did
all around the condo.
What? What?

988
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,270
What? Pay you compensation
for your labor?

989
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,480
We fixed this place up
together.
Are you nuts?

990
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,211
Stop calling me nuts,
I swear to God.
I fixed the...

991
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,411
You went around with a sponge,

992
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,976
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

993
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,612
That's what you're saying
that I did?
GARY: There's no...

994
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,213
BROOKE: That was...
That's called aesthetics.

995
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,316
It warmed this place up
so it didn't look like

996
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,623
an army barracks,
which it was about to.

997
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,629
I'll tell you what
it's called in his language,
depreciated.

998
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,688
That's what it's called.
You don't even know
what that means.

999
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,132
Unless the next buyer
happens to have your same
Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

1000
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,499
All right.
Let me tell you
something else.

1001
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,970
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes
in the wall.

1002
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,440
The holes that you drilled
in the wall there to hang up
whatever that thing is called.

1003
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,567
Oh, please. Gary.

1004
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,632
GARY: You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

1005
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,271
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value
to the condo.

1006
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,178
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

1007
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,082
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling
in the bathroom.

1008

Have you seen...
I did the new track lighting.

1009
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,785

shittiest tile job.
GARY: I did the plumbing!

1010
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,289
The plumbing!
That's realty terms.

1011
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,120
Okay. Let's talk
about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

1012
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,352
We have two temperatures
in our bathroom.

1013
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,157
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

1014
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,720
That's it. That's all we get.
It's my problem

1015
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,163
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

1016
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,222
GARY: Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

1017
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,358
I get a minute
to take a shower.

1018
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,663
One minute?
BROOKE: One minute of warmth?

1019
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,863
Oh, Jesus. One minute.
That's it. That's correct.

1020
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,668
Thank God you're not
in charge of keeping all the
clocks in Chicago on time.

1021
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,209
This is basic logic.
You are out of your mind.
You have lost it.

1022
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,074
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

1023
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,207
Cheese and rice,
you guys are gonna kill
each other. Now, let's just...

1024
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
Realistically speaking,
neither one of you

1025
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,013
can afford this mortgage
on your own, okay?

1026
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,717
And that's a shame,
because this building will
continue to increase in value.

1027
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,055
I get nothing but
phone calls about it,
all right?

1028
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,719
Waiting for a unit to open up.

1029
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,492
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest
is selling.

1030
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,093
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see
any other solution.

1031
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,301
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

1032
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,363
and you get on
with your lives.

1033
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:03,875
I know that selling is not
the easiest thing, but
I do think that it's the best.

1034
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,079
And to be honest,
this is a situation

1035
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,416
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

1036
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,155
That's great. Thank you.
That's great.
Thank you for that.

1037
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,025
I wish I didn't have to,
you know,

1038
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,963
but company policy says
I cannot waive that.

1039
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,894
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying
in theory, you know.

1040
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:30,338
In this situation,
'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1041
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,839
No can do, though.

1042
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:36,169
As soon as you can,
I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1043

Okay. Great. There they are.

I'm so sorry.

1152
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,731
Hello.

1153
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,241
ADDIE: <i>Okay, is this when</i>
<i>I'm supposed to call?</i>
What?

1154
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,778
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1155
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,407
<i>Okay, that's great.</i>
Wait. What? Oh, all right.

1156
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,781
Listen, where...
Just don't move.
Where are you?

1157
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,877
<i>I'm sitting in my kitchen.</i>
Sitting? Okay.

1158
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,922
(STAMMERING) Don't move.

1159
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,925
Don't... I'm gonna be
right there, honey. I'm gonna
be right there, okay?

1160
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,790
Is everything okay?
Oh, my gosh.

1161
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,329
That was my best friend.

1162
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,231
She just had an accident
and she...
She has this knee thing

1163
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,269
and she's just very fragile,
and I have to go.
What?

1164
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,804
I can give you a ride.
No. No. That's okay.

1165
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:19,603
I'm gonna grab a cab, so...
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,200
I like your dress.

1167
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:26,005
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously
read a lot of books.

1168
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,709
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1169
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:31,083
He reads a lot of books
because nobody
wants to talk to him.

1170
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:34,845
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1171
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,324
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1172
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,452
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1173
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,522
We've got to find somebody
who is really gonna
make Gary jealous.

1174
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,759
LUPUS:
Can I just say something?

1175
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,234
You sound a little jealous,
Gary.

1176
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,203
GARY: Why would I be
jealous of some guy
with computer skills?

1177
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,833
Let's say he doesn't have
computer skills, but he's got
a big old elephant hog on him?

1178
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,638
Would that bother you
or would you be
okay with that?

1179
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,110
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1180
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,476
LUPUS: My mind works great.

1181
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,812
So, what's this bullshit
I hear about you
selling the condo?

1182
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,974
Selling that condo
is ludicrous.

1183
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,610
I was waiting for
when I was gonna get

1184
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,281
the how-Gary-always-
screws-his-life-up
speech again.

1185
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,983
This must be the right time.
Look, you tell me,

1186
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,117
you just tell me, tell me.
Is it happening now?
Yeah. Okay.

1187
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,788
Tell me how
losing that asset

1188
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,957
is gonna get us
on the river?

1189
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,730
Go ahead, just tell me.
Tell me. Somebody tell me.
What is this?

1190
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,203
What is this? What is it?
What is it? Hey!
Don't patronize me.

1191
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,264
Helicopters.
Helicopters. Exactly!

1192
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,310
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1193
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,108
Dennis, I'm being totally
serious with you. I don't
need this shit right now.

1194
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,274
Hey, you want to cry,
cry to Mom.

1195
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,985
Nobody's crying.
I'm not crying.

1196
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,817
I just don't feel
like hearing it.
There's no feelings here.

1197
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,586
This is about money
and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1198
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,191
You broke up. Fine.

1199
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,256
You know, sad.

1200
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,962
Sad is, instead of putting
$1,000 into your mortgage
every month,

1201
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,008
you waste it on rent.
That's what sad is.

1202
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:04,906
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused,
brokenhearted.

1203
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,309
Heartbreak is not
having that money

1204
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:12,081
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1205
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,221
so that after taxes
you can invest!

1206
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:20,491
You know, you're confused.

1207
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,859
Are you finished?
Look, I need
the damn tour logs.

1208
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:28,926
Yeah.

1209
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,333
Well, I really,
really appreciate
the heart to heart.

1210
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,774
It was a great talk, Dennis.
Thank you.

1211
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,004
Oh, well, you're behind
three months. You're still
behind three months.

1212
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,174
And those logs are imperative
to insuring that our books
are straight!

1213
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,878
I'll tell you what those
logs are. Those logs are
bullshit is what they are!

1214
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,853
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn
things yourself!

1215
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,048
I do, I do!

1216
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,559
And I don't appreciate it,
because it cuts into
my time with my family.

1217
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,595
I could be spending that time
with my family instead of
doing your books.

1218
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,858
I already do the taxes.
I do the billing.

1219
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,163
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1220
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,261
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1221
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,136
You do the tours!
I am the talent, Dennis!

1222
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,066
They sign up a month
in advance to see me.

1223
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:12,511
They'll wait in line
for the next bus
to see me! All right?

1224
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:18,410
So don't drain me
with all this bullshit
about the goddamn tour logs!

Hi, Mike.

1234
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,019
Hi.
Come on in.

Is your mom
in the room with you?

1237

'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1238
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,321
I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1239
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,332
I'm gonna be just
a few more seconds.
So, just sit down and relax.

1240
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,265
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1241

GARY: I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

1242
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:12,504
You take the fun
out of beating you, because
you have an excuse to lose.

<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

that your mom won't
love you anymore

1245
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,008
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

Oh, hey,

Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

I love it, yeah.
I love it, don't you?

1269
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,409
I mean, it's the kind of thing
where literally

I play the game and it's like,

that when that moment comes

that Lupus sent, we each have
eight articles of clothing.

1312
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,948
Now, if you want to bet,
you take off an article
of clothing,

1313
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,114
you put it in the center.

1314
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,489
If you win,
you take back the clothes,
you put back on what you bet.

You can go all in
at any point,

you must take off
all your clothes to do so.

do the right thing

01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,653
but I don't think I have

1591
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,757
anything left to give.

1592
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:07,766
I'm sorry.

1593
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,740
I was hoping for...

1594
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:22,681
It doesn't matter.

1595
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,718
Oh, this is now
beyond awkward.

1596
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,590
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1597
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:37,597
and I think I'm gonna go.

1598
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:43,731
Okay.

1599
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,909
Thank you.

1600
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,377
I made a dinner,
and I don't know if
it's any good or not,

1601
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,384
but you're welcome to have it.

1602
01:30:58,719 --> 01:30:59,811
Okay.

1603
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,388
Gary, that's really...
That's not what
you think that it is.

1604
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,588
It's okay.

1605
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,931
I'm gonna go take a walk.

1609
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:38,621
I'm sorry about that.
No.

1610
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:42,225
I'm sorry I imposed.
No, that's fine. Please.

1611
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:47,733
So, what do you think?
I think you're right.

1612
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,134
I think it's great.
Good.

1613
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,430
Okay.
Okay.

1614
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:53,633
So,

1615
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:58,469
I will have that wrapped up.

1616
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:01,276
Packed up, sorry,
and delivered.

1617
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,083
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1618
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:05,277
Sure.

1619
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,011
Yeah. I'm gonna run.
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1620
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:10,421
No, no, no.
I can... It's okay.

GARY: So, the thing that
I was most afraid
of happening happened

1624
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:32,103
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows
how I feel.

1625
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:37,145
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1626
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:41,416
I think,
what you got to do now
is really think hard,

1627
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,583
because you have
to find somebody

1628
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,128
that can't be traced back
to either of us

1629
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,092
to visit this guy.

1630
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:53,659
What are you talking about?
I don't...

1631
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,463
The guy who came with her.

1632
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:57,970
I don't need anything
to happen to the guy.

1633
01:32:58,039 --> 01:32:59,700
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1634
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:01,901
It's not about him.
I don't care about that.
...it's a problem.

1635
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:04,570
The guy, he's not a...
They're not dumb.
Cops are smart, trust me.

1636
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,579
Okay, but he's not
a problem to me.
Right.

1637
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,444
Listen to me.

1638
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,952
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1639
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:13,111
I got you.

1640
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:16,154
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1641
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,713
What are you talking about?
I'll take care of it.

1642
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:19,783
I don't want you
to take care of anything.
John, do me a favor.

1643
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,886
I'm being serious with you.
I know, I know.
Smart. You're smart.

1644
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,295
No, I'm not.
I'm being honest with you.

1645
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:25,764
I don't want anything
to happen to him.
Me, either.

1646
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,892
Promise me you're not
gonna have anyone
do anything to this guy.

1647
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,869
But you've gotta
tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1648
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:31,837
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell
a different story...

1649
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:33,703
Nothing.
Promise me one thing.
We don't care...

1650
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,765
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this.
I'm exhausted.

1651
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:38,175
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbors know
you're going home.

1652
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:41,942
Do me a favor.
They got phone records. Make
a couple phone calls tonight.

1653
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,745
Especially around 10:00.

1654
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:47,143
Okay. Please don't
do anything. All right.

1655
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,882
I don't mean it like...
I mean, honestly.

1656
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:50,321
No, no, I got it.

1657
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:57,160
For all you know,
nothing's happening.

1658
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,997
I don't want anything
to happen.
Right.

1659
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,432
Say it louder.

1660
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:32,517
What are you doing here
so early?

1661
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:56,106
Hey.

1662
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,585
Everything okay
with you and...
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

1663
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:07,116
I just wanna get
my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1664
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:10,692
I'm sorry it took
so long for me to...

1665
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,832
I love you, Dennis.

1666
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:18,033
(GASPING)
It's all right. It's okay.

1667
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,540
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
do the stuff.

1668
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,161
So, that's it
for all my stuff.

1669
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:58,371
If you want, you could give me
your key and I'll drop it off
at Riggleman's.

1670
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,108
All right.

1671
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:10,650
Thanks.

1672
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:12,815
Gary.

1673
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:17,219
You know, there's
a thousand things I...

1674
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:20,200
I would have done differently.

1675
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,563
Me, too.

1676
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:30,066
Sort of, actually,
when I see this space, I
realize that if we didn't have

1677
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:33,944
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1678
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:39,776
a pool table
would have fit nicely.

1679
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,046
Yeah.

1680
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:46,849
Although the oversized couch
did come in very useful the
last couple of weeks, so...

1681
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,688
Yes, it... I guess.

1682
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,000
Have a good trip.

1683
01:37:58,405 --> 01:37:59,702
Thanks.

01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:42,371
Hi.
Hi.

1711
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,172
Wow.

1712
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:47,139
(CHUCKLES)

1713
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:50,115
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

1714
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:54,550
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of
full with all the bags here.

1715
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,289
How've you been?
I've been really good.

1716
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,828
How have you been?
I've been good.

1717
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:03,691
Yeah.

1718
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,697
You look great.
Thank you.

1719
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:10,066
The hair's a little different.
Looks nice.
Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1720
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:14,600
You've lost some weight.
Well, it's very
deceiving, actually.

1721
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:19,510
I've managed to become thin
without having any real muscle
on me whatsoever.

1722
01:40:19,613 --> 01:40:22,878
Very tough thing to
accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

1723
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,441
Well, you look terrific.
Thanks.

1724
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:29,954
I heard your trip
went really well.
It did. It went really well.

1725
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,616
Oh, good.
It was fun. It was amazing.

1726
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,252
I saw so many amazing places.
It was just...

1727
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:38,826
But, you know,
you do realize
how much you love home.

1728
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,936
It's good to have you back.
Yeah. It's good to be back.

1729
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,799
And the boat.
Congratulations on the boat.
Thanks.

1730
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:51,776
I'm waiting for it
to get warm, and I'm gonna
come by and take a ride.

1731
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:54,678
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house.
Come on by.

1732
01:40:54,748 --> 01:40:56,807
Well, I will, then.

1733
01:40:58,252 --> 01:40:59,742
I hope you do.

1734
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,248
Definitely.

1735
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:09,126
Well, I got to...
I'm going to a meeting, so...

1736
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:13,997
I got to drop these bags
off anyway, but it's really
good to see you, Brooke.

1737
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:17,029
Really good to see you.
Shouldn't...

1738
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:19,271
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1739
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,706
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time
before we...

1740
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:24,141
Yeah.
...catch up.

1741
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:26,611
We have a lot more
to talk about.
Yeah.

1742
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:28,003
So.

1743
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:30,976
Be good.
Okay.

1744
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:32,245
Bye.
Bye.

1745
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:40,586
(I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW
PLAYING)

1746
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:03,165
