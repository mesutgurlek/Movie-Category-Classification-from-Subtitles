1
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,833
Passengers arriving
on Philippine Airlines flight 118,

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,798
welcome to Manila
International Airport.

3
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,959
Hey.

4
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,988
Hey, kid!

5
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,514
- Are you Zack?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,556
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,912
- Come on, let's get your bags, OK?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,113
Take your jacket off, kid.
It's hot here.

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,317
This is the PI,
the Philippine Islands.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,516
Zack, I'm sorry about
what happened to your mom.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,795
It must have been pretty rough.

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,516
I would have called you a lot sooner,
but I was out at sea.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,558
I've been calling you
for four months.

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,232
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I was out at sea for four months.

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,828
All right, kid. These are
your mama-sans, Tiki and Maria.

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,797
Hello, Byron.

17
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,315
I want you to meet somebody.

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,437
This is my son, Zack.
Tiki, say hello.

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,158
Zack - Tiki and Maria.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,311
- Hi, Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,958
I'm at sea three weeks
of every month.

22
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,758
When I'm back in port,

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,957
I don't have time
for this daddy stuff.

24
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,189
That's OK, sir.

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,397
You don't understand.
I'm too old for this.

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,678
I don't care what the Navy says.
This is no place for kids.

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,196
Like I said on the telephone,
you're better off in Virginia.

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,875
- I'm never going back!
- Maybe that's not for you to say!

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,918
God dammit!
Don't look at me that way!

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,833
What happened to your mother
had nothing to do with me.

31
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,388
It did! You said you'd come back!
You promised!

32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,439
That's what she said?
That's a female lie. That's bullshit!

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,399
I found your letters
and read them after she did it!

34
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,439
You said you loved her,
and she believed you!

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,272
You're a liar!

36
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,555
Hurry, grow up, boy.
I'll wait for you. Cherry boy.

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,474
You want to go to school?
I'll teach you nice.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,874
Chicken feet, monkey meat.
Come on, you buy.

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,679
You buy. Monkey meat. You buy.

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,198
Hey, sailor. What ship are you from?

41
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,320
Hey! What are you doing?

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,756
Big spender, give us some money.

43
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,229
- I don't have any.
- Get it out!

44
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,514
No!

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,638
Leave me alone!

46
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,432
Leave me alone.

47
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,430
Holy shit.

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,910
Watch it. I got to heave.

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,956
Jesus Christ.

50
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,675
Give me a towel.

51
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,110
Pretty fuckin' wild.

52
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,711
Holy shit.

53
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,358
Not as wild as that night we banged
those three stewardesses in Manila.

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,956
Bet you didn't get it on like that
in that jerkwater college of yours.

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,473
How long you going to
hang around Seattle?

56
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,829
Get ready.
This one will blow you away.

57
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,071
Nothing you do
is ever going to surprise me.

58
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,470
- Tell me.
- I joined the Navy.

59
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,397
- You joined the Navy?
- That's right, I did.

60
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,313
I'm on my way to Port Rainier,

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,994
this officer's training school
over there.

62
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,398
- What for?
- Jets. I want to fly jets.

63
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,837
This place is only
a couple of hours from here.

64
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,071
Maybe you'll want to
visit me sometime, right?

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,790
- Who put that idea in your head?
- Nobody. Just come to me.

66
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,232
What's so funny?

67
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,959
You, man. It's like saying
you're running for president.

68
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,036
Christ, look at yourself.

69
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,796
Officers don't have tattoos.

70
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,277
- Look, I'll see you, man, all right?
- Yeah.

71
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,154
- Zack, come on, don't be pissed off.
- I'm not pissed off.

72
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,152
You are pissed off. I'm on your side.

73
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,429
I don't want to see you do
something you'll regret.

74
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,640
You got to give up six fucking years
of your life if you want to fly.

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,510
Six fucking years, with the most
uptight assholes on earth.

76
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,673
Officers aren't like you and me.
They're a different breed.

77
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,197
This sounds like you're afraid
you might have to salute me someday.

78
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
Why would I be afraid to salute you?

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,230
I don't know. It sounds that way.

80
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,471
You want some fatherly bullshit -
a pat on the back.

81
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,755
From you? No. No.

82
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,553
Thanks for my graduation present,
Byron. See you around.

83
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,349
Don't go away mad.
Hey, babe. Zack! Come on.

84
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,118
Zack!

85
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,278
Fall in!

86
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,393
I said fall in, you slimy worms!

87
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,199
Put your toes on that chalk line!

88
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,513
I said put your toes on the
chalk line, you slimy worms!

89
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,269
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

90
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,796
Where you been all your lives,
at an orgy?

91
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,919
Listening to Mick Jagger music and
bad-mouthing your country, I'll bet.

92
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,951
Stop eyeballing me. You're not worthy
to look your superiors in the eye.

93
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,077
Use your peripheral vision.
Understand?

94
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,195
Yes, sir.

95
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,068
When I say "understand",
I want the group to say, "Yes, sir!"

96
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,752
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

97
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,956
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

98
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,998
I know why most of you are here.

99
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,871
I'm not stupid.

100
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,791
Before you get to sell what we teach
you over at United Airlines,

101
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,759
got to give the Navy six years
of your life, sweet pea.

102
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,153
Lots of things can happen in six
years. Another war could come up.

103
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,074
If you're too peaceful a person
to napalm an enemy village,

104
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,551
where there are women and children,
I'm going to find that out.

105
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,392
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

106
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,948
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

107
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,158
Hi, son.

108
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,314
How you doing, sarge?

109
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,790
- What did you call me?
- Beg your pardon?

110
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,916
What did you call me, boy?

111
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,797
- Sarge.
- Before that.

112
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,193
Nothing before that.

113
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,512
You said, "How are you?"
A ewe is a female sheep.

114
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,751
- Is that what you think I am, boy?
- No.

115
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,478
- No, sir!
- No, sir.

116
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,437
- Louder, sweet pea!
- No, sir!

117
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,594
You want to fuck me?
That's why you called me a ewe?

118
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,150
- Are you a queer?
- Hell no, sir!

119
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,437
- Where you from, boy?
- Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, sir.

120
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,953
Only two things come out of Oklahoma.

121
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,600
Steers and queers.

122
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,471
Which one are you, boy?

123
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,117
I don't see no horns.
You must be a queer.

124
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,155
No, sir.

125
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,754
Stop whispering.
You're giving me a hard-on.

126
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,273
No, sir!

127
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,830
You laughing at me, dickbrain?

128
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,959
No, sir!

129
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,429
Stop eyeballing me,

130
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,990
or I'll rip your eyeballs out
and skullfuck you to death.

131
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,035
Yes, sir!

132
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,872
What's your name, boy?

133
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,679
Mayo. Zack Mayo, sir!

134
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,955
How did you slip into this programme?

135
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,873
I didn't know the Navy
was so hard up.

136
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,310
You got an injury there, Mayo?

137
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,992
Not exactly, sir.

138
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,072
Hey, this is really wonderful work.
Where did you get this, Mayo?

139
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,594
Subic Base, Philippines, sir.

140
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,148
Thought I recognised the work.

141
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,597
Be proud of them wings.

142
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,390
They're the only ones you're going to
leave here with, Mayo-nnaise!

143
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,394
- What's your name, boy?
- Emiliano Santos Della Serra, sir.

144
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,029
You don't say?
You a college boy, Della Serra?

145
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,270
Yes, sir! Math major, sir.

146
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,669
Graduated from Texas tech
with honours, sir!

147
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,239
I see.

148
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,674
You see this cane, Della Serra?

149
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,876
See the notches near the handle?

150
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,397
There's a notch for every college
puke like you that I got to DOR.

151
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
That's Drop On Request
from this program.

152
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,558
The first one I'm going to call
out of this class is you, Emiliano.

153
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,315
I expect to lose half of you
before I'm finished.

154
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,790
I will use every means
necessary, fair and unfair,

155
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,998
to trip you up, to expose your
weaknesses as a potential aviator

156
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,071
and as a human being, understand?

157
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,718
Yes, sir!

158
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,079
The price at the other end is
a flight education worth $1 million!

159
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,833
But first, you got to get past me!

160
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,200
Hey, Paula! It's 5:00!

161
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,714
Where's the goddamn whistle?

162
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,909
Oh, shit!

163
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,154
Come on, Paula.
Let's go! Turn that thing off!

164
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,639
Next!

165
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,237
Oh, shit.

166
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,713
What is that?

167
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,834
This is my idea of an ass bandit.

168
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,151
Wait till the girls see you,
scrotumhead.

169
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,753
Scrotumhead!

170
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,990
Think that's funny, don't you, boy?

171
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,278
Not all the obstacles that can trip
you up are on this base.

172
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,272
Let me tell you something
about the local girls.

173
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,635
Ever since there's been a base here,

174
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,632
there's been what you'd call
the Puget Sound Debs.

175
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,918
The poor girls come across
the sound on the ferry every weekend

176
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,514
with just one thing in mind,

177
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,151
and that's to marry themselves
a naval aviator.

178
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,835
A Puget Deb will tell you,

179
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,638
"Don't you worry
about contraceptives.

180
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,154
"I've got that all taken care of."

181
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,515
Don't believe it, sweet pea.

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,633
A Puget Deb will do anything
and say anything to trap you.

183
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,870
I know this sounds silly,

184
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,918
especially in this
so-called modern age,

185
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,073
but you scuzzy college pukes should
watch out, because they're out there,

186
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,277
and you, sweet peas,
are the answer to their dream!

187
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,229
Hurry up! On the double!

188
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,118
You lard asses, I'm going to fix you!

189
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,553
Get up in there!

190
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,029
Quick! On the double, Mayonnaise!

191
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,792
Come on, Seeger.

192
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,031
Little girl poopies to the left,
boys to the right!

193
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,951
Come on, let's go!

194
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,952
What a motley bunch! Get in there!

195
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,438
All right, quick! On the double!

196
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,836
OK, here we go.

197
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,992
How's it going?

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,036
You got to be kidding.

199
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,237
How do they expect me
to get down there?

200
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,437
One of you guys want to switch bunks?

201
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,876
- They're assigned bunks, man.
- I don't think we can.

202
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,269
Hey, Daniels, you're in there.

203
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,317
Who the hell is that guy?

204
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,676
That's your mom and dad
for the next 13 weeks.

205
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,878
Fall out! Get outside!
On the double! Come on out here!

206
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,872
Quick! Out the door! On the double!

207
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,079
Quick! Quick! Quick!

208
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,639
More! More! More! More!

209
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,073
Give me 50.

210
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,151
Give me 50. Count them!

211
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,558
Think there's any truth to what he
said about those girls, Puget Debs?

212
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,868
- Sure.
- Still?

213
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,034
Yeah. Should have warned you scuzzy
female types about the Puget Dudes.

214
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,358
They say they're wearing rubbers, but
there's a hole bitten in the bottom.

215
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,475
Very funny, Mayo...

216
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,109
Seeger, Mayo, Worley!
Got enough energy to run them sewers,

217
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,796
get over there and give me 50!
On the double! Right now!

218
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,116
All right, poopie asses,
get your faces on down there!

219
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,670
You women better not expect
special privileges!

220
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,550
You think flying a plane is just
sitting on a chair pushing buttons?

221
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,950
Looks like you need a little
upper-body strength, Seeger!

222
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,155
All right, all right, get up.

223
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,309
Get up!

224
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,913
Step out!

225
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,599
Get back in line! You watch!

226
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,195
Pilots off the Lexington should be
getting to the Officers Club now.

227
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,589
You sure got the timetable down,
Lynette.

228
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,353
After three years,
you learn all the tricks.

229
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,159
Did you see
that bodacious set of tatas?

230
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,312
I brought the records
the social committee asked for.

231
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,079
You didn't come all this way...

232
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,118
You're pissing me off, boys!

233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,315
38...

234
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,469
39...

235
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,633
The Blue Angels will be in soon.
I'll introduce you if you like.

236
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,915
- Bye for now.
- Bye, bye.

237
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,468
Far fucking out!

238
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,916
I've been wanting to meet
one of those Blue Angels!

239
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,639
Look at those poopies.
Those poor guys.

240
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,711
See you when you get liberty!

241
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,394
It grows out about an inch by then!

242
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,792
Ain't gonna be no liberty for you.
You'll be going home before then.

243
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,393
Start from one again!

244
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,754
1...

245
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,355
2...

246
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,520
Flyin' low and feelin' mean!

247
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,513
Spot a family by the stream!

248
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,473
Pickle a pair and hear 'em scream!

249
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,748
Cos napalm sticks to kids!

250
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,278
- That's disgusting!
- What are you doing here?

251
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,078
Am I threatening you?

252
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,277
Send you to war,
you'll get your ass shot down.

253
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,830
Wouldn't mind being the first woman
to fly fighters in combat.

254
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,388
- Go in my place. Jets?
- All the way.

255
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,675
- Mayo?
- Jets.

256
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,912
Only two go to jets.
Who's going with me?

257
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,228
- Me!
- Me!

258
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,390
Talking in the ranks again.

259
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,519
You three just added 2 miles
to this little hike...for everybody.

260
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,079
Come on! Let's go!

261
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,400
Family of gooks
are sittin' in a ditch!

262
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,633
Little baby suckin'
on his mama's tit!

263
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,716
Chemical firms don't give a shit!

264
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,233
That napalm sticks to kids!

265
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,514
Get up here! Up those stairs!

266
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,271
Let's go! Come on!

267
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,238
Move, move, move!

268
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,236
Move it up here!

269
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,153
Come on, let's go!

270
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,037
Come on, let's go! Go!

271
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,076
Get up here! Move!

272
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,593
Get up here!

273
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,875
Move it, candy pants!

274
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,316
Double it up! Double it up! Move on!

275
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,590
All right, everybody, up!
Up on your feet!

276
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,832
I don't want to see nothing
coming out your mouths either!

277
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,356
Let's get in shape around here!
Stand straight up!

278
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,115
Get out of the way!

279
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,953
Lift your head and hold it high!

280
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,558
The best in the regiment
is runnin' on by!

281
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,519
That could be you at the end of
13 weeks... Those who might survive!

282
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,751
You don't deserve to look at them!

283
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,751
Della Serra, turn you back!

284
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,910
You are without a doubt

285
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,958
the most pathetic class
I've ever been assigned to!

286
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,839
You big chump. Four weeks, and you
still can't shine a damn buckle.

287
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,831
Shoot me a Kotex, buddy.

288
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,675
Be careful where you stick that.

289
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,628
- Five minutes to inspection, Mayo.
- Where's your money?

290
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,308
Boonies.

291
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,429
You better hope Foley
never finds out about that.

292
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,032
Hey, Perryman.

293
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,276
Look what I got here, man.

294
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,916
Look at that. Look at them buckles.

295
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,638
Look good, huh?

296
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,709
10 bucks. 15 for the boonies.

297
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,836
Who's got 10 bucks?

298
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,311
I spend every penny keeping
my old lady and kid in that motel.

299
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,231
You're breaking my heart, Perryman.

300
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,709
Who's doing this for you?

301
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,432
Some enlisted guy, right?

302
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,789
- Hey, tell me something.
- Watch the sheets, man.

303
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,917
Is that piss-ass piece of change
you're making

304
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,312
worth all of us getting kicked out
of here on an honours violation?

305
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,238
I don't see anybody else
complaining about it, Perryman.

306
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,753
Excuse me.

307
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,117
Ready? Go!

308
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,191
Look out, Worley, coming through.

309
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,192
- The hell you say, son.
- Here I come.

310
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,198
I'm putting my name on that wall.

311
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,759
Underneath mine.

312
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,909
Fuck!

313
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,472
Give me the rope!

314
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,348
Shit!

315
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,558
God damn, Mayonnaise!

316
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,637
2:25. Not bad...for a beginner.

317
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,838
Piece of cake.

318
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,229
Let's go! Come on, Schneider!

319
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,514
Come on, Schneider!

320
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,153
Let's go! Let's go!

321
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,390
Let's go! Let's go!

322
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,072
Kick ass!

323
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,992
Let's go!
You guys are bringing up the rear!

324
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,590
You ain't getting out of here
till you get over that wall, Seeger!

325
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,069
- I'll make it, sir!
- Hurry up!

326
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,996
Come on. Get over there!

327
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,393
You really want to be a man, Seeger?

328
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,109
You one of those girls didn't
get enough of daddy's attention

329
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,556
cos he really wanted a son, Seeger?

330
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,633
That's it. That's what'll
beat you every time, Seeger -

331
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,632
your mental attitude
is that of a female.

332
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,995
Deep down under all that bullshit

333
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,471
you're still thinking like
a second-class citizen, aren't you?

334
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,074
You can never give orders to men!

335
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,071
Walk around.

336
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,118
Walk around, sugar britches.

337
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,471
Bernoulli's equation gives us
the total amount of energy

338
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,118
contained in the air flow.

339
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,909
"P" is static pressure
in pounds per square foot.

340
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,470
"RHO" is air density
in slugs per cubic foot,

341
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,870
and velocity is in feet per second.

342
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,520
2,000 pounds per square foot...

343
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,558
Let's see them.

344
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,596
What about the buckles?

345
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,638
OK. All right. 20 bucks, right?

346
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,479
Hey, bud.

347
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,759
Beat it.

348
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,952
What are you laughing about?

349
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,112
- I thought that's how you did it.
- Did what?

350
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,475
Come on, Santy Claus.

351
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,271
You won't tell anybody, will you?

352
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,672
Not if you make it worth my while.
Free boonies for the duration.

353
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,512
That's fair.

354
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,835
Tell you what...
you get me through aerodynamics,

355
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,832
you can write your own ticket,
my friend.

356
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,592
You got a deal.

357
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,438
George Jones, where are you
when we need you most?

358
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,953
Hey, 2:00. Moving in. Della Serra.

359
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,674
Radar's up. Scoping the target area.

360
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,472
Zero in. Slick it back.

361
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,949
Who'll be the lucky Deb?
Is it the blonde? The brunette?

362
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,512
Score! He got her.

363
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,478
My God, check Perryman.

364
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,233
Five years of marriage,
still in love.

365
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,992
That's what life's all about.

366
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,517
Hey, Seeger!

367
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,110
Remember those bodacious tatas
and her pal?

368
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,634
Right there they are, bud.

369
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,474
We ought to do something about it.

370
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,192
Captain Graves, so nice to meet you.
The boys speak so highly of you.

371
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,714
Lynette,
he has several people to meet.

372
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,519
- I'm so sorry.
- Captain Rufferwell.

373
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,709
Mrs Rufferwell!

374
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,915
Hello, Captain.

375
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
How are you? Nice to meet you.

376
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,114
Could you introduce us
to these two young ladies, please?

377
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,599
Paula, Lynette.

378
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,713
Miss Paula Pokrifki,

379
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,518
Miss Lynette Pomeroy,

380
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,672
may I present
Officer Candidate Sid Worley

381
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,115
and Officer Candidate Zachary Mayo.

382
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,631
Well, I hope you have a good time.

383
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,559
We already met.

384
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,709
We did?

385
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,793
You said it would
grow an inch by now.

386
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,798
- That was you guys?
- Yeah.

387
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,037
Would you like to dance?

388
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,713
Sure.

389
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,318
It's grown out
more than an inch, pal.

390
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,555
Would you like to get a drink?

391
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,073
Sure.

392
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,673
Let's go.

393
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,200
What kind of a name is Pokrifki?

394
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,317
Polish. What kind of a name is Mayo?

395
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,675
Italian. My mom was Irish.

396
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,159
No, thank you.

397
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,674
I think I got her ears.

398
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,637
The rest is all wop.

399
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,995
Where are you from, Mayo the wop?

400
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,876
Everywhere, nowhere...

401
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,793
Paula the Polack.

402
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,033
Seriously.

403
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,680
Seriously. Seriously...

404
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,718
My father's a rear admiral,
seventh fleet.

405
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,279
You're kidding.

406
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,193
We lived in ports
all over the world...

407
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,910
- Kathmandu...Moscow, Nairobi.
- Really?

408
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,230
I've never been out of Washington.

409
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,355
Wait a minute.
You're kidding me, right?

410
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,637
We don't have any
naval bases in Moscow.

411
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,712
- No.
- No. I didn't think so.

412
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,630
So...you got a girl, Mayo the wop?

413
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,479
No.

414
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,070
I ain't looking for one either.

415
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,515
What are you looking for?

416
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,231
I've heard about these girls who
come here looking for a husband.

417
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,155
- Not me.
- Yeah? Why are you here?

418
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,869
To meet interesting people,
improve myself.

419
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,709
What do you do, go to school?

420
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,597
No, I got a job.

421
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,559
I work over at National Paper.
It's a real good job.

422
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,313
I'm going to save
enough money, travel.

423
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,278
Think I'd like to go to Moscow.

424
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,914
You been through
the Dilbert Dunker yet?

425
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,037
No, but my father and brother
made it through.

426
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,190
I guess I can, too.

427
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,430
Is your brother a flier?

428
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,193
He was. He got killed.

429
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,033
- Vietnam?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,628
My brother died over there, too.

431
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,756
He wasn't a flier though.

432
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,759
I was only 12 when it happened.

433
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,115
I don't remember
that much about him.

434
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,036
I sure remember Tommy.

435
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,270
Mind if we talk
about something else?

436
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,831
We don't have to talk
about anything at all.

437
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,950
Do you think you'll make it
to getting your wings?

438
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,795
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me
been dropping out like flies.

439
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,758
You got to say you're going to do it.

440
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,832
Got to programme yourself.
It'll happen.

441
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,480
You've just got to see
yourself making it.

442
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,791
I read this article
in Cosmo about that.

443
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,153
I swear.

444
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,399
Paula...you are a very,
very pretty girl.

445
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,553
Do you want to go somewhere else?

446
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,675
Come on.

447
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,439
Fall out, Worley.

448
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,516
Something tells me you girls
have been here before.

449
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,160
Whatever gave you that idea?

450
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,556
Stop it! You're going to ruin it.

451
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,834
I'm sorry.

452
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,672
I'll do it.

453
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,558
You sure this is OK?

454
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,076
Don't worry.
I'll respect you in the morning.

455
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,032
You're crazy, girl.

456
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,076
You'll respect me!

457
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,959
Couldn't wait to get out of there.

458
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,794
- Didn't you like the band?
- Not much.

459
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,189
You didn't like Tie a Yellow Ribbon?

460
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,032
I thought their rendition's...

461
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,955
Let's go down to the beach.

462
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,837
That sounds good.

463
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,872
Squad, halt!

464
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,318
Fall out!

465
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,874
Look at Foley. Do you believe it?

466
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,319
Showboat.

467
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,470
All right. Listen up.

468
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,358
I'm the base martial arts instructor.

469
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,989
Those of you in 1-5
must desist thinking of me

470
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,957
as the drill instructor for now.

471
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,157
Just think of me...as the enemy.

472
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,678
Do you believe this guy?

473
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,479
May I have a volunteer, please?

474
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,475
Daniels.

475
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,074
How about you? Get up here quick.

476
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,957
Put him in the hospital.

477
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,554
He can't touch me.
It's against the law.

478
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,234
- Kick his ass.
- Come on, Topper!

479
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,151
Come on up here, son.

480
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,553
Hang tough, buddy!

481
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,713
Hello, pussy.

482
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,955
How bad do you want to survive?

483
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,112
This Officer Candidate
doesn't understand the question, sir.

484
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,434
Let's see
if I can clarify it a little bit.

485
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,119
Want to survive
enough to stop me, pussy,

486
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,715
or are you relying on my generosity,
my love of humanity,

487
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,836
to stop me from killing you?

488
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,148
I...breathe.

489
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,071
Break loose.

490
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,595
Break loose!

491
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,591
I...can't...breathe.

492
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,797
Get away from here!

493
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,118
You're not hurt.
I could have killed you.

494
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,394
Move off.

495
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,392
Get out of here!

496
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,755
Hurry up. Get back to your seat!

497
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,431
You think I was harsh
on your classmate, don't you?

498
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,638
Wait until you get shot down
behind enemy lines somewhere,

499
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,678
and the only thing
between you and a POW Camp

500
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,035
is what you learn from me.

501
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,031
Now that I got your attention,

502
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,157
we shall proceed with the class.

503
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,474
God, I hope she shows.

504
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,028
She's going to show. She will show.

505
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,318
A rich, socialite Okie like you
ought to be a big catch around here.

506
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,753
Hey, I ain't rich.

507
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,990
- You're an officer's kid.
- So what?

508
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,196
Man, I spent six years

509
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,955
living right on top of the
raunchiest whorehouse in the PI.

510
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,469
"You want numbah one fucky-fucky?

511
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,594
"Long time, short time.
$10! Cheap-cheap!"

512
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,669
10 bucks?

513
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,637
"10 dollah. 10 dollah!"

514
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,714
Lynette, honey, how's it hanging?

515
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,916
Don't drool on her, boy.

516
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,957
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.

517
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,592
Pansy-ass flyboys.

518
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,073
I remember you. Mayo the wop.

519
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,872
Yep, that's me.

520
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,071
It's good to see you.

521
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,073
I was looking forward to it.

522
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,788
- Me, too.
- Really?

523
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,154
Yeah.

524
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,833
Excuse me.

525
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,915
You guys want to just hang out here,
or can I suggest an alternate plan?

526
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,837
Like pick up a bottle
and go to the motel?

527
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,672
Just like that, yeah.

528
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,199
What do you think?

529
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,830
I'll vote for a motel.

530
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,072
My kind of group.

531
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,312
Troy, here they come.

532
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,672
Well! Make way for the warmongers.

533
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,357
What did you call us?

534
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,796
I called you a warmonger.
Ain't that what you are?

535
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,199
Yeah, right.

536
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,835
I just want to ask you something.

537
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,672
What do you want?

538
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,357
You rich college boys come strutting
around in your ice cream outfits

539
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,510
like you own the goddamned place.

540
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,678
- I mean, who do you think you are?
- I don't want to fight you.

541
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,594
I do not want to fight.
Go back inside and cool down.

542
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,671
I ain't finished talking, sailor boy!

543
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,592
Get him, Troy.

544
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,795
Oh, God.

545
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,832
Back off, man. That's enough, man.

546
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,229
Holy shit! Check his nose!

547
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,916
He broke his nose, man.

548
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,275
- You asshole!
- Faggot!

549
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,879
Come on, come on.

550
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,919
God! I never seen anything
like that in my life.

551
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,353
Did you see his nose?

552
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,752
Lynette, will you just shut up
until we get to the motel? Please?

553
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,115
Well, excuse me for living.

554
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,632
Asshole!

555
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,632
I should have walked away.

556
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,393
Zack, he didn't give you a choice.

557
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,869
A man's always got a choice.

558
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,350
Where did you learn to fight?

559
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,874
I don't want to talk about it.

560
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,234
All right.

561
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,788
It wouldn't kill you
to open up to me.

562
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,712
What do you want? You want to fuck?

563
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,510
Come here. Take your clothes off.
I'll give you a good fuck.

564
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,999
Where's that coming from?

565
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,992
- Get on the bed.
- I wouldn't fuck you now...

566
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,150
Then get the hell out!

567
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,470
Who do you think you're talking to?

568
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,358
I'm not some whore
you brought in here.

569
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,398
I'm trying to be your friend, Zack.

570
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,074
Then be a friend. Get out of here.

571
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,515
Fine. Fine.

572
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,512
Man, you ain't nothing special.

573
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,068
No manners.
You treat women like whores.

574
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,199
If you ask me, you got no chance
of being no officer.

575
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,074
It's OK.

576
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,275
It's all right.

577
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,673
I'm sorry.

578
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,433
I'm sorry.

579
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,876
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm starved.

580
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,109
- Skivvies?
- Pretty sexy, huh?

581
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,237
- Sporty.
- Control yourself, baby.

582
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,279
Good!

583
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,908
Look, Paula...

584
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,711
I try real hard not to fool anybody
about who I am, what I want.

585
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,517
I know who you are and what you want.

586
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,955
And what do you want?

587
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,316
I want a good time until you leave.

588
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,356
That's it?

589
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,917
Hey!

590
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,073
- Last night was incredible.
- I thought so, too.

591
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,596
- Zack, am I your fantasy?
- What?

592
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,636
I'm not getting serious on you.

593
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,871
I dare you
not to fall in love with me.

594
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,394
How can you resist? I'm like candy.

595
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,791
You're better than candy.

596
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,555
It's going to be hard
to get enough, very hard.

597
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,073
Very hard!

598
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,754
You're getting feisty on me,
you little polack.

599
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,793
You cocky polack!

600
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,153
What do you do with a girl
when you're through with her?

601
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,390
You say something or just disappear?

602
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,751
I never had a girl.

603
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,954
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.

604
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,951
Any time, sailor.

605
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,831
Heads up, Perryman.
When you hit the water,

606
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,879
you might get the wind
knocked out of you. Don't panic.

607
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,757
You've got a second and a half

608
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,276
before the cage is completely
underwater and upside down.

609
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,552
Go, Joe!

610
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,954
Now, the most important thing
is to watch your bubbles.

611
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,758
When that cage flips upside down,
you'll be disoriented.

612
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,310
You won't know what your bearings
are, like Perryman down there.

613
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,631
The bubbles determine
which way is up.

614
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,157
All right, time's up.
Go down for him.

615
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,910
This is what happens if you panic.

616
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,992
You can die there,
and this is a pool.

617
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,312
Out in the pacific, you won't
have a frogman to save your ass.

618
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,436
Totally unsatisfactory, Perryman.

619
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,636
Do it again.

620
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,596
Two more chances to make it,
or you're out.

621
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,193
All right. Next!

622
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,316
Hold it. Change in order.

623
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,394
Mayo...since you're hotshot
of the week, you're next.

624
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,833
Aye, aye, sir.

625
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,912
- Seeger, you're behind him.
- Yes, sir.

626
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,313
You ought to be good at this, Mayo.
Something you can do alone.

627
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,594
Take him up!

628
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,797
You never know
when you'll trip up, Mayo.

629
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,551
It could be some character flaw
that comes out under stress.

630
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,873
Let's go, Joe!

631
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,038
All right! Way to go!

632
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,236
OK, Seeger. You're next.

633
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,198
All right, Seeger, let's go.
Get a move on.

634
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,632
Joe, take her up!

635
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,235
Don't you cry, sugar britches!

636
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,518
Go, Joe!

637
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,076
All right, Seeger!

638
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,639
All right.

639
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,710
Gosh, that was great!
Think they'd let us do it again?

640
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,950
Not bad, Seeger. But you still
got to get over that wall.

641
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,958
Next!

642
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,598
Daniels, move it.

643
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,557
It's just a joy ride.

644
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,192
Does this hit with a plane's impact?

645
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,316
It's nothing compared to a plane.

646
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,631
Don't forget to watch the bubbles.

647
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,073
Take him up!

648
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,037
All right, Daniels.
Let's have that thumbs up.

649
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,318
Come on. Where's the thumbs up at?

650
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,238
All right. Go, Joe!

651
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,233
Take it easy.

652
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,914
Pull it up!

653
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,396
Can't get it!
It's gonna take a couple of seconds.

654
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,758
Let me through!

655
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,749
Grab him!

656
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,318
All right. Pull him out!

657
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,109
Hold him!

658
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,714
Put him on his stomach!

659
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,119
Take his helmet off!

660
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,919
- God damn!
- Get it off.

661
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,993
Christ! He killed himself.

662
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,992
Somebody get me a corpsman.
On the double!

663
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,115
Yes, sir!

664
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,468
OK, everybody just stand back.

665
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,754
Come on, Topper.

666
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,876
- God!
- Come on.

667
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,632
Come on, buddy.

668
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,358
Come on, man.

669
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,759
Come on, Topper.

670
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,831
Come on. Come on.

671
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,353
Breathe in.

672
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,469
Hey!

673
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,629
All right.

674
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,717
All right!

675
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,152
All right.

676
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,390
That corpsman on the way?

677
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,828
Stand back. Give him room. Get back.

678
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,476
Somebody go check on that corpsman.

679
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,120
He'll be all right. Take it easy.

680
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,037
Prepare for inspection!

681
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,154
Shit.

682
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,674
I am not going to make it.

683
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,992
Help me out, Sid.

684
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,231
- Got a spare?
- My spare sucks.

685
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,993
You know where the hardware store is.

686
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,072
Zack, I need a buckle, man.

687
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,512
I can't risk it.

688
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,556
You got time. He's with the girls.

689
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,278
Can't do it.

690
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,319
I got to see my family.
I've got to get out this weekend.

691
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,154
Wouldn't want you to get
an honour violation, Perryman.

692
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,959
OK.

693
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,597
Attention on deck!

694
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,836
In every class, there's one joker
who thinks he's smarter than me.

695
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:15,556
In this class, that happens
to be you...isn't it, Mayonnaise?

696
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,390
Perryman, Worley...
let us have this room.

697
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,118
On the double.

698
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,998
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
- Stow it.

699
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,514
Mayo...

700
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,431
I want you DOR.

701
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,433
No, sir.

702
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,080
You can kick me out,
I ain't quitting.

703
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,152
Get into your fatigues, Mayo.

704
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,037
By the end of this weekend,
you'll quit.

705
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,434
Casey Jones was a son of a bitch!

706
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,914
Drove his train in a 30-foot ditch!

707
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,748
Came on out with his dick in his hand

708
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,070
Said, "Listen, ladies,
I'm a hell of a man."

709
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,392
Went to his room and lined up 100.

710
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,149
Swore up and down
he'd fuck every one.

711
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,074
Fucked 98
till his balls turned blue.

712
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,755
Then he backed off, jacked off,
and fucked the other two!

713
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,633
Wave goodbye to your buddies.
I forgot. You don't have buddies.

714
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,392
Only customers.

715
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,876
You having fun, Mayonnaise?

716
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,069
Yes, sir!

717
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,991
- Don't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

718
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,035
All right!

719
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,992
98...

720
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,509
99...

721
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,672
Get your face
all the way down in there!

722
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,634
100.

723
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,953
- Ready to quit now, Mayo?
- No, sir!

724
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,238
Look over there, Mayo.

725
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,432
Look at her.

726
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,752
She decided to stay instead
of taking liberty this weekend.

727
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,674
She may not make it, but
she's got more heart and character

728
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,159
than you'll ever have!

729
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,037
And stop eyeballing me, boy!

730
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,557
Life's dealt you some shitty
cards, hasn't it?

731
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,949
I'm doing all right, sir!

732
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,868
6...

733
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,555
Bullshit. I done some checking.

734
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,517
I looked through your files.

735
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,513
I know about your mama.
Don't you eyeball me.

736
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,956
I know your father's an alcoholic
and a whore chaser.

737
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,715
That's why you don't mesh, Mayo.

738
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,395
Because deep down...
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

739
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,709
Deep down inside...

740
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,792
you know the others
are better than you!

741
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,632
Isn't that right, Mayo?

742
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,871
No, sir! No, sir!

743
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,071
What's the matter? You getting tired?
I'm not tired.

744
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,878
Move it, boy!

745
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,315
This is where the fun starts!

746
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,474
Move it!

747
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,791
You got all day tomorrow
to look forward to!

748
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,590
6 inches off the ground.
Give me 6 to 90.

749
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,835
Hey, Mayo, why don't we quit
this little charade

750
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,559
over a couple of beers at TJ's?

751
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,315
You're as close
to being officer material as me.

752
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,710
This candidate believes
he would make a good officer!

753
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,999
You only give a shit about yourself.
All your classmates know it.

754
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,073
Do you think they would trust you
behind the controls of a plane?

755
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,393
You'd probably zipp off in my F-14
and sell it to the Cubans.

756
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,233
No, sir! No, sir! I love my country.

757
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,198
Sell it to the air force, Mayo.

758
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,957
Why would a slick hustler like you
sign up for this abuse?

759
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,758
I want to fly jets.

760
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,831
My grandmama wants to fly jets.

761
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,558
I've always wanted it!

762
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,552
We're not talking about flying.
We're talking about character.

763
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,118
I've changed, sir.

764
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,158
- The hell you have.
- I've changed, sir!

765
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,677
You've just polished your act.
You've shined it up!

766
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,639
Tell me what I want to hear.
I want your DOR.

767
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,598
I ain't going to quit.

768
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,717
- Spell it! D-O-R.
- I ain't gonna quit!

769
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,873
Then you and your daddy can get drunk
and go whore-chasing together!

770
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,554
No, sir! I ain't going to quit!

771
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,359
Then forget it. You're out!

772
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,112
Don't you do it!

773
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,872
Don't...you...

774
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,075
I got nowhere else to go!

775
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,074
I got nowhere else to go!

776
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,077
I ain't got nothing else.

777
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,311
I got nothing else.

778
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,394
All right, Mayo. On your feet.

779
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,238
Come on, Mayo,
let's get back to the barracks.

780
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,231
Hey, Foley!

781
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,313
Zack, don't give up!
You got that queer on the run!

782
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,231
Kiss this, Foley!

783
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,118
Hang in there, Zack!
Remember the Tides Inn.

784
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,599
Those friends of yours?

785
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,513
- Don't give up, Mayo!
- Yes, sir.

786
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,318
We're with you, Zack!

787
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,550
Zack, you can make it!

788
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,834
You got some urinals to clean.

789
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,319
Move out.

790
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,632
Hey, Foley's queer!
He got his balls shot off in the war!

791
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,429
You're still here, Mayo?

792
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,759
- Sid.
- Yeah?

793
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,268
Thanks.

794
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,793
Sid.

795
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,593
Look at that.

796
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,432
That son of a bitch.

797
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,750
Want me to get a towel?

798
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,877
I'll get one.

799
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,190
I don't want you to move.

800
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,914
Somebody's got to move sometime...
eventually.

801
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,389
"They found them there weeks later,

802
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,392
"shrivelled from lack
of food and water."

803
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,153
Bye, Zachary.

804
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,594
I laughed all week, thinking
about you guys on that boat.

805
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,596
We were so drunk.

806
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,114
Pretty sharp, Paula. Pretty sharp.

807
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,150
I'd love to be one of those girls

808
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,470
they're letting in
the flight programme.

809
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,949
It would be a gas to fly.

810
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,553
What's stopping you?

811
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,358
You know what those magazines say.
It's just...

812
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,353
I don't know.
It's not so easy for a girl.

813
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,115
That's still no excuse
for not getting what you want.

814
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,873
Just go get it.

815
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,956
Who says I'm not going
after what I want?

816
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,993
Not me.

817
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,950
My mama's 39 years old.

818
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,074
She still works over at that factory.

819
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,237
Every time I look at her,
I know exactly what I don't want.

820
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,877
My old lady...

821
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,158
took a bottle of pills one day
when I was at school.

822
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,468
Oh, God.

823
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,034
The thing that got me about it...

824
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,913
She didn't leave a note.
She didn't...

825
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,675
Nothing. She just checked out.

826
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,076
I always hated her for that.

827
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,636
Oh, God. That must really hurt.

828
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,275
Hurt? No. No.

829
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,271
You're all alone in the world.

830
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,194
Once you got that down,
nothing hurts anymore.

831
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,117
I bet most people buy that line
when you feed it to them.

832
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,035
Hey, are you really serious
about having him over?

833
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,680
I haven't made up my mind yet.

834
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,514
Paula...just how far
would you go to get Zack?

835
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,115
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

836
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,873
Would you let yourself get pregnant?

837
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,275
No way, Lynette. Would you?

838
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:06,674
Well...I never used to think
I'd do something like that.

839
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,398
But I don't know anymore.

840
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,554
Nine weeks just ain't long enough
for a guy to fall in love with you.

841
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,428
That doesn't justify trapping him
or getting pregnant.

842
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,512
I can't believe you'd think that.
It's real backward.

843
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,750
It ain't any more backward

844
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,675
than the way these hotshot assholes
use us till they've had enough,

845
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,149
then ditch us like we's trash.

846
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,669
Don't you ever feel used, Paula?

847
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,914
Don't you feel the sons of bitches
ought to be paying for our troubles?

848
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,356
No. I never feel like that.

849
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,752
Well, I do.

850
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,396
Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.

851
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,552
It was my pleasure.

852
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,632
Those are the most beautiful
things I've ever saw.

853
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,755
Wipe that stuff off your mouth.

854
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,948
Zack?

855
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,278
This is great.

856
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,228
Sir?

857
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,594
How many more weeks till graduation?

858
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,148
Three more. Three more weeks.

859
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,316
Those are the roughest, aren't they?

860
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,356
That's what they tell me.

861
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,353
Sir, why are you staring at my food?

862
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,470
Or are you staring at me?

863
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,676
Staring at you.

864
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,514
He doesn't mean anything by it.
Do you, Joe?

865
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,675
No, I don't mean anything by it.

866
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,351
- Like some more chicken, Zack?
- No. No, thanks.

867
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,593
I've had it.
I can't eat another bite.

868
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,511
I'm stuffed, too.

869
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,354
This is the best meal
I've had in a long time.

870
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,876
Let's go, Zack. Thank you, Mama.

871
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,554
- Thank you, Zack.
- Thanks again, ma'am.

872
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,513
Go on and eat.

873
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,238
Mama, Mama, Mama!

874
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,153
I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed, Zack.

875
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,435
I shouldn't have brought you here.

876
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,872
That's OK. A great free meal.
A nice, relaxing dinner.

877
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,156
Those people are so uptight.
I felt so sorry for you.

878
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,233
Don't. I'm used to it.
It's hereditary.

879
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:12,314
After this, you go to basic flight
which is in Pensacola, right?

880
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,868
Yeah, Pensacola.

881
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,759
And...going to Beeville, Texas,
when I get jets.

882
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,278
So, after that...
don't you think about...

883
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,148
I mean, come on... What's after that?

884
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,074
Family, kids...
Don't you think about all that?

885
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,120
No.

886
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,351
- Is that what you think about?
- Sometimes.

887
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,393
If I could do a better job than them,
I'd love it.

888
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,310
And what would you do different?

889
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,194
Everything.

890
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,758
First, I'd marry a man
I really loved.

891
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,678
So why did your mom marry this guy
if she didn't love him?

892
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,593
My real father wouldn't marry her.

893
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,796
- Your real father?
- My real father.

894
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,348
I want to show you my real father.

895
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,833
Pop.

896
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,992
Your real father
was an Officers Candidate like me?

897
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,513
- About 22 years ago.
- Jesus.

898
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,633
No wonder this guy was looking
at me funny.

899
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,551
He always looks funny.

900
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,158
It's about time
I got back to the wars.

901
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,071
Yeah, I know, I know.

902
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,110
Thank your mom for dinner, OK?

903
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,033
- Great chicken, huh?
- I loved the chicken.

904
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,269
If you get a chance,
why don't you call me?

905
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,070
I have survival training this week,
so I can't make any promises.

906
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,639
No promises.

907
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,192
I didn't have to show you
that picture if I didn't want to.

908
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:20,239
- I wanted to tell you that.
- I know. Bye, baby.

909
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,792
- Be careful on that.
- Yeah.

910
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,389
You and Paula still seeing
those flight candidates?

911
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,630
Any reason we wouldn't be?

912
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,430
It's 3:40 and you haven't said
what you're doing this weekend.

913
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,952
Hi. I'd like to speak with Zack Mayo.
He's an AOC candidate.

914
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,877
Could you look for him?
Tell him it's Paula.

915
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,554
Liberty time, boys and girls.

916
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,032
Fall out!

917
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,872
Aye, aye, sir!

918
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,112
- Where you going? Where's my bread?
- Forget that thing.

919
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,918
Come on, Perryman. Come on.

920
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,197
- Seeger, don't forget TJ's.
- I won't.

921
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,590
Hey, Mayo! You got a phone call.
Somebody named Paula.

922
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,392
Tell her I already split.

923
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,195
I see. OK.

924
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,356
Comes a time
right after survival training,

925
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,398
they start thinking
they can make it without you.

926
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,789
Suddenly, they stop calling.

927
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,394
Suddenly, they own the goddamn world.

928
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,229
They said that he already left.

929
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,629
I don't think he did.

930
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,393
He hasn't called by now,
he won't call.

931
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,790
Bunny, just shut up!
You don't know so much.

932
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,711
Clock me out, Lynette.

933
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,268
Paula, what are you doing?

934
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,193
May they all crash and burn.

935
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,155
- Paula, wait! Where are you going?
- Let me go, Mama.

936
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,152
You're going to look for Zack.
Don't do it.

937
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,913
I love him. I can't let him go.

938
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,638
How will you stop him?

939
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,836
I don't know,
but I'll think of a way.

940
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,717
- No!
- No?

941
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:03,432
I can't let you do this.
Don't go. Please, don't go.

942
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,670
What are you crying about?

943
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,349
Cos I know what you're feeling!

944
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,069
- What am I feeling?
- Don't do it. Let him go.

945
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,594
Don't trick him or trap him.

946
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,639
I wouldn't do that.
I'd never try to trap him.

947
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,998
If you find him,
you'll say anything. You will.

948
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,913
And God help you after that.

949
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,877
Mama, you're right.

950
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,754
Daddy, Zack's 2/10 of a second
off the obstacle course record.

951
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,796
He'll break it before he leaves.

952
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,190
Lucky you weren't
in the programme when I was.

953
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,556
You couldn't quit
the way you can now.

954
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,757
When I and my oldest boy
went through it,

955
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,752
you bilged out, you became a swabby.

956
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,274
That's real interesting, sir.

957
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,909
How come you haven't written
Susan in over three weeks?

958
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,555
We haven't had time to write anybody.
I've only written y'all once.

959
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,312
It's incredible.

960
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,878
- Right?
- Yeah.

961
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,755
- Who is this Susan?
- My girl back home.

962
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,150
I'm marrying her
as soon I get out of here.

963
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,599
She was Tommy's girl.

964
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,990
They were supposed to get
married before he got killed.

965
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,396
I didn't want you to think
I was a shit for fucking Lynette.

966
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,471
Man, I ain't your parents.

967
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,151
Do you love this girl?

968
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,630
Greatest chick you'll ever know.
She loves kids.

969
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,917
Works with handicapped kids
every afternoon.

970
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,951
That ain't what I'm talking about.
I asked you if you loved her.

971
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,634
Everybody loves her.

972
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,395
- I won't make that reunion tonight.
- Why not?

973
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,389
I'm meeting Lynette at the Tides.

974
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,510
Best head in 52 states.
What can I do?

975
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,038
No, no, no.

976
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,237
You should've done what I did...
break it off clean,

977
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,108
have it done with, over.
It's the best.

978
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,953
She was torn up you didn't call her.

979
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,395
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

980
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,875
Women. Women, women, women.

981
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,192
They say, "A lot of laughs,
no problems."

982
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,513
Doesn't work that way, does it?

983
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,919
Look out, TJ's! Here I come.

984
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,437
See you later, man.

985
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,556
I don't know
what you're smiling about, Perryman.

986
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,392
You're lucky you're here.

987
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,029
- What are you talking about?
- I still taste that bug.

988
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,429
A toast. We made it. To survival.

989
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,398
- To survival.
- To survival.

990
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,118
In spite of Perryman.

991
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,551
In spite of Foley.

992
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,350
Is that your Deb over there?

993
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,309
She's pulling rank on you.
That's a flight instructor.

994
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,308
Back in a minute.

995
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,756
What are you doing here?

996
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,315
It was time for me to see
the legendary TJ's

997
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,356
once before I left here.

998
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,118
You come here a lot?

999
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,555
I come here once in a while.

1000
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,994
I'm sorry I didn't call you
this weekend.

1001
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,275
This week has been unbelievable.

1002
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,679
It's OK.

1003
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,751
How did the survival training go?

1004
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,434
- I survived.
- You survived. Obviously.

1005
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,193
How was your week?

1006
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,157
It was good.

1007
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,959
I'm getting a raise
beginning of next month.

1008
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,553
That's great.

1009
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,600
You're graduating in a couple weeks?

1010
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,314
Yeah.

1011
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,233
I'm starting to believe I'll make it.

1012
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,992
You'll make it.

1013
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,516
I told you -
you saw it, and it happened.

1014
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,477
Yeah, you told me.

1015
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,750
I got to go, I have a date. So...

1016
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,478
Look, there's something I wanted...

1017
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,240
What?

1018
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,754
I...I wanted to thank you.

1019
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,994
I wouldn't have made it
through this crazy thing

1020
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,958
if I didn't have something
to look forward to.

1021
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,396
Don't thank me for nothing.
I had a good time.

1022
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,756
Good luck in Pensacola
with your flight training, and...

1023
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,791
Get jets, huh?

1024
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,592
I'll see you, Zack.

1025
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,198
Give me another one.

1026
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,114
In fact, give me the bottle.

1027
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,035
Come here, baby doll.

1028
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,519
Come here.

1029
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,157
Come over here.

1030
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,711
Sit down for a second.
I'll tell you something.

1031
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,469
Had to have one more taste.

1032
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,678
This stuff come in anything
besides strawberry?

1033
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,558
I'll bring some coconut next time.

1034
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,033
Sid...l've really got to go.

1035
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:18,474
Shouldn't you have
got your period by now?

1036
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,710
I'm a little late, that's all.

1037
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,595
How late are you?

1038
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,033
Why? What's the difference?

1039
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,796
If anything happened,
it would be my responsibility.

1040
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,755
Now, just exactly how late are you?

1041
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,276
What do you care?
Suppose I was to get pregnant.

1042
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,718
Just suppose. I'd never make you do
something you didn't want to do.

1043
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,234
I know.

1044
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,711
But that's not the only issue here.
There's more to it than that.

1045
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,995
What other issue is there, Sid?

1046
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,591
My responsibility as its father,
for one thing.

1047
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,310
If I've got you pregnant,
I'll do the right thing by you.

1048
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,872
I'll pay for the abortion,
be with you through it, comfort you.

1049
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,838
We'd go through it together.

1050
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,157
So how late are you?

1051
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,673
Let's just wait
and see what happens, OK?

1052
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,273
See you later.

1053
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,228
I'll call you.

1054
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,275
Fuck!

1055
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,871
Last chance for the record!

1056
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,353
Go!

1057
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,155
This is it, Mayonnaise. Go!

1058
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,828
Come on!

1059
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,117
Go for it, Mayo!
Go get it! You got it!

1060
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,391
Go, Mayo! Push it!

1061
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,313
Put your name on that wall!

1062
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,390
Mike, let's catch that animal!

1063
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,838
Let's do this together, Seeger.

1064
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,955
- Come on, Seeger.
- Forget it, just go for the record.

1065
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,832
Come on! You got it!

1066
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,113
Come on, man!

1067
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,270
Hey! Where you going?

1068
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,635
- Seeger, get up.
- Forget it.

1069
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,475
You want jets? Then get up!
You're going over! Right here!

1070
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,036
Three steps. Right, left, right.

1071
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,509
Hand over hand. Walk the wall.

1072
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,194
- Come on, Seeger.
- Ready? Let's go!

1073
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,637
Left, right, pull!
Walk that wall, Seeger! Walk it!

1074
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,156
Hand over hand!
Hand over hand! Walk it! Walk it!

1075
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,074
Walk the wall! Seeger! Seeger, walk!

1076
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,912
Seeger!

1077
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,597
Don't you let go! You walk that wall!
Pull! Pull! Pull, Candidate Seeger!

1078
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,992
Pull! One leg! You got it!
Pull over! Pull over!

1079
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,311
Pull yourself over! All right!

1080
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,073
Where's Sid?

1081
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,430
What makes you think she's not lying?

1082
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,592
She went to a doctor. She's pregnant.

1083
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,591
So get an abortion.

1084
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,468
I'd love to, believe me.
She won't even talk about it.

1085
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,959
She's Catholic.

1086
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,838
You're not marrying this girl.

1087
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,313
If I don't, she'll have the baby
on her own somewhere.

1088
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,356
Women do it all the time.

1089
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,230
I can't let her have a kid
by herself. It's my kid, too.

1090
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,912
You sure?

1091
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,873
It's mine.

1092
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,718
I'm sorry, all right?

1093
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,273
What if Foley was right?
She got knocked up to trap you.

1094
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,078
Is it still your responsibility?

1095
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,593
That's not the point.

1096
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,593
No matter how it happened,
the child would still be mine.

1097
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,240
I wouldn't know
where it was or nothing.

1098
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,039
Jesus Christ!
Is everything your responsibility?

1099
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,837
Sit. Adjust. Pray. Attack.

1100
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,274
It's like your brother
getting killed.

1101
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:25,036
It's the same damn thing -
him getting killed instead of you.

1102
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,634
That's why you promised
to marry Susan.

1103
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:31,759
You do everything
out of some bullshit code of ethics.

1104
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,960
It may be bullshit to you,
but I wasn't raised that way!

1105
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,554
We're responsible
for the people in our lives.

1106
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,313
That's all that separates us
from the animals!

1107
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,118
I'm not like you, Mayo.

1108
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,636
I can't shit on people
and sleep at night.

1109
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,029
I say you're responsible
to yourself first.

1110
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,838
If you can't handle that,

1111
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,832
you got bigger problems
than making some girl pregnant!

1112
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,990
Gentlemen, relax.

1113
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,633
Without an oxygen mask
at 30,000 feet,

1114
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,473
your insides will feel
like this rubber glove.

1115
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,152
Your coordination deteriorates.

1116
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,038
Even the most childlike exercises
seem impossible.

1117
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,236
Look for the warning signs -

1118
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,675
giddiness, shortness of breath,
claustrophobia.

1119
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,115
They can hit you at any moment.

1120
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,749
The instant you feel yourself
losing control, go back on oxygen.

1121
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,876
That's the purpose of this drill.

1122
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,030
Does everyone understand
the exercises?

1123
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:43,350
OK, everybody set?
Let's see a thumbs up, please.

1124
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,317
Very good. Everybody remove
your mask, please.

1125
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,472
All right. Begin the exercises now.

1126
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,874
Queen of diamonds.

1127
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,112
Nine of diamonds.

1128
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,514
If you have any problems,
put your mask on.

1129
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:10,875
If you can't, raise your hand,
and the corpsman will assist you.

1130
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,635
How you doing, Mayo and Seeger?
Having a little trouble?

1131
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,594
Concentrate.
Try to make your palms meet.

1132
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,793
Ace of spades.

1133
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,236
How you doing down there, Worley?

1134
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,878
Worley, are you all right?

1135
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,512
- Worley, can you hear me?
- Ace of spades.

1136
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,795
Worley, put your mask back on,
please.

1137
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,632
Put your mask back on!

1138
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,995
- Sid, you OK?
- Sid!

1139
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,718
I got to get out.

1140
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,395
Worley, sit down.
Corpsman, we got a problem.

1141
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,710
I got to get out of here!

1142
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,631
Corpsman, get that mask on.

1143
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,994
It's all right.

1144
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,269
Get out of here!
It's all right. Breathe! Breathe!

1145
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,430
Mayo, they're watching!

1146
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,990
We're going
to stabilise the pressure.

1147
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,116
It's OK. All right. Everything's OK.

1148
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,236
Everybody's watching you. Hold on.

1149
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,790
We'll stabilise the pressure now.
Man the doors. One minute.

1150
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,394
Stay where you are.
Leave your masks on!

1151
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,232
- He's got it.
- He's fine.

1152
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,199
He's OK. No problem. He's OK.

1153
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,999
Colours!

1154
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,639
Secure the halyard!

1155
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,951
Charlie, take care of that.

1156
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,513
What's going on?

1157
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,670
You didn't kick him out?

1158
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,918
Did he tell you what
he's been going through?

1159
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,877
It doesn't matter.

1160
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,829
What does matter is that
he freaked out at 25,000 feet.

1161
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,672
That can't happen ever.

1162
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,479
He's got a girl who's pregnant.

1163
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,118
That don't matter.

1164
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,590
Don't matter?
You've got two weeks left!

1165
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,831
That can happen to you,
too, Mayonnaise.

1166
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,876
He ain't bullshitting you, buddy.

1167
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,269
I'm talking to you, motherfucker!

1168
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,072
Don't fuck for you!

1169
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,071
What did you call me?

1170
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,594
I thought the DI's
were supposed to help.

1171
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,194
What kind of a human being are you?

1172
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,953
Lock it up or you'll go with him.

1173
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,235
Go back to the barracks. Please?

1174
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,479
I don't get this.
He's the best candidate in the class!

1175
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,190
The best student, the best leader...
the best friend to everybody.

1176
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,748
Can't you bend your goddamn rules?

1177
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,196
He didn't ask me to DOR.
I went to him.

1178
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,998
What are you talking about?

1179
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,993
I'm glad it's over.
I was here for everybody but me.

1180
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,675
I was here for my big brother.

1181
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,479
Hey, buddy.

1182
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,952
Sid, wait a minute. Sid!

1183
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,514
Request permission to carry on...

1184
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,069
Sir!

1185
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,991
Get the fuck out of here.

1186
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,158
- Yes, sir. Keep the change.
- Thanks, pal.

1187
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,954
Lynette!

1188
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,030
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Sid.

1189
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,553
Come here a minute.

1190
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,029
What are you doing out of uniform?

1191
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,157
- I got something.
- Wait. I look a mess.

1192
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,879
All right, then.
If you don't want it...

1193
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,391
All right. What?

1194
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,716
- Well, if you don't want it.
- What?

1195
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,351
Oh, my God!

1196
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,196
Oh, my God. It's beautiful!

1197
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,999
It cost my savings,
but what the fuck?

1198
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,878
Oh, God! Sid!

1199
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,356
So...does this mean...

1200
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,591
Yes, ma'am! That's what it means!

1201
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,077
Oh, Sid!

1202
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,197
Let's do it right now!

1203
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,078
I wonder where we'll get stationed?

1204
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:56,470
I've always wanted to go to Hawaii!

1205
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,916
Honey, we're not being
stationed anywhere. I DOR'd.

1206
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,949
- You what?
- I DOR'd.

1207
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,394
I wasn't cut out to be a pilot.

1208
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,029
I was faking it. I've been
faking everything up to now.

1209
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,036
But...

1210
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,475
What'll we do? Where would we go?

1211
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,559
Oklahoma.

1212
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,712
I'll get my old job
back at JC Penney's.

1213
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,439
Hell, in two years,
I'll be floor manager.

1214
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:30,912
You're going to love Oklahoma.
You and mama will get along great.

1215
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,958
Money might be tight,
so we'll live at home.

1216
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,792
It's going to work out.

1217
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,713
Sid... There's no baby.

1218
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,673
What?

1219
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,598
I'm not pregnant.

1220
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,596
I got my period this morning.

1221
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,589
There's no baby, Sid.

1222
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,837
I'll be goddamned.

1223
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,836
What do you say
we get married anyway?

1224
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,388
I love you!

1225
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:32,268
I don't think I really knew
that till just now, just this second.

1226
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:38,559
I have never been happier in my life
than I have in the last seven weeks.

1227
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,596
I've never felt so relaxed,

1228
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,468
and I've never felt so loved
for who I really am.

1229
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,759
Lynette, marry me.

1230
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,798
Make me the happiest man
in the whole world.

1231
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,431
I'm sorry, Sid.

1232
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,636
But I don't want to marry you.

1233
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,157
I really like you,

1234
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:24,312
and we've had ourselves
some really great times,

1235
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,356
but I thought you understood.

1236
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,596
I want to marry a pilot.

1237
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:34,959
I want to live my life overseas...
the wife of an aviator!

1238
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,759
Damn you!

1239
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,473
Goddamn you!

1240
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:50,110
Nobody DORs after 11 weeks!

1241
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,077
Nobody!

1242
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:09,556
Hi, ma'am.
Have you seen Paula around?

1243
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,589
Paula!

1244
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,477
I'm looking for Sid. He DOR'd
and split. Nobody's seen him since.

1245
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,028
I don't know where to look.

1246
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,711
- Same room?
- Yes, sir.

1247
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,350
Number three.

1248
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,874
Yep. That's the one.

1249
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,993
- What do you think of this?
- Looks nice.

1250
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,914
Watch this. I think you'll like it.

1251
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,793
Damn it!

1252
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,873
Shit.

1253
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,188
Lynette.

1254
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,952
- Has Sid been here?
- Already come and gone.

1255
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,993
What happened?

1256
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,437
Can you believe it?
He DOR'd in the 12th week.

1257
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,832
How can you win?

1258
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,597
Lynette...

1259
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,351
What did you tell him about the baby?

1260
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,716
That there isn't one...as of today.

1261
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,476
I got my period this morning.

1262
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,834
I couldn't believe it.
He still wanted to marry me.

1263
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,310
- What did you say?
- I said no, of course.

1264
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:46,032
I don't want no Okie from Muskogee.
I can get that right here.

1265
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,951
You little bitch.

1266
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:54,075
Who do you think you are, playing
with people like that? He loves you!

1267
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,912
You shit on him!

1268
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,198
You made up everything, didn't you?
There wasn't any baby.

1269
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:05,400
Of course there was a baby!
I'd never lie about that!

1270
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,718
Would I, Paula?

1271
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,512
You little cunt.

1272
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,472
God help you.

1273
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,560
You're no different than I am, Paula.

1274
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:31,677
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not!

1275
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,072
- Let me see if he's here, OK?
- All right.

1276
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:01,074
Seen Sid Worley around here?

1277
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,152
Yeah, he's here.

1278
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,759
Sid.

1279
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,708
Sid.

1280
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,870
Guy said he just got here.

1281
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,754
Sid.

1282
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,708
Sid?

1283
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,399
Hey, man.

1284
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,392
Sid, you OK?

1285
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,993
Sid.

1286
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,513
Shit!

1287
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,913
God.

1288
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,119
Call an ambulance.

1289
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,034
God.

1290
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,833
Call an ambulance.

1291
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:35,519
You dumb, fucking Okie.
I was your friend.

1292
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,634
Why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

1293
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,836
You didn't even try.

1294
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,033
You didn't even say goodbye to me.

1295
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,239
The base Chaplain said
he'd call Sid's parents.

1296
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,788
Why can't I learn?

1297
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,838
Just like her all over again.
Just like her.

1298
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:47,198
Zack, don't do this to yourself.
You didn't kill your mother.

1299
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,636
You didn't kill Sid.
They killed themselves.

1300
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,280
There's nothing
you could have done about it.

1301
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,558
I got to leave.
Want money for a cab or something?

1302
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,551
I don't deserve that.

1303
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,993
OK. All right.

1304
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,833
You're not the only one
that's feeling awful.

1305
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,436
Maybe I had something to do with it.
I knew what Lynette was doing.

1306
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:16,311
Look, you got no problems!
Another class will come through soon.

1307
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,834
You and Lynette...
right back into business!

1308
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,596
That's not fair. I never lied to you.
I never did what Lynette's doing.

1309
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:26,637
- I'm not Lynette.
- No.

1310
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:31,394
I love you.
I've loved you since I met you.

1311
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,997
Don't you understand?

1312
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:40,750
No! I don't want you to love me!
I don't want anyone to love me.

1313
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,512
I just want out!

1314
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,636
I don't know, but it's been said!

1315
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,030
Air Force wings are made of lead!

1316
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,436
Left, right, left, right,
column right.

1317
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,999
Turn!

1318
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,877
I don't know, but I've been told.

1319
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,917
Navy wings are made of gold!

1320
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,639
Platoon...

1321
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,869
Halt!

1322
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:16,954
Sir, this Officer Candidate requests
permission to speak in private, sir!

1323
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,316
The whole class knows about Worley.
We're sorry.

1324
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,311
I bet you are.
I want to see you in private, sir.

1325
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,994
- Not now. I'm busy.
- Now!

1326
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,640
- Forward...
- Sir, I request permission...

1327
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,996
Right, left. Right, left.
Right, left...left...

1328
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:39,392
Sir, this candidate requests
permission to see you in private!

1329
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:43,029
- Sir!
- Not now. I'm busy. Get cleaned up.

1330
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,072
I don't need your shit!
I came back to quit! DOR!

1331
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,116
Platoon...halt!

1332
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:54,670
I don't need you.
I don't need the Navy!

1333
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,432
I don't need anybody.

1334
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,988
OK, Mayo. I see what you want.

1335
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,709
You said you wanted
to meet me in private?

1336
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:07,110
You got it! The blimp hangar. Now!

1337
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,714
- Move it!
- You move it.

1338
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:12,712
We ain't going there to talk, boy.

1339
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:13,915
Move!

1340
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,909
Fall out.

1341
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,400
Fall out! This is between me and him.

1342
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,752
All right, Mayo.

1343
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,277
Let's see what you got.

1344
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,192
Quiet.

1345
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,038
You've had training, Mayon...

1346
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,952
- Come on, Foley.
- Lookie, lookie here.

1347
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,517
Your blood's as red as mine,
isn't it, Mayo?

1348
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,429
Come on, come on. Get up!

1349
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,359
Holy!

1350
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,915
You can quit now, if you want to.

1351
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,517
It's up to you.

1352
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,834
Sir, the officers are present.

1353
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,239
Guests, please rise.

1354
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:43,155
Class 1581, raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

1355
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,992
"I do solemnly swear...

1356
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,513
"that I will support and defend

1357
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,995
"the constitution
of the United States of America...

1358
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,280
"against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

1359
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,719
"That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

1360
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,230
"That I take this
obligation freely...

1361
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,678
"without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion.

1362
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,108
"That I will well
and faithfully discharge...

1363
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,309
"the duties of office
I am about to enter.

1364
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,393
"So help me God."

1365
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,633
Please, be seated.

1366
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,270
- Gunnery Sergeant Foley.
- Sir!

1367
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,718
Well done, Sergeant.

1368
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,717
Thank you, sir.

1369
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:05,637
Class...1-5-8-1... Fall out!

1370
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,468
Aye, aye, sir!

1371
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,310
Foley's fire-eaters finally finished!

1372
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,548
What did you think of that, babe?

1373
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,835
I did it! What did you think?

1374
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,831
See you at the saluting ceremony.

1375
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,991
Come on. Meet my family.

1376
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,594
No. I'm going to get my first salute.

1377
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,876
Congratulations, Ensign Chadwick.

1378
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,274
- Congratulations, Ensign Seeger.
- Thank you, sir.

1379
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,590
Gunnery Sergeant Ensign Seeger...

1380
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,833
sir.

1381
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,353
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo.

1382
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,430
- I won't ever forget you, Sergeant.
- I know.

1383
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:31,075
I wouldn't have made this
if it weren't for you.

1384
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,230
Get the hell out of here.

1385
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,518
Thank you, Sergeant.

1386
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,115
Congratulations,
Ensign Della Serra.

1387
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,758
Thank you, Sergeant.

1388
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,997
When I say, "Understand",
the group will say, "Yes, sir!"

1389
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,877
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1390
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,791
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1391
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,589
I don't believe what I'm seeing!
Where you been?

1392
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,272
Listening to punk rock music

1393
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,715
and bad-mouthing your country,
I'll bet!

1394
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:24,513
- Where you from, boy?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir.

1395
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,636
- Where?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir!

1396
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:31,316
Two things come out of Arizona...
steers and queers!

1397
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:35,837
Which are you? I don't see no horns,
so you must be queer.

1398
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,478
No, sir!

1399
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,276
I will use every means necessary,
fair and unfair, to trip you up!

1400
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:03,430
Turn it, Bunny.
No! Back the other way.

1401
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,398
Keep going, keep going. Tilt it...

1402
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:13,311
Way to go, Paula!

1403
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,193
Way to go!

1404
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:53,076
English
