1
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:06,670
(drumroll)

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,671
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:22,015
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:28,223
(lights match)

5
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:31,488
(quiet orchestral music plays)

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,855
(wings flapping)

7
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:44,930
(insects chirping softly)

8
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,804
(old-time band plays mid-tempo intro)

9
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,280
(soft chirping, croaking)

10
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:53,584
(click)

11
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,346
(click)

12
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:02,215
(woman singing)

13
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,907
(singing continues)

14
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,426
MAN (calls): Max!

15
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:25,427
Uh-huh?

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,293
Ready to concede?

17
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,731
No!

18
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,702
(singing continues)

19
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,777
I thought as it's
your last night here,

20
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:49,876
it only appropriate that we
open something extra special.

21
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,011
Bandol.

22
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,418
Excellent choice.

23
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:57,153
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

24
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:00,788
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

25
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:04,959
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

26
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,434
collapse in a heap

27
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:09,506
after drinking just a single glass.

28
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,269
Perhaps my knee landing
squarely in his testicles...

29
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,809
(cork pops)

30
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:16,573
...may have been partly to blame.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,977
What was I talking about before?

32
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,879
You said the importance
of a good blue suit

33
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,178
can never be overstated.

34
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,809
Quite right.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,684
A blue suit is the most
versatile of accoutrements.

36
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,586
More important
than the suit itself

37
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,420
is the man who fits it for you.

38
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,255
Once you find a good tailor,

39
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:33,330
you must never
give his name away,

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,660
not even under the threat

41
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,165
of bodily harm.

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,998
(music continues in background)

43
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:44,870
Now, where were we?

44
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,772
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

45
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,674
Uh-huh.

46
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,649
Uh-huh.

47
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,946
Max, have I told you why I enjoy

48
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,714
- making wine so much?
- You don't

49
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,153
make the wine, Uncle Henry,
that guy Duflot does.

50
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,487
In France,
it's always the landowner

51
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,618
who makes the wine.

52
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:07,196
Even though he does
nothing more than supervise

53
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:10,358
with binoculars
from the comfort of his study.

54
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:14,301
No, I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar

55
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,704
is quite simply incapable of lying.

56
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,174
Picked too early,
picked too late, it matters not.

57
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:23,178
The wine will always whisper
into your mouth

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,339
with complete,
unabashed honesty,

59
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:28,646
every time you take a sip.

60
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,045
Mmm,

61
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:33,646
delightful.

62
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:35,691
Now, Maximillian,

63
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:38,227
now you know why
I love wine so much,

64
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,889
have you anything
you want to tell me?

65
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:42,022
Yes, I do.

66
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:43,690
Yes, what is it?

67
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,171
Checkmate.

68
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:53,004
You little shit.

69
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,041
##

70
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:11,418
- Good morning, lab rats.
- OTHERS: Good morning, Max.

71
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:13,189
MAX: Today we're shifting gear.

72
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,857
Today... is Greedy Bastard Day.

73
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,457
(lively chatter, chuckling)

74
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,537
MAX:
The secret to riches, lab rats,

75
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:24,767
is the same as the secret to comedy...

76
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,365
timing.

77
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:28,977
- (indistinct chatter)
- MAN: 115.10, Max.

78
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,138
So I thought we should move now.

79
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,216
- Not yet, Alf.
- Boss,

80
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,477
why do you keep calling me Alf?

81
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,485
Because you're an aggressive
little flunky, Kenny.

82
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,576
And as your boss

83
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:39,155
and genetic superior,

84
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,156
I can call you whatever I want.

85
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,282
(cell phone rings)

86
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:43,382
Max Skinner's phone.

87
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:44,927
It's Kimberly.
Is Max there?

88
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,427
Yeah. One moment, please.

89
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,157
It's Kimberly.

90
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,496
- Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
- KI MBERLY: Where is he?

91
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:54,696
He and his fiancée

92
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:56,466
are at their wedding
rehearsal today.

93
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,234
- Their what?
- Do you want me to leave him a message?

94
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,934
No, I don't want
to leave him a message!

95
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,237
Okay.

96
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:02,277
(phone beeps)

97
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,006
KENNY: 115.90...

98
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:07,277
116...

99
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:08,442
116.10.

100
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,849
All right, lab rats,
just remember

101
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:11,352
we're not here for the dental plan.

102
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:14,481
50 big!
People are buying! Max?

103
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,024
Sell.

104
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:20,586
(all shouting frantically)

105
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,255
That's yours!

106
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:25,028
(shouting continues)

107
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,363
KENNY: I said that's yours!

108
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:32,833
(phones ringing)

109
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,672
That miserable sod Skinner's
dumping bonds

110
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:36,678
- onto the market.
- But he can't do that.

111
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,145
There's a gentleman's agreement
on the exchange.

112
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,045
A gentleman's agreement presupposes

113
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,118
- there's a gentleman involved.
- Amis,

114
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:44,449
he put out $5 billion
in sell orders— prices are

115
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,954
- crashing through the floor!
- Come on,

116
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,045
people, get off your asses!

117
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:49,751
Come on, step to it!
Start selling!

118
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,452
- (frantic shouting)
- Sell!

119
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,790
(shouting continues)

120
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,261
They should bury you
face down, Max,

121
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,891
because that's the way you're going.

122
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,334
(shouting continues)

123
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,031
(Kenny shouting)

124
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:08,840
Free big figures to 113.50!

125
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:10,573
WOMAN: Sell! Sell!

126
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,171
KENNY: Still going down.

127
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:13,579
Buy.

128
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,151
Fuckin' buy it all back!

129
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:17,015
Buy it all back immediately!

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,485
Buy it all back!
It's yours to buy back!

131
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,557
Don't worry about it!
Buy it all back!

132
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:22,056
You're a genius, Max!

133
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,495
Filthy bugger,
he's forced down prices.

134
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,656
He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap!

135
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:30,392
Start buying!

136
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,866
Buying now! Start buying!

137
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,937
(frantic shouting)

138
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,406
(others singing)

139
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,445
(singing ends)

140
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:43,843
(cheering)

141
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,778
- I can!
- I can!

142
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,078
Well done today, lab rats.

143
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,209
Wonderful work.

144
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,753
We all made
a spectacular amount of money.

145
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:52,844
(cheering)

146
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,947
Today we proved the adage that

147
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,958
winning isn't everything...

148
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,028
ALL: It's the only thing!

149
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,061
(whooping, cheering)

150
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:11,436
MALE REPORTER:
And there were strange goings-on

151
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,634
on the bond market today.

152
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:17,237
Prices crashed to 112.5,
after Lorden Brothers

153
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:19,975
unloaded $3 billion in sell orders.

154
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,382
FEMALE REPORTER: Then in an extraordinary
move, the company bought the bonds back

155
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,114
at a substantially
reduced price,

156
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:27,588
making over $77 million

157
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,319
- in the process.
- (whistles): Blimey.

158
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:31,792
Cries of foul play were loud

159
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:35,729
and widespread, with talks
of an inquiry to follow.

160
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:36,821
(clears throat)

161
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,094
Morning, Mr. Skinner.

162
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,431
- Morning, Bert.
- And congratulations.

163
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,300
- Thank you.
- You might've tipped me off,

164
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:43,566
Mr. Skinner.

165
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:45,574
I'll give you a tip, Bert:

166
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,577
Never pat a burning dog.

167
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,646
(elevator bell dings)

168
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,179
(quietly): Wanker.

169
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:53,249
(glass rings softly)

170
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,850
##

171
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:15,598
##

172
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,314
##

173
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,093
(sighs)

174
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:41,792
Oh, Henry, bloody hell.

175
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,627
KENNY: Ready for the fan mall?

176
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,567
Shoot, sunshine.

177
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,138
- "Bastard."
- Uh-huh.

178
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,035
"Bastard."

179
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,799
Uh-huh.

180
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,033
- "Burn in hell."
- Right.

181
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,302
"Rot in hell."

182
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,240
Oh. Lovely.

183
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:55,208
"Die."

184
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:55,869
Charming.

185
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,003
Maxie?

186
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,809
"Congratulations, you're my hero."

187
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,314
Who said that?

188
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,179
Your lawyer.

189
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:02,216
- Oh.
- Maxie, listen,

190
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,311
I just got off the phone
with, uh, Auzet.

191
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,220
That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.

192
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,519
She the one that sent me the letter?

193
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,685
Yeah.

194
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:15,196
Anyway, listen,
uh, it seems that

195
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:16,390
your Uncle Henry

196
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,899
hasn't updated his will

197
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,229
in over 20 years.

198
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,133
Which is why,
in typical frog fashion,

199
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:22,432
they take over a month

200
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,437
to notify us.

201
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,098
All right, so what do we do with that?

202
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,266
Is there a reading of the will,

203
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:27,365
or do we just download

204
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,240
that sort of thing these days?
What happens?

205
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,576
No, that's the point, Max.

206
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,673
Sorry?

207
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,217
There is no legal will.

208
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,216
Really?

209
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,581
You're his closest
blood relative,

210
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:40,248
- so you get everything.
- What, his clothes

211
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:41,722
and his Edmundo Ross LPs?

212
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:42,723
(chuckles)

213
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,384
The house, you git.

214
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,086
You get to keep his house.

215
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,288
What, the old farmhouse

216
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,092
and the vineyards and
the grapes and everything?

217
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,896
Place like must be worth
a few quid these days.

218
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,527
Hey.

219
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:55,764
- Hmm.
- Anyway,

220
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,204
I've booked you a flight

221
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:01,471
and an appointment with Auzet
for 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

222
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:03,239
Just a few papers to sign.

223
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:04,711
Come on, I can't go
to France tomorrow.

224
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:06,146
Gem, I'm the toast of the town.

225
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,580
I need to do
a few victory laps

226
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,379
around the city,
show off a little bit,

227
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,976
have a late night or two.
Oh, come on,

228
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,612
you heard the mail—
it's times like this,

229
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:14,418
when everyone hates you,
that's when it's fun.

230
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:15,718
Go on, Max—
we'll take good care

231
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:16,884
of the place when you're gone.

232
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,221
No problems.

233
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,386
Right.

234
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,123
- Ken.
- Mm.

235
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,630
Why don't you go
and try and find

236
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,927
some small animals to hurt?

237
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:27,595
I know, find a poodle and
punt it off the balcony.

238
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,840
(sighs)

239
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:36,179
Hmm?

240
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,769
- Tell me something, Max.
- Yes?

241
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,781
Did you care for him?

242
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,283
Yes, I did.

243
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,681
When was the last time you spoke?

244
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:46,915
A long time ago.

245
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,012
Why?

246
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,217
Well, I don't know, Gemma.

247
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:50,759
That's probably got
something to do

248
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,260
with me becoming an asshole.

249
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,096
Okay.

250
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:02,663
(piano plays mellow jazz)

251
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,809
(mellow jazz continues)

252
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:15,712
Max!

253
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,548
- MAX: Hello, how are you?
- How are you?

254
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,815
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

255
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:22,391
I'm looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.

256
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,325
Oh, well, follow me.

257
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,295
(indistinct chatter)

258
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,696
- Danny, how are you?
- Congratulations.

259
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:32,496
- Thank you. Austin.
- Max, congratulations.

260
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:33,694
Say hello to your dad for me.

261
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,635
Oh, love, mm.
How are you doing?

262
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,366
- Very well. How are you?
- Oh, Lucy.

263
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,772
- Hello.
- I didn't realize that you two knew each other.

264
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,808
Whoops.

265
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:43,209
He's adorable.

266
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:48,580
Mm, magnificent bouquet.

267
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:49,982
Alluring nose.

268
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,144
Honey and spice.

269
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,085
And all things nice.

270
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,488
Inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues

271
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,026
of brick red,
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.

272
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:00,528
It's a burgundy.

273
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,190
Yes, I knew it's burgundy.

274
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,392
One for you, sir?

275
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:07,834
I think I shall have an eclipse.

276
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,235
- Thank you.
- Charles, can we get

277
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:11,204
our minds off the double
frontage with the view

278
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,570
and onto the French real estate?

279
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,768
What do you think it's worth?

280
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,777
Max, barely a day has passed
since you learned

281
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,039
of the long-lost uncle's

282
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:19,172
departure from this world,

283
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,011
and all you can think of is money.

284
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,744
The very same uncle you're
talking about, Charles, is

285
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,684
the man who taught me every man
needs a fuck-you million.

286
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:27,382
Okay, when are you gonna
furnish me with the particulars,

287
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,787
because an estate agent
needs something

288
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:29,881
he can sink his teeth into.

289
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,553
Well, uh, it's been a while

290
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,687
since I've been there,
but from memory,

291
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:37,426
at least half a dozen
bedrooms, a pool, tennis...

292
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:38,967
court, a decent-sized kitchen...

293
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:42,038
- Thanks.
- 11 hectares, a vineyard.

294
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,868
Bloody hell, Max, it sounds
like an estate to me, a château.

295
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:47,239
What's a château go for these days?

296
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,972
Well, we're obviously in the
"F-You" department, aren't we?

297
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,445
- Maybe several.
- Really?

298
00:12:51,548 --> 00:12:53,379
God bless Henry.

299
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,507
I won't count my commission.

300
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:55,880
I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.

301
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,613
That's why I'm fond of you.

302
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,655
Well, in that case, Max...

303
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:02,452
here's to you.

304
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,686
(jet engines roaring)

305
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,498
(woman speaking French
over P.A. System)

306
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:21,802
(woman singing pop song in French)

307
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,984
(speaks in French, laughs)

308
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,250
Gemma.

309
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:38,122
(GPS speaking in Italian)

310
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:42,358
(male and female voices
alternate in foreign languages)

311
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:44,330
Parlez-vous anglals?

312
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,375
(horn honks)

313
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:55,808
(phone rings)

314
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,639
- Yeah?
- Kenny,

315
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,444
I want the current
ten-year yield,

316
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,179
I want an update on the figures
for nonfarm payrolls,

317
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,380
and I want you to get
your scrawny little backside

318
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:07,649
out of my chair.

319
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,248
Thank you.

320
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:13,627
How'd he know that?

321
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,755
(woman singing pop song
in French on radio)

322
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,695
Lance Armstrong!

323
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:23,068
(shouting angrily in French)

324
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,299
(pop song blaring from distance)

325
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,985
(pop song blaring on radio,
line ringing)

326
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,818
Maxie! Hi. How are you?

327
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:42,357
Gemma, come on, love,
admit it: This is

328
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,552
because I didn't shag you
at the Christmas party,

329
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:46,322
- isn't it?
- Listen, I swear on my life,

330
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,693
Max, they didn't have
any other cars.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,934
GEMMA: So, where are we, Max?

332
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh, for bollocky's sake!

333
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,696
Right, I've gone
to the end of that road...

334
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:58,899
- Look, they're both the D-3.
- (GPS repeats "Go!" in French)

335
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:01,500
I've got Menerbes on my left,
or I've got Cavaillon on my right,

336
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,442
and they're both on the D-3.

337
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:05,343
- GPS (in French): Go! Go!
- Oh... shut up!

338
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:07,882
Okay, okay, hang on a minute.
I'll help you. Hang on.

339
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,281
I've got a...
I've got a GPS here

340
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:11,354
- GPS (in French): Go! Go!
- With a stutter and a...

341
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,513
quite frankly,
a shitty, froggy attitude!

342
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:14,920
(beeping)

343
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,255
Okay, listen, you turn left
and that'll take you straight

344
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,352
onto the N-7, and if you
really put your foot on it,

345
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:23,557
you might even get
to your appointment on time.

346
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,533
(flies buzzing loudly,
Max grunting in pain)

347
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,764
- Bollocks! Bugger!
- (zips pants)

348
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:31,864
(phone rings)

349
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,442
Mission control.

350
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:35,340
All right, love,
please reschedule

351
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:36,935
my meeting with the notaire

352
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,309
for first thing tomorrow morning.

353
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,313
Okay.

354
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,077
What about the keys, Max?

355
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,414
- Oh, there used to be a stone, you know.
- Uh-huh.

356
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,717
Uh, by the front door. Ask her to put that...
put the keys under the stone,

357
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,757
and I'll, um,
I'll pick them up from there.

358
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:50,917
Okay, copy that. Copy that.

359
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:58,632
(GPS speaking in French)

360
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,273
Huh.

361
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,944
(insects chittering)

362
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:23,956
(bell tolling in distance)

363
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,332
(insects chittering)

364
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:42,573
(bell tolling in distance)

365
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,874
(groans, exhales)

366
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,579
(dog barking in distance)

367
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,798
(hinges squeak)

368
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,630
MAX: Hello?

369
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:12,969
(clock ticking)

370
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,568
Henry?

371
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,916
(dog barking)

372
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:28,022
(speaking French)

373
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:30,092
(speaking French)

374
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:36,821
(phone beeps off)

375
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:48,833
(medium-tempo piano intro plays)

376
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:59,415
(man singing)

377
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:34,524
(singing continues)

378
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:59,609
- (singing continues)
- (board creaking)

379
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:03,243
(squeaking)

380
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,015
UNCLE HENRY'S VOICE:
Come on, you're slower than your Aunt Mldge!

381
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,487
(rackets hitting tennis ball)

382
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,457
- That's lt, Maxlmllllan.
- (Max grunting)

383
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,619
- (Uncle Henry laughing)
- YOUNG MAX: It's not funny.

384
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:14,993
UNCLE HENRY:
What are you, a man or a mouse?

385
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,430
YOUNG MAX:
Flne, then, I'm a mouse. Squeak, squeak!

386
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,558
(Uncle Henry laughing)

387
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,072
(singing continues)

388
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:32,306
(insect buzzing)

389
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,576
UNCLE HENRY:
Hopeless, you're hopeless.

390
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,151
YOUNG MAX: Oh, stop lt!

391
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:38,277
- (Uncle Henry laughing)
- (singing continues)

392
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:48,457
(singing ends)

393
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,397
UNCLE HENRY: Match polnt.

394
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,832
Ace!

395
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,493
Game! Set!

396
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:56,868
- Match!
- You cannot be serious!

397
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,235
- (groaning)
- Hey.

398
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:00,741
- You have to rub it in?
- Hey...

399
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:02,834
The point is, Max, why
you aren't celebrating?

400
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,412
Because I lost!

401
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,414
Well, a man
should acknowledge

402
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:12,011
his losses just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.

403
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,748
Come on, give us a jig.

404
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,414
Give your old uncle a jig.

405
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:16,617
- Oh, yeah, I lost.
- Arms and up and down.

406
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,718
Yeah, great, yeah, I lost! I lost!

407
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:20,989
- Uncle Henry won!
- Yes.

408
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,065
- Three cheers!
- Dance, don't shimmy like an Italian.

409
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,258
Well done, Uncle Henry.

410
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,198
This is stupid.

411
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:28,930
You'll come to see

412
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,734
that a man learns
nothing from winning.

413
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,208
The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.

414
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:37,074
Not least of which is, uh,

415
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,876
how much more enjoyable it is to win.

416
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,042
It's inevitable to lose now and again.

417
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:46,485
The trick is not
to make a habit of it.

418
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:47,715
Drink?

419
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:01,059
##

420
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,433
(inhales deeply)

421
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,532
(coughing)

422
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,477
Chicken shit.

423
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,104
- (dog barking)
- Excuse me?

424
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,274
On the roses.

425
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,648
Oh, fertilizer.

426
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,448
Oh, Tati.

427
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,488
Hello.

428
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,921
Duflot?

429
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:23,286
Oul.

430
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:24,587
- Max.
- My God.

431
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:27,629
Haven't you... matured.

432
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,528
Ah, c'est vral,
the floods of'78,

433
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,261
- Right.
- Mistral of'86,

434
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:34,996
- fanleaf disease in '93.
- (dog urinating)

435
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,594
- Fanleaf disease.
- In each vintage I've

436
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:40,039
corked away another
year of my youth.

437
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:41,770
But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

438
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:43,175
- Ludivine.
- Yeah.

439
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,440
And my dog...
ah, vollà, Tati.

440
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,879
(barks)

441
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:48,280
I expect you're hungry, no?

442
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,408
Please, come tonight.

443
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,952
My wife is roasting a lamb— mmm!

444
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,281
To tell the truth,

445
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:53,980
I haven't had much
of an appetite

446
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,182
since I learned of Henry.

447
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,351
Oh, the very last years,
his sight was failing.

448
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:01,089
But I tended to things
for him, you know?

449
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,529
We became very close.

450
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:08,195
Almost like...
father and son.

451
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:11,637
Well, I am most appreciative

452
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:13,038
that someone was here for him.

453
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:15,133
Well, my wife will
come in the morning

454
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,404
with croissants, okay?

455
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:18,605
Huh? She will resume her duties.

456
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,308
- Allez! Bon!
- If you insist.

457
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,385
(speaking in French)

458
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:29,216
(dog growling)

459
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:35,621
Hmm.

460
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,426
"Welcome."

461
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,933
Ah.

462
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,906
Don't mind if I do.

463
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,743
Here's to you, Henry.

464
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,479
Devoting your life to the vines...

465
00:22:57,587 --> 00:22:59,817
and bottling the truth.

466
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,022
(swishing)

467
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:07,254
Hmm...

468
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:09,695
(groans)

469
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,323
(spits)

470
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:13,265
That was honest.

471
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,772
Jesus, ought to have
a poison sticker on it.

472
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:27,380
Ah... coffee, coffee.

473
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:30,281
What's in here?

474
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:32,684
And that?

475
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,283
Piss off.

476
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,090
Hmm.

477
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:43,791
Morning, Henry.

478
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,698
Milk.

479
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:50,802
Hmm.

480
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:54,472
(sighs)

481
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:56,940
(speaking in French)

482
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:57,910
(gasps)

483
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:59,413
Maxie!

484
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:00,447
Madame Duflot!

485
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,381
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

486
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:06,751
(kissing rapidly)

487
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:09,017
- Oh...
- Morning.

488
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:24,900
(cell phone ringing)

489
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,406
Morning, Gemma.

490
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,670
Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

491
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,746
Oh, yes, as bereavements go, you know.

492
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,245
This will cheer you up.

493
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:33,645
You've been busted.

494
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:36,582
Morning Flnanclal Tlmes headline:

495
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:39,314
"Lorden Brothers trade
under investigation."

496
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,720
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

497
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:44,190
The FSA today launched
an official inquiry

498
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:47,285
into recent Lorden Brothers
trade activity.

499
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,296
Yes, well, I double-checked
it all through Legal.

500
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:51,161
I covered our asses, okay?

501
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,531
It's just bollocks to placate
the lucid back.

502
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,160
Oh, he doesn't think so.

503
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:59,173
- Nigel?
- Sir Nigel.

504
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,403
He wants a meeting with you today,
5:00 this afternoon.

505
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,809
Well, it must be
about something else.

506
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:06,575
Um, what time is my meeting
with the notaire?

507
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:08,547
A little over an hour from now.

508
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:09,948
My time or yours?

509
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,417
Oh, shit.

510
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,283
Oh, Gemma!

511
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:25,697
(light, medium-tempo
theme playing)

512
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:39,379
##

513
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:42,246
(cell phone ringing)

514
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:43,613
Yes?

515
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,448
How's the house, Max?
Is it gorgeous?

516
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:47,351
Well, to tell you
the truth, Charlie,

517
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:48,582
it's a little bit shabby.

518
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:49,749
We don't say shabby, Max.

519
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:51,952
We say filled with the patina
of a bygone era.

520
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:54,052
- How's the wine?
- Right.

521
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,687
Uh, bouquet of a wet dog.

522
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,629
Hits the palate
like a razor blade

523
00:25:57,733 --> 00:25:59,860
with a finish that hints of awful.

524
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,231
So the house is falling apart

525
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,634
and the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine?

526
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:03,932
Excellent.

527
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,270
One thing you are going
to need is an oenologue.

528
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,535
All right, what's that?

529
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,270
It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

530
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,676
They take soil samples— bits of
the vine, that sort of thing—

531
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,840
tests them— there must
be a couple near you.

532
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,974
And also, I would need
a couple of sexy snaps

533
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:17,416
to get the punters clamoring,

534
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,614
and I have an e-mail address for
you to send them to, which is...

535
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:23,123
Hold on a second.
I'll just put you on speaker.

536
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:24,192
Okay, shoot.

537
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:25,225
Provencelistings@

abroadproperties. Inc.

539
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,264
Shit.

540
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,303
- Hello?
- Attentlon!

541
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,269
(shrieking, tires screeching)

542
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,897
- Hello?
- Shit.

543
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,703
(gasping)

544
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:40,277
- Max?
- All right, go on.

545
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,008
(yelling in French)

546
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:48,011
(horn honking)

547
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,761
(engine revving)

548
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,102
(clears throat)

549
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,047
Auzet.

550
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:10,853
(speaking French)

551
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,393
Hello.

552
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,292
Max Skinner.

553
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:17,422
The vigneron makes the wine

554
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:21,230
and the estate owner
maintains the property.

555
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,235
Mr. Skinner?

556
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:24,898
Yes, hmm, right, well, delightful.

557
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,942
This is how your uncle
and Monsieur Duflot

558
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:30,341
worked for over 20 years.

559
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:31,640
Naturally, Monsieur Duflot

560
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:34,011
will be anxious
as to your intentions.

561
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:36,880
I think I can speed this up.

562
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:40,149
I have no intention
of becoming a winemaker.

563
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:44,590
So let Monsieur Duflot
make the wine

564
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:46,888
and you enjoy the estate
on the weekends.

565
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:48,827
I'm not sure you understand me.

566
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,626
My life is in London.

567
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,291
I don't do weekends.

568
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:54,062
I intend to sell La Siroque

569
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,535
as soon as possible.

570
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,969
And what about, uh,

571
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:58,869
Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

572
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:00,737
Look, in all cases like this,
it simply

573
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:02,071
just comes down to a figure.

574
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:04,942
Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a plane to catch.

575
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,242
Right.

576
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,067
You're selling La Siroque?

577
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:27,965
There has been a mistake, I think.

578
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,469
News travels fast.

579
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:30,800
(barking)

580
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,339
But your uncle,

581
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:34,306
he meant for you to have it,

582
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,308
not sell it.

583
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:36,605
Well, I'm sure if he did,

584
00:28:36,712 --> 00:28:38,612
he would have written
that down in a proper will.

585
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:39,908
He didn't.

586
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:42,381
You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.

587
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:44,952
He was a man of secrets,
a man of passion.

588
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:46,521
He didn't write things down.

589
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:48,783
You would take me
away from my vines?

590
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:51,291
My vines, Duflot.

591
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,224
I live in them,

592
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,489
I breathe in them.

593
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,360
They tear my hands.

594
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:58,933
Look, Francis, when
I sell the property,

595
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:02,026
I do intend to make you
a handsome settlement.

596
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,867
Do you know, monsieur,
what it is to love something

597
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:07,374
more than your own life?

598
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:10,604
To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?

599
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:12,647
I have only a few vintages left.

600
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:16,343
Soon my body and spirit will
be defeated by the terrolr.

601
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,545
And you would dare come
here and take away

602
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:20,019
my last few chances of immortality?

603
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:23,182
Afraid so. Be in touch.

604
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,884
(grunts)

605
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:27,326
- (dog barking)
- It's not over!

606
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:30,023
(speaking in French)

607
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,430
(cell phone ringing)

608
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:34,024
Leaving now.

609
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,433
Oh, good.

610
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:37,732
'Cause Sir Nigel has made
a special trip, Max.

611
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,740
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

612
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:42,402
Good. Oh, did you remember
to take photos for Charlie?

613
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,569
Yes.

614
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,374
- (tires screech)
- Damn it!

615
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:47,381
Idiot.

616
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,916
(door chime ringing,
engine idling)

617
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:01,789
(shutter clicking rapidly)

618
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,263
(clicking)

619
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:22,948
(clicking)

620
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:36,224
(flies buzzing)

621
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:39,699
(inhales deeply)

622
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:43,363
UNCLE HENRY: Let's see you then.

623
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:44,564
YOUNG MAX: One... two...

624
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:46,265
...and go!
- (Henry laughs)

625
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,253
(clicking)

626
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:09,056
(cell phone ringing)

627
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:10,995
- Yes?
- Get in the car.

628
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,625
Get off my camera.

629
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,668
(board creaking)

630
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,106
- (board snapping)
- Bollocks!

631
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,235
(grunts)

632
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:27,213
(groans)

633
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:28,476
(raspy grunt)

634
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:31,382
(cell phone ringing)

635
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:34,285
(grunts)

636
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,950
(line ringing, sighs)

637
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:40,491
(vibrating)

638
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:44,088
Oh, come on!
Where's the ladder?

639
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,464
Where are you, tosser?

640
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:56,706
(French pop song playing on radio)

641
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,696
(rattling, scraping)

642
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:17,425
(door chime ringing)

643
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:29,076
(engine idling)

644
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,012
- (ringing and vibrating)
- Hold on!

645
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,351
Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

646
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,513
(speaking in French)

647
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:41,884
(line ringing, sighs)

648
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:49,123
MAX:
Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

649
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:52,257
(grunting, cell phone ringing)

650
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,470
Hello.

651
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:07,606
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

652
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,115
I'm... I'm the pool man.

653
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:11,152
I do this every Thursday.

654
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,845
It's just routine maintenance.

655
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,082
(groaning)

656
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,353
It's been lovely chatting to you.

657
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:27,329
And, and you are
a spectacular vision.

658
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,034
But any chance for a rope
or a ladder?

659
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,302
Is that your little car?

660
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:36,502
Uh, yes, I'm the temporary custodian

661
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,477
of the lime green roller skate,

662
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,138
but it's a hired car; it's a rental.

663
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:41,011
It's not for sale. Sorry?

664
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,447
- Can you swim?
- Well, yes, but...

665
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,677
but not in a foot of cow shit.

666
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,174
Hello?

667
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:55,646
(hissing, then whooshing)

668
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:00,884
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Will all passengers on Flight...

669
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:02,886
(cell phone ringing)

670
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:06,515
He's not on the flight.

671
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,115
GEMMA: Right, right.

672
00:34:08,227 --> 00:34:11,424
Okay, roger that.

673
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,184
What is it, Major Lawrence,

674
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:43,318
that attracts you, personally,
to the desert?

675
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:46,125
It's clean.

676
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:49,201
I like it because it's clean.

677
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,216
(light, jazzy theme playing)

678
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,120
Great.

679
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:17,025
(groaning)

680
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:20,223
(panting)

681
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,462
(cell phone ringing)

682
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:32,833
You better be in prison, Maxie.

683
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,344
Yes, just tell him I'm sorry.

684
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,141
There was nothing
I could do about it.

685
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:38,443
Sorry's no good, Max.
He's gone.

686
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:39,950
Oh, shit.

687
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:43,351
Um, what time is the first
flight out in the morning?

688
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:45,787
Oh, there's no point
in rushing back, Max.

689
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:48,917
You know, the last thing
Sir Nigel did on his way out

690
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:51,895
- was to suspend you for a week.
- What?

691
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:54,693
What the f— does he expect me
to do for a week?

692
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,290
Take a holiday?

693
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:57,960
Christ, he didn't say that, did he?

694
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,128
No, I just did.

695
00:35:59,238 --> 00:36:00,899
Right, Gemma. Never say that.

696
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,234
If anybody calls,

697
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,309
do not say I'm on holiday.

698
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,843
All right?
That's worse than dying.

699
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:07,242
Now, look.

700
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:09,473
I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.

701
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:10,571
- You just make sure
- Okay.

702
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,674
That every man jack
in there is ready.

703
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:14,810
Set it up so I can
trade in Kenny's name.

704
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,944
What?

705
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:18,080
Get him a clearance
at the highest level

706
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,782
on Sir Nigel's recommend.

707
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:20,859
Are you mad, Max?

708
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,018
Who cares? Just do it.

709
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:23,151
Don't tell anybody, all right?

710
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:25,662
Especially not that
little shit, Kenny.

711
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:27,493
Max, is there a problem?

712
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,500
No, I'm having a great time.

713
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:30,660
- You sure?
- Yes.

714
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:32,896
- You just be careful, okay? Okay. Ciao.
- Okay.

715
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:34,905
Bye.

716
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:41,403
(man singing on phonograph)

717
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:58,267
(singing continues)

718
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,143
(sniffs)

719
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:06,270
(singing ends)

720
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:09,544
(bell tolling, rooster crows)

721
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:12,142
(singing a happy tune)

722
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:21,726
(bell tolling in distance,
singing continues)

723
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,695
(rooster crows,
gasps, grunts)

724
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,592
(continues singing)

725
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:32,005
(exhales)

726
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:33,734
- (rattling)
- Oh, shit!

727
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:36,811
Shit! Scorpion! Scorpion!
Ludivine!

728
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:38,242
(shouts)

729
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:39,438
Scorpion!

730
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:42,345
- (Ludivine yells)
- Oh! Drop it! Bloody hell!

731
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,714
Get that little bastard!

732
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:48,646
Of course.

733
00:37:48,757 --> 00:37:50,019
Okay.

734
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,958
(upbeat pop intro plays)

735
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:54,688
(man singing)

736
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:14,642
Fits very well; beautifully.

737
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,307
CHARLI E: Max?

738
00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:18,113
Are you back in Blighty?

739
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,516
On the contrary, chuckles.

740
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:23,182
I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.

741
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,259
So it's true,
you are getting the sack.

742
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,191
No, I'm not getting
the sack, Charlie.

743
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:30,025
I'm just exploring my options,
with a view to realizing

744
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,099
the full potential
of my inheritance.

745
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,428
Well, speaking
of your inheritance,

746
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:34,866
how soon before we can view?

747
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,300
It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say.

748
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:39,464
Surprising, actually,
how well it's been maintained.

749
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:40,802
Hmm. So you don't need

750
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:42,376
a contractor or anything like that?

751
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:44,445
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Just needs a...

752
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:47,174
a coat of paint
and a bit of a scrub.

753
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:48,374
Okay, you sure?

754
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:51,316
- No problem at all, Charlie.
- Good.

755
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:53,887
Charlie?

756
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,548
Charlie, can you hear me?

757
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:57,716
- Yes.
- (hinges creaking)

758
00:38:57,826 --> 00:38:58,815
Can you hear me now?

759
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,327
- Yes.
- Look, I wasn't joking before

760
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:03,556
about what I said
about the wine they make here.

761
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:07,795
It is not, I repeat,
not first-class.

762
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:10,700
- Will that affect our price?
- Well, how bad can it be?

763
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,500
Uh, well,
it gives you a blinding headache

764
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:13,869
- and it makes you angry.
- Ah.

765
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:16,671
I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.

766
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:18,507
Well, we'll just have
to make sure

767
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:20,342
our buyers don't know
anything about wine.

768
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:21,779
We'll concentrate on the Americans.

769
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,350
(imitates electric guitar)

770
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:26,043
Just make sure she's match-fit
in 72 hours.

771
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:27,621
72 hours.

772
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:29,019
Righto.

773
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:30,784
(chicken clucking)

774
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,893
(chuckles): A Lamborghini tractor.

775
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:35,189
Palntbrush...

776
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:36,558
paintbrush, paintbrush.

777
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,470
Paintbrush!

778
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:53,104
(clucking)

779
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:54,909
(excited squawking)

780
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:57,807
You old bugger.

781
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:00,251
(engine starts)

782
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,895
(engine roaring)

783
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,212
(engine turns off)

784
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,643
Duflot.

785
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,616
(footsteps approaching)

786
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,155
I was just about to use
that paintbrush.

787
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:36,553
It's my paintbrush.

788
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:37,955
Gee whiz.

789
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,321
This is fun.

790
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:41,224
Tell you what,

791
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,957
I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.

792
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:45,191
- Hmm?
- No.

793
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,289
No?

794
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,766
Fifty.

795
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,429
I'll give you a hundred euros
for your paintbrush, Duflot.

796
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,165
I don't care.
What do you want?

797
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,275
When you sell, I stay vigneron.

798
00:40:57,378 --> 00:40:58,936
I keep my vines.

799
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,071
You want to stay with your vines?

800
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,409
- Mm-hmm.
- Fine.

801
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:02,778
That means you...

802
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:05,182
must help me...
fix the place up—

803
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:06,548
do the gardens,

804
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:09,122
paint the house,
clean the pool— and I,

805
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,214
if at all possible,
will attempt to convince

806
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,317
the new owners
of the worth and value

807
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:14,827
of your services.

808
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,123
D'accord?

809
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,595
(exhales, spits)

810
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:18,927
A Frenchman's hand

811
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,263
is his word.

812
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,358
(spits)

813
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,132
An Englishman's word is his bond.

814
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,332
- Concord?
- Deal.

815
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,870
Frog tosspot.

816
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:30,967
English prick.

817
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:37,308
(man singing passionate
folk ballad in French)

818
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:51,223
No.

819
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,027
(grunting)

820
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:08,346
(grunts)

821
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,998
(grunts)

822
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:28,033
(laughs)

823
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,036
Awfully sorry.

824
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:31,901
(laughing)

825
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,236
(whispering): Goal of the day.

826
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:39,775
(ball bouncing)

827
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:50,749
(folk music playing)

828
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,622
UNCLE HENRY: Bat. Come on.

829
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:55,252
Here comes the ball!

830
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:56,887
(cheering)

831
00:42:56,998 --> 00:42:58,465
Champion of the over— unh!

832
00:42:58,566 --> 00:42:59,760
(grunts)

833
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,461
Let's play.

834
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,128
Come on.

835
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:06,229
(man singing)

836
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,400
All right, I'm 12-none out.

837
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:12,613
Okay.

838
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:16,847
(cheering)

839
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:20,286
It won't last one month.

840
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:22,652
If things go
according to plan, Francis,

841
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:25,087
it will be somebody else's problem.

842
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,048
LUDIVI NE: Monsieur Max!

843
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,217
Yes?

844
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:35,263
There is, um... a person

845
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:37,093
- at the door.
- A person?

846
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,291
A person.

847
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,527
(hinges creaking)

848
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:43,933
Bonjour.

849
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,199
Bonjour.

850
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:51,108
The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.

851
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:52,339
Oh.

852
00:43:52,448 --> 00:43:53,506
You speak English.

853
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,049
- Like a native.
- (chuckles)

854
00:43:55,151 --> 00:43:56,812
I'm Christie Roberts.

855
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:58,819
I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

856
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:01,446
You lucky devil, you found him.

857
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,990
Impossible.

858
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:05,117
You're way too young.

859
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:08,526
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

860
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:10,895
I meant too young to be my dad.

861
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:15,560
Henry Skinner is my father.

862
00:44:17,773 --> 00:44:19,138
She has Henry's nose.

863
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:20,230
Allez. Allez.

864
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:22,139
(hinges creaking)

865
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:24,941
Wow.

866
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,515
(clears throat)

867
00:44:27,616 --> 00:44:29,481
This your mum?

868
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:30,882
In all her Flashdance glory.

869
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:32,112
(chuckles)

870
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:35,487
So, uh...

871
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:37,115
is he around?

872
00:44:39,195 --> 00:44:40,287
Oh, bollocks.

873
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:41,454
Um...

874
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten your name.

875
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:48,202
- It's Christie.
- Christie.

876
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:51,137
You see, Christie, um...

877
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,265
Henry...

878
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,069
He's dead, huh?

879
00:44:57,179 --> 00:44:59,010
A month ago.

880
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:04,712
Um...

881
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,844
(sighs)

882
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,479
Cup of tea?

883
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,319
Yes?

884
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:10,892
Madame Duflot.

885
00:45:10,993 --> 00:45:12,483
(speaking French)

886
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:13,960
Well, no, it's more
than a wrinkle, Max.

887
00:45:14,063 --> 00:45:15,496
What if the girl
turns out to be legit?

888
00:45:15,598 --> 00:45:16,656
Oh, come on, she turns up

889
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:18,494
a couple months after he parks it?

890
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:20,262
Far too sweet, Charlie;
I'm not buying it.

891
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,563
You need some
legal advice, mate,

892
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,501
and you need it fast,
in case the little minx

893
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:25,301
screws up the whole deal.

894
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:26,704
Asking price?

895
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,299
Uh, it's seven and a half.

896
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,809
Did you get that?

897
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:32,881
Right.

898
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,588
Christie, I'm just going
to pop into town.

899
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:41,747
Oh, no problem—
I booked a youth hostel,

900
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:43,051
just in case the old man

901
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,489
- was schizo, you know?
- Oh, right.

902
00:45:44,593 --> 00:45:46,527
Oh, you mind dropping me off?

903
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:50,224
I really got to get
out of these clothes.

904
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:52,300
Why don't you just get
out of your clothes here?

905
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:54,631
(chuckling):
Got plenty of space, lots of room.

906
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:56,034
You can clean up, take a shower.

907
00:45:56,138 --> 00:45:58,129
- I'll be back in a jiff.
- You sure?

908
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,208
Absolutely, absolutely.

909
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,140
Madame Duflot?
(speaks French)

910
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:04,235
Vollà.

911
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:10,579
WOMAN:
In the French law, there Is no dlfference between

912
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,484
legitimate and illegitimate
children when it comes

913
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:15,887
to their right to inherit.

914
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:17,356
That's bloody ridiculous.

915
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:19,017
She never even met Henry.

916
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:20,720
She could very well be an impostor.

917
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,161
That is precisely why
she would be required

918
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:24,562
to produce some form

919
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,430
of documentation.

920
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:27,866
Photo or even

921
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,461
correspondence— a love letter.

922
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:34,133
Yes, yes, yes, but what if I just...
sell the property

923
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:36,905
before she even makes her claim?

924
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:40,914
No; legally, she could
invalidate the sale

925
00:46:41,016 --> 00:46:42,779
even after the transfer of title.

926
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,147
Bugger.

927
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:45,811
My advice, Mr. Skinner,

928
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:48,151
is to treat her
with the utmost respect.

929
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:49,918
(mumbling) Goes without saying.

930
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:52,493
And hope she'll be on her way.

931
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:54,289
(mumbling)
...bugger off.

932
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:57,559
Don't let this... end in court.

933
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:08,841
(upbeat, jazzy theme plays)

934
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,538
(revs engine, honks horn)

935
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:18,778
Mercl.

936
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:23,184
(tires screeching)

937
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,426
Joan of Arc?

938
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:37,029
Oh, Jacques Cousteau.

939
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:38,800
You tried to drown me.

940
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:40,932
And you tried to run me
over with your little car.

941
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:43,238
What are you talking about,
I tried to run you over?

942
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:44,141
What sort of bollocks is that?

943
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:45,770
Down the road
from La Siroque,

944
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,008
you were driving your
midget car on your phone.

945
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:50,779
Bonjour. Bonjour.

946
00:47:50,886 --> 00:47:52,217
And I believe

947
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:54,289
had your head stuck
very far up your ass.

948
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,052
Look at the damage
you have caused me!

949
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,786
(yells in French)
You tried to kill me,

950
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:00,555
I tried to kill you.

951
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:03,096
(patrons applauding,
whistling, cheering)

952
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,465
My God.

953
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:09,628
She's fantastic.

954
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:17,041
Hey, Max.

955
00:48:17,146 --> 00:48:18,670
Look at the view.

956
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:19,907
It's like Cézanne.

957
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:23,212
(pops lips, exhales)

958
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:27,119
(sniffing)

959
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:30,453
(snoring)

960
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,026
(gasps)

961
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:37,560
(barking)

962
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:38,928
Oh, Tati. Psst.

963
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,539
Francis...

964
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:48,838
in, uh, in town today,

965
00:48:48,944 --> 00:48:51,412
I was, um,

966
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,946
I was passing by this restaurant...

967
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:54,743
Her name is Fanny Chenal.

968
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,215
(chuckling)

969
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,216
Right.

970
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:58,411
Many times, I've seen

971
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,216
this same look on your uncle's face.

972
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:03,018
But you deserve credit.

973
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,558
Why is that?

974
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,924
You are now the town hero
for making her show

975
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:08,553
her derriere.
(chuckles)

976
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:16,028
She, um... (clears throat)
She grew up around here, didn't she?

977
00:49:16,138 --> 00:49:17,435
Who?

978
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,905
Fanny Chenal.

979
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:22,101
I believe, yes.

980
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:24,145
She, um...

981
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,944
She otherwise spoken for?

982
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,211
She was once.

983
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,015
A football player— for Lyon.

984
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,214
He was shit,

985
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:35,847
just like his left foot.

986
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,222
He treated her very badly, you know.

987
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:41,125
Since then, it's rumored
that she will let no man

988
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,788
near her heart.

989
00:49:49,605 --> 00:49:50,629
(lid rattles, creaks)

990
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:55,208
So she's alone, then.

991
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:58,002
Who?

992
00:49:58,113 --> 00:49:59,740
Fanny Chenal.

993
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:00,780
Max,

994
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,646
recall what Proust said:

995
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,275
"Leave pretty women

996
00:50:04,386 --> 00:50:06,013
to men without imagination."

997
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:07,485
Duflot, I'm a banker.

998
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:10,848
I have no imagination.

999
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,781
Stop.

1000
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,613
Fred Perry.

1001
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,422
Henri Lacoste.

1002
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:34,465
(grunting)

1003
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:36,298
(groans)

1004
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,375
Love-15.

1005
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,536
(barking)

1006
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:43,572
15-all.

1007
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:48,652
- (Tati whimpers)
- MAX: Yes!

1008
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,652
(laughing)

1009
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,219
No, no, out.

1010
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:54,917
Cannot be serious!
That was in by a mile!

1011
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:57,657
Ball. Ball!

1012
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,358
(man singing)

1013
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:02,161
Ah, good.

1014
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,826
(grunting, groaning)

1015
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,003
(barking)

1016
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,265
- Yeah! Hey!
- (groans)

1017
00:51:07,373 --> 00:51:09,307
(singing continues)

1018
00:51:09,408 --> 00:51:10,705
Oh... oh, bollocks!

1019
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,180
(laughing)

1020
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:19,757
(grunts, yells)

1021
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:23,158
(yells)

1022
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,161
(grunts)

1023
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:27,290
(singing continues)

1024
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,096
(laughing)

1025
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:30,500
My point.

1026
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:31,536
(mumbles)

1027
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,002
(panting)

1028
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:43,610
Match point.

1029
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:48,219
(grunts)

1030
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:51,348
(straining)

1031
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:54,861
Game.

1032
00:51:54,962 --> 00:51:56,088
Hmm.

1033
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:00,532
(exhales loudly)

1034
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:02,966
(coughing)

1035
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,265
(coughing, wheezing)

1036
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,172
(grunts)

1037
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,481
Eh, Tati.

1038
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:20,678
(Tati snarling)

1039
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,864
(imitating crowd cheering)

1040
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:34,991
(chuckling)

1041
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:45,441
(lush piano melody playing)

1042
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:51,807
Vollà.

1043
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:56,887
(gasps)

1044
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,480
Oh, Maxie.

1045
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,890
Oh, look, Ludivine, um,

1046
00:53:00,994 --> 00:53:02,052
she's my cousin.

1047
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:03,720
Well, she might be...
could end up turning out

1048
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,230
to be, um, a relative, uh,
from a cousinly perspect...

1049
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,595
Uh-huh.

1050
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:09,066
This is perhaps
a little over the top.

1051
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:10,067
No.

1052
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,831
Half the aristocrats in France

1053
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,304
have liaison with their cousins.

1054
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:15,397
Gosh, that explains a lot.

1055
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:17,340
- Ooh.
- (giggles)

1056
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,144
Oh, won't do.

1057
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:26,014
Anything but, uh...
La Siroque.

1058
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,087
Vln de merdre.

1059
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:33,449
No label.
That looks promising.

1060
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,522
HENRY: Careful on those steps.

1061
00:53:43,037 --> 00:53:44,664
What do you see up there?

1062
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:45,761
Fervens.

1063
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:48,808
Are you speaking in tongues, boy?

1064
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,037
"Fervere"— it's a Latin term.

1065
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,306
It means "to boil."

1066
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:56,975
The native yeasts in your cellar
are converting the sugar

1067
00:53:57,085 --> 00:53:58,143
inside the grapes to alcohol.

1068
00:53:58,252 --> 00:53:59,310
(sniffs)

1069
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,513
The release of
carbon dioxide gas

1070
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:03,954
is what causes the bubbling of it.

1071
00:54:04,058 --> 00:54:05,457
I must be suffering from dementia.

1072
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,618
I don't recall ever
having told you that.

1073
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:09,483
You didn't.

1074
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:11,527
Monsieur Duflot explained it to me.

1075
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,892
Well done.

1076
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:15,157
Proves the adage

1077
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,756
that wisdom can be found
in the most unlikely places.

1078
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:21,327
To watch Duflot on bended knee

1079
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:24,236
doing something as simple
as weeding his soil,

1080
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:26,036
he brings a magnificent poetry

1081
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:28,042
in his devotion
to each and every grape.

1082
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:29,611
(inhales)

1083
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:31,544
Perhaps it'd inspire you

1084
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:35,846
to find devotion in what you do
for a living one day.

1085
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:39,683
I want to be a professional
poker player when I'm older.

1086
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:40,949
Or a comedian.

1087
00:54:41,057 --> 00:54:42,251
Maximillian,

1088
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,919
ask me what is

1089
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:47,826
the most important thing in comedy.

1090
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:50,627
What is the most
important thing

1091
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:51,792
- in comedy?
- Timing.

1092
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:53,493
(chuckles)

1093
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,161
(laughs)

1094
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:56,296
Timing.

1095
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:00,535
(cork pops)

1096
00:55:02,078 --> 00:55:03,978
Have you tasted Dad's wine?

1097
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,411
Oh, yes, indeed.
Bloody awful, isn't it?

1098
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:06,846
But I do recommend it

1099
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,441
for getting the paint out from
underneath your fingernails.

1100
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:10,951
(chuckles)
So you know.

1101
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:13,284
Well, I'm more of a cognac drinker.

1102
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,982
I'm too impatient
to be a wine lover.

1103
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:16,183
If I'm gonna get drunk,
I don't want

1104
00:55:16,293 --> 00:55:17,225
to spend all night doing it.

1105
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:18,225
Try that.

1106
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:19,260
(sniffs)

1107
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:21,159
(sips)

1108
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:22,162
It's better.

1109
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:24,893
It's extraordinary.

1110
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:26,969
Like a Bordeaux,

1111
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,264
only velvet rather than wool.

1112
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:29,360
Well, well,

1113
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:30,871
guess who knows a thing
or two about wine.

1114
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:32,032
(chuckles)

1115
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:33,040
Back in Napa,

1116
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,269
we're known to gargle

1117
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:36,072
and spit on occasion.

1118
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:38,204
That sounds like fun.

1119
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:41,751
Is, uh, is this made here

1120
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:43,079
on the estate?

1121
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:44,414
"Coin Perdu."

1122
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:45,920
Doubt it.

1123
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:47,546
Different bottles.

1124
00:55:47,657 --> 00:55:49,090
Same corks.

1125
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:50,557
Un petlt mystery, n'est-ce pas?

1126
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,060
Well, Henry always was
a little bit of a mystery.

1127
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:54,687
How so?

1128
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:58,290
He loved England,
but he lived in France.

1129
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:00,096
And he loved women,

1130
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:02,637
but never the same one
for more than

1131
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:05,230
a certain period of time.

1132
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:07,242
He never got married.

1133
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:08,709
And he loved adventure.

1134
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:09,744
But every single one of

1135
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:11,040
my memories takes place

1136
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:14,480
within about 100 steps
of this very spot.

1137
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:16,449
Are they good memories?

1138
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:19,317
No.

1139
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:21,617
They're grand.

1140
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:23,215
(chuckles)

1141
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,294
I'm going to go upstairs,

1142
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:27,761
finish my book.

1143
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:30,424
Death In Venlce.

1144
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:31,557
That's my book.

1145
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:33,067
Don't tell me the ending.

1146
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:34,830
(chuckles)

1147
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,308
Well, actually, I never
got around to finishing it.

1148
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,710
Hello, old mate, how are you?

1149
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:46,076
Just a quick question.

1150
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:47,547
Yeah, hang on. Shirley.

1151
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:51,242
Yes?

1152
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:52,252
You'd know this.

1153
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:53,413
In France,

1154
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:56,185
is it actually illegal
to shag your own cousin?

1155
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:57,759
Only if she's ugly.

1156
00:56:57,861 --> 00:56:59,226
Right.

1157
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:00,296
(phone beeps off)

1158
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:05,729
Bollocks.

1159
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,934
MAX: Lance Armstrong!

1160
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,530
(bikers shouting angrily)

1161
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:15,611
(people laughing, chattering)

1162
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:16,974
I know, I'm so sorry.

1163
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,208
I'm supposed to be here
for a 7:30 reservation!

1164
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:22,181
30 minutes, I'm sorry.

1165
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:23,718
Oh, come on.

1166
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,048
FANNY:
I know. I know.

1167
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:27,214
WOMAN:
You said we'd be seated right away.

1168
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:28,984
I know. Okay, you have a drink.

1169
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:31,356
We'll offer you a drink,

1170
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,691
and you'll have your table in
less than 20 minutes, okay?

1171
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,526
All righty. Okay.

1172
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:36,792
MAN:
All right, what I want is—

1173
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,765
get ready, write it down:
Double mai tai.

1174
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:44,706
Caroline?

1175
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:49,872
(elegant song playing)

1176
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:52,244
Bonsolr.

1177
00:57:52,348 --> 00:57:54,873
Monsleur...

1178
00:57:54,984 --> 00:57:56,884
Well, I hope your
food's wonderful

1179
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:58,419
because your service
is obviously lousy.

1180
00:57:58,521 --> 00:58:00,216
Please, Monsieur, I'm too busy
to ignore you.

1181
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:02,348
- Where are all your waiters, love?
- Look,

1182
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:04,127
- my hands are full without fun
and games with you. Comprends?
- Mm-hmm.

1183
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:04,991
- My hands are full without fun
and games with you. Comprends?
- Mm-hmm.

1184
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:08,360
McDonald's is in Avignon,
fish and chips in Marseille.

1185
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,894
Table six?

1186
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:12,559
MAN: Allez, allez!

1187
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:17,763
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, love.

1188
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:18,704
Done this before.

1189
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:19,706
Where?

1190
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:20,867
Worked my way through university

1191
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:22,103
at London's finest restaurants.

1192
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:25,079
MAN: Monsleur!

1193
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:27,376
- Mals qu'est-ce qul se passe?
- Alors?

1194
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:29,418
Venez, monsleur!

1195
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:30,747
Okay, okay.
You can serve.

1196
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:33,254
But remember, if there
are any complaints,

1197
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:35,586
in France,
the customer is always wrong.

1198
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:37,455
Table six.

1199
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:38,892
(French accent): Table six.

1200
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,807
Bonsolr...

1201
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:52,932
Table?

1202
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:56,444
Uh... 16.

1203
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:04,547
Champagne?

1204
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:06,986
Yes, cheers. And wha-what
are we going to have here?

1205
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,217
MAN:
Garkin! Garkin! Get over here.

1206
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:10,588
- I need, need help over here.
- En deux mlnutes, monsleur.

1207
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:11,661
Where you going?

1208
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:13,654
Garkin!

1209
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,094
WOMAN: Oh, do you speak American?

1210
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:16,529
'Cause this menu
is all in French

1211
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:17,600
and we don't understand it.

1212
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,430
MAN:
Yeah, we need some silverware.

1213
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:21,060
But, uh, let me tell you
what I would like to have.

1214
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:22,069
Mm-hmm.

1215
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:23,434
I would like a salad "Nicoisee..."

1216
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,632
with ranch dressing on it.

1217
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:27,141
Wait, wait, baby,
low-cal ranch dressing.

1218
00:59:27,243 --> 00:59:28,676
Oh, that's right.
I'm still on my diet.

1219
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:31,679
So, I would like low-cal
ranch dressing with no oil.

1220
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:34,181
And could you sprinkle
some bacon bits on top?

1221
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:36,479
(French accent):
McDonald's is in Avignon,

1222
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:39,282
fish and chips, Marseille.
Allez.

1223
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:40,788
MAN:
You people got some serious attitude around here.

1224
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,448
(gentle, upbeat
pop song playing)

1225
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:59,016
Here are your tips.

1226
00:59:59,123 --> 01:00:00,385
Thank you for your help.

1227
01:00:01,492 --> 01:00:02,390
You're fired.

1228
01:00:06,097 --> 01:00:09,089
You know, my vigneron said that

1229
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,599
you grew up around Gord.

1230
01:00:10,702 --> 01:00:12,966
Monsieur Duflot is mistaken.

1231
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:16,438
I only visited Gord during
the summer with my mother.

1232
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,906
I used to spend my summers here.

1233
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,907
I wonder if we ever met.

1234
01:00:24,983 --> 01:00:28,749
Well, if we did,
I hope I was unbearable.

1235
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,454
You're a local.
You'd know the answer to this.

1236
01:00:32,557 --> 01:00:37,995
Where would a young man,
recently cashed up, take someone

1237
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:40,326
for a drink?

1238
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:42,592
What?

1239
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,191
Are you asking me on a date?

1240
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:50,404
No, it's more of an apology.

1241
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:53,500
I just don't, uh, want you to
think I'm the sort of maniac

1242
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:55,476
who goes around running people
off the road.

1243
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,571
I'm not interested.

1244
01:00:58,816 --> 01:00:59,805
Have a good night.

1245
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,683
(door closes)

1246
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,131
(crickets chirping)

1247
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:34,084
(fountain burbling)

1248
01:01:34,185 --> 01:01:35,914
Sunday night, 8:00.

1249
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,146
Place de I'Etang.

1250
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,815
Don't be late.

1251
01:01:39,924 --> 01:01:41,448
I shall see you then.

1252
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:48,223
(rattling)

1253
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:49,492
Oh, my God.
(screams)

1254
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,658
Help! Scorpions!

1255
01:01:50,768 --> 01:01:52,167
- Scorpions!
- Maddy!

1256
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:53,168
Help!

1257
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:55,432
Oh, my God.
(screams)

1258
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,199
Et vollà!

1259
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:56,932
(screams)

1260
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:59,134
Et vollà.

1261
01:01:59,243 --> 01:02:00,767
- La lavande...
- No, no!

1262
01:02:00,878 --> 01:02:02,436
(screams)

1263
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:04,071
La lavande...

1264
01:02:04,182 --> 01:02:07,379
(upbeat Latin-flavored
swing melody playing)

1265
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:18,585
##

1266
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:21,994
Mercl.

1267
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,193
You're welcome.

1268
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:37,606
##

1269
01:02:47,425 --> 01:02:49,893
##

1270
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,590
You dance very well, Ludivine.

1271
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,828
Thank you.

1272
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:01,063
I miss Henry.

1273
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:02,833
He was an excellent dancer.

1274
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,498
Yeah.

1275
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:06,839
(man singing)

1276
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:07,968
- Do you want to dance?
- Oh, oh, oh...

1277
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,103
Oh, what happened?

1278
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:11,340
Uh, the tennis with
(clears throat) Francis.

1279
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:13,644
Oh, poor boy. Do you
want me to put a bandage?

1280
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:14,843
No.

1281
01:03:14,952 --> 01:03:15,680
Antiseptic?

1282
01:03:15,787 --> 01:03:17,015
No.

1283
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:19,316
Oh, you are coming

1284
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:23,860
to our house tonight,
manger ce solr, to our home.

1285
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:25,019
Oul.

1286
01:03:25,129 --> 01:03:26,061
- Huh?
- Oul.

1287
01:03:26,164 --> 01:03:29,531
I am cooking for you, Max.

1288
01:03:30,735 --> 01:03:31,929
(clicks tongue)

1289
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:33,196
Mercl.

1290
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:36,000
- (man singing continues)
- (Ludivine humming to tune)

1291
01:03:54,058 --> 01:03:56,356
(music fading)

1292
01:03:57,595 --> 01:03:58,493
Bonjour.

1293
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:00,860
Vous parlez françals?

1294
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,694
Ouals.

1295
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,497
Francis Duflot, vigneron.

1296
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:08,538
Christie Roberts.

1297
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:09,833
Illegitimate daughter.

1298
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:10,873
(chuckles)

1299
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:13,569
The resemblance to
Henry is unmistakable.

1300
01:04:13,678 --> 01:04:14,645
The nose.

1301
01:04:14,745 --> 01:04:15,973
(both chuckling)

1302
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,517
For 23 years, I toiled
side-by-side with your father.

1303
01:04:20,618 --> 01:04:24,918
Even now, he works from
there and I from here.

1304
01:04:25,022 --> 01:04:28,014
That's when I first
planted the vines.

1305
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,719
But now they are sad and tired.

1306
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:31,726
Except here.

1307
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:34,195
Here?
No, it's catastrophic.

1308
01:04:34,298 --> 01:04:37,358
Nothing but rocks and grief.

1309
01:04:37,468 --> 01:04:39,902
CHRISTI E:
Limestones absorb the sunlight.

1310
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:41,938
Keep the vines warm at night.

1311
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:45,098
Wine brat.

1312
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,575
I spent summers working
in a vineyard in California.

1313
01:04:47,678 --> 01:04:49,111
(chuckles):
Oul, mals...

1314
01:04:49,213 --> 01:04:51,272
In California, they don't make wine.

1315
01:04:51,382 --> 01:04:52,713
They make Hawaiian Punch.

1316
01:04:52,817 --> 01:04:55,342
Mondavi might argue with that one.

1317
01:04:55,453 --> 01:04:56,613
Maybe Henry's daughter

1318
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:59,087
would be interested in
a personal tour in the vines.

1319
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,055
- Okay.
- Okay?

1320
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,991
If we are lucky,
his spirit will join us.

1321
01:05:05,396 --> 01:05:07,023
(sniffing)

1322
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:13,167
(sniffs)

1323
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:22,478
Paid to the order
of Francois Hupert, the plumber?

1324
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,512
How much?

1325
01:05:23,614 --> 01:05:25,707
Uh, 87 francs.

1326
01:05:25,816 --> 01:05:27,545
Mm...

1327
01:05:27,652 --> 01:05:29,017
sign!

1328
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,089
Henry Skinner.

1329
01:05:33,424 --> 01:05:35,119
- Next?
- The mechanic.

1330
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:37,160
Not a sous to that grease monkey.

1331
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:40,230
The old Jag's still coughing
like your Aunt Midge.

1332
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:41,628
Next.

1333
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:43,495
Uh, Jean-Pierre Lesourdre.

1334
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:44,761
How much?

1335
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:45,927
How much?

1336
01:05:46,037 --> 01:05:46,969
2,000 francs.

1337
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:49,005
Huh? Uh, okay, okay.

1338
01:05:50,675 --> 01:05:53,508
You're a genius, Maximillian.

1339
01:05:53,611 --> 01:05:55,272
You could be me.

1340
01:05:55,379 --> 01:05:56,607
(Henry laughs)

1341
01:05:56,714 --> 01:05:58,147
CHARLI E:
The photos worked like a charm.

1342
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,147
MAX: Really?

1343
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,683
Yeah, massive interest, Max.

1344
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:01,752
Wonderful.

1345
01:06:01,852 --> 01:06:03,615
Yes, money, money, money,
money, money.

1346
01:06:03,721 --> 01:06:06,451
So I decided it's time
I was on-site.

1347
01:06:06,557 --> 01:06:08,422
So I booked a flight.

1348
01:06:08,526 --> 01:06:10,118
I'll be with you tomorrow afternoon.

1349
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:11,319
Terrific.

1350
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:14,057
Well, I'll alert the staff
and chain up the dogs.

1351
01:06:14,165 --> 01:06:15,632
What do you mean, chain up the dogs?

1352
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:18,133
No, I don't have any dogs,
Charlie, that's a...

1353
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:20,294
that's just a figure of speech,
eh? Okay, bye.

1354
01:06:20,404 --> 01:06:22,565
(ambulance siren wailing)

1355
01:06:22,673 --> 01:06:25,699
(woman singing)

1356
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:39,921
(singing continues)

1357
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,258
(chuckling wryly)

1358
01:06:46,362 --> 01:06:48,296
Max!
(chuckles)

1359
01:06:48,398 --> 01:06:50,093
Pretty cool, huh?

1360
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,428
Bonsolr.

1361
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,297
(singing continues)

1362
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:54,301
Ça va?

1363
01:06:54,404 --> 01:06:56,099
Ça va...

1364
01:06:56,206 --> 01:06:57,468
Allez, we must have an appero.

1365
01:06:57,574 --> 01:07:00,407
We must have a big one.
Look at that.

1366
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,444
(chuckles)

1367
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:05,912
(singing continues)

1368
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:07,448
Ah, Ludivine.

1369
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,678
Ah, non, non, non,
je ne veux pas— Maxle!

1370
01:07:10,787 --> 01:07:11,845
Bonsolr.

1371
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:12,887
Hello.

1372
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:14,217
Ça va?

1373
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:15,154
Ça va?

1374
01:07:15,258 --> 01:07:16,520
Oh, mercl.

1375
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:18,651
C'est gentll, mercl, mercl, mercl...

1376
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:19,728
Of course.

1377
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:23,925
(speaking French)

1378
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:26,863
Ah, I took the liberty

1379
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:29,370
of inviting Henry's
daughter to join us.

1380
01:07:34,477 --> 01:07:35,239
Pastls?

1381
01:07:35,345 --> 01:07:36,312
- Oul.
- Allez.

1382
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,738
Bonsolr, coz.

1383
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:40,145
Bonsolr.

1384
01:07:41,217 --> 01:07:42,878
I see you've managed

1385
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:44,783
to ingratiate yourself
with the hired help.

1386
01:07:46,422 --> 01:07:47,548
Where'd you get the Halston?

1387
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:48,954
Dad's closet.

1388
01:07:49,058 --> 01:07:50,719
Ta-da.

1389
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:53,523
I wonder what she wore home.

1390
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,565
A simple meal after a day's work
in the fields.

1391
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,031
Eggplant...

1392
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:01,001
Caviar de Bergine—very good.
Headless larks.

1393
01:08:01,104 --> 01:08:03,095
Where are the heads? We didn't,
like, eat them already, did we?

1394
01:08:03,206 --> 01:08:04,104
No, no, no.

1395
01:08:04,207 --> 01:08:06,038
Uh, mushrooms of the region.

1396
01:08:06,142 --> 01:08:08,235
Et vollà...

1397
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:11,871
And finally civet
of wild boar

1398
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:15,610
marinated in red wine and blood
pressed from the carcass.

1399
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:17,982
Why would you have it any other way?

1400
01:08:18,087 --> 01:08:20,055
Allez, attaque.
Ludivine?

1401
01:08:20,156 --> 01:08:21,555
Help, help.

1402
01:08:21,658 --> 01:08:23,148
Wine, Max?

1403
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:24,317
La Siroque?

1404
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:25,325
Mals non.

1405
01:08:25,428 --> 01:08:26,122
Uh... Christie?

1406
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:27,719
- Wine?
- No, I'm okay.

1407
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:30,992
(gasps)

1408
01:08:31,097 --> 01:08:32,826
Oh, Papa.

1409
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:35,493
(groans)

1410
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:38,093
Papa speaks Provençal.

1411
01:08:38,204 --> 01:08:39,102
You know?

1412
01:08:39,205 --> 01:08:41,105
Oh, but very few
still understand it.

1413
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:43,801
It's now exclusively practiced

1414
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:46,936
by poets and sodomites.

1415
01:08:47,047 --> 01:08:48,947
What a sodomite is, by the way?

1416
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:51,574
I will explain you tonight.

1417
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:52,413
(chortling slurp)

1418
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:54,282
Francis.

1419
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:55,684
Mmm...

1420
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:57,188
Mmm...

1421
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,985
The asparagus is-is lovely.

1422
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:00,559
Mmm, thank you.

1423
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,821
Very chewy, but...

1424
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:04,021
Iovely.

1425
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,154
Eh, bravo, eh, Ludivine?

1426
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:07,165
MAX:
And the boar, mmm!

1427
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:10,395
Perhaps the best boar I've had.

1428
01:09:10,503 --> 01:09:11,561
Can I have some bread, please?

1429
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:13,332
Oh, yeah.

1430
01:09:14,874 --> 01:09:17,775
Francis, Francis?

1431
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:20,710
Papa, donne-mol ca, Papa.

1432
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:22,941
(both arguing at once)

1433
01:09:23,049 --> 01:09:24,607
Sorry.

1434
01:09:24,718 --> 01:09:26,185
C'est Le Coln Perdu.

1435
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:27,947
It's a local vln de garage, c'est...

1436
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:29,146
"Vln de garage?"

1437
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:30,722
CHRISTI E:
It's a garage wine.

1438
01:09:30,824 --> 01:09:32,382
Like a boutique wine.

1439
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:35,154
Small vineyards, small productions.

1440
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:37,320
Seriously big prices.

1441
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,227
It's overrated.

1442
01:09:39,332 --> 01:09:41,698
It didn't say that on the Web.

1443
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:44,827
Turns out Le Coin Perdu
is a Provençal legend.

1444
01:09:44,938 --> 01:09:46,405
It changes hands
among collectors,

1445
01:09:46,506 --> 01:09:48,633
but nobody knows who makes it.

1446
01:09:48,742 --> 01:09:51,210
Well, uh, it's time for fromage.

1447
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:52,471
Okay?

1448
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:54,137
LUDIVI NE:
You want, uh, fromage, cheese?

1449
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:56,340
- Allez.
- Allez.

1450
01:09:56,449 --> 01:09:58,917
FRANCIS: And now, now...

1451
01:09:59,019 --> 01:09:59,986
Papa? Papa?

1452
01:10:00,086 --> 01:10:01,883
Trouble you for a spot of the Coin?

1453
01:10:01,988 --> 01:10:03,478
You know what it is, Christie?

1454
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,024
It is Mar de Provence.
I made it myself.

1455
01:10:06,126 --> 01:10:07,787
CHRISTI E:
Wow.

1456
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:09,156
It's a little bit strong.

1457
01:10:09,262 --> 01:10:10,286
But very good.

1458
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:11,989
Chin-chin.

1459
01:10:12,098 --> 01:10:13,030
It's your father's recipe.

1460
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:14,600
Yes.

1461
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:15,531
Max.

1462
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:16,465
- Little bit?
- Oul, mercl.

1463
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:17,797
Tell-Tell us, Madame Duflot,

1464
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:22,398
what is it that makes you so
certain she is Henry's child?

1465
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:24,409
Oh, but of course.

1466
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,240
The nose.

1467
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:27,574
Oh, the nose.

1468
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,774
The glorious snout.
The prominent proboscis.

1469
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:32,716
Is there something else? Anything?

1470
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:34,878
No? Anything that might help

1471
01:10:34,988 --> 01:10:36,979
corroborate Christie's claim?

1472
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,157
Henry ever discuss California?

1473
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,494
Did he ever mention a woman
in California?

1474
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:48,260
(chuckling)

1475
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:50,563
It's funny, isn't it?
Any moments of drunken candor

1476
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:54,766
where he might have mentioned offspring?

1477
01:10:54,874 --> 01:10:56,000
No?

1478
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:57,542
I mean, seriously.

1479
01:10:57,644 --> 01:10:59,942
Oh, because the last person that

1480
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:02,913
Henry would ever consciously
breed with would be an American.

1481
01:11:03,016 --> 01:11:04,347
Yes, but, uh, in this moment,

1482
01:11:04,451 --> 01:11:07,682
I see more of Henry in Christie
than I do in you.

1483
01:11:07,787 --> 01:11:09,015
(laughing)

1484
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:10,749
CHRISTI E:
Max...

1485
01:11:10,857 --> 01:11:13,883
all I want is to learn
about my father.

1486
01:11:13,993 --> 01:11:17,053
This is my chance to find
out who made me and...

1487
01:11:17,163 --> 01:11:20,655
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

1488
01:11:25,405 --> 01:11:26,497
Oh!

1489
01:11:26,606 --> 01:11:27,937
Oh.

1490
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:29,474
(sighs, chair falls)

1491
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:31,535
Monsleur...

1492
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:34,477
Madame...
Papa Duflot...

1493
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,605
thanks for a lovely evening.

1494
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:37,580
Oh, Papa will walk you back.

1495
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:38,844
No, Ludivine, no.

1496
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:39,941
(Papa whimpering)

1497
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:40,917
The vines will guide me.

1498
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,920
Bonsolr.

1499
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:44,785
(Papa sighing)

1500
01:11:44,891 --> 01:11:45,858
Good night.

1501
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:47,449
- Whoa.
- It's okay?

1502
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,857
I'm okay.

1503
01:11:48,962 --> 01:11:50,088
Oh.

1504
01:11:55,435 --> 01:11:57,232
(hiccuping)

1505
01:11:57,337 --> 01:11:59,271
(frog croaking)

1506
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:00,703
(hiccuping)

1507
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:03,102
(hiccuping)

1508
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:06,675
(hiccups)

1509
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:10,141
(frog croaks)

1510
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,376
(hiccups)

1511
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:14,310
What are you doing?

1512
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,014
I lost my shoe.

1513
01:12:17,123 --> 01:12:18,112
What?

1514
01:12:18,224 --> 01:12:20,192
I lost my shoe.

1515
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:22,887
Why can't Henry be my dad?

1516
01:12:22,996 --> 01:12:25,055
Well, because now that
he's back in my life,

1517
01:12:25,165 --> 01:12:26,928
I'm not sure that
I want to share him.

1518
01:12:27,033 --> 01:12:28,694
You don't believe me, do you?

1519
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,770
Look, Christie, it's not a matter of that.

1520
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:35,170
Ludivine told me your parents
died when you were young.

1521
01:12:35,275 --> 01:12:38,767
You know, I... grew up
without a dad, too.

1522
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:40,368
Doesn't it matter to you

1523
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,972
that I may be the only
blood relative you have?

1524
01:12:45,385 --> 01:12:47,717
Yes, it does. That's why
I need to be sure.

1525
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,152
(groans)

1526
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,361
(groans)

1527
01:12:59,299 --> 01:13:01,597
Whoa... whoa!

1528
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,636
(panting)

1529
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:06,705
(snoring softly)

1530
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,741
This was my room
when I was a little boy.

1531
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:22,478
Sleeping here...

1532
01:13:22,589 --> 01:13:25,683
it was the safest place
in the world.

1533
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:29,819
No bedtimes, no chores.

1534
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:32,227
No squabbling adults.

1535
01:13:32,332 --> 01:13:34,994
I loved Henry deeply,
but I never got

1536
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:37,569
around to telling him.

1537
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:40,264
It's a shitty feeling.

1538
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:46,907
He was someone who saved my life.

1539
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:57,779
Thanks a million, Maximillian.

1540
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:04,223
Bloody hell, Henry.
Oh, where does it come back in?

1541
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,093
- Where does it come back in?
- LUDIVI NE: Maxie!

1542
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:08,099
Bugger cooked the books.

1543
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:13,829
(cell phone ringing)

1544
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,103
Yes?

1545
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,768
AMIS:
Max, my boy.

1546
01:14:18,878 --> 01:14:20,436
MAX:
Amis, you old cheese.

1547
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:22,480
AMIS:
So sorry to hear you're out.

1548
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:24,106
MAX:
Well, as usual, Amis,

1549
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:27,380
the only thing right about your intelligence
is that it's all wrong.

1550
01:14:27,487 --> 01:14:29,352
Then again, you always were
at the back of the conga line.

1551
01:14:29,455 --> 01:14:32,322
You've crossed the line
one too many times, "Sinner."

1552
01:14:32,425 --> 01:14:34,256
You little runt!

1553
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,659
By the by, thank you so much for
your very generous contribution

1554
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,459
to my Aston Martin fund.

1555
01:14:39,565 --> 01:14:40,964
Did you get the flowers?

1556
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:43,035
What flowers?
What are you talking about?

1557
01:14:43,136 --> 01:14:45,969
...little schemes and ploys...
- Do go on.

1558
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:47,198
Well, you're nothing.

1559
01:14:47,307 --> 01:14:48,433
Plonker.

1560
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,099
Oi! I heard that.

1561
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:51,836
Who you calling a plonker?

1562
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,435
You fat prat.

1563
01:14:53,546 --> 01:14:55,036
Hey? Hello?

1564
01:14:55,148 --> 01:14:56,809
- AMIS: Skinner?
- Bonjour.

1565
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,851
Hello. I'm Jean-Marie Bougnier.

1566
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,614
Yes?

1567
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:03,052
I've come to test the vines.

1568
01:15:03,156 --> 01:15:04,316
- Oh, the oenologue!
- Yeah.

1569
01:15:04,424 --> 01:15:07,325
Right, great. Um, well, grab
your boots and off we go.

1570
01:15:07,427 --> 01:15:09,418
Yeah.

1571
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,590
(cell phone ringing)

1572
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,827
Gemma, long time.

1573
01:15:15,935 --> 01:15:19,666
Max, I've just had a vision
of you serving Kenny

1574
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:21,535
a latte at Starbucks.

1575
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:24,007
Getting comfortable
in my chair, is he?

1576
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,168
GEMMA:
Yeah, listen.

1577
01:15:25,278 --> 01:15:30,045
Remember, we are not here
for the dental plan.

1578
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:31,844
Sell, sell.

1579
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:34,977
He's even taking credit
for your trade this week.

1580
01:15:35,088 --> 01:15:38,922
He's telling everyone in
the office that he was the one

1581
01:15:39,025 --> 01:15:40,322
that gave you the idea.

1582
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,587
Well, if he wasn't an ambitious
and mercenary little bastard,

1583
01:15:42,695 --> 01:15:45,061
I never would have given him
the job in the first place.

1584
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:47,064
Yeah, but, Max,
he's really trying to take...

1585
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,963
Gemma... just
give him his head

1586
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:50,558
and let him do what he needs to do.

1587
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,194
All right?
Tout à I'heure, Gemma.

1588
01:15:52,305 --> 01:15:53,829
Tout à I'heure.

1589
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,875
(sighs)

1590
01:15:56,976 --> 01:15:58,637
Well...

1591
01:15:58,745 --> 01:15:59,677
Plquette.

1592
01:15:59,779 --> 01:16:01,713
Wonderful, wonderful.

1593
01:16:01,814 --> 01:16:04,374
No, no, it mean, um...
it is bad, you know?

1594
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:05,951
Yeah.

1595
01:16:06,052 --> 01:16:08,282
Uh... shit.

1596
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:10,720
(speaking French)

1597
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:13,850
Chicken shit, no?

1598
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,224
(speaks French)

1599
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:18,422
It's very terrible,
this one, you know?

1600
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:22,433
It's like, um, in French
we say, um... mort.

1601
01:16:22,535 --> 01:16:23,627
It's completely dead.

1602
01:16:23,736 --> 01:16:25,931
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

1603
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:27,097
Look at this one; this is a...

1604
01:16:27,206 --> 01:16:29,140
It's a baby.
It is a baby.

1605
01:16:29,242 --> 01:16:31,176
Look at it.

1606
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:33,302
I test this one.

1607
01:16:33,413 --> 01:16:36,041
(speaking French)

1608
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:37,673
Wow.

1609
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,217
Catastrophe.

1610
01:16:39,318 --> 01:16:41,081
Very, very bad.

1611
01:16:41,187 --> 01:16:43,018
I am really sorry. Eh!

1612
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:51,753
More like a quarry than a vineyard.

1613
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:53,195
(chuckles)

1614
01:16:53,299 --> 01:16:55,062
Look at this—you know what it mean?

1615
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:56,226
(speaking French)

1616
01:16:56,335 --> 01:16:59,133
You cut off two of
every three bunches.

1617
01:16:59,238 --> 01:17:02,366
What's left gets all the nourishment,
you know?

1618
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:05,205
And why would you do that?

1619
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:07,905
Perhaps the peasants
got the time to salvage

1620
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:09,606
what they could, you know?

1621
01:17:09,715 --> 01:17:11,808
(laughing)

1622
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:13,146
(hollow chuckle)

1623
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:14,651
Right, um...

1624
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:15,948
I think I follow you.

1625
01:17:16,055 --> 01:17:19,024
Um, so wh-what's the verdict?

1626
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,922
Despite your vigneron's

1627
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:23,587
unbearable faults, you know,

1628
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:27,132
this terrolr is beyond help.

1629
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:30,532
Nothing, um... shit.

1630
01:17:30,636 --> 01:17:32,536
Nothing. No.

1631
01:17:32,638 --> 01:17:37,075
You might consider growing
potatoes or squash.

1632
01:17:37,176 --> 01:17:38,803
(laughing)

1633
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:42,074
I will have my office
send a report

1634
01:17:42,181 --> 01:17:43,512
and my invoice.

1635
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:45,447
Thank you.

1636
01:17:50,456 --> 01:17:51,923
Oi!

1637
01:17:52,024 --> 01:17:53,321
Wakey, wakey, beach bunny.

1638
01:17:53,426 --> 01:17:54,984
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

1639
01:17:55,094 --> 01:17:56,891
These are Henry's private papers.

1640
01:17:56,996 --> 01:17:58,691
They're irreplaceable.

1641
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:00,060
(groans)

1642
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:03,135
Did you know Dad mixed a martini
for Winston Churchill?

1643
01:18:03,236 --> 01:18:08,469
He also danced a waltz
with Amelia Earhart in 1975.

1644
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:11,042
Well, considering Amelia
Earhart died in the 1930s,

1645
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,611
that's a perfect
example of the type

1646
01:18:12,712 --> 01:18:14,373
of exaggerator Uncle Henry was.

1647
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,345
Want to know the real Uncle Henry?

1648
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:19,247
Not the one your overactive
imagination is manufacturing?

1649
01:18:19,352 --> 01:18:21,013
The real Henry Skinner
was a man so afraid

1650
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,781
of committing to the real world

1651
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:24,982
that he retreated from life
to drink and shag his way

1652
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,353
to a lonely and loveless end!

1653
01:18:28,427 --> 01:18:31,794
Everything I need to know
about my dad is right here.

1654
01:18:31,898 --> 01:18:34,423
It's right in front of me.

1655
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:37,128
You know, and if this place
meant as much to him

1656
01:18:37,236 --> 01:18:39,534
as I believe it did,

1657
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:40,799
you're worse than I thought

1658
01:18:40,907 --> 01:18:42,772
for even thinking about selling it.

1659
01:18:49,448 --> 01:18:52,508
I'll leave tomorrow.

1660
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:15,304
##

1661
01:19:34,627 --> 01:19:39,155
##

1662
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:44,669
YOUNG MAX:
Uncle Henry!

1663
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,737
HENRY:
Let's see you then.

1664
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:48,966
- One, two, and go!
- Yay!

1665
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:50,906
(Henry laughs)

1666
01:20:00,686 --> 01:20:03,655
##

1667
01:20:08,361 --> 01:20:11,228
(cell phone ringing)

1668
01:20:13,933 --> 01:20:14,900
Yes?

1669
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:16,263
CHARLI E:
Hello.

1670
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:17,666
You working out on the house?

1671
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,397
(sighs)
Charlie.

1672
01:20:19,505 --> 01:20:20,699
Yes, at it since daybreak.

1673
01:20:20,806 --> 01:20:22,273
Really.

1674
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:25,208
I hate to think of you toiling
down there, all on your own.

1675
01:20:25,311 --> 01:20:27,302
We're English, Charlie, you know?

1676
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:29,313
Born to rule and sacrifice.

1677
01:20:29,415 --> 01:20:30,541
Yes.

1678
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,311
Where are you?

1679
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:34,147
- I'm outside.
- (phone beeps off)

1680
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:39,457
(whispering):
Wow.

1681
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,919
Max, take my original estimate

1682
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:44,792
- and shove it up my ass.
- Shh!

1683
01:20:44,897 --> 01:20:46,558
- If I can't get you $5 million
- Charlie, shh-shh...

1684
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,566
for this baby, I'm in the wrong sport.

1685
01:20:48,668 --> 01:20:50,135
What?

1686
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:52,864
What?

1687
01:20:52,972 --> 01:20:54,166
Oh, dear.

1688
01:20:54,273 --> 01:20:55,240
Huh?

1689
01:20:55,341 --> 01:20:57,571
This is a disaster.

1690
01:20:57,677 --> 01:20:59,611
Mr. Froggy Wineman

1691
01:20:59,712 --> 01:21:01,577
has just knocked a million
off our sale price.

1692
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:02,705
Oh, bugger it, you know?

1693
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:04,180
We just go to plan two, right?

1694
01:21:04,283 --> 01:21:06,376
Just flog it as fast as we can
for as much as we can.

1695
01:21:06,485 --> 01:21:08,851
And just keep in mind
that the vigneron, Duflot,

1696
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:10,785
he stays on
as part of the deal, okay?

1697
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:11,948
- I'll do my best.
- Right.

1698
01:21:12,058 --> 01:21:13,252
Max?

1699
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:15,122
So what's on the agenda
for this evening?

1700
01:21:15,227 --> 01:21:16,592
Steak frlte?

1701
01:21:16,696 --> 01:21:18,823
Bottle of pastis?
Evening game of bridge?

1702
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,125
Charlie.

1703
01:21:20,232 --> 01:21:21,859
Charlie, please;
real men don't play bridge,

1704
01:21:21,967 --> 01:21:24,162
and, uh, I have a...

1705
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:27,000
an obligatory cultural activity
in the village this evening.

1706
01:21:27,106 --> 01:21:28,266
Can I come?

1707
01:21:28,374 --> 01:21:29,602
Will there be girls?

1708
01:21:29,709 --> 01:21:32,701
No and yes.

1709
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:37,246
So you're leaving
your best friend alone

1710
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:40,717
in an eerie château
on his first night?

1711
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,117
Charlie.

1712
01:21:42,221 --> 01:21:45,384
No. I'm leaving you alone.

1713
01:21:45,491 --> 01:21:48,619
And, um, you're not as alone
as you think you are.

1714
01:21:48,728 --> 01:21:49,956
You'll find a friend.

1715
01:21:50,062 --> 01:21:51,825
Okay?

1716
01:21:56,869 --> 01:21:59,470
(motorcycle starting)

1717
01:22:02,573 --> 01:22:05,872
(laughter and enthusiastic conversation)

1718
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,016
(phone rings)

1719
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,212
Max.

1720
01:22:17,321 --> 01:22:19,152
(laughs)
We thought you were dead.

1721
01:22:19,257 --> 01:22:20,986
Kenny, I've heard the word
that Monday's auction

1722
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:22,491
is going to trade like a turd.

1723
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:23,821
Oh, yeah?

1724
01:22:23,928 --> 01:22:24,986
A smart move

1725
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:30,261
would be to sell 28 gilt short
at, say, 99.10.

1726
01:22:30,368 --> 01:22:31,562
Good grief.

1727
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:33,136
Are you sure?

1728
01:22:33,237 --> 01:22:34,727
It's risky as hell;
it'd seriously piss off the markets.

1729
01:22:34,839 --> 01:22:36,101
Now, of course,

1730
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:38,402
I'm not allowed to do
the trading, Kenny, but, uh,

1731
01:22:38,509 --> 01:22:40,636
I'm sure that you'll share
the credit with me

1732
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:41,712
when the bouquets are passed around.

1733
01:22:41,812 --> 01:22:43,575
- Yes?
- All right, Max.

1734
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:46,275
- See you later.
- Righto.

1735
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:49,376
Boss, someone is shorting
Monday's gilt auction.

1736
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:54,222
Skinner.

1737
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:57,294
Not this time, you miserable sod.

1738
01:22:57,395 --> 01:22:58,657
(thunder rumbles)

1739
01:22:58,763 --> 01:23:00,890
ALL:
Buy!

1740
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:03,728
Get your hands
on as much as you can.

1741
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:07,670
(growling)

1742
01:23:07,772 --> 01:23:09,899
(slow, romantic music playing)

1743
01:23:10,007 --> 01:23:12,532
(man singing in French)

1744
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:24,846
(swishing)

1745
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,954
CHRISTI E:
Hello.

1746
01:23:31,062 --> 01:23:33,530
Hello.

1747
01:23:33,631 --> 01:23:35,064
Anyone there?

1748
01:23:36,133 --> 01:23:37,725
Hello?

1749
01:23:37,835 --> 01:23:39,427
Who are you?

1750
01:23:39,537 --> 01:23:42,097
I'm Charlie's friend Max.

1751
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:43,503
No, I'm not.

1752
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:45,302
I'm Max's friend Charlie.

1753
01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:48,970
Okay, Max's friend.

1754
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,517
I need you to come up here
and take a look at my back.

1755
01:23:58,022 --> 01:24:00,286
Thanks.

1756
01:24:00,391 --> 01:24:03,189
(overlapping chatter)

1757
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:08,726
(laughter)

1758
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:17,936
Have I told you you're a vision?

1759
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:20,636
Oul, from the bottom of the pool,

1760
01:24:20,745 --> 01:24:22,474
when you were peeking up my skirt.

1761
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,047
Gosh, guilty as charged.

1762
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:25,581
Sorry about that.

1763
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:29,282
- Bonsolr. You look lovely.
- Bonsolr.

1764
01:24:29,387 --> 01:24:30,854
You, too.

1765
01:24:30,955 --> 01:24:34,118
Sartorial elegance by Henri.

1766
01:24:34,225 --> 01:24:36,455
Wow.

1767
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,585
Le Coin Perdu?

1768
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,861
I've never actually seen a bottle.

1769
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:43,331
Have you heard of it?

1770
01:24:43,434 --> 01:24:45,254
It's expensive.

1771
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:46,118
It's expensive.

1772
01:24:46,222 --> 01:24:48,213
Are you trying to seduce me, Max?

1773
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,451
Oh, gosh.
No, of course not.

1774
01:24:50,559 --> 01:24:51,992
The thought would never
even cross my mind,

1775
01:24:52,094 --> 01:24:53,686
not more than six or ten times.

1776
01:24:56,532 --> 01:24:57,624
Um...

1777
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:01,101
Eh, right now,

1778
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:03,262
it's sort of the color of...

1779
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:05,169
ripe pomegranate.

1780
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:06,673
(sighs)

1781
01:25:06,775 --> 01:25:08,174
Bummer.

1782
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:11,007
Could you, uh... look

1783
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:13,138
in the medicine cabinet
for some aloe,

1784
01:25:13,249 --> 01:25:15,080
aspirin, bucket of ice.

1785
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:16,344
Yeah.

1786
01:25:16,452 --> 01:25:19,683
Uh, I'm Christie, by the way.

1787
01:25:19,788 --> 01:25:20,755
Charlie.

1788
01:25:20,856 --> 01:25:21,914
(groans)

1789
01:25:22,024 --> 01:25:22,991
How do you do?

1790
01:25:23,092 --> 01:25:25,026
(chuckles)
I love your accent.

1791
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:26,958
Thanks.

1792
01:25:27,062 --> 01:25:28,764
(softly):
Love your bum.

1793
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:29,788
(softly):
Love your bum.

1794
01:25:29,898 --> 01:25:32,389
(overlapping chatter)

1795
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:36,301
(brass-driven fanfare playing)

1796
01:25:36,405 --> 01:25:40,967
(man singing spry tune in French)

1797
01:25:41,076 --> 01:25:44,477
(laughter)

1798
01:25:54,757 --> 01:25:57,191
##

1799
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,793
(thunder rumbles)

1800
01:26:03,565 --> 01:26:07,023
There's something you
should know about me, Max.

1801
01:26:07,136 --> 01:26:08,034
Yes?

1802
01:26:08,137 --> 01:26:10,970
I'm very, very choosy.

1803
01:26:11,073 --> 01:26:13,303
Well, I'm very, very honored.

1804
01:26:15,377 --> 01:26:18,835
I'm also very,
very suspicious;

1805
01:26:18,947 --> 01:26:20,812
very, very irrational;

1806
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:23,009
and I have a very,
very short temper.

1807
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:24,813
(laughing)

1808
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,117
I'm also extremely jealous
and slow to forgive,

1809
01:26:28,223 --> 01:26:29,850
just so you know.

1810
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31,357
Well, this promises to be

1811
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,018
- a lovely evening.
- Mm.

1812
01:26:35,531 --> 01:26:37,158
I wouldn't go to Rome.

1813
01:26:37,266 --> 01:26:39,029
It is quite overcrowded.

1814
01:26:39,134 --> 01:26:42,194
I mean, there's more
tourists than pigeons.

1815
01:26:42,304 --> 01:26:45,569
I've got to go somewhere,
maybe Venice. Ow.

1816
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:47,266
Yeah, but it's sinking.

1817
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:49,435
You know, one false move,

1818
01:26:49,545 --> 01:26:51,979
fall in the canal— sorry.

1819
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:53,776
Run down by a gondolier.

1820
01:26:53,882 --> 01:26:56,874
Whereas London has got it all,

1821
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:59,010
including your own

1822
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:02,215
personal tour guide: Mol.

1823
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:04,315
(gasps)
Charlie.

1824
01:27:04,426 --> 01:27:06,121
(sighs)

1825
01:27:06,228 --> 01:27:07,593
Concentrate.

1826
01:27:07,696 --> 01:27:09,789
Sorry.

1827
01:27:09,898 --> 01:27:12,799
(song continues)

1828
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:21,008
(thunder rumbling fiercely)

1829
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,573
(patrons screaming)

1830
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:35,184
(shouting)

1831
01:27:37,926 --> 01:27:39,416
Alone at last.

1832
01:27:39,528 --> 01:27:41,723
You've been candid with me, so I

1833
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:43,092
should be candid with you.

1834
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,861
I'm famously callous,

1835
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:49,961
even to the point
of being insensitive.

1836
01:27:51,673 --> 01:27:55,109
And I have an absolute
inability to trust anyone.

1837
01:27:57,312 --> 01:28:01,248
The only person I ever loved
was my Uncle Henry, and...

1838
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,716
I didn't contact him for
the last ten years of his life.

1839
01:28:06,755 --> 01:28:08,916
He often expressed great sadness,

1840
01:28:09,024 --> 01:28:12,790
as though he thought
you had been lost.

1841
01:28:12,895 --> 01:28:14,658
You knew him?

1842
01:28:14,763 --> 01:28:16,458
As a woman living here,

1843
01:28:16,565 --> 01:28:18,430
it was impossible not to know him.

1844
01:28:18,534 --> 01:28:20,399
Right.

1845
01:28:20,502 --> 01:28:21,867
Um, he didn't, by any chance,

1846
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,198
ever get out the Edmundo records

1847
01:28:23,305 --> 01:28:24,897
- (chuckles)
- And do the, um...

1848
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:26,702
Rumba?

1849
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,175
No.

1850
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:32,042
Thank you.

1851
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:34,012
(chuckles):
But of course I tried.

1852
01:28:34,116 --> 01:28:36,880
Well, you would, 'cause he
was absolutely lovable.

1853
01:28:36,985 --> 01:28:40,216
Yes.

1854
01:28:40,322 --> 01:28:41,812
I can't for the life
of me think of why

1855
01:28:41,924 --> 01:28:44,119
I stopped coming down here.

1856
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:48,255
I love this place.

1857
01:28:48,363 --> 01:28:50,456
It's intoxicating.

1858
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:59,600
(Fanny gasping passionately)

1859
01:29:05,347 --> 01:29:07,440
(moans)

1860
01:29:16,658 --> 01:29:19,456
##

1861
01:29:25,701 --> 01:29:29,262
(chuckles lightly)

1862
01:29:29,371 --> 01:29:32,568
(laughs)

1863
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,614
(door squeaks)

1864
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:42,775
CHARLI E (in distance):
Scorpions! Agh!

1865
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:44,284
Ow!

1866
01:29:44,386 --> 01:29:46,013
- Scorpions!
- Mm.

1867
01:29:46,121 --> 01:29:47,748
(yelling at Tati in French)

1868
01:29:47,856 --> 01:29:50,347
There are scorpions in my bedroom!

1869
01:29:53,762 --> 01:29:56,094
I must go to work.

1870
01:29:56,198 --> 01:29:58,792
Isn't that usually the man's line?

1871
01:30:05,507 --> 01:30:06,974
Do you know the reason

1872
01:30:07,075 --> 01:30:09,737
why I spent the night with you?

1873
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:16,216
It is because once you have done
what you came here to do,

1874
01:30:16,318 --> 01:30:18,445
you will not return.

1875
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:22,854
For us, there can be no future.

1876
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:27,088
There is safety in that.

1877
01:30:28,163 --> 01:30:30,529
Well...

1878
01:30:33,135 --> 01:30:34,500
...there's absolutely nothing

1879
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:37,970
stopping us from setting up
your café in Notting Hill.

1880
01:30:38,073 --> 01:30:39,563
- (laughing)
- London definitely needs

1881
01:30:39,675 --> 01:30:40,539
a decent bistro.

1882
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:42,371
Mm.

1883
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:45,605
How typical... to assume

1884
01:30:45,714 --> 01:30:48,945
that I live in Provence
because I have no choice.

1885
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:52,612
Fanny, this place just
doesn't suit my life.

1886
01:30:52,721 --> 01:30:54,780
No, Max.

1887
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:59,156
It is your life
that doesn't suit this place.

1888
01:31:03,365 --> 01:31:06,232
Au revolr.

1889
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:18,341
What happened to the diving board?

1890
01:31:20,415 --> 01:31:21,780
Hmm.

1891
01:31:21,883 --> 01:31:25,114
We did quite well, didn't we?

1892
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,983
Yeah, I don't think we did
too badly, considering

1893
01:31:27,089 --> 01:31:29,557
the oenologue's report.

1894
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:35,321
You know, Charlie...

1895
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:39,196
...I think I'm in love.

1896
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:40,495
I don't blame you, mate.

1897
01:31:40,602 --> 01:31:42,661
She's a goddess,
even if she is your cousin.

1898
01:31:42,771 --> 01:31:44,898
Not Christie, you silly sod.

1899
01:31:45,007 --> 01:31:48,170
My, um...

1900
01:31:48,276 --> 01:31:51,074
my obligatory cultural activity is a girl.

1901
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:52,942
- Oh.
- A woman.

1902
01:31:53,048 --> 01:31:54,879
Fanny Chenal.

1903
01:31:54,983 --> 01:31:56,644
Ooh, la la.

1904
01:31:58,453 --> 01:32:00,478
I've been thinking,
perhaps I shouldn't sell.

1905
01:32:00,589 --> 01:32:02,079
(with French accent):
Max, I think

1906
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:04,488
at the moment,
your whole body is covered

1907
01:32:04,593 --> 01:32:06,584
in the eau de French girl,

1908
01:32:06,695 --> 01:32:09,027
and when you have
had a cold shower,

1909
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,224
things will look
a little bit different.

1910
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,358
I could keep it as
a pied-à-terre, a weekender,

1911
01:32:13,468 --> 01:32:14,833
holiday house, you know.

1912
01:32:14,936 --> 01:32:17,803
Can I remind you what happened
when your boss and mentor,

1913
01:32:17,906 --> 01:32:22,104
a man you loved, took his
first holiday in 15 years.

1914
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,768
I stole his job.

1915
01:32:23,879 --> 01:32:25,403
Exact.

1916
01:32:25,514 --> 01:32:27,106
Max Skinner doesn't do weekends.

1917
01:32:27,215 --> 01:32:28,614
Max Skinner doesn't take holidays.

1918
01:32:28,717 --> 01:32:30,048
Max Skinner...

1919
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:34,689
...makes money.

1920
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:37,281
So do what you do best, Max.

1921
01:32:37,392 --> 01:32:39,724
Hmm?

1922
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:41,693
If you're going to sell it,

1923
01:32:41,797 --> 01:32:43,731
you got to sign it.

1924
01:32:43,832 --> 01:32:47,268
(man singing in French)

1925
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:49,929
(singing continues)

1926
01:32:57,045 --> 01:32:59,172
Shh.

1927
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:03,650
(singing)

1928
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:05,811
Why is he singing to them,
Uncle Henry?

1929
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:07,616
Well, you see, Max,

1930
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:10,658
the terrolr needs more
than southern rain.

1931
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:13,159
It needs harmony.

1932
01:33:13,261 --> 01:33:15,786
It needs balance.

1933
01:33:15,897 --> 01:33:19,162
(Duflot humming)

1934
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:29,174
(singing same song)

1935
01:33:31,346 --> 01:33:33,507
My whole life,
people laughed at me

1936
01:33:33,615 --> 01:33:35,242
for singing to the vines.

1937
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:39,218
I explained that, someday,
the vines would sing back.

1938
01:33:39,321 --> 01:33:41,881
Here, they finally have.

1939
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:44,891
You don't know what you are doing.

1940
01:33:44,993 --> 01:33:46,358
What are you talking about?

1941
01:33:46,461 --> 01:33:47,553
Here...

1942
01:33:47,662 --> 01:33:49,596
Le Coin Perdu.

1943
01:33:49,698 --> 01:33:51,723
It's not possible.

1944
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:54,131
The oenologue said you couldn't
even grow squash or potatoes...

1945
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:55,533
No, no, no, no, no.

1946
01:33:55,637 --> 01:33:58,299
The oenologue was paid to say that.

1947
01:33:58,406 --> 01:34:01,034
We thought that if you believed
La Siroque had no value,

1948
01:34:01,143 --> 01:34:03,941
you would leave things
as they were,

1949
01:34:04,045 --> 01:34:05,706
so the status quo.

1950
01:34:05,814 --> 01:34:07,805
Why didn't you tell me this before?

1951
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:08,883
Why didn't you trust me?

1952
01:34:08,984 --> 01:34:11,953
Max, would you trust you?

1953
01:34:12,053 --> 01:34:14,419
These vines, they are illegal.

1954
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:16,821
Your uncle always intended

1955
01:34:16,925 --> 01:34:19,086
to leave the estate to you,

1956
01:34:19,194 --> 01:34:21,458
but he worried about
what you had become.

1957
01:34:21,563 --> 01:34:25,556
"My nephew is selfish,"
he used to say.

1958
01:34:25,667 --> 01:34:27,828
"How can I give this
place to a man

1959
01:34:27,936 --> 01:34:31,235
who can't even appreciate
the simple pleasures of life?"

1960
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:33,899
So it was never written.

1961
01:34:34,009 --> 01:34:36,944
(chuckles)
Plus, fate took him

1962
01:34:37,045 --> 01:34:39,036
before he could decide what to do.

1963
01:34:41,116 --> 01:34:44,210
I've already sold it.

1964
01:34:47,489 --> 01:34:49,684
Then you have done
the very thing

1965
01:34:49,791 --> 01:34:51,258
your uncle feared you would do.

1966
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:56,661
You have sold his spirit
to the highest bidder, Max,

1967
01:34:56,765 --> 01:35:00,257
and betrayed the only man
who ever cared for you.

1968
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:08,400
Here, Max.

1969
01:35:10,045 --> 01:35:13,640
Here was Henry's fuck-you money!

1970
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,427
(thunder rumbling)

1971
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,794
(inhaling)

1972
01:35:32,901 --> 01:35:35,062
(glass tinging)

1973
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:36,899
This one.

1974
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:38,905
Ah, well chosen.

1975
01:35:39,007 --> 01:35:41,475
It's not quite there yet.

1976
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:43,441
Once you find
something good, Max,

1977
01:35:43,545 --> 01:35:45,410
you have to take care of it.

1978
01:35:45,513 --> 01:35:47,276
You have to let it grow.

1979
01:35:58,393 --> 01:36:00,384
Christie.

1980
01:36:00,495 --> 01:36:02,554
What are you doing?
You can't just leave.

1981
01:36:02,664 --> 01:36:03,562
Sure, I can.

1982
01:36:03,665 --> 01:36:05,132
Well, what about last night?

1983
01:36:05,233 --> 01:36:07,360
I nursed you through
second-degree burns.

1984
01:36:07,469 --> 01:36:09,596
You were sweet.

1985
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:12,036
And I seriously damaged
the ends of my fingers.

1986
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,108
Frostbitten?

1987
01:36:14,209 --> 01:36:15,972
Like your heart.

1988
01:36:20,348 --> 01:36:22,145
Bye, Charlie.

1989
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,083
Bye, Christie.

1990
01:36:25,186 --> 01:36:26,813
(sighs)

1991
01:36:36,464 --> 01:36:37,931
Where you headed?

1992
01:36:38,033 --> 01:36:39,898
Not exactly sure.

1993
01:36:40,001 --> 01:36:41,525
I brought you something.

1994
01:36:41,636 --> 01:36:43,160
Your book.

1995
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:44,761
You didn't finish it.

1996
01:36:49,711 --> 01:36:51,702
Christie?

1997
01:36:52,914 --> 01:36:55,212
You do have his nose.

1998
01:36:58,219 --> 01:36:59,550
Au revolr.

1999
01:36:59,654 --> 01:37:02,122
Au revolr, coz.

2000
01:37:06,127 --> 01:37:07,924
HENRY:
Dear Max,

2001
01:37:08,029 --> 01:37:10,793
I know It's been many years
slnce we last spoke,

2002
01:37:10,899 --> 01:37:13,561
but I find myself
In a blt of a jam,

2003
01:37:13,668 --> 01:37:15,932
and I'm afrald I need your help.

2004
01:37:16,037 --> 01:37:19,666
The thlng Is, Max, old boy, I'm dylng.

2005
01:37:19,774 --> 01:37:22,299
I know thls because, uh,
Dr. Karr, my physlclan,

2006
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,742
has stopped talklng
about my health

2007
01:37:24,846 --> 01:37:27,144
and begun dlscusslng the weather.

2008
01:37:27,248 --> 01:37:31,309
Convlnced that death,
llke all tradesmen,

2009
01:37:31,419 --> 01:37:33,979
would be unable
to find my front door,

2010
01:37:34,089 --> 01:37:36,353
and havlng always
belleved wllls

2011
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,756
to be wrltten Invltatlons
to the Reaper,

2012
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:42,318
I find myself lmpelled
to lmpress upon your klndness.

2013
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:47,831
I have a daughter, :
Her name Is Chrlstle Roberts.

2014
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:50,234
Sadly, we have never met.

2015
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:52,602
Her mother's name was Alllson.

2016
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:56,302
She was a tour gulde
at a tlny vlneyard

2017
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,538
In Northern Callfornla.

2018
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:00,238
Max, I should llke you
to find her,

2019
01:38:00,348 --> 01:38:02,339
and to thls end,
I should llke to leave her

2020
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:05,044
what Is rlghtfully hers.

2021
01:38:05,153 --> 01:38:08,247
I hope thls declslon
doesn't hurt your feellngs,

2022
01:38:08,356 --> 01:38:11,257
and as successful as you are,
you don't need lt.

2023
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:13,623
I hope you understand,

2024
01:38:13,728 --> 01:38:16,253
because, for me,
even In lts present state,

2025
01:38:16,364 --> 01:38:19,765
La Slroque Is a place of maglc,

2026
01:38:19,868 --> 01:38:22,302
and It Is my heartfelt wlsh

2027
01:38:22,404 --> 01:38:26,704
that Chrlstle should share
In that maglc.

2028
01:38:26,808 --> 01:38:29,368
I llke to thlnk ofher here.

2029
01:38:29,477 --> 01:38:33,709
After all, she and La Slroque
are all I leave behlnd.

2030
01:38:33,815 --> 01:38:35,407
Your lovlng uncle...

2031
01:38:35,517 --> 01:38:36,916
MAX:
Your loving uncle,

2032
01:38:37,018 --> 01:38:38,713
HENRY:
Henry Sklnner.

2033
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:42,051
MAX:
Henry Skinner.

2034
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:49,557
Il est un petlt, um, wrinkle.

2035
01:38:49,664 --> 01:38:51,632
What do you mean? What...
What sort of wrinkle?

2036
01:38:51,733 --> 01:38:52,791
Uh...

2037
01:38:54,869 --> 01:38:57,030
Ah, Genghis, back from the dead.

2038
01:38:57,138 --> 01:38:58,332
Just a lovely tie.

2039
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,170
Do tell your mother
I admire her taste.

2040
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:02,743
Welcome back, boss.

2041
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:05,574
Oh... I bet.

2042
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,477
KENNY:
You wanker!

2043
01:39:07,582 --> 01:39:09,447
Kenneth. Nice haircut.

2044
01:39:09,551 --> 01:39:10,677
You set me up.

2045
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:11,877
Oh, dear boy,

2046
01:39:11,986 --> 01:39:13,647
you haven't been fired
in my absence, have you?

2047
01:39:13,755 --> 01:39:14,881
A short order.

2048
01:39:14,989 --> 01:39:16,923
Did my nuts in
in less than an hour.

2049
01:39:17,025 --> 01:39:18,253
You didn't?
That's unfortunate, dear boy.

2050
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:21,157
Lost us six million quid.

2051
01:39:21,262 --> 01:39:23,730
Couldn't have anything to do
with me, Kenny. I was suspended.

2052
01:39:23,832 --> 01:39:25,925
You bastard!

2053
01:39:26,034 --> 01:39:27,433
Morning, lab rats.

2054
01:39:27,535 --> 01:39:28,695
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, Max.

2055
01:39:28,803 --> 01:39:30,327
Morning, Max.

2056
01:39:34,976 --> 01:39:37,410
Bonjour, Jasmlnda.

2057
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,843
Ça va?

2058
01:39:40,949 --> 01:39:42,041
Bonjour?

2059
01:39:44,252 --> 01:39:46,379
You look different.

2060
01:39:46,488 --> 01:39:48,012
Give me everything
I need to read to catch up

2061
01:39:48,123 --> 01:39:49,954
and an espresso.

2062
01:39:50,058 --> 01:39:51,787
Max?

2063
01:39:51,893 --> 01:39:53,326
Hmm?

2064
01:39:53,428 --> 01:39:55,896
Sir Nigel's waiting for you.

2065
01:39:55,997 --> 01:39:58,488
Make it a double.

2066
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,296
(speaking German)

2067
01:40:10,845 --> 01:40:12,836
(Nigel continues speaking German)

2068
01:40:29,597 --> 01:40:33,727
Auf Wlederherren.

2069
01:40:40,108 --> 01:40:42,838
Van Gogh.

2070
01:40:44,913 --> 01:40:47,882
Hope you've got a good lock
on the door, sir.

2071
01:40:47,982 --> 01:40:49,347
Don't be soft.

2072
01:40:49,450 --> 01:40:50,610
It's not real.

2073
01:40:50,718 --> 01:40:52,413
The real one's in my vault.

2074
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,885
It's a copy.

2075
01:40:53,988 --> 01:40:56,891
200 grand for a knockoff.

2076
01:40:56,891 --> 01:40:57,823
200 grand for a knockoff.

2077
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:00,520
Sit.

2078
01:41:01,596 --> 01:41:06,056
Art's a passion, Max.

2079
01:41:06,167 --> 01:41:07,828
Got to have passions.

2080
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:11,895
I have horses, cars, money...

2081
01:41:12,006 --> 01:41:13,268
Are they passions or vices, sir?

2082
01:41:13,374 --> 01:41:15,274
Have I finished talking?

2083
01:41:17,245 --> 01:41:19,440
When I finish talking,
that's when you talk,

2084
01:41:19,547 --> 01:41:21,515
and it better be good!

2085
01:41:21,616 --> 01:41:24,278
While you've been
on your little holiday,

2086
01:41:24,385 --> 01:41:26,819
I've been in a shitstorm!

2087
01:41:26,921 --> 01:41:31,290
Sir, I do appreciate that my actions
may have caused some...

2088
01:41:31,392 --> 01:41:32,723
Max...

2089
01:41:34,062 --> 01:41:37,361
You're one of the ballsiest
traders in this square mile,

2090
01:41:37,465 --> 01:41:39,228
but you've got to learn
there are consequences

2091
01:41:39,334 --> 01:41:43,031
to your sort of behavior.

2092
01:41:44,072 --> 01:41:46,973
There it is.

2093
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:51,203
You have one hour.

2094
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:57,578
So, shall I pack my Smurfs?

2095
01:42:05,727 --> 01:42:07,695
(quiet, melancholy theme plays)

2096
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:16,667
(birds chirping in distance)

2097
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:18,830
HENRY:
Oh, Max!

2098
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,601
Look after Madame Chenal's
daughter, Fanny,

2099
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:22,801
while I give her mother
a tour of the estate.

2100
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:24,775
Uh, but I really want to finish
the last chapter

2101
01:42:24,879 --> 01:42:26,471
of Death In Venlce.

2102
01:42:26,581 --> 01:42:28,105
Well, given the book's title,

2103
01:42:28,216 --> 01:42:30,980
I don't think you'll be
surprised by the ending.

2104
01:42:31,085 --> 01:42:32,347
CHENAL:
You be good, Fanny.

2105
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:33,511
HENRY:
Come now, Madame Chenal.

2106
01:42:33,621 --> 01:42:35,384
There are many attractions
here at La Siroque,

2107
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:39,586
beginning with the view,
as seen from my bedroom.

2108
01:42:39,694 --> 01:42:41,855
(slurps)

2109
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:46,799
(Henry laughs in distance)

2110
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:49,927
(samba music begins playing
from inside the house)

2111
01:43:02,984 --> 01:43:04,884
(music continues)

2112
01:43:11,492 --> 01:43:13,084
(Chenal laughing)

2113
01:43:13,194 --> 01:43:16,095
(man singing)

2114
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:29,674
(whispering)

2115
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,385
(song fades)

2116
01:43:39,787 --> 01:43:42,984
That's a lot of zeros, Max.

2117
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:45,616
Or a full partnership for life.

2118
01:43:45,727 --> 01:43:48,389
My choice.

2119
01:43:49,464 --> 01:43:51,762
Now you listen to Mommy, Max.

2120
01:43:51,866 --> 01:43:55,302
Partner—you're made for life.

2121
01:43:55,403 --> 01:43:57,098
Sir Nigel didn't become partner
till he was 53,

2122
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:59,696
and look at him.

2123
01:43:59,807 --> 01:44:02,867
Yes.

2124
01:44:02,977 --> 01:44:05,946
Look at him.

2125
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:11,074
Now what's it to be:
The money

2126
01:44:11,185 --> 01:44:14,518
or your life?

2127
01:44:16,524 --> 01:44:18,287
When do you ever see it, Nige?

2128
01:44:18,393 --> 01:44:20,884
The real one?

2129
01:44:20,995 --> 01:44:22,121
When do you look at it?

2130
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:24,255
Do you make late-night
pilgrimages down to the vault

2131
01:44:24,365 --> 01:44:26,333
just to see it or?

2132
01:44:26,434 --> 01:44:29,426
What point are you making?

2133
01:44:32,273 --> 01:44:36,403
(music playing softly in background,
people chattering)

2134
01:44:45,386 --> 01:44:47,445
(quiet, contemplative
theme playing)

2135
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:57,761
(speaking French)

2136
01:44:59,867 --> 01:45:02,131
Bonjour.
(speaking French)

2137
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:09,638
I think so.

2138
01:45:11,712 --> 01:45:14,272
You sure you don't need more time?

2139
01:45:14,382 --> 01:45:16,680
No, I know what I want.

2140
01:45:16,784 --> 01:45:19,412
You're sure?

2141
01:45:21,122 --> 01:45:23,852
Absolutely.

2142
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,719
So, what is it to be?

2143
01:45:29,831 --> 01:45:33,130
How's the soup?

2144
01:45:33,234 --> 01:45:35,862
The soup is finished.

2145
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:38,200
Like my job.

2146
01:45:41,976 --> 01:45:43,238
The fish?

2147
01:45:43,344 --> 01:45:46,074
We've run out.

2148
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:49,513
That's like me with excuses.

2149
01:45:51,586 --> 01:45:52,951
Don't waste my time.

2150
01:45:53,054 --> 01:45:54,885
Choose something we have.

2151
01:45:58,259 --> 01:45:59,521
I would like a lifetime spent

2152
01:45:59,627 --> 01:46:02,619
with an irrational
and suspicious goddess.

2153
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,792
Some short-tempered jealousy
on the side...

2154
01:46:11,339 --> 01:46:14,570
...and a bottle of wine
that tastes like you...

2155
01:46:14,675 --> 01:46:16,836
and a glass that's never empty.

2156
01:46:39,233 --> 01:46:43,761
You remember what
I whispered to you

2157
01:46:43,871 --> 01:46:46,965
when we were kids in the pool.

2158
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:49,702
And it seems that you do, too.

2159
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:52,244
Blen sur.

2160
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:55,281
But it was not
until just now

2161
01:46:55,383 --> 01:47:00,377
that I recognized you: Max.

2162
01:47:10,726 --> 01:47:13,251
(people chatting and laughing)

2163
01:47:23,406 --> 01:47:25,306
(slow, pleasant theme playing)

2164
01:47:25,408 --> 01:47:28,343
(Duflot and Christie arguing)

2165
01:47:28,444 --> 01:47:30,344
CHRISTI E:
I said no.

2166
01:47:30,446 --> 01:47:31,504
DUFLOT:
What, "No, no, no, no."

2167
01:47:31,614 --> 01:47:33,844
No way. You are not
de-stemming those grapes.

2168
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:35,144
But this is the way

2169
01:47:35,251 --> 01:47:36,843
I've always done things, you know.

2170
01:47:36,953 --> 01:47:38,887
We want structure
and color for the wine.

2171
01:47:38,988 --> 01:47:41,479
CHRISTI E: Leaving the stems on
when we press will give it a kick in the ass.

2172
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,490
DUFLOT:
And the wine will taste like rocket fuel.

2173
01:47:43,592 --> 01:47:44,650
CHRISTI E:
No way!

2174
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,784
You are not de-stemming
those grapes.

2175
01:47:45,895 --> 01:47:47,453
DUFLOT:
All acids and tannins.

2176
01:47:47,563 --> 01:47:48,791
Oh, you say acid and tannins...

2177
01:47:48,898 --> 01:47:49,865
Yes, I say tannins...

2178
01:47:49,966 --> 01:47:51,866
I say flavor and cojones, you know,

2179
01:47:51,968 --> 01:47:53,265
- Barolo super Tuscans.
- Whoa.

2180
01:47:53,369 --> 01:47:54,233
That's what's selling out there.

2181
01:47:54,337 --> 01:47:56,430
Not some wimpy wine from Louveron!

2182
01:47:58,507 --> 01:48:00,634
Ah, Max.
Thank God you're here.

2183
01:48:00,743 --> 01:48:03,678
I will not work with this
mad person jamals! Never!

2184
01:48:05,147 --> 01:48:09,083
I love her, this woman, she...

2185
01:48:09,185 --> 01:48:11,915
she's like Henry, with a nice ass.

2186
01:48:14,323 --> 01:48:16,314
Oh...

2187
01:48:16,425 --> 01:48:18,325
I can't deal with this guy, Max.

2188
01:48:18,427 --> 01:48:22,796
What is it with the French?

2189
01:48:22,898 --> 01:48:26,334
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

2190
01:48:26,435 --> 01:48:27,834
you were running low
on green ink,

2191
01:48:27,937 --> 01:48:29,700
so I bought you some more.

2192
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:32,865
- Never know.
- (phone ringing)

2193
01:48:32,975 --> 01:48:36,411
You might want to write
a letter or something.

2194
01:48:40,883 --> 01:48:41,872
Yes?

2195
01:48:41,984 --> 01:48:43,349
CHARLI E:
Max, how's Christie?

2196
01:48:43,452 --> 01:48:46,046
How's the sale going, Charlie?

2197
01:48:46,155 --> 01:48:47,417
Apartments in this bracket
shift in a blink.

2198
01:48:47,523 --> 01:48:50,151
I'm very confident of getting
you more than you paid for it.

2199
01:48:50,259 --> 01:48:51,283
Bullshit, Charlie.

2200
01:48:51,394 --> 01:48:52,952
If you don't give me
a 40% yield,

2201
01:48:53,062 --> 01:48:54,529
you're off the gig, Sunshine.
You got me?

2202
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:55,756
(Charlie laughs)

2203
01:48:55,865 --> 01:48:58,527
Max, you do realize, of course,

2204
01:48:58,634 --> 01:49:00,465
it's not going to last
down there, don't you?

2205
01:49:00,569 --> 01:49:02,093
You don't say.

2206
01:49:02,204 --> 01:49:04,570
And as impossible
as it may seem,

2207
01:49:04,673 --> 01:49:07,574
the very things that are
so unique and sexy now,

2208
01:49:07,676 --> 01:49:11,112
will soon be the dread
of your day-to-day existence.

2209
01:49:11,213 --> 01:49:13,841
And after a few months of eating

2210
01:49:13,949 --> 01:49:16,679
and drinking and sleeping,

2211
01:49:16,786 --> 01:49:20,313
and shagging, what have you got
to look forward to, huh?

2212
01:49:20,423 --> 01:49:21,890
Boredom.

2213
01:49:21,991 --> 01:49:23,322
(Max sighs)

2214
01:49:23,426 --> 01:49:27,192
I mean, what are you going
to do, write a book? Hmm?

2215
01:49:28,597 --> 01:49:30,087
Max, I'm your best friend,

2216
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:32,190
and I'm telling you, you won't last.

2217
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:34,895
We'll see about that, Charlie.

2218
01:49:35,004 --> 01:49:36,335
DUFLOT:
Okay, okay, okay.

2219
01:49:36,439 --> 01:49:37,406
Like this, I-I...

2220
01:49:37,506 --> 01:49:41,237
(speaking indistinctly)

2221
01:49:49,718 --> 01:49:52,084
You know, that was Charlie
on the phone...

2222
01:49:52,188 --> 01:49:53,155
Ah, no, no, no.

2223
01:49:59,195 --> 01:50:00,560
Un arbre.

2224
01:50:04,533 --> 01:50:05,591
Olseau.

2225
01:50:47,743 --> 01:50:49,711
(quiet, pleasant theme playing)

2226
01:50:53,616 --> 01:50:57,313
(people laughing and cheering
in distance)

2227
01:50:57,419 --> 01:51:00,183
(talking excitedly)

2228
01:51:12,001 --> 01:51:14,936
So, uh, are you an actual rapper?

2229
01:51:16,908 --> 01:51:18,808
No, he's the rapper.
I'm the manager.

2230
01:51:20,178 --> 01:51:21,941
Mm.

2231
01:51:23,348 --> 01:51:25,407
I'm Jasminda, by the way.

2232
01:51:25,517 --> 01:51:26,779
Gemma for short.

2233
01:51:28,035 --> 01:51:30,595
(women vocalizing)

2234
01:51:30,704 --> 01:51:34,367
(man singing in French)

2235
01:51:34,475 --> 01:51:35,737
Bollocks!

2236
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:48,813
(tires screeching)

2237
01:51:52,593 --> 01:51:55,562
(inhales deeply)

2238
01:51:55,663 --> 01:51:56,652
Oh.

2239
01:52:03,604 --> 01:52:04,662
(spits)

2240
01:52:08,175 --> 01:52:09,608
Shh.

2241
01:52:14,715 --> 01:52:17,843
(man singing continues)

2242
01:52:17,952 --> 01:52:20,853

(swishing, spitting)

2247
01:52:34,235 --> 01:52:37,204

(barks)

2250
01:52:51,285 --> 01:52:52,309
- Be in touch.

2251
01:52:52,419 --> 01:52:55,286
