- Mom, it's me. It's Josh.

158

- Stop it! Oh, God!

159
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:47,365
I made a wish last night.
I turned into a grown-up, Mom.

160
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,924
I made this wish on the machine and it turned
me into a grown-up - at the carnival.

161
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:54,732
My birthday's November 3rd.
I got a "B" in history.

162
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:58,249
Here, take the purse. You can have
anything that's in it. Go away!

166

- You bastard! What did you do to my son?
- I <i>am</i> your son.

167

Billy! Do us both a favour.

179
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:54,204
Put the balls away,

Harvitz! Pick up that shirt

- Help! Help!
- Goddamn it, Billy Francis Kopeche!

189
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:29,092
Look, I know I don't look like myself,
but something really strange happened.

190
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:33,610
I'm really scared and I need your help.
You're my best friend! I can prove it.

191
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,808
Oh...

192
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:40,124
The space goes down, down, baby
Down, down the roller coaster

193
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:42,408
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, don't let me go

194

Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

Shimmy, shimmy, go-go bop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

196
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:48,803
I met a girlfriend named Triscuit

197
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,884
She said a Triscuit's a biscuit

Ten times a week

I stole my momma's credit

The mother's pretty hysterical.

It's not making any sense at all.

210
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,532
There's no ransom note,
no prints - no nothing.

211
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:33,447
- File a report, to be on the safe side.

You want me to pack your bags?

214
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,047
We go to the city,
we lay low for a couple of days.

215

We find the Zoltar machine, you make

Hey. This looks OK.

Hey, don't worry about it.

306
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:17,403
- Um... Social Security number?
- 32-17-25.

307
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,927
- What is that?
- My locker combination.

308
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:22,284
Great.

309
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,204
Mr Baskin?

Mr Baskin?

311
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:30,611
- Y-yes... Yes.
- The personnel director will see you now.

312
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,328
Uh... your son can wait out here.

OK. Son, you should sit down.
And don't give the lady any trouble, now.

Sure, <i>Dad.</i>

316

317

<i>(manic clicking of pen)</i>

318
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,926
There's two numbers missing

319
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,402
Oh. Uh... 12.

320
00:26:07,013 --> 00:26:09,004
1-2.

321

It says here you've got four years' experience.

322
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,246
- Yes.
- All on computers?

323
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,324
Yes.

324
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,722
Where did you go to school?

325
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:27,407
It was... It was called George Washington.

326
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:31,122
Oh, GW? My brother-in-law
got his doctorate there.

327

- Did you pledge?
- Yes.

328

David, the girl is absolutely useless.

330

Excuse me. I'm not getting my mail.
Nothing has been filed.

332

Ever since she got engaged,
my life has been a disaster.

333
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,809
She came so highly recommended.

334
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,646
She spent three months
writing down her married name.

335
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,803
Mrs Judy Hicks. Mrs Donald Hicks.

336
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:02,852
Mrs Judy Mitchelson Hicks - sometimes
with a hyphen, sometimes without.

337
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:06,243
- Sometimes she <i>spells</i> the hyphen!
<i> -(snorts)</i>

338
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,167
- Well, I really don't know where I can put her.
- Put her on unemployment!

339
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:16,610
- When can you start?
- Soon.

340
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:30,565
We'll start you off
with last week's preschool orders.

341
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:34,362
lt should take a few days -
give you a chance to find your way around.

342
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:37,013
- Do you smoke?
- Well, just, uh... once. But...

343
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,766
Only on breaks, and in the coffee room.

344
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:43,562
Most of that's pretty straightforward stuff.
Any questions, come to me.

345
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:45,883

- Five years.

The work stinks,

Say hi to her and she's yours.

She'll wrap her legs round you so tight,

- But the favourability ratings...

00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,451
Me, too. I come here every Saturday.

459
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:58,125
You can't see this on a marketing report.

460
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,961
What's a marketing report?

461
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:06,084
Exactly.

462
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:08,209
Come on.

463
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,130
- What do you think of that?
- The championship hockey?

464
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,681
- Yeah.
- Ooh, I love it. Only, the....

465
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,846
- Only, what?
- Well, the pieces don't move.

466
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:22,401
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the old set,...

467
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:26,691
..you could slide the men up and down
the ice. Now all they do is spin around.

468
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:30,004
It was more like real hockey the old way.
Why'd they change it?

469
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:31,890
I don't know.

470
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,329
The Starfighters are good -
you can change all the pieces around.

471
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:37,483
But I never liked the Galacticons.

472
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,962
You only get one robot,
and there's no vehicle.

473
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:42,647
- Mm-hm. I see.
- Plus, you can't take 'em underwater.

474
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,645
- And if you do, they...

- Computers?
- Yeah. Yeah...

485
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:49,402
You just saved me a trip to the gym, son.

486
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:55,723
According to the marketability studies, this
thing should go straight through the roof.

- Hey! Hey! Watch it, fella.
- Sorry. Sorry.

And he came from Data Processing.

He's outta his mind.
The old man has finally lost it!

492

- Do you know he gave him Bob's old office?
- Bob's...

493
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:16,167
Bob's office is bigger than my office!

494
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:20,807
There's gotta be a reason. Things like this
don't happen without a reason.

495
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:24,602
- If the president dies, you take over?
- No, they got a hundred of 'em. Ready?

496
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:27,491
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thank you. Come on in.

497
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:31,291
Look at it! It's bigger

- Well, I play with all of this stuff,...

00:39:55,213 --> 00:39:57,773
..and then I go in and I tell 'em what I think.

- Yeah.

Oh! Thank you, Miss Patterson.
Hey! Miss Patterson!

510
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:12,523
Could you get Media to send up
the video of the Super Bowl?

511
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,081
And have 'em edit out all the commercials?

512
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:17,892
- Yes, Mr Baskin.

He can't come from nowhere, Susan.
How about Hasbro?

Yes, and Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.

Let's face it, Paul, the guy

<i>(Paul)</i> Terrific! This is just terrific(!)

You're being paranoid, Paul.

524
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:55,051
<i>(Paul)</i> These tests were conducted
over a six-month period,...

525
00:40:55,133 --> 00:41:00,412
..using a double-blind format
of eight overlapping demographic groups.

526
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:04,013
Every region of the country was sampled.

527
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:07,642
The focus testing... showed a solid base...

528
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:11,929
..in the 9- to 11-year-old bracket,...

529
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:15,483
..with a possible carry-over
into the 12-year-olds.

530
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,851
When you consider that
Gobots and Transformers poll...

531
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:22,845
- ..37 per cent market share,...
<i> -(Josh)</i> I'm sorry.

the same area,...

00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:28,724
..I think that we should see
one quarter of that.

534
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:33,125
And that is one fifth of the total revenue
from all of last year.

What exactly... don't you get?

541
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:58,004
It turns from a building into
a robot, right?

542
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,244
Precisely.

543
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,728
Well, what's fun about that?

544
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:08,813
Well, if you'd read
your industry breakdown,...

545
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,885
..you'd see that our success
in the action-figure area...

546
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:16,251
..has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent
in the last two years.

547
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:19,088
There, that might help.

Oh.

There's a million robots

- ..that could pick up a car and crush it.
- In teresting.

- This doesn't just happen. This guy...

Mm-hm.

Maybe next year, Brian. Next year.

more about toys than you.

An electronic comic book? That's amazing!

We could do, like, sports comic books,...

..where, like, if you're going to
steal second or something like that.

We could have sports books -
baseball, football...

Really, it would work for
almost any sport. Hockey!

1062
01:26:13,813 --> 01:26:15,804
I'll be right back.

1063
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:18,361
<i>(Mac)</i> How much would the unit cost?

1064
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:22,207
Well, our initial figure
was around, uh... seven...

1065
01:26:24,373 --> 01:26:26,364
..around seven dollars,...

1066
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:31,925
..with a retail cost of about... 18.95.

1067
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:37,243
Well, you expect a kid
to pay $19 for a comic book?

1068
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,688
I think a kid...

1069
01:26:46,093 --> 01:26:48,402
Will you excuse me?

1070
01:26:55,013 --> 01:26:57,083
Josh?

1071
01:26:57,173 --> 01:26:59,164
Josh!

1072
01:27:07,533 --> 01:27:09,524
<i>(whistles)</i>

1073
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:15,726
Will you take me
to Sea Point Park, New York?

1074
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:18,373
Sea Point Park? Josh!

1075
01:27:18,453 --> 01:27:20,011
- Not so fast!
- Here.

1076
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:22,971
Josh! Josh!

1077
01:27:23,693 --> 01:27:26,127
See you back home!

1078
01:27:26,213 --> 01:27:28,443
Yeah!

1079
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:31,206
Excuse me. Uh... do you know him?
You know Josh?

1080
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:34,842
- Yeah... Yeah.
- Look, you have to tell me where he went.

1081
01:27:34,933 --> 01:27:37,447
- Who are you?
- I'm...

1082
01:27:38,933 --> 01:27:43,768
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Euch! <i>(chuckles)</i>

1083
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:47,643
- Billy Kopeche.
- You have to tell me where he went.

1084
01:27:48,213 --> 01:27:50,204
Please, tell me.

1085
01:27:50,293 --> 01:27:52,488
Tell me!

1086
01:29:44,173 --> 01:29:46,368
Work, damn it!

1087
01:30:18,053 --> 01:30:20,248
- Josh?
- Susan!

1088
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:23,291
You know, you don't walk out on somebody.

1089
01:30:24,213 --> 01:30:28,525
You don't just get up and leave and...
and walk out like that. You don't do that!

1090
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:30,922
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

1091
01:30:31,853 --> 01:30:35,368
I'm really sorry, but...
I didn't know what to do. I...

1092
01:30:35,453 --> 01:30:38,251
I didn't know what to say.

1093
01:30:56,013 --> 01:30:58,368
Oh, God!

1094
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,648
You got your wish.

1095
01:31:01,653 --> 01:31:04,167
- I tried to tell you...
- I didn't listen.

1096
01:31:04,253 --> 01:31:06,813
- I guess I didn't hear you,...
- I tried to tell you.

1097
01:31:06,893 --> 01:31:12,923
- ..or want to! Even if I did listen...
- I've been thinking about this. I've been...

1098
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:18,933
There's a million reasons for me to go home,
but there's only one reason for me to stay.

1099
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:24,091
What... What reason is that?

1100
01:31:25,853 --> 01:31:27,844
Well...

1101
01:31:27,933 --> 01:31:29,924
..you!

1102
01:31:30,853 --> 01:31:33,811
Oh, come on... Come on. Come on, come on!

1103
01:31:40,893 --> 01:31:43,566
So, uh... what are you? Fifteen? Sixteen?

1104
01:31:46,093 --> 01:31:48,812
Well... I'm thirteen.

1105
01:31:48,893 --> 01:31:50,884
Ohh...

1106
01:31:54,613 --> 01:31:56,843
Well, that explains it!

1107
01:32:08,013 --> 01:32:10,573
Maybe you could come with me.

1108
01:32:13,413 --> 01:32:15,847
No! Ha!

1109
01:32:15,933 --> 01:32:17,207
No...

1110
01:32:17,293 --> 01:32:19,284
Why not?

1111
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,933
I've... I've been there before.

1112
01:32:25,613 --> 01:32:28,127
It's hard enough the first time.

1113
01:32:29,413 --> 01:32:31,802
You know what I mean?

1114
01:32:33,093 --> 01:32:35,561
You don't know what I mean.

1115
01:32:44,133 --> 01:32:46,852
Come on, I'll drive you home.

1116
01:32:51,573 --> 01:32:54,883
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'll be OK.

1117
01:32:54,973 --> 01:32:57,043
You'll be fine.

1118
01:32:57,133 --> 01:32:59,567
In ten years, who knows?

1119
01:33:01,053 --> 01:33:03,806
Maybe you should hold onto my number.

1120
01:33:21,493 --> 01:33:23,961
So this is where you live?

1121
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,928
- Which one is it?
- That one right there, just...

1122
01:33:29,013 --> 01:33:31,846
<i>(Susan)</i> Oh. That's nice.

1123
01:33:36,373 --> 01:33:39,206
I'm gonna miss you.

1124
01:33:39,293 --> 01:33:41,887
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1125
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,843
- You won't even remember me.
- Oh, yes, I will.

1126
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:50,044
Mom?

1127
01:35:50,813 --> 01:35:52,804
- Mom!
- Josh?

1128
01:35:52,893 --> 01:35:54,884
- It's me!
- Josh?

1129
01:35:55,653 --> 01:35:58,042
Josh! Oh, my God!

1130
01:35:58,133 --> 01:36:00,169
Oh, thank God you're home!

1131
01:36:00,253 --> 01:36:03,290
Oh, Mom... I missed you all so much.

1132
01:36:12,653 --> 01:36:15,804
<i> -(Josh)</i> I'm just not good enough.
- What are you talking about?

1133
01:36:15,893 --> 01:36:19,090
You hit the ball over the fence
almost every time in stickball.

1134
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:22,688
- You just gotta get used to a fatter bat.
<i>- (both chuckle)</i>

1135
01:36:23,613 --> 01:36:25,968
<i> -(Josh)</i> You really think I could do it?
- Yeah!

1136
01:36:26,053 --> 01:36:30,410
<i>- (Josh)</i> Come on, we'll hit some after supper.
- OK. I'll call for ya.
