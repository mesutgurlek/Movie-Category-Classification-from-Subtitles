1
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,947
"Ludwig van Beethoven,
the man who inherited...

2
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:24,869
and increased the immortal fame
of Handel and Bach...

3
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,873
of Haydn and Mozart,
is now no more.

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,519
He was an artist,
and who will stand beside him?

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,313
He was an artist...

6
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:56,651
and what he was,
he was only through music.

7
00:01:57,527 --> 00:02:01,239
The thorns of life
had wounded him deeply...

8
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,242
so he held fast to his art...

9
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:08,538
even when the gate through which
it entered was shut.

10
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:13,209
Music spoke through a deafened ear
to he who could no longer hear it.

11
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,422
He carried the music
in his heart.

12
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,580
Because he shut himself off
from the world, they called him hostile.

13
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:35,041
They said he was unfeeling...

14
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:36,376
and called him callous.

15
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:41,589
But he was not hard of heart.

16
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,012
It is the finest blades
that are most easily blunted...

17
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,016
bent or broken.

18
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,990
He withdrew from his fellow man
after he had given them everything...

19
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:11,703
and had received nothing in return.

20
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,454
He lived alone...

21
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:16,624
because he found no second self.

22
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,753
Thus he was, thus he died.

23
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,548
Thus he will live for all time".

24
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,722
Which one of you is the thief?

25
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:57,058
Huh?

26
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,897
Produce the money,
or I will have you arrested!

27
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,484
Then arrest me!

28
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,863
I took him in when nobody
could bear his company!

29
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,074
And now you want to get paid, eh?

30
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,203
- Bank shares.
- Give them to me!

31
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:21,165
The money is mine!

32
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,293
Here. Here is his will.

33
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:29,215
"I declare that my brothers
Caspar and Johann...

34
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:32,927
are the heirs to my fortune,
if so it can be called".

35
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:37,557
As Caspar is long dead,
that leaves me! Just me!

36
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,270
Well, give me my money!
Answer!

37
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,566
This is his final testament.

38
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,067
What?

39
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,907
"All my music
and all the capital of my estate..

40
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:59,620
shall go to my sole heir,
my immortal beloved".

41
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:02,415
Signed, "Ludwig van Beethoven".

42
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,417
A letter is enclosed.

43
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,254
- This is...
- Come on, now.

44
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,298
Don't keep me in suspense.
Who is it?

45
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,301
- Nobody.
- Oh, not so.

46
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:14,886
The letter bears no name.

47
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,472
"To my immortal beloved".

48
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:29,942
"My angel, my all,
my other self".

49
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,948
The maestro was nursing
a secret passion.

50
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:40,620
I never heard such words from his lips.
Who could this be?

51
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,164
The only love he held
was for himself.

52
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:47,168
I suffered his insults, his temper.

53
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:51,005
I suffered in silence when he spat
the food I made back in my face.

54
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,341
That money is ours!

55
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:54,967
It is not.

56
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:59,347
It doesn't matter anymore.
He is gone.

57
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,349
We have his music.

58
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,395
Destroy this letter.

59
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:10,316
It would only show
his disordered life to the world.

60
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,570
It's his dying wish.
We owe him at least that.

61
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,864
You have no authority in this matter.

62
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,950
I have his authority.

63
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,286
Still the faithful dog, eh?

64
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,330
He was my friend.

65
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,541
What friend would be so cruel?

66
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,335
What brother so uncaring?

67
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,879
You know nothing of my brother!

68
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,068
Take me to Karlsbad.

69
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:07,749
"My angel, my all, my other self.

70
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,045
Just a few words today
and that in pencil, yours.

71
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:17,258
Only tomorrow will I know for certain
where I am to stay.

72
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,220
A worthless waste of time
and such.

73
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:23,723
Why this deep sorrow?

74
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:28,895
If we could be united,
we would feel this pain no longer".

75
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,488
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Frau...

76
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,031
Streicher.

77
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:44,077
- Herr Schindler.
- Let me find your reservation.

78
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,454
I'm afraid I don't have
a reservation.

79
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:51,667
Oh, no matter. We have always room
for a gentleman such as yourself.

80
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,754
Is this the address for this hotel?

81
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,467
One moment.

82
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,594
Ja, of course.

83
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:04,847
Do you know the name
Ludwig van Beethoven?

84
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:07,183
- The composer?
- Yes.

85
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,644
I knew him.

86
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:13,815
- Did he ever stay here?
- Are you a policeman?

87
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,985
Then I will not answer your questions.

88
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, please, I'm trying
to conclude his affairs.

89
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:23,282
Ah, van Beethoven is dead.

90
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,368
Alas, yes.

91
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:28,204
Best thing for him.
He was a terrible man.

92
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,498
Then he stayed here?

93
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,252
A long time ago.
Too long to remember.

94
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,379
I can remember only the damage.

95
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,131
The damage?

96
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,551
I was never paid for the damage.

97
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:44,595
He smashed it all up, everything.

98
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,142
There was a chair, three florins.
Window, five.

99
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,936
- I had to paint everything.
- Frau Streicher.

100
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,982
Would this be sufficient?

101
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,536
There was a woman.

102
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:15,043
We had been expecting
Herr van Beethoven for days.

103
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,878
She came instead.

104
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:22,175
She said he was to join her.

105
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,803
She registered in his room.

106
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,473
Under what name?

107
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,808
illegible. Then...

108
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:36,522
there was this terrible storm,
a deluge.

109
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:38,441
The woman hid in her room...

110
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,486
waiting.

111
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:44,822
Ashamed to show her face,
I'd say.

112
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:50,119
And then, the letter arrived.

113
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,423
You opened the letter.

114
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:05,843
I had to. How else would I know
who it was for?

115
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,805
I only read his signature.

116
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:15,770
"My angel, my all, my other self.

117
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,730
Just a few words...

118
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:21,317
and that in pencil..."

119
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,112
I sent it to her room at once.

120
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:01,441
She can't have liked what she read.

121
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:05,653
She left at once, right away.

122
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:08,239
Left without a word to anybody.

123
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:14,620
And then, of course,
Herr van Beethoven arrives.

124
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:18,207
When he found she was gone,
he went mad.

125
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,209
He was like a madman.

126
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:39,353
Threw a chair out of the window.

127
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:43,066
I called the police.
I was frightened of him.

128
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:52,367
Herr van Beethoven!

129
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,868
Open up!

130
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:30,530
Here is her signature.

131
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,201
Is that a "J" or a "G"?

132
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,122
It looks more like an "A" to me.

133
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:45,503
She was haughty like a countess.

134
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,130
What did she look like?

135
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:52,260
Never got a proper look at her.

136
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:55,513
I don't think she wanted
to be recognized.

137
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,983
Herr Schindler.

138
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,571
Lock the door.

139
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:12,739
But, Countess...

140
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,991
Lock the door.

141
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,289
We must not be disturbed.

142
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:25,752
Not everything they say
about me is true.

143
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,885
Holz was here
with the other one, the weasel.

144
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:35,136
Johann.

145
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:38,056
How could Luigi
have such a vile brother?

146
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,558
I hope they were in good health.

147
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:46,147
They say you have
stolen Luigi's money.

148
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:47,982
They thought you would come here.

149
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,234
Why?

150
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,862
I told them nothing.

151
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:57,241
The price for my silence
is that you must tell me everything.

152
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:02,789
I'm afraid that's impossible.
It falls upon me to interrogate you.

153
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,582
Why should I submit to that?

154
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,087
That is what he wanted.

155
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,630
Who?

156
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,007
The maestro.

157
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:20,473
What I shall tell you
will never leave this room?

158
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:24,685
On my word of honor, Contessa.

159
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:31,484
There is substance to the rumors.

160
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:37,031
I was the great love of Luigi's life.

161
00:16:56,384 --> 00:17:00,221
I first heard the name
Beethoven when I was 17.

162
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:05,977
I had heard that his music
aroused such passion as to be dangerous.

163
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,897
Some thought it obscene
and unsuitable for the young.

164
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,342
I wrote to my cousins,
Theresa and Josephine.

165
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:42,722
They lived in Vienna,
the great music capital of the world.

166
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,228
Surely they would know more.
Indeed they did.

167
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,065
They knew him intimately.

168
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:54,859
More intimately than
they admitted at the time.

169
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:44,325
Most nights I dreamt of him.

170
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,537
And then,
Father was posted to Vienna.

171
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:54,460
We were invited to Prince Lichnowsky's
palace for a musical evening.

172
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,295
Beethoven was going to be there.

173
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,051
I knew he must be so noble...

174
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:05,263
so refined in feeling,
so cultured.

175
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:09,392
I could hardly wait.
I was going to hear him play.

176
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:47,782
That music affected me like
none I had ever heard before.

177
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:50,243
And as for Beethoven...

178
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,246
I was soon overcome.

179
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,248
I feared I might faint.

180
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,465
Hello.

181
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:08,094
Oh. I didn't see you.

182
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,097
I have to go back.

183
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:16,060
Oh, you are leaving me
to listen to that ass...

184
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:20,440
who plays like a kitchen maid,
all clipped and staccato.

185
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,984
This music is beautiful.

186
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:26,320
I was told that the Viennese
had superior taste.

187
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:29,741
Clearly in your case,
it is not true.

188
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:32,869
You must be Julia Guicciardi.

189
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:35,371
I hear there's quite a contest
for your charms.

190
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:40,251
Sir, you're rude and offensive.
I'm leaving.

191
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:44,464
- Do you play the piano?
- What?

192
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:47,425
I intend to be your teacher.

193
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,970
I shall call for you
tomorrow at 10:00.

194
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,516
You shall be barred from the house.

195
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,692
I could not believe the outrage.

196
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:09,072
This ugly man, surely a servant,
had called at the front door.

197
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,331
I have an appointment.

198
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,833
She has a piano.

199
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,881
A gentleman is here to see you.

200
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:29,717
He says he's your new music teacher.

201
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,887
Father, there has been a mistake.
This man is a common oat.

202
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,225
He accosted me last night.
Send him away at once.

203
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:40,853
I will not! It would be a shame
on our household.

204
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:46,150
Sir?

205
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:56,577
May i present Ludwig van Beethoven?

206
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:23,104
So you must attend my next recital.

207
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,106
I heard you last week.

208
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:27,108
I remember.

209
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,318
The music was beautiful.

210
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,404
Surely not that bad.

211
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:33,281
I found the playing exquisite.

212
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:38,786
It's that damned Beethoven
I can't stand.

213
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:42,290
People only claim to admire his stuff
so as not to seem ignorant.

214
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:46,794
My dear husband, don't confirm
your stupidity in front of the guests.

215
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,593
We all speak frankly here.

216
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:56,137
Tell us your opinion.

217
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,931
Heavens, no.
I was not looking for flattery.

218
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,269
It was too clipped and staccato.

219
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:06,731
There was not enough singing tone.

220
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:11,361
Julia, as you can see, is being taught
by the maestro himself.

221
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,488
What?

222
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,615
He comes every day to the house.

223
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,700
Every day?

224
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:20,161
Is that wise?

225
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,497
Why do you say that?

226
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,665
He's a harsh teacher.

227
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,544
He's a scoundrel
and a republican.

228
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,922
It is even said that he is
a follower of Napoleon.

229
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:34,133
He'd have us all in the arms
of Madame La Guillotine.

230
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:38,262
He travels in polite society
on his reputation as a virtuoso...

231
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,473
but flies into a fit if anyone...

232
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:44,644
even dares suggest
he sit at the keyboard.

233
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:47,688
Why will he no longer play?

234
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,567
Beethoven is a strange
and obstinate man.

235
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,028
He says it makes him
feel like a servant...

236
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:56,197
and he serves no masters.

237
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,199
But he takes the money.

238
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:37,780
You think because I did not stop you
that I am not listening.

239
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:43,244
A mistake is nothing.

240
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:46,706
But the fact that
you thump out the notes...

241
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:51,169
without the least sensitivity
to their meaning is unforgivable.

242
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:55,548
And your lack of passion
is unforgivable.

243
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,719
I shall have to beat you.

244
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,497
I am writing a new symphony.

245
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,166
It will cause a scandal
because of its subject.

246
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:32,960
- Tell me.
- Here. Take my arm.

247
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,636
They should make way for us,
not us for them!

248
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,888
Their days are over.
Your world is finished!

249
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,807
Oh, shut up!

250
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:50,395
When I was a boy, they would have
had you arrested for less.

251
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:53,815
But now they are scared
of what is happening in France.

252
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:56,567
- You know why wigs went out of fashion?
- Why?

253
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:59,237
Because too many ended up
in the bottom of baskets.

254
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,572
But I am a countess, too, Luigi.

255
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:05,535
They are scared.
Scared of Napoleon.

256
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:08,538
That is why Napoleon
is the subject of my symphony.

257
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:52,248
I have here
a proposal of marriage..

258
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:54,250
from a composer.

259
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,338
- Count Gallenberg.
- Oh.

260
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,257
You were thinking of Beethoven?

261
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,343
Julia, the gossip is everywhere.

262
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,309
- He also has proposed.
- Then there is no contest.

263
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,728
- You love Beethoven?
- Yes.

264
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:20,443
I cannot give my consent.

265
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,612
We are not wealthy, Julia.

266
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:26,240
He is a man without rank,
fortune or permanent engagement.

267
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:29,577
His character and temperament
are so peculiar that I doubt...

268
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,746
any would find happiness with him.

269
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,498
- He's a genius.
- Perhaps.

270
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:39,045
But in the last year he has not
played nor published a single note.

271
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:43,925
There are those who say there is
some infirmity that prevents him.

272
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:47,095
Untrue gossip! Lies!

273
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:49,180
Has he played for you?

274
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,728
We made a bargain. If I could
prove Luigi could still play...

275
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:58,690
Father would give his consent.

276
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:11,577
Obviously a fine countess.

277
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,039
Dear brother...

278
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:16,958
you are going up in the world.

279
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,669
Hand it over, you ignoramus.

280
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:23,297
As your secretary,
it is my solemn duty to read this.

281
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,638
"Beloved Luigi, my father
has recently taken delivery...

282
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:34,475
of a new pianoforte
from Broadwood in London.

283
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,688
It is of the latest design and is
the first of its kind in Vienna.

284
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:43,901
Tomorrow morning I will send away
the servants and we shall all be out.

285
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:48,322
I have done this so that you might try
this new invention undisturbed".

286
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:27,875
What is the meaning of this? What
kind of trick have you played on me?

287
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,711
Stop it, Luigi.

288
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:32,922
- Herr Beethoven, I beg you.
- Now I see.

289
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:34,882
- I see perfectly.
- We mean you no harm.

290
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:38,094
- A little test!
- Luigi, wait!

291
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:43,015
It is terrible to rob me
in this way...

292
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:45,017
of my most treasured feelings!

293
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:50,064
Father can go to hell!
I bid you wait!

294
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:52,525
It's no use. He can't hear you!

295
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,527
He's deaf!

296
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:04,829
A month later
I married Count Gallenberg.

297
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:08,374
And you never heard from him again?

298
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,917
He wrote to me.

299
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,169
It was...

300
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:15,757
After the war,
there had been some...

301
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:17,759
unpleasantness.

302
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,220
It was a bad time.

303
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,523
They who think me hostile...

304
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,527
obstinate or misanthropic...

305
00:34:36,611 --> 00:34:39,614
how unjust they are to me...

306
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:44,160
for they do not know
the secret reason I appear that way.

307
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:48,623
It is not possible for me
to say, "Speak louder.

308
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,625
Shout. I am deaf".

309
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:56,047
How can I live if my enemies,
who are many...

310
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,634
believe I no longer possess
the one sense that should be perfect...

311
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:03,429
to a higher degree in me
than in others?

312
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:16,984
Not so fast.
So what will you do?

313
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:20,822
See every shallow countess
Ludwig gave a dedication to?

314
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:23,616
They are all liars
who want a piece of him now he is gone.

315
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,661
I have the lady's signature.

316
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:30,289
I shall study his correspondence
to find the hand that matches.

317
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:33,042
It is illegible.
You are wasting your time.

318
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:36,087
- No court will uphold this nonsense.
- Help me then.

319
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:38,798
Are you mad?

320
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:43,261
Help you to cheat me?
I will tell you this.

321
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:46,305
There is no lady
at the end of your search.

322
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:49,600
Ludwig was a woman hater.
Look at how he behaved with Johanna.

323
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:53,938
He had every right. Your brother
took a bride of low character.

324
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:57,191
You are too much under Ludwig's
influence to see the truth.

325
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,695
He wanted Caspar under his thumb.

326
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:02,947
Running his errands.

327
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:05,491
He hated Johanna
because she took him away.

328
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:20,506
There she is.

329
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,217
Oh, she's so beautiful.

330
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:30,391
- A marvelous creature.
- She will be mine.

331
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,227
So, you would betray me for that?

332
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:35,855
Where is your book? Here.

333
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:41,569
Willingly.

334
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:43,196
She can be bought.

335
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,865
- All women can be bought.
- You are insulting the woman I love.

336
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:50,703
At first, it will
be all enticements.

337
00:36:50,787 --> 00:36:55,249
Then, snap! The trap shuts.
There's always a price to pay.

338
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,378
I would never betray you
for one of those creatures.

339
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:11,641
Brothers, I have wonderful news.

340
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,144
She has finally consented.

341
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,647
- You are to be wed?
- Yes!

342
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,898
You explain to him.

343
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,609
May I...

344
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:24,195
present my bride?

345
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,115
Is this a joke?

346
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,909
You cannot be serious.

347
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:34,205
By all means, copulate with her.

348
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:38,000
But marriage? What for?

349
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,711
You will be a laughingstock.

350
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:42,755
Every farmhand in the region
has enjoyed her for free.

351
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,216
Why should you pay more?

352
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,770
I know you cannot hear me,
and I don't care.

353
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:01,733
What I have to say
is for Caspar, not you.

354
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,612
I have had lovers...

355
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,614
but that is not a crime.

356
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,788
I told you it was impossible.

357
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,762
I only want what is right.

358
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:36,768
He was jealous of his brother.

359
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,978
Why, she will destroy him.

360
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:41,773
Jealous of his happiness.

361
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:04,170
I'm Ludwig van Beethoven,
and I need your help.

362
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,440
Break the door down.

363
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,633
Arrest that whore.

364
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,178
- Don't touch her!
- Arrest that whore.

365
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,597
That is slander.

366
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:02,767
We were married yesterday.

367
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,860
She is with child.

368
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:16,530
Now leave!

369
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:21,327
He behaved no better
when I married Therese.

370
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,372
He wanted us both
at his beck and call.

371
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,874
Give up the search.

372
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,876
I cannot.

373
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,878
I have my reasons.

374
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,422
I will find this lady.

375
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:37,927
And she will claim her legacy
with the full force of the law.

376
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:51,315
"The journey was dreadful.

377
00:40:51,399 --> 00:40:55,027
The coach had to go and break
down on such a terrible road.

378
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,239
And for no reason,
just a country road.

379
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,702
I have to see you.

380
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:07,290
However much you love me,
I love you more.

381
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:09,500
Never hide yourself from me".

382
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:25,057
Excuse me. I'm looking for
the Countess Erdödy.

383
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:26,559
Erdödy?

384
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:33,274
I'm looking for the Countess Erdödy.

385
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,279
Zoltan!

386
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,794
Schindler.
You do not recognize me?

387
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,087
Oh.

388
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:58,257
Please, sit.
Join me for dinner.

389
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:06,641
- Countess.
- Anna Marie.

390
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,727
These are my people I'm home now.
I don't have to play the countess.

391
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,228
I'm free!

392
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:21,489
Poor Louis.
I miss him so much.

393
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:24,617
His death has left a void.

394
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,911
The way they treated him...

395
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,790
disgusted me.

396
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:34,043
He was too good for them.

397
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:35,795
His fire...

398
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,589
offended their small brains.

399
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,676
But not you.

400
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:45,179
I could match his temperament.

401
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:49,517
You gave him rooms at your palace?

402
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:53,688
I wanted him near me.

403
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:56,107
Was he your lover?

404
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:13,684
Horns!

405
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:19,357
Clarinets!

406
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:09,365
From the beginning.

407
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:42,523
From the beginning.

408
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:35,284
That was how I met Louis...

409
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,414
and how the world
learned of his deafness.

410
00:46:45,753 --> 00:46:48,256
I was separated from my husband.

411
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:53,469
I lived an independent life in Vienna
with my three children.

412
00:47:09,944 --> 00:47:12,405
I will arrange a housekeeper.

413
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,632
Please.

414
00:47:41,142 --> 00:47:43,102
Oh, I had one.

415
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,315
She cheated me.

416
00:47:56,991 --> 00:48:00,411
We had thought of Napoleon
as a liberator...

417
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:03,205
a force for change.

418
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:06,083
Now we saw the truth.

419
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:09,587
Bonaparte
had declared himself emperor...

420
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,465
and set out to conquer the world.

421
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:16,636
He said he brought freedom
from the tyranny of kings.

422
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:21,307
But he was Saturn,
gobbling up his children.

423
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,242
His cannon fired night and day...

424
00:48:40,326 --> 00:48:42,244
on the city of Vienna.

425
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:24,578
Leave her alone!

426
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,140
Mimi!

427
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:09,206
Fire!

428
00:50:48,496 --> 00:50:50,456
Madam.

429
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:53,334
There is a gentleman
here to see you.

430
00:50:56,504 --> 00:51:00,299
I cannot receive anybody.

431
00:51:00,341 --> 00:51:02,551
I think he is deaf.

432
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:04,929
He will not go away.

433
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:10,184
The countess will see you now.

434
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:26,325
Your son...

435
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,006
We will speak in music.

436
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,488
Napoleon was victorious.

437
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:08,117
The whole of Europe was at his feet.

438
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,663
He took a Hapsburg princess
as his bride...

439
00:52:12,747 --> 00:52:15,499
and set up court at Schoenbrun Palace.

440
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:22,632
He proved himself no different
than any aristocrat.

441
00:52:22,715 --> 00:52:24,634
Everybody was betrayed.

442
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:29,388
This was the way
of the modern world.

443
00:53:41,502 --> 00:53:44,255
The year Louis lived with us...

444
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:47,967
was the happiest of my life.

445
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,011
And, I think, of his too.

446
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:16,329
He opened his heart to me.

447
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:19,457
He called me
his father confessor.

448
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,459
He told me everything.

449
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,633
You must have loved him
very, very much.

450
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:30,760
With all my heart.

451
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:32,595
And he you.

452
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,067
I don't think so. No.

453
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,694
Then he was a fool!

454
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,074
I like you better drunk.

455
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,577
- It's good to talk about him.
- Yeah.

456
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,040
But is this why
you came all this way?

457
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:03,918
No, not only.

458
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,587
You said there was
some unfinished business.

459
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,089
There is.

460
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:11,968
But how can I help you, Anton?

461
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:18,015
Perhaps it's nothing.

462
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:22,520
And perhaps it's the key to him.

463
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:29,235
Perhaps they're right
and I should let it go, but I cannot.

464
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:32,989
- It's impossible for me.
- But why?

465
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:38,536
It was that damned sonata...

466
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:41,706
the "Kreutzer".

467
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:46,586
At the time I entertained
ambitions of a musical career.

468
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:49,422
I'd gone to Vienna to study
and was fortunate enough...

469
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:51,966
to be taken by Schuppanzigh
as a pupil.

470
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:55,219
He and George Bridgetower,
the famous virtuoso from Africa...

471
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:58,264
were about to premiere
this new Beethoven sonata...

472
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:01,183
at Count Razumovsky's that evening...

473
00:56:01,267 --> 00:56:04,186
and I was allowed
to attend the rehearsal.

474
00:56:05,646 --> 00:56:10,192
It was there that the seed
of a mystery was planted...

475
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:13,154
that haunts me to this day.

476
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:24,498
Do you like it?

477
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,502
I cannot hear them.

478
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:30,838
But I know they are
making a hash of it.

479
00:56:30,922 --> 00:56:32,840
What do you think?

480
00:56:36,302 --> 00:56:40,389
Music is a dreadful thing.

481
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:43,976
What is it?

482
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,561
I don't understand it.

483
00:56:45,645 --> 00:56:48,940
What does it do?

484
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:53,736
It exalts the soul.

485
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,822
Utter nonsense If you hear
a marching band, is your soul exalted?

486
00:56:56,864 --> 00:57:00,117
No, you march.
If you hear a waltz, you dance.

487
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,328
If you hear a mass,
you take communion.

488
00:57:03,496 --> 00:57:06,874
It is the power of music...

489
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,503
to carry one directly
into the mental state...

490
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:12,380
of the composer.

491
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,800
The listener has no choice.

492
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:17,802
It is like hypnotism.

493
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:22,348
So, now...

494
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:25,017
what was in my mind
when I wrote this?

495
00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:33,943
A man is trying
to reach his lover.

496
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:36,654
His carriage has broken down
in the rain.

497
00:57:36,737 --> 00:57:39,573
The wheels stuck in the mud.

498
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,077
She will only wait so long.

499
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:47,873
This...

500
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:51,127
is the sound of his agitation.

501
00:57:59,635 --> 00:58:02,430
"This is how it is..."

502
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,933
the music is saying.

503
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,187
"Not how you are used to being.

504
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:13,232
Not how you are used to thinking.

505
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:16,736
But like this".

506
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:23,284
Who was the woman?
He never told me.

507
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,453
I knew better than to ask.

508
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:32,168
He made me see the world
in an entirely new light.

509
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:38,925
I abandoned my petty ambitions.
I fetched and carried for him.

510
00:58:38,966 --> 00:58:42,470
I wrote his letters and smoothed over
his domestic disputes.

511
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:46,724
I became his secretary.

512
00:58:51,979 --> 00:58:56,651
Oh, the hag has sold it in the market
for a souvenir.

513
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,444
Oh, no.

514
00:58:58,527 --> 00:59:00,613
It's lost.

515
00:59:01,656 --> 00:59:03,783
Gone forever.

516
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:05,326
Here.

517
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:11,624
Maybe not.

518
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:16,379
Ludwig was convinced he had left
the sketch for his new symphony...

519
00:59:16,462 --> 00:59:19,006
in the safekeeping
of his brother Caspar.

520
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,133
- My God. Here.
- Uncle!

521
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,719
The brothers had barely spoken
for eight years.

522
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:25,388
This is Herr Schindler.
