<i>Previously on "Switched at birth"...</i>

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,947
She doesn't like me.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,667
Here.

4
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,603
- All yours.
- Okay, here we go.

5
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:26,538
One more time, ladies. Let's go.

6
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:29,043
Hi, Tina Choi. "Kansas City Herald."

7
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,743
Kathryn, did you read this article?

8
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:33,679
We sound totally fine about missing
out on raising our own daughters.

9
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:37,483
Simone is one of Bay's good friends.

10
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:40,386
Well, used to be good friend...

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,720
or actually I don't know.

12
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,590
- Can I see your hearing aids?
- It doesn't turn off my brain.

13
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,725
Only my ears.

14
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,462
Get in here now!

15
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:10,972
Excuse me.

16
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,452
Are you okay?

17
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:16,388
Oh, just fine. Thanks.

18
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,557
Can we hurry up, please?

19
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,432
I don't think we can use that one.

20
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:09,475
Because it's staged. We told those guys

21
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,277
to act like we weren't there.

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,416
So to really be planking

23
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,321
you can't stage or photoshop anything.

24
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,459
What are you looking for?

25
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:32,164
Aha ha ha... funny.

26
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:35,634
I'm just saying true art, it needs to be

27
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,302
authentic.

28
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:39,471
People can sense when something is phony.

29
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:42,174
Okay, stop!

30
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:44,007
Stop that.

31
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,315
Oh, he... hello.

32
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,450
Hi.

33
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:13,505
Something without something?

34
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,479
I can't talk...

35
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,421
You know what? Maybe I should go.

36
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,492
Okay, bye.

38
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,421
Oh, heels and an apron...
how "mad men" of you, mom.

39
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:06,491
- I have a meeting today.
- Yowza, nice outfit.

40
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,394
You should bring this
next time we go somewhere.

41
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,529
- Ew.
- Ew.

44
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,227
The reporter from the
"Kansas City Herald."

45
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,405
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, she called your mother.

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,341
She wants to check in
and see how we're doing.

47
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,178
I told Wilke I'd meet him early.
So I'm gonna head out.

48
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,180
All right, well,

49
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm gonna let her know
how we felt about her last article

50
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,552
and make sure
that she doesn't do it again.

51
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,390
It might be more intimidating
without the apron.

52
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,680
Or just add a wooden spoon maybe.

53
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:43,027
Ha ha, very very funny.

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,597
Yeah, they get that from me.

55
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,643
What's up with the fancy breakfast?

56
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,058
What?

57
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,376
There has to be a reason?

58
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,239
Uh, yeah.

59
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,181
Well, we haven't had much time to talk

60
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,518
since you went to that music festival.

61
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,180
There wasn't much to talk about.

62
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,257
What about Bay and Emmett?

63
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,504
What about them?

64
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,724
They're dating.

65
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,231
You didn't tell me.

66
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,809
I didn't think it was important.

67
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,883
It's not like Emmett and I are dating.

68
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,459
No, but...

69
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,801
you two spent a lot of time together.

70
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,953
Emmett and I will still see each other.

71
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:33,006
We have like four classes together.

72
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,540
I just...

73
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,380
I wish that you two

74
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,178
hadn't been so exclusive, that's all.

75
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:43,143
It seems like you're spending half
a lot of time by yourself,

76
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,972
now that he and Bay are together.

77
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,310
I'm fine, mom.

78
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:52,881
Okay.

79
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:59,971
What the hell is a "capibra" and why
do we need to spend $400 to buy one?

80
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,031
Capybara. It's a 200lb rodent.

81
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:04,576
And we aren't buying, we're renting...
you need permits to buy one.

82
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:07,345
I don't want to rent or buy a capybara.

83
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,564
I want to make a video that showcases
our music, not a giant rodent.

84
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,583
And it will! But you've gotta have
a hook to get them to look at you,

85
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:15,972
then you deliver the goods. Bam!

86
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,323
Okay, I get it... we need to
make a flashy music video.

87
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:21,326
But how are we gonna pay for it? Our
parents aren't going to give us the money.

88
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,041
I know. How unfair is that?

89
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,297
You run up a few gambling debts,
steal one test,

90
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,432
and suddenly they treat
you like a criminal.

91
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:30,061
I do know one way we can make some money.

92
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:32,437
How do I just know this is gonna suck?

93
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,884
I wasn't expecting

94
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,633
to see you until later.

95
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,595
I'll see you at school. And you too...

96
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,540
I have cooking class today.

97
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,391
Yeah, what was that about?

98
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:30,195
I can't follow you when
you're talking with her.

99
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,054
You did?

100
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:38,730
That's great!

101
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,246
But why was she mad?

102
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,663
I mean, she talks, Daphne talks.

103
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,247
Oh, ok. She must have a reason for
not wanting you to take it.

104
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,942
She thinks that I made you?

105
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:59,600
And if I did ask you to?

106
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,461
But I do.

107
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,692
Emmett, she is not just your mom.

108
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:10,302
She's my mom's best friend.

109
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:14,032
She coaches Daphne's team with my dad.

110
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,526
I can't have her hate me.

111
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,590
Oh, she does. She hates me.

112
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,518
Emmett, I...

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,341
The ref didn't even believe
that she hit me

114
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:47,569
until the doctor looked at
my elbow after the game.

115
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,166
- No foul?
- Nope.

116
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:51,695
But we got our revenge.
Scored 12 more points on her

117
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:54,119
- by the end of the quarter.
- Oh, that's awesome!

118
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,679
I mean, I'm sorry you got hurt,
but it must be so fun to play that hard.

119
00:08:57,762 --> 00:08:58,764
Oh yeah.

120
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,321
- Hey.
- Hey.

121
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:05,251
- Do you know Simone?
- Uh, yeah, like since kindergarten.

122
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:08,340
How's that Mr. Waffles? Cutest dog ever.

123
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,057
He died last summer.

124
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:11,332
Oh.

125
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,531
You guys are in cooking class together.

126
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,338
Yeah, Daphne pulled my bacon
out of the fire today.

127
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,503
Always looking to save that pig.

128
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,442
She's a vegetarian, so she...

129
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:28,343
You know what? It's cool. Forget it.

130
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,345
Hey, thanks for sticking me
with the cleanup.

131
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:32,581
Oh, but it's so much fun watching you

132
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,109
- try to figure out how soap works.
- Aha.

133
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,164
First bell. Later.

134
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,222
Hey,

135
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,086
we should play hoops together sometime.

136
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,120
There's actually a pick-up
game this afternoon.

137
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,893
You should totally come by.

138
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:49,807
We want to start right at the beginning.

139
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:51,587
Before you even had the babies...

140
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,368
the hopes you and John
had for your little golden girl,

141
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:56,175
the trepidation Regina must have had,

142
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,706
being a single mother

143
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,811
with an unreliable boyfriend
and a drinking problem.

144
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,018
Wait. H-how do you know all of this?

145
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,155
I'm a reporter.

146
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:08,717
And... and how could you
possibly get all that happened

147
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:11,098
into one follow-up article?

148
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,654
- Article?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,324
No, we're talking about a book.

150
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,626
We've never had as much
response to an article

151
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,628
as we have to that piece
I did on your family.

152
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,331
We're still getting emails
from people wanting to know

153
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,205
how you are, how it really happened.

154
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,468
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's a natural.

155
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:30,672
People love this kind of
true-life-horror-story-with-a-happy-ending.

156
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,290
Like that little girl that was kidnapped

157
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,710
and held captive for 18
years and found alive.

158
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:39,448
Okay, we are not a horror story and have
no intention of being turned into one.

159
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,352
Kathryn, however you characterize it,
it is a great story,

160
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,553
someone is going to tell it...
authorized or not.

161
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:49,358
Not that I would tell it unauthorized,
of course.

162
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,727
- Of course not.
- You don't want to wait on this.

163
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:55,556
You want to get out in front of it...
and with someone you trust.

164
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,433
Someone who shares your midwestern values.

165
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,836
Like you?

166
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:02,989
Absolutely.

167
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,441
Okay, the cars roll out,
you wipe them down,

168
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,645
you make sure the tires are clean, then
you flap your towel for the customer.

169
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,680
Don't leave rags on the car.

170
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,715
And you will be wearing these.

171
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,420
No offense, Mr. Kennish,

172
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:21,099
but we don't wanna holster the guns.

173
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,725
That's how we're gonna get the big tips.

174
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,297
Heh! Good luck with that.

175
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,691
All right.

176
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,451
- Check it.
- So what's the sign for "you're going down"?

177
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:52,287
- You're about to find out.
- Tied game, last basket wins.

178
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,234
Shoot it.

179
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,446
Nice.

180
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,466
- Hey, sorry about that.
- I'm not!

181
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,568
Way to let out let those killer instincts.

182
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,195
Hey, I was thinking about hitting
up crossroads for first fridays.

183
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:13,208
There's supposed to be this amazing
thai food truck. You interested?

184
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:15,410
I would love to,
but I'm actually going to Joey's

185
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:17,593
- With some of these guys.
- Oh.

186
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,214
That's okay. Next time.

187
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,683
No, this time. You should come with us.

188
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,908
- Who's Joey?
- No no, Joey's is this club near U.M.K.C.

189
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,919
Lots of cute college guys.

190
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,492
It's over-21 though. You need a fake.

191
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:32,746
That's not a problem.

192
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,563
Cool, I'll text you the info then.

193
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:35,618
Sweet.

194
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:39,983
Hey, coach.

195
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,878
I'm coach Medlock. Do you have a second?

196
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:51,346
Oh... uh, ahhh.

197
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,282
I... I didn't see you.

198
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:54,800
There.

199
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,486
Oh, uh, yeah.

200
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:58,709
Uh...

201
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,622
sometimes I like to...

202
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,258
to see how the colors are

203
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:05,527
working in the natural

204
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,362
light. You know what? Never mind.

205
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,279
It's not important.

206
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:11,366
Are... are you here to see Regina?

207
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,682
Uh... oh, wait.

208
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,995
I just... I want you to know

209
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,140
that speech therapy

210
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,473
was Emmett's idea.

211
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:34,356
I didn't ask him to take it.

212
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,473
You didn't have to.

213
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:49,234
- Hey.
- Hey hey, sweetie, perfect timing!

214
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,138
Listen,

215
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm thinking about changing
the starting line up.

216
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,543
I'm thinking about moving
Jennifer to forward

217
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:56,511
and pulling Emily back for defense.

218
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:57,319
- Uh...
- I think...

219
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,114
Coach Medlock wants me to play for Buckner.

220
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,622
Of course he does.

221
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,418
He has an excellent eye for talent.

222
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,925
Yeah, he saw me playing
a pick-up game at Buckner today,

223
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,824
and he knows that I play for Carlton, and

224
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,794
so he asked me to join the team!

225
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,637
Except you're already on another team.

226
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:18,217
This is Buckner. They're
like a million times better.

227
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:19,870
Sweetie,

228
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:22,604
I know this is incredibly flattering

229
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:25,240
and we can revisit this
at the end of the year.

230
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,409
Or even at the end of the season.

231
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,561
But you don't quit your team.

232
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:34,666
- Okay?
- Right.

233
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:35,976
Right, okay.

234
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,899
So what do you think
of Jennifer at forward?

235
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,199
- That's good, right?
- Yeah sure.

236
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,084
We put her at the three position

237
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:48,463
and Emily is gonna be much more
helpful with you on defense.

238
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:51,921
When you guys are pressing, we have
someone there who can actually move.

239
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:53,119
Right?

240
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,707
Ok, wait, you, me, your mom... wait.

241
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,878
What... okay.

242
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,795
What? No!

243
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,571
No! No no no no no!

244
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,320
We will avoid her.

245
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:29,507
Yes. No!

246
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,612
Oh oh, that looks weird.

247
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:36,409
- Now I have to go.
- Hey, um,

248
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,319
I just wanted to say that you guys

249
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,763
make a really cute couple.

250
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,536
Uh, Regina?

251
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:47,765
Yeah?

252
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,981
What are you doing tomorrow night?

253
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:54,075
Wilke!

254
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,911
Hey.

255
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:58,766
You're here and there's no cooking class today.

256
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,539
I knew you were stalking me!

257
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:02,897
Well, I actually had a question for you.

258
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,581
I figured it would be best to ask in person.

259
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:05,697
Oh, good cover.

260
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,941
I... I need a fake I.D.

261
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:12,194
The guy I knew at Carlton that
did 'em graduated last year.

262
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,641
So I thought you might know
somebody here.

263
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,579
That could cost you a few bucks.

264
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,821
That's okay. It's important.

265
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:23,787
And... I'll bet there are
a lot of other kids at Carlton

266
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:26,632
who also might be in
the market for a fake I.D.

267
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,347
Yeah, probably. So...

268
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:32,167
Do you know somebody or...?

269
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,800
Actually, I do.

270
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:37,702
As it happens, I am the
guy you're looking for.

271
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,993
Really? That's great.

272
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,558
Now why don't you and
I go have some coffee,

273
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,132
discuss the particulars of your I.D.

274
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,455
and how we might market
my services to your classmates.

275
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:46,455
I actually got to get back to Carlton.

276
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:49,923
We've got a game today.
But text me, okay? Thank you.

277
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,960
Hey, what was Daphne doing here?

278
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:55,970
Helping us buy a capybara.

279
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,295
This is a whole video

280
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:15,407
tutorial on how to make
fake identity cards.

281
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,893
Hey, do you mind, I stilll can't find mine.

282
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,456
Yeah, go ahead.

283
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,852
Looks like the hot tip is
to make it from another state.

284
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:23,445
What are you guys doing?

285
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,968
Starting our own small
business. Fake I.D.s.

286
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,634
Want to get back in the pool?
Give you the family rate.

287
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,003
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

288
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:31,933
You get caught now no one
can have a fake I.D.?

289
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:35,538
Uh, having one and selling
them are two totally different things.

290
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,726
I get caught, I get community service.

291
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:41,496
You get caught, you get a cell
and a roommate at Leavenworth.

292
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,255
She does have a point.

293
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:44,833
Maybe this isn't the best idea.

294
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,692
It's on the internet, dude. It's just...

295
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,795
"A unique party favor to
share with all your friends."

296
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,249
What people do with them
after they get them,

297
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,924
we have no control over that.

298
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,186
Wow, way to rationalize.

299
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,804
I thought you were turning over a new leaf

300
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,757
after the whole stealing-the-test thing.

301
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:04,568
Ok, good.

302
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:08,069
Let's just ask your dad
for a couple extra shifts at the car wash.

303
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,788
At three bucks a car plus minimumage,

304
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:10,957
we should be able to fund our video

305
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,776
about the time "Guitar face"
is ready for a reunion tour.

306
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,852
- Yeah, we should get some more card stock.
- And ink cartridges.

307
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,071
Mm-hmm, definitely.

308
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:25,941
Hey, mom...

309
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:28,669
What is with the books?

310
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,944
Oh, it's just a little homework.

311
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:37,722
- What's up?
- I... I need some advice.

312
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:39,361
Wait, from me?

313
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,170
Don't look so happy about it.
That just makes it harder.

314
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:44,635
Sorry. I'm sorry.

315
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:48,456
I think Emmett's mom hates me.

316
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:52,386
Melody? Okay, why would she hate you?

317
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:55,201
Em-Emmett and I have kind of...

318
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,505
- we've been hanging out.
- You and Emmett?

319
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:00,654
- I thought it was he and Daphne...
- No.

320
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:03,294
- He and I are together.
- Wait, together together?

321
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,418
Are you two...

322
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,885
Are you serious?

323
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,840
Yeah, mom,

324
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,340
it's kind of serious.

325
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,189
Huh.

326
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,059
Wow, really?!

327
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,232
It's that hard to believe we're a couple?

328
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,528
No no, of course not.

329
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,676
It's just that, well, there was Liam

330
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,328
then there's Ty and now there's...

331
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:25,718
Wow. You and Melody should get

332
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:28,479
together and discuss
why I am so horrible for Emmett.

333
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,993
She thinks he's flunking out because

334
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,003
of me and you think
I'm some sort of boy junkie.

335
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:33,695
I'm just trying to understand, honey.

336
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:36,511
He and I have way more in
common than Liam and I ever did.

337
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,219
And he's age appropriate which
I thought you would appreciate.

338
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
And,

339
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,338
mom, he gets me and I get him.

340
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,611
Well, then Melody should
consider herself lucky

341
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:52,369
that her son is dating
someone as smart and caring

342
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,011
and creative as you.

343
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:57,378
And if she doesn't,
well then, it's her loss.

344
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,670
Mmm, no, it's my loss because
once the mom disapproves

345
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,950
of the girlfriend,
it's just a matter of time.

346
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:06,948
Oh wait, we do not have as
much power as you think we do.

347
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,606
- Really?
- Really.

348
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,796
Mm-hmm. Do you remember
when Toby was dating Melissa

349
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:14,321
- the hippie chick?
- I never said a word!

350
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:18,366
You didn't have to! Which is why
I have to get Melody to like me.

351
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,386
So Regina and I are going
to go over there and...

352
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:25,719
the plan is to try and convince
her that I'm not the antichrist.

353
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,024
Except I don't know how to do that.

354
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,405
I don't know how to make her like me.

355
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,836
Honey, just be yourself.

356
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,734
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

357
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:41,000
People like you. They do not like me.

358
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,499
So I don't want to be
myself tonight. I want...

359
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,428
to be you.

360
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,966
Honey, you're...

361
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,564
You could lighten up
a little on the sarcasm.

362
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:56,374
- Mm-hmm.
- And bring artichoke dip.

363
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,444
Oh, I love your artichoke dip.

364
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,801
Everybody does. It sounds like a vegetable

365
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,822
and it's full of mayo and cheese.

366
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,779
There is no way Melody can resist that.

367
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:07,609
Thank you.

368
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,263
You'll win her over.

369
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,221
I hope so.

370
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,129
Can I come in?

371
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,356
Yeah sure. I'm just taking a little break.

372
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,068
So you in business with Wilke?

373
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,589
Yeah, turns out

374
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,027
he's in sales

375
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:38,866
and I'm in manufacturing?

376
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:44,158
Um, he sells. I make.

377
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,618
You know, now that I'm learning to sign

378
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,762
I am finding that we hearing people

379
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:51,505
use far too many words.

380
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:55,904
Well, I just hope you don't
get in trouble on my account.

381
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,095
Ahhh.

382
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,032
Okay.

383
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,539
I need some advice.

384
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:10,539
I want to quit the Carlton
basketball team and join Buckner's.

385
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:16,820
Does dad know?

386
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:19,457
That's the advice I need.

387
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:23,836
You quit baseball.
Okay, so how did you do it?

388
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:25,979
I don't know, I just

389
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,912
told him I didn't want to play anymore,

390
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:31,022
that, y'know, sports was his thing
and music was my thing.

391
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,219
- And he was okay with that?
- Oh, hell no.

392
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,762
- But y'know, he had Bay.
- Bay played baseball?

393
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,925
Soccer. For about 10 minutes.

394
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:44,193
Until we all decided that
that was a very bad idea.

395
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,794
But it gave him a place to

396
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:50,415
put all that coaching-sports
connection stuff when I quit.

397
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,292
So what'd he do with it after Bay
stopped playing soccer?

398
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,649
I dunno. I guess it
just kind of went away.

399
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:00,594
Till you showed up.

400
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,053
And you're not a musician,

401
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,511
and you're not an artist...

402
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,424
I'm an athlete, like him.

403
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,550
The mini-me dad never had.
And he loves coaching you.

404
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:13,737
So you're telling me to stay?

405
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,351
You asked for my advice.

406
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,428
You can still do what you want.

407
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:23,831
You don't have to listen to John.

408
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,393
But he's my dad.

409
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:28,443
He's the whole reason
I can even play basketball.

410
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,011
I mean genetically speaking.

411
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:34,778
Well, that doesn't give him veto power

412
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,145
- over where you can play.
- I just want to play for a good team.

413
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:41,688
I want to win! It's the Kennish in me.
I get that from him too.

414
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,737
Well, so do it.

415
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,417
Well, he started coaching
at Carlton for me.

416
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,308
I mean, he's doing everything he can to...

417
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,175
you know, do the dad thing.

418
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,481
So don't do it. I mean...
Carlton could get better, right?

419
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,427
No.

420
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,146
Hmph.

421
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:06,563
Um, okay, now in
the lousy timing department,

422
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,636
I need to tell you that Bay and I

423
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:12,951
are going over to Melody
and Emmett's house tomorrow.

424
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,022
Oh.

425
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,067
Okay.

426
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,157
Bay feels like Melody doesn't like her.

427
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,705
So I thought that maybe they should
get to know each other better.

428
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:25,103
Okay.

429
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,974
Okay? That's it?

430
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:36,277
What do you want me to say?
I hate my basketball team.

431
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,164
I miss Emmett. Angelo's back.

432
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:40,265
And I don't like sharing you with Bay.

433
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,709
But, it is what it is.

434
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:52,817
No, I believe you, it just...
it feels wrong.

435
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,981
All right. Yes.

436
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:56,985
Okay.

437
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:02,078
- That was our lawyer... Amanda.
- And?

438
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,467
She says Tina Choi is right.

439
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:06,786
If she or anyone else wants
to use public record

440
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:09,396
and gossip to write
a book about us, they can.

441
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,318
She had no other suggestions?

442
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,040
No. To collaborate with her,

443
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,948
try to influence what she writes.

444
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,703
Is that such a bad idea?

445
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,875
Tina Choi wants to make
us sound like freaks!

446
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,430
Regina is the single alcoholic mother

447
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,376
with the sweet handicapped child.

448
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:28,129
We're the midwestern royalty

449
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,982
saddled with raising
the raven-haired hell raiser.

450
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,353
She said that?

451
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:36,545
In so many words. Look, if I sign
on to collaborate with her,

452
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:37,883
she's not going to listen
to what I have to say

453
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:40,094
she's gonna use my name to legitimize

454
00:26:40,095 --> 00:26:43,419
whatever salacious slant
she thinks is gonna sell books.

455
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,152
I'll call Amanda.

456
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:47,747
Why? You think she's going to

457
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:49,962
tell you something
different than she told me?

458
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:51,204
I don't know. Maybe.

459
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:52,766
- I'll give her a push.
- I pushed.

460
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,441
That's her answer.

461
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:56,865
I can handle it.

462
00:26:58,606 --> 00:26:59,860
Okay

463
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,261
So what's your zodiac sign?

464
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:05,481
Libra.

465
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:10,564
My birthday is october 22nd.

466
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,303
No, your birthday is june 24th...

467
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,134
- It's cancer.
- Right.

468
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:16,899
Sorry. I'm a little nervous.

469
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,639
Hey, uh, mom made some
extra artichoke dip.

470
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:23,772
It's Toby's favorite. Where is he?

471
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,870
- He's getting ink cartridges.
- Lots of Carlton kids

472
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:28,677
in need of novelty I.D.s.

473
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,606
Mmm, this stuff is amazing.

474
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:34,598
- You have a fake I.D.?
- Yep.

475
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,244
Daphne Rabinsky from
Pleasantville, New York.

476
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:39,101
I'm going to Joey's tonight with Simone

477
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:41,523
and some other girls from
the Buckner basketball team.

478
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,291
- Thanks, Wilke.
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,478
Excellent. Toby would've loved it.

480
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:58,089
- Hey.
- Yeah?

481
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,515
I just wanted to tell you to, uh uh...

482
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,738
be careful with Simone.

483
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:09,466
- What do you mean?
- Simone can be kind of...

484
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,811
What?

485
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:16,293
You know what? Never mind.

486
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,672
Wow!

487
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:23,351
You got Emmett. You dated Ty.

488
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,893
You didn't want me to be with Liam

489
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,033
and now you're warning me off

490
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:28,571
of someone you're not
even friends with anymore?

491
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:32,190
You're right. My bad. Have a good time.

492
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:33,943
I will.

493
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,139
Hi.

494
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,337
Oh, um, artichoke dip.

495
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:21,399
No, it was me and my mom.

496
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:25,675
My other mom.

497
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,587
Don't interpret for me.
I want Melody to see that I'm trying.

498
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:43,915
Okay.

499
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:03,478
Let the games begin.

- Where did you get this?
- Wilke.

503
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:21,914
I am so talking to him tomorrow.
Or maybe tonight.

504
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,475
Wilke, you're too early.
I don't have my beer goggles on yet.

505
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,668
Oh! Usually by 9:00
that's all you were wearing.

506
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,592
Wait wait... were you guys together?

507
00:30:30,593 --> 00:30:33,176
- Briefly.
- And then I released him into the wild.

508
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:35,348
Hey, we've got a table.

509
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,300
Come on, you can bring
your friend here, as long as

510
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,730
he promises to do everything we say.

511
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:41,962
- I'm in.
- Wilke.

512
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:44,867
- What are you doing here?
- You invited me.

513
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:47,935
Well, you told me where you'd be,
who you'd with.

514
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:50,461
In some cultures that'd be
considered a marriage proposal.

515
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:53,059
- I'm serious.
- And I make you laugh,

516
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,790
that's why we're so good together.

517
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,228
We're not together. We're just friends.

518
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,614
So I completely misread
the making out in the car,

519
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:02,245
the heart-to-heart
conversation on the dock...

520
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:04,258
I might have sent some mixed signals

521
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,635
but it doesn't change how I feel.

522
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,998
I love talking to you, Wilke...

523
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,692
but you're just not my type.

524
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:16,627
So what's your type? Deaf and into Bay?

525
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:21,321
- This is not about Emmett.
- Really?

526
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,257
- It's not!
- Okay.

527
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,432
Well, message received.

528
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,773
You want that?

529
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,454
Park place is a good property.

530
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,975
I'm sorry. I missed a lot of that.

531
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:28,588
I like to win too.

532
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:35,187
- Ahem, Daphne's the only...
- Got it.

533
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:41,362
It's fine.

534
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:44,816
I know that you guys hang out a lot.

535
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,545
What did I do?

536
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,100
You signed "Hang out" wrong.

537
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,814
You said "I know you guys
get circumcised a lot."

538
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,377
You're laughing at me.

539
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,298
Melody, stop.

540
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:16,676
You know what? This obviously...

541
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:21,459
Thank you for the lovely evening.

542
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:23,967
I'll just... I'll text you.

543
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,085
I'll drive you.

544
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,994
What's the matter with you?

545
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,932
Bay is my daughter and
your son's girlfriend.

546
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:43,155
You owe her an apology.

547
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:03,086
No way!

548
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,521
Oh, all teeth.

549
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,153
And I'm betting he had salami for dinner.

550
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,902
Eww!

551
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,839
What did you say to him?

552
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,560
- "Wanna make out?"
- Subtle.

553
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:25,448
Okay, Daphne, your turn.

554
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:28,004
No no no, Daphne's not
a part of the team yet,

555
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,962
so she doesn't have to take the dare.

556
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,126
I'm sorry, it's kinda dark in here.
What'd you say?

557
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:34,384
- You don't have to take the dare.
- Pffft!

558
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:37,206
You think I can't do it? Pick the guy.

559
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,114
Here's to the competitive spirit.

560
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,357
Okay, um, let's see...

561
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,075
Him.

562
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,556
- "Do you wanna make out"?
- It works every time.

563
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,948
- Hi.
- Hi.

564
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,395
Don't look now, but my friends over there

565
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,749
dared me to come over here and kiss you.

566
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:10,748
Do you mind?

567
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:15,758
- Not a bit.
- I'll take that as a yes then.

568
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:21,990
Girl, yeah!

569
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,898
What the hell are you doing?

570
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,319
- Oh, uh-oh.
- Guy: She came on to me!

571
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,040
- It was a dare.
- Do I look stupid to you?

572
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,732
Excuse me, but my friend's
colostomy bag is about to explode.

573
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:36,534
How could you do that to me?

574
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:37,785
- Come on.
- I go to the bathroom...

575
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:38,919
Let's get out of here.

576
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,149
Did you just say I have a colostomy bag?

577
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,699
- Let's go.
- Hey, we need to pay.

578
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,860
Oh, um, I'll take care of it.
I'll meet you guys out front.

579
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:46,916
Okay, cool.

580
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:51,116
Hey, um, I am so sorry about that.

581
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,955
What're you talking about?
That was really fun!

582
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:55,654
Okay, good.

583
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:57,699
- I'll see you in a second.
- Okay.

584
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,708
Snooki Polizzi wrote a book.

585
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:16,174
Valerie Bertinelli, she wrote a book.

586
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:19,403
Kendra Wilkinson... she wrote two.

587
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,559
- Who's Kendra Wilkinson?
- One of Hugh Hefner's ex-girlfriends.

588
00:36:23,863 --> 00:36:26,344
And Keith Richards? He pickled his brain

589
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:30,007
on heroin and meth for 20 years
and even he wrote a book.

590
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,393
Actually I think Keith
wrote this with somebody.

591
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,110
Whatever. The point is

592
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,019
all of these people can write
books about their lives,

593
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,191
why can't I? No one knows
my story better than I do.

594
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,829
And I got straight
"A"s in english all through college...

595
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,606
including two upper-division
creative writing classes.

596
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,432
And if I get stuck,
I can always get someone to help me.

597
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,535
Like Kendra?

598
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,634
Honey. What do you think?

599
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,911
I think it is an outstanding idea.

600
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,011
- You know what I say?
- Hmm?

602
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:07,698
I say Tina Choi can go pound sand.

603
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,877
- She is a total bitch.
- Honestly, I've never seen her like that...

604
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:25,106
So it's me. I bring out the worst in her?

605
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:27,282
- I didn't say that.
- It can't be because I'm hearing.

606
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,262
You're hearing and she loves you.

607
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:30,291
I don't think Emmett's

608
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,535
ever been this serious
about someone before.

609
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,682
I think it's probably just scary
for her to think about losing him.

610
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,146
Okay, so the mama bear syndrome
that makes it all right?

611
00:37:39,147 --> 00:37:42,007
- I didn't say that.
- You are totally defending her.

612
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:43,112
She's my best friend.

613
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:45,652
She's been there for
me and I owe her a lot.

614
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,723
That's right, I forgot...
and you don't owe me anything.

615
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,537

Hey, forget your key?

618
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:08,674
No. I saw you through the window.

619
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:10,187
I needed to talk to you.

620
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:12,097
Sure. What's up?

621
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:16,188
I decided to take coach Medlock's offer.

622
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,331
I'm going to join the Buckner team.

623
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,721
I thought we discussed this.

624
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:24,939
No, I floated the idea
and you shot it down.

625
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,072
I shot... I didn't shoot anything down.

626
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:29,323
I simply reminded you that

627
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:31,027
you happen to committed to another team.

628
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:34,372
It's not even a team! No one cares
if we win except me and you!

629
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:35,831
Daphne, I know this is frustrating,

630
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:39,060
but we're building.
These things take time.

631
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:42,011
You are always telling us to take
the shot when we get the chance

632
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:45,329
because we might not get another one.
Well, that's what I'm doing.

633
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,251
We're in the middle of a season.

634
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:51,015
Okay, sweetie, you cannot quit your team.

635

- Do not quit your team.
- I know you don't care about this,

636
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:53,448
but there are so many things

637
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,863
- in life that I don't like...
- I do care about this.

638
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:58,309
And can't change.
This is something I can change.
