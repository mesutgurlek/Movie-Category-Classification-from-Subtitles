1
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,626
Fucking God!

2
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,443
''Apartment For Rent''

3
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,082
I'd Iike a phone sIug.

4
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,670
- AII out. Down, back and Ieft.
- Thanks.

5
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,153
Momma, this is Jeanne.

6
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,451
There's an apartment in Passy
I'm going to see.

7
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:05,728
Then I go meet Tom at the station.

8
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,573
See you Iater.

9
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,925
Kisses. So Iong.

10
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,895
I'm here for the apartment.

11
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,091
I saw the sign.

12
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,339
- Sign?
- Yes.

13
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,951
What sign?

14
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,486
AIways the same.
Nobody teIIs me anything.

15
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:24,111
- I'd Iike to see it.
- To rent it?

16
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,333
I don't know yet.

17
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,685
They rent, they Ieave,
and I'm the Iast to know.

18
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32,601
You think that's fair?

19
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,893
If you want to go up aIone,
go on.

20
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,773
I'm afraid of the rats.

21
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,667
The key is gone.

22
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:44,657
Lots of strange things happen.

23
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,699
They drink six bottIes a day.

24
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:57,787
Wait. There must be a dupIicate.

25
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,179
Here it is.

26
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,732
You're very young, right?

27
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,229
She's crazy.

28
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,926
Who are you?

29
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:20,886
What a fright.
How'd you get in?

30
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,712
By the door.

31
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,078
Oh, yes. I Ieft it open.

32
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,174
But I didn't hear you come in.

33
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,762
- I was aIready here.
- Excuse me?

34
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,732
Then the key--

35
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,638
And I bribed the concierge.

36
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,891
These oId houses are fascinating.

37
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:54,615
An armchair wouId Iook good here.

38
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,663
The armchair has to go...

39
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,163
in front of the window.

40
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,111
You are American?

41
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,719
You have an American accent.

42
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,431
- WiII you rent it?
- And you?

43
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,592
I don't know.

44
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,832
What are you doing?

45
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,128
Do I answer or not?

46
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,604
There's no one here.

47
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:41,800
There is no one.

48
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,673
I don't know.

49
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:29,102
Then you decided to take it?

50
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:35,578
I had decided, but--

51
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:39,322
But now I don't know.

52
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,802
Do you Iike it?

53
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,217
Do you?

54
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,154
I have to think about it.

55
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,362
Think fast.

56
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,717
You stiII here?

57
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:34,804
Attention.

58
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,027
Who do they take us for?

59
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:39,738
This is cinema.
We're making a movie.

60
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:43,459
If I kiss you,
that might be cinema.

61
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,777
If I caress you,
it might be cinema.

62
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:49,832
What the deviI do they want?
I know them.

63
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:54,406
I'm shooting a fiIm-- ''Portrait
of a GirI--'' for teIevision.

64
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,256
And the girI is you.

65
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,209
But you're mad! You shouId have
asked my permission.

66
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:01,085
Yes, but it amuses me...

67
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:05,508
to begin with the girI
of the portrait who meets her fiance.

68
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:07,056
This is my crew.

69
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,490
And so you kiss me...

70
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:13,677
knowing it's a fiIm.

71
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,051
Coward!

72
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,854
See, it'II be most of aII
a Iove story.

73
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,316
TeII me, Jeanne.

74
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,557
What did you do
whiIe I was away?

75
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,384
I thought of you day and night
and I cried.

76
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,648
DarIing, I can't
Iive without you.

77
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:30,752
Magnificent! Stop! Perfect!

78
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,633
I wanted to cIean up...

79
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,543
but the poIice didn't Iet me.

80
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:47,888
They didn't beIieve in suicide.

81
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:49,412
Too much bIood aII over.

82
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,301
They had fun making me reenact.

83
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,974
''She went there.

84
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,767
She went here.

85
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:14,527
She opened the curtain.''

86
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,131
I did everything Iike her.

87
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:20,038
The cIients, awake aII night.

88
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:23,079
The hoteI fuII of poIice.

89
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,958
They pIaying around with the bIood.

90
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,341
AII spies.

91
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:42,441
If she was sad,
if she was happy...

92
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:44,580
If you fought,
if you hit each other.

93
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:46,688
And then when you were married...

94
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,607
why you didn't have chiIdren.

95
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:52,031
Pigs.

96
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,067
They treated me Iike dirt.

97
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,009
They said...

98
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,928
''Nervous type, your boss.

99
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,582
You know he was a boxer?''

100
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:09,415
So?

101
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,328
''But he didn't do weII.''

102
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,315
Then he was...

103
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,324
an actor.

104
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,264
And then a bongo pIayer.

105
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:28,112
RevoIutionary in South America.

106
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,677
JournaIist in Japan.

107
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:33,769
One day he debarks in Tahiti.

108
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:35,647
Wanders around.

109
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:39,391
Learns French.

110
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,507
Then he arrives in Paris.

111
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:42,854
And here...

112
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,573
meets a woman with money.

113
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:50,852
Marries her and--

114
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,496
''Now what's your boss do?''

115
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:57,290
He's kept.

116
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,543
''Can I cIean up now?''

117
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,465
''Don't touch anything.

118
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,776
You reaIIy think...

119
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,978
she kiIIed herseIf?''

120
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,168
And then he pushed me
in a corner trying to--

121
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,539
Turn off the water.

122
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:20,250
Maybe they'II do an autopsy.

123
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:26,452
Why don't you
turn off the water?

124
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,352
Here's your razor.

125
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,453
It's not mine.

126
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,611
They don't need it anymore.

127
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,528
The inquiry is over.

128
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes, she had some cuts here
and on the neck.

129
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,505
Excuse me.
Where shouId I put it?

130
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:02,636
- You couId have rung.
- It was open. Here?

131
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,689
No, in front of the firepIace.

132
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,946
And these chairs?

133
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,225
Here's the tabIe.
Where do I put it?

134
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,694
How do I know?
He'II decide.

135
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,699
I'II Ieave it here.

136
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:26,232
- Heavy. It's reaIIy a doubIe.
- But it won't fit.

137
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,427
You'II see.
Your husband'II find room.

138
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:38,786
What a mess.

139
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,972
Thank you.

140
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,837
This armchair has to go
in front of the window.

141
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:53,950
Like that.

142
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:57,237
I onIy came to return the key.

143
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:59,572
- To return it to you.
- What do I care?

144
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,474
Take off your coat.

145
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,962
Come on. Give me a hand.

146
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,890
Take these chairs...

147
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:12,803
and put them here.

148
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,050
Put them on the other side.

149
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,931
Take it too.

150
00:24:26,996 --> 00:24:28,623
You didn't Iose any time.

151
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,440
Listen, sir...

152
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,540
I have to go.

153
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,993
Look, sir, I've gotta go.

154
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:45,207
The bed is too big
for the room.

155
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,131
I don't know what to caII you.

156
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,423
I don't have a name.

157
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:51,194
- You want to know my name?
- No, I don't!

158
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,680
I don't wanna know your name.

159
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,518
You don't have a name
and I don't have a name either.

160
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:58,603
No names here.
Not one name.

161
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,176
You're crazy.

162
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:03,514
Maybe I am, but I don't wanna know
anything about you.

163
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,913
I don't wanna know where you Iive
or where you come from.

164
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:08,573
I wanna know nothing!
You understand?

165
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,467
- You scare me.
- Nothing.

166
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,629
You and I are gonna meet here...

167
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,377
without knowing anything
that goes on outside here.

168
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:23,171
But why?

169
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:26,429
Because...

170
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:29,219
we don't need names here.

171
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:33,027
Don't you see?

172
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,346
We're gonna forget...

173
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,028
everything that we knew.

174
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,464
Every-- AII the peopIe...

175
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:43,260
aII that we do, aII that we--

176
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,915
Wherever we Iive.

177
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,368
We're going to forget that.
Everything.

178
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,467
But I can't.

179
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:58,417
Can you?

180
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,324
I don't know.

181
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,548
Are you scared?

182
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:16,451
Come.

183
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:52,505
- I thought I'd find you here.
- I expected you Iater.

184
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,941
I took the first train.

185
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:04,779
PauI, how horribIe!

186
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,221
Papa is in bed with asthma.

187
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,252
The doctors forbade him
to come.

188
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,730
Better.

189
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:41,066
I'm stronger.

190
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:03,839
What are you Iooking for?

191
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,825
Something that expIains it.

192
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,875
A Ietter, a cIue--

193
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,180
There's nothing,
absoIuteIy nothing.

194
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,497
It's impossibIe
that my IittIe Rose--

195
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:25,616
Nothing for her mother.
Not a word.

196
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,619
UseIess to Iook anymore.

197
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,760
Not even for you,
her husband.

198
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,821
You need to rest.

199
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,950
Maybe there's a vacant room.

200
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:16,660
With a razor?

201
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,294
What time did it happen?

202
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:29,094
I don't know. At night.

203
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,665
And then?

204
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:35,214
And then--

205
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:38,751
I aIready toId you on the phone.

206
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,615
When I found her...

207
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:45,606
I caIIed the ambuIance.

208
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,006
After your teIephone caII...

209
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:53,377
we were awake
aII night Iong...

210
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:56,102
taIking about you and Rose.

211
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,991
And Papa taIked softIy...

212
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:02,173
as if it happened
in our house.

213
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:20,044
- Where did it happen?
- In a room.

214
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:22,361
Did she suffer?

215
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,522
Ask the doctors
who did the autopsy.

216
00:30:25,753 --> 00:30:27,345
The autopsy?

217
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,659
I aIready had some announcements.

218
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,339
I've had enough of deaths.

219
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,493
I think of everything.
I do.

220
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:08,137
I'II prepare
a IoveIy funeraI chamber...

221
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:09,719
with Iots of fIowers.

222
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,542
The cards...

223
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:17,572
the mourning cIothes,
the fIowers.

224
00:31:19,226 --> 00:31:21,353
You have everything
in that suitcase.

225
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:24,522
You didn't forget anything.

226
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,560
But I don't want
any priests here.

227
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:32,661
Understand?

228
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,601
You need them.
It must be a reIigious funeraI.

229
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:38,649
Rose wasn't a beIiever.

230
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,175
Nobody beIieves
in a fucking God here!

231
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,432
PauI, don't shout.
Don't shout Iike that!

232
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:52,094
A priest doesn't want
any suicides.

233
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:54,288
Church doesn't want
any suicides, do they?

234
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:58,029
They'II give her absoIution.

235
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,174
AbsoIution and a nice mass.
That's aII I ask.

236
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:06,135
Understand? Rose--
She's my baby girI.

237
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:10,350
Why did she kiII herseIf?

238
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:11,993
Why?

239
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:14,519
Why did she kiII herseIf?

240
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:17,804
Why?

241
00:32:27,835 --> 00:32:29,996
You don't know, do you?

242
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:32,872
You don't know.

243
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:19,539
Let's just Iook at each other.

244
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:31,609
It's beautifuI
without knowing anything.

245
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:49,236
Maybe--

246
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,544
Maybe we can come
without touching.

247
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:55,786
Come without touching?

248
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:05,985
You concentrating?

249
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,281
Did you come yet?

250
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,413
- It's difficuIt.
- I didn't either yet.

251
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,283
You're not trying hard enough.

252
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:24,048
I shaII have to invent
a name for you.

253
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,226
A name? Oh, Jesus.

254
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,765
Christ.

255
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:32,931
Oh, God, I've been caIIed
by a miIIion names aII my Iife.

256
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,289
I don't want a name. I'm better off
with a grunt or a groan for a name.

257
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:41,131
You want to hear my name?

258
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,554
So mascuIine.
Listen to mine.

259
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,739
I didn't get the Iast name.

260
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,215
You shouIdn't have
done that to me.

261
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:50,059
But it's not a wig.
It's mine.

262
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm not beautifuI?

263
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,639
TeII me you don't
Iike the way I Iook.

264
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:02,833
But I do
Iike the way you Iook.

265
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:05,942
Listen.

266
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:09,686
You seem changed,
but you're the same.

267
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,532
I can aIready see a shot.

268
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:16,027
The camera is high.

269
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:18,728
It sIowIy descends
toward you.

270
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,781
And as you advance,
it moves in on you.

271
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:23,660
There's music too.

272
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:29,752
It gets cIoser
and cIoser to you.

273
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,789
I'm in a hurry.
Let's begin.

274
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:36,693
But first we'II
taIk about it a IittIe.

275
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:40,610
Tonight we improvise.

276
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,508
FoIIow me.

277
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:56,703
He was my chiIdhood friend.

278
00:37:56,671 --> 00:38:00,607
He wouId watch me for hours.
Maybe he understood me.

279
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,674
Dogs are better than peopIe.

280
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,722
May I present OIympia,
my nurse.

281
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,770
Mustapha knew how to teII
the poor from the rich.

282
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,917
If someone weII-dressed
came in, he didn't growI.

283
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:19,149
But if it was a beggar,
you shouId have seen him.

284
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,008
The coIoneI had him recognize Arabs
by their odor.

285
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:24,713
- OIympia, open the door.
- First, give me a kiss.

286
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:29,370
Go and open it.

287
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,037
OIympia is the personification
of domestic virtue.

288
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:34,433
FaithfuI, economic and racist.

289
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:40,156
At Papa's death, we moved
to the oId country house.

290
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:43,880
My chiIdhood was
made up of smeIIs.

291
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:46,500
The moId on the waIIs,
the cIosed rooms.

292
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,057
Many chiIdren came to pIay.

293
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:51,891
We ran from morning to night.

294
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,034
Growing oId is a crime.

295
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:56,848
That's me.

296
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,065
And that's MademoiseIIe Sauvage,
the teacher.

297
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,024
Severe and reIigious.

298
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,006
She was too good
and spoiIed you.

299
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,829
This is Christine.
The best friend.

300
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:12,284
She's married
and has two chiIdren.

301
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,690
It's Iike a viIIage here.
Everyone knows everyone.

302
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,453
I couIdn't Iive in Paris.

303
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,201
It's more humane here.

304
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,123
It's meIanchoIy
remembering the past.

305
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,706
Why meIanchoIy?

306
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,902
It's marveIous.

307
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,279
It's your chiIdhood.
It's everything I want.

308
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:31,910
And what are you doing there?

309
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,864
Who are aII these zombies
around us?

310
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,198
The door!

311
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,041
I'm opening the door.

312
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,926
I'm opening the doors!

313
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:45,938
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the shot.

314
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,678
There. I found it.

315
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,497
Reverse gear.

316
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,457
And what are you doing here?

317
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,925
Beat it! Scram!

318
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,626
Yes. Reverse gear!

319
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,246
Understand? Like a car.

320
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,939
Put it in reverse.

321
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:07,255
CIose your eyes.

322
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,392
Back up. CIose your eyes.

323
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:14,272
Come forward, backing up.

324
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:16,906
Keep going
and find your chiIdhood again.

325
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:19,264
It's Papa.

326
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:22,133
There. You take off
and find your chiIdhood again.

327
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,479
In fuII dress uniform.

328
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,116
Don't be afraid.
Overcome the obstacIes.

329
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:29,487
Papa in AIgiers.

330
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,739
You are fifteen. Fourteen.

331
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,300
Thirteen. TweIve.

332
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:37,961
EIeven. Ten. Nine.

333
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:41,841
My favorite street
at eight years oId.

334
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,383
My notebook.

335
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:56,426
My French homework.
Theme: ''The Countryside.''

336
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,914
Exposition: ''The country
is the home of the cows.

337
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:02,105
The cow is
aII dressed in Ieather.

338
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:05,539
The cow has four sides:
front, back...

339
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,461
ñtop and bottom.''

340
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:11,270
- Isn't that good?
- ReaIIy charming.

341
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:17,458
Source of my cuIture
was Larousse and I copied it.

342
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:20,476
''Menstruation. Feminine noun.

343
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:24,751
PhysioIogicaI function
consisting in fIow.

344
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:26,466
Penis. MascuIine noun.

345
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:31,096
Organ of copuIation, measuring
between five and 40 centimeters.''

346
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:32,668
This is a IittIe Robert!

347
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,040
Look.

348
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,984
- Who is it?
- My first Iove.

349
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:44,296
- Who?
- It's my cousin PauI. The first Iove.

350
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:46,659
- But his eyes are cIosed.
- What?

351
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,150
His eyes are cIosed!

352
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:50,095
He pIayed piano very weII.

353
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:53,847
That's how I remember him--
sitting at the piano.

354
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,662
His fingers fIew over the keys.

355
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,737
He practiced hour after hour.

356
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:03,771
At the bottom of the garden
there were two trees.

357
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:07,147
A pIantain and a chestnut.

358
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:08,871
Sunday after mass...

359
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:11,766
everyone sat under his own tree.

360
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:14,141
It was marveIous.

361
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:16,171
We Iooked into each other's eyes.

362
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:19,029
And for me these trees
were the jungIe.

363
00:42:21,602 --> 00:42:23,968
- What are you doing?
- We're shitting.

364
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:25,530
Why? Can't you see ?

365
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:27,732
- In my jungIe?
- Let's run!

366
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,656
Shoot! Shoot!

367
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:40,009
Did you get everything?

368
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,264
- Did you get it?
- Everything.

369
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,710
OIympia was subIime. She gave
a precise idea of her racism.

370
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:55,900
This reaIIy is a jungIe.

371
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,808
TeII me about your father.

372
00:42:57,794 --> 00:43:00,160
- Aren't we finished?
- Five minutes.

373
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,564
But I'm in a hurry.
for work.

374
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,657
But the coIoneI?

375
00:43:04,643 --> 00:43:09,603
The coIoneI had green eyes
and shiny boots.

376
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,943
I Ioved him Iike a god.

377
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:13,841
He was so handsome
in his uniform.

378
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:17,228
What a steaming piIe
of horseshit.

379
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:19,646
What are you saying?
I forbid you.

380
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:24,880
AII uniforms are buIIshit.

381
00:43:24,962 --> 00:43:27,123
Everything outside this pIace
is buIIshit.

382
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:32,545
Besides that, I don't want to hear
about your stories about your past.

383
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:37,750
He died in '58 in AIgeria.

384
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:40,431
Or '68 or '28 or '98.

385
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:43,652
In '58,
and I forbid you to joke.

386
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:47,114
Why don't you stop taIking about things
that don't matter here?

387
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:50,130
What the heII's the difference?

388
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:57,188
So what do I have to say
and what do I have to do?

389
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,267
Come on the good ship IoIIipop.

390
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:22,629
Why don't you go back to America?

391
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:34,161
I don't know.

392
00:44:35,684 --> 00:44:37,618
Bad memories, I guess.

393
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:43,153
Of what?

394
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:51,958
My father was a drunk.

395
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,820
Tough, whore-fucker,
bar fighter...

396
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:59,698
super mascuIine...

397
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:04,517
and he was tough.

398
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,386
My mother was very--

399
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:10,145
very poetic.

400
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:12,084
And aIso a drunk.

401
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,807
AII my memories
when I was a kid...

402
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,940
was of her being arrested nude.

403
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,476
We Iived in this smaII town.

404
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:27,935
Farming community.
We Iived on a farm.

405
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,147
And I'd come home after schooI...

406
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:38,137
and she'd be gone...

407
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:40,417
or in jaiI or something.

408
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:44,498
And then--

409
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,949
I used to have to miIk a cow.

410
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:56,583
Every morning and every night.
I Iiked that.

411
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:01,171
But I remember...

412
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:05,743
one time I was aII dressed up...

413
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:08,695
to go out and take this girI
to a basketbaII game.

414
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:14,384
I started to go and my father said,
''You have to miIk the cow.''

415
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:18,905
I asked him,
''WouId you pIease miIk it for me?''

416
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,189
He said, ''No,
get your ass out there.''

417
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:24,955
So I went out
and I was in a hurry.

418
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:28,835
Didn't have time
to change my shoes, and I had...

419
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:31,039
cow shit aII over my shoes.

420
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:35,347
On the way to the basketbaII game,
it smeIIed in the car.

421
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,515
And...

422
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:45,942
I don't know, I just--

423
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:49,329
I can't remember
very many good things.

424
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:53,550
Not one?

425
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,475
Yeah. Some.

426
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,753
There was a farmer.
Very nice guy.

427
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,844
OId guy, very poor
and worked reaI hard.

428
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:03,589
I used to...

429
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:06,956
work in a ditch
draining Iand for farming.

430
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:11,851
And he wore overaIIs
and he smoked a cIay pipe.

431
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,426
HaIf the time he wouIdn't
put tobacco in it.

432
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:19,510
And I hated the work.

433
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:21,428
It was hot and dirty and...

434
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,883
broke my back.

435
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:29,593
AII day Iong I'd watch his spit...

436
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:33,842
which wouId run down the pipe stem
and hang on the bowI of the pipe.

437
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:39,432
I used to make bets with myseIf
on when it was gonna faII off.

438
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,632
And I aIways Iost.

439
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:43,471
I never saw it faII off.

440
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:48,497
I'd just Iook around and it'd be gone
and a new one wouId be there.

441
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,356
Then we had a beautifuI--

442
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,087
WeII, my mother
taught me to Iove nature.

443
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,900
And...

444
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,003
I guess that was
the most she couId do.

445
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,314
And in front of our house...

446
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,637
we had this big fieId, meadow.

447
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:13,985
It was a mustard fieId
in the summer.

448
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:18,054
We had a big,
bIack dog named Dutchy.

449
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,053
She used to hunt for rabbits
in that fieId.

450
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,727
But she couIdn't see them.

451
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:26,712
So she'd have to Ieap up
in this mustard fieId...

452
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:31,099
Iook around very quickIy
to see where the rabbits were.

453
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:33,713
And it was...

454
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:36,299
very beautifuI.

455
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:38,162
She never caught the rabbits.

456
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,847
You have been had.

457
00:48:40,806 --> 00:48:42,137
Oh, reaIIy?

458
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:47,817
I don't wanna know anything
about your past, baby.

459
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:49,782
Think I was
teIIing you the truth?

460
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,316
Maybe.

461
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:09,102
I'm Red Riding Hood
and you're the woIf.

462
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:19,889
Oh, what strong arms you have.

463
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:22,782
The better to squeeze
a fart out of you.

464
00:49:24,391 --> 00:49:26,791
What Iong naiIs you have.

465
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:30,315
The better to scratch your ass with.

466
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,870
What a Iot of fur you have.

467
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,859
The better
to Iet your crabs hide in.

468
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:53,040
What a Iong tongue you have.

469
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:57,768
The better to stick in your rear,
my dear.

470
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:19,197
That's your happiness
and my ''ha-penis.''

471
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,913
Peanuts?

472
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:22,428
SchIong.

473
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:31,062
Prick. Joint.

474
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:36,713
It's funny.

475
00:50:36,712 --> 00:50:39,203
It's Iike pIaying grown-ups
when you're IittIe.

476
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,920
I feeI Iike a chiId again here.

477
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:47,973
- Did you have fun as a kid?
- It's the most beautifuI thing.

478
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:52,372
Is it beautifuI to be made
into a tattIetaIe...

479
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:56,326
or forced to admire authority or
seII yourseIf for a piece of candy?

480
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:59,224
- I wasn't Iike that.
- No?

481
00:50:59,176 --> 00:51:01,701
I was writing poems.

482
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:05,665
I was drawing castIes,
big castIes with tower.

483
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:07,510
A Iot of tower.

484
00:51:09,768 --> 00:51:12,999
- You never thought about sex?
- No, no sex.

485
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:15,371
- No, no sex.
- Tower.

486
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:19,397
You were probabIy in Iove
with your teacher then.

487
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:23,270
- My teacher was a woman.
- Then she was a Iesbian.

488
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:26,010
- How did you know?
- That's cIassicaI.

489
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,393
But anyway--

490
00:51:28,393 --> 00:51:30,884
My first Iove
was my cousin PauI.

491
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:36,713
I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
if you keep teIIing me names.

492
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:38,244
No names.

493
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:41,150
I don't mind if you teII the truth,
but don't give me the names.

494
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,031
- I can't handIe that.
- Sorry.

495
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:51,024
Go on and teII the truth.

496
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:53,683
- What eIse?
- I was 13.

497
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,575
He was dark, very thin.

498
00:51:56,745 --> 00:51:59,270
I can see him. Big nose.

499
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,265
A big romance.

500
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:04,427
I feII in Iove with him
when I heard him pIaying piano.

501
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,991
You mean, when he first
got into your knickers.

502
00:52:06,953 --> 00:52:10,286
He was a chiId prodigy.
He was pIaying with both hands.

503
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:12,151
I'II bet he was.

504
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:15,434
ProbabIy getting his kicks.

505
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:18,870
- We were dying of heat.
- Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:21,023
Good excuse. What eIse?

507
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:24,834
In the afternoon,
when the grown-ups were napping--

508
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:27,509
- You started grabbing his joint.
- You're crazy!

509
00:52:27,465 --> 00:52:29,831
- WeII, he touched you.
- I never Iet him. Never.

510
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:36,224
Liar, Iiar, pants on fire,
nose as Iong as a teIephone wire.

511
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:38,039
You mean to teII me
that he didn't touch you?

512
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:41,961
Look me straight in the face
and say ''He didn't touch me once.''

513
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:45,293
No, he touched me,
but the way he did it.

514
00:52:45,257 --> 00:52:50,024
Aha! The way he did it.
Okay, what did he do?

515
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:52,696
Behind the house
there were two trees:

516
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,084
a pIantain tree and a chestnut.

517
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,009
I sat under the pIantain tree
and he sat under the chestnut.

518
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:02,619
And one, two, three,
we each began to masturbate.

519
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:05,234
The first who came won.

520
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:15,897
ñWhy don't you Iisten to me?

521
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,582
When did you first come?
How oId were you?

522
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:21,721
The first time?

523
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:24,573
I was very Iate for schooI.

524
00:53:24,522 --> 00:53:27,355
I began running downhiII.

525
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:31,890
SuddenIy, I feIt
a strong sensation here.

526
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:35,204
I came as I ran.

527
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,976
Then I ran faster and faster,
and the more I ran...

528
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,557
the more I came.

529
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:44,165
Two days Iater
I tried running again...

530
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:46,041
but no dice.

531
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,692
Why don't you Iisten to me?

532
00:53:54,763 --> 00:53:58,062
You know, it seems to me
I'm taIking to the waII.

533
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:00,555
Your soIitude weighs on me,
you know?

534
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:02,548
It isn't induIgent or generous.

535
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,133
You're an egoist!

536
00:54:08,682 --> 00:54:10,946
I can be by myseIf too,
you know.

537
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,488
We can't sIeep with this music.

538
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:58,477
I came to this hoteI
for one night...

539
00:56:58,477 --> 00:57:00,809
and stayed for five years.

540
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:05,974
When we had the hoteI
peopIe came here to sIeep.

541
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:08,328
Now they do anything.

542
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:13,068
They hide out, take drugs,
pIay music.

543
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:19,828
Remove that hand.

544
00:57:19,821 --> 00:57:22,517
You're not aIone.
I'm here.

545
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:29,838
You're crazy!

546
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,566
I'm beginning to understand.

547
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:34,591
You want me to stop the music?

548
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,821
Okay.

549
00:57:36,877 --> 00:57:38,811
I'II make him shut up.

550
00:57:39,662 --> 00:57:42,028
What are you doing, PauI?

551
00:57:41,997 --> 00:57:45,694
What's the matter, Mother?
Are you upset? Don't be upset.

552
00:57:45,613 --> 00:57:47,547
Nothing reaIIy
to be upset about.

553
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:51,994
It takes so IittIe to make them afraid.
You wanna know what they're afraid of?

554
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,047
They're afraid of the dark.
Imagine that.

555
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,293
I want you to meet my friend.

556
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,532
Turn on the Iight.

557
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,542
You ought to meet
a few cIients of the hoteI.

558
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:03,087
FoIks, I'd Iike you
to say heIIo to Mom.

559
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:06,455
Mom, this is Mr. Juicehead Junkie.

560
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,782
And Mr. Saxophone...

561
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,218
he's our connection, Mom.

562
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:13,116
Gives us some hard stuff.

563
00:58:13,102 --> 00:58:18,096
And right here is the beautifuI
Miss BIow Job of 1933.

564
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:21,834
She's stiII making a few points
when she takes her teeth out.

565
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:23,835
- Light, PauI.
- Don't you want to say heIIo?

566
00:58:23,822 --> 00:58:25,983
This is Mom.

567
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,901
You afraid of the dark, Mom?
She's afraid of the dark.

568
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:31,474
Oh, weII, poor thing.
AII right, sweetheart.

569
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:36,068
I'II take care of you. Don't worry.
I'II give you a IittIe Iight.

570
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,884
Don't you worry about a thing.

571
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:45,660
Let's go back to bed.

572
00:58:58,254 --> 00:59:00,722
- Good night, Madam.
- Good night.

573
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:07,219
Good night, MarceI.

574
00:59:08,175 --> 00:59:10,109
Good night, PauI.

575
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:22,879
Who is it?

576
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,591
You Iike?

577
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:28,081
He was Rosa's Iover.

578
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:03,736
What am I doing
in this apartment with you?

579
01:00:03,663 --> 01:00:05,153
Love?

580
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:06,600
WeII...

581
01:00:07,664 --> 01:00:10,497
Iet's say we're just taking...

582
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:13,380
a fIying fuck
at a roIIing doughnut.

583
01:00:14,351 --> 01:00:16,683
So you think I'm a ''wore.''

584
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:19,591
I think you're a what?
A what? A ''wore''?

585
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:22,027
- A ''wore.''
- You mean ''whore,'' right?

586
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,230
Yes. A whore.

587
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:28,007
No, you're just a dear
oId-fashioned girI trying to get aIong.

588
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,320
I'd prefer to be a whore.

589
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:33,910
Why were you
going through my pockets?

590
01:00:33,872 --> 01:00:36,397
To find out who you are.

591
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:40,766
- Yes.
- WeII, if you Iook reaI cIose...

592
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:43,812
you'II see me
hiding behind my zipper.

593
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:50,016
WeII, we know that he buys cIothes
in some big store.

594
01:00:49,904 --> 01:00:51,895
That's not much...

595
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:53,821
but it's a beginning.

596
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:57,364
That's not a beginning.
That's a finish.

597
01:00:57,328 --> 01:01:00,729
WeII, okay.
Let's forget it.

598
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:02,089
How oId are you?

599
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:04,030
I'II be 93 this weekend.

600
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:05,950
Oh!
You don't Iook it.

601
01:01:05,936 --> 01:01:08,097
Thank you.

602
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,514
- Have you been in coIIege?
- Oh, yeah.

603
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,820
Yeah, I went to...

604
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,768
the University of Congo.

605
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:18,879
- Studied whaIe fucking.
- Wow.

606
01:01:19,696 --> 01:01:22,631
Barbers don't usuaIIy
go to university.

607
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:27,686
Are you teIIing me
that I Iook Iike a barber?

608
01:01:27,632 --> 01:01:30,624
No, but that's a razor's barber.

609
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:32,943
That's a barber's razor.

610
01:01:32,912 --> 01:01:35,642
Barber's razors.
Yes.

611
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,534
Or a madman's.

612
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:43,588
So you want to cut me up?

613
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:45,470
No.

614
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:48,516
That wouId be Iike
writing my name on your face.

615
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:50,695
Like they do to sIaves?

616
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,608
SIaves are branded on the ass,
and I want you free.

617
01:01:53,553 --> 01:01:55,248
Free?
I'm not free.

618
01:01:56,593 --> 01:02:01,929
You want to know why you don't
want to know anything about me?

619
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:04,405
- Because you hate women.
- Oh, reaIIy?

620
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:06,803
What have they ever done to you?

621
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:10,783
WeII...

622
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,863
either they aIways pretend
to know who I am...

623
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:17,745
or they pretend that I don't know
who they are, and that's very boring.

624
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:23,482
I'm not afraid to say who I am.
I'm 20 years oId--

625
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:25,741
No! I--
Jesus Christ.

626
01:02:25,713 --> 01:02:27,408
Where's your brain?

627
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,381
Shut up.

628
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:35,113
Get it?

629
01:02:37,073 --> 01:02:40,509
I know it's tough,
but you're gonna have to bear it.

630
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:44,052
You know, these sinks
are reaIIy beautifuI.

631
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:48,609
They're very rare.
You don't find them anymore.

632
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:51,997
I think it's these sinks
that Iet you stay together.

633
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,263
Hmm? Don't you think?

634
01:02:57,586 --> 01:02:59,952
What's that?
What's aII this?

635
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,411
Mad? Mad? Huh?
Mad? Mad?

636
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:13,235
I think I'm happy with you.

637
01:03:16,657 --> 01:03:20,525
Encore! Do it again!

638
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,367
Again!

639
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:27,007
I am coming.
I am ready.

640
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:30,624
Are we going together?

641
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:44,197
He is a jerk.
He didn't even say bye!

642
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:22,769
What are you doing here?

643
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:25,103
I'm coming. I'm fIying.

644
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,006
Stay there!

645
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:28,434
Why didn't you taIk
on the phone?

646
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:30,461
What's the matter?

647
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,385
Find another girI for your fiIm.

648
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,174
But why?

649
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:38,350
You take advantage of me.

650
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:41,383
You make me do things
I've never done.

651
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,890
You're steaIing my time.

652
01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:46,952
You make me do
whatever you want.

653
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:50,432
The fiIm is over.

654
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:02,435
I'm tired of having
my mind raped!
