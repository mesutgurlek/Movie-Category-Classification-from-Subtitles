1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,568
<i>- I found...
- I found...</i>

2
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,038
<i>So many things...</i>

3
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:45,009
<i>- I dreamed of...
- Dreamed of, dreamed of...</i>

4
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,306
<i>You fell in love with me...</i>

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,976
<i>- But I couldn't think...
- But I couldn't think...</i>

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,644
<i>Of how it could be...</i>

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,747
<i>And I finally found him...</i>

8
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,851
<i>And I'm takin'
the long way out.</i>

9
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,954
<i>- 'Cause it's gonna be...
- It's gonna be...</i>

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,958
<i>Somethin' special to me...</i>

11
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,128
<i>Somethin'special to me...
Yeah, yeah.</i>

12
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,265
<i>Days go by and
we're still laughing.</i>

13
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,933
<i>He's all mine...</i>

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,308
<i>And I'm never alone.</i>

15
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,281
<i>Days go by
and we're still happy...</i>

16
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,546
<i>He's all mine alone.</i>

17
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:33,057
<i>He's something special to me.</i>

18
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,321
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

19
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:39,354
<i>And I finally found him.</i>

20
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,698
<i>And I'm takin'
the long way out.</i>

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,500
<i>- 'Cause it's gonna be...
- It's gonna be...</i>

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,633
<i>Somethin'special to me.</i>

23
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,872
<i>Somethin'special to me.
Yeah, yeah.</i>

24
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,939
<i>Days go by and we're still happy.</i>

25
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,042
<i>He's all mine alone.</i>

26
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,919
<i>It all began at the Plaza Hotel...</i>

27
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,082
<i>...twenty years ago
in the month of June.</i>

28
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,561
<i>- Two mothers brought their
daughters, Liv and Emma...</i>

29
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,462
<i>...here to the Palm Court for tea.</i>

30
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,729
<i>On that afternoon,
there was a wedding.</i>

31
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,498
<i>There was something blue,
something borrowed...</i>

32
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,337
<i>...and something completely magical.</i>

33
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,604
<i>And two little girls
from New Jersey...</i>

34
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,738
<i>...held in their hands a new dream...</i>

35
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,615
<i>...that one day they would find
that one person...</i>

36
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,587
<i>...who would stand by them
no matter what...</i>

37
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,624
<i>...and when they did, they too...</i>

38
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,353
<i>...would have June
weddings at the Plaza.</i>

39
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,430
Thank you.

40
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,458
And, yes, Your Honor, I will take
this lofty man to be my husband.

41
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,701
I always knew my wedding
would be the happiest day of my life.

42
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,107
Now I will dance with you
until we have six babies and a house.

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,084
Do you think they let pets
inside the Plaza?

44
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:10,384
<i>Well, it's not like we're getting
married until we're 16 at least.</i>

45
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,890
<i>Next time, can I play the bride?</i>

46
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,893
Emma, you know
I always play the bride.

47
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,419
<i>This will be an everlasting love...</i>

48
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,966
<i>- This will be...
- Not too shabby.</i>

49
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,561
- Caviar cocktail hour...
- Cigar roller, white glove service...

50
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,538
- Celadon cymbidium orchids.
- Great deejay.

51
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,438
So we both admit it's beautiful.

52
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,908
<i>- Um, yeah.
- But?</i>

53
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,071
<i>Do you think it's the work
of Marion St. Claire?</i>

54
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,274
Oh. Marion's a visionary.

55
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,338
Mmm?

56
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,749
<i>- Oh.
- If it had been my wedding...</i>

57
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,584
- Oh, just say it.
- It ain'tJune.

58
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,057
- And it ain't the Plaza.
- It's the elephant in the room.

59
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,151
Yeah.

60
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,629
- And here you are.
- Oh, look.

61
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,258
A duck made out of ice.
Isn't this great?

62
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,268
Know what else is great?

63
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,567
Going home early and watching
your backed-up TiVo?

64
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,607
Am I that predictable?

65
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,972
How about one more dance...

66
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,978
...and I'll give you my piece
of the cake... if you let me lead.

67
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,980
Very funny.

68
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,846
- Come on. Come on.
- You know I always lead.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,386
Hey. Oh.

70
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,445
Hi, girls.

71
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,649
<i>- Are you ready to catch this bouquet?
- Gotta go.</i>

72
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,853
<i>- I'm so happy all of you are here.
- On the other hand, always fun.</i>

73
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,862
I know. They take it so seriously.

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,730
<i>My work friends, sort of.</i>

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,634
<i>My college buds... Oh, my God.</i>

76
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,434
Emma Allan, is that the same dress
you wore to the Delta Gamma...

77
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,032
"Kegs for a Cause" semiformal,
like, a bazillion years ago?

78
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,239
- Yeah.
- What's your point? Because it's a classic.

79
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,306
- If a dress works, you work it hard.
- Oh.

80
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,750
See, that is sweet. And loyal.

81
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,083
Girlfriends sticking up
for each other.

82
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,487
<i>I like that, a lot. Keep that.</i>

83
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,425
- Anyway, are you guys ready to catch this?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,225
Just think about it,
feel it, catch it...

85
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:04,433
One, two, three!

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,270
<i>I would have seen the signs if I'd been there.</i>

87
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:14,245
<i>It's all right there.
Look at Emma's eyes...Like a hunter's.</i>

88
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,183
<i>And Liv's hand...How would you like that
clasped around your throat?</i>

89
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,712
<i>Not that either of them can imagine
hurting each other at this point.</i>

90
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,191
<i>Why should they?
They've been inseparable for 20 years.</i>

91
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,354
Okay, slow down.

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,558
- Why can't we run with iPods?
- We can't run with iPods because iPods...

93
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,863
...are for people who can't be alone
with their own thoughts.

94
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm literally running circles around you.
Do you know that?

95
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,130
Do you know how many things
I can think about at once?

96
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,867
You know what a multitasker I am.

97
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,875
You're not enjoying my conversation?
Is that what you're saying?

98
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,877
- I'm hurt. I am very hurt, Liv.
- I gotta go.

99
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,674
- All right. Have a good day.
- Love you.

100
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,215
- Call me. Tell me how the meeting goes.
- Watch this power walk.

101
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,376
<i>- Whoo!
- WhooI</i>

102
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,882
Hey, did you get the changes to the brief?

103
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,115
- Read and highlighted in the cab.
- Great.

104
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,057
Purse. It's like the whole city
is made out of lint.

105
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,222
<i>It's an aggressive approach, exploiting
the weaknesses of our plaintiff's case...</i>

106
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,356
...and I think judicially
we'll find favor...

107
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,401
Particularly if we pullJustice Givens.

108
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,403
Thank you, Liv.

109
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,405
Our best associate, Mr. Simmons.

110
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,634
Maybe your approach
is too aggressive.

111
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,767
<i>I mean, if we pound them...</i>

112
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,176
...as you suggest, they'll hardly
be in the mood to settle.

113
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,511
Mr. Simmons, you don't...
You don't know me, but I...

114
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,483
<i>I know you.</i>

115
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,815
All you need to know
is how badly you want to win...

116
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,321
...because we won't be settling.

117
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,917
<i>You're right. She's perfect.</i>

118
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,589
- Oh, Ms. Allan?
- Hey, Robert. What's up?

119
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,963
I think Ms. Delgado
is looking for you.

120
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,468
Is she? W-Was she nearby?

121
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,267
- She... She's in her room.
- She's...

122
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,677
Emma, there you are.

123
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,044
- Oh, God, Deb. Hi.
- I know. Isn't it gorgeous?

124
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,141
God, I feel so blessed to have this body.

125
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,210
- You know, I am so late...
- No, listen. You gotta help me out here.

126
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,483
- You know the debate team?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,287
I cannot go to the state finals.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,693
I mean, children talking
about their little problems.

129
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,129
Ugh! You gotta do it for me.

130
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,533
Yeah, Deb, I'm already doing
your late bus patrol...

131
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,538
...and pep squad and your
after-school detention.

132
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,167
- You're the debate team adviser.
I don't think that I should... - I know.

133
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,177
I do so much.

134
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,577
I wish I could just
do the bare minimum.

135
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,912
I so admire you for that.

136
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,042
Thank you.

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,144
Anyway, all right, look.
Here's how we'll work it out.

138
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,815
- I'll do the debate team...
- Okay, good.

139
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,519
Uh-huh. If you take my Tuesday
study halls for the rest of the year.

140
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,562
- Okay?
- Yeah, that's... No.

141
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,496
All right. You owe me, girl.

142
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,262
<i>- Get out of the hallway, kids!
- You know why she does this?</i>

143
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,860
- You're the best teacher at that school.
- No, I...

144
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,236
She's trying to overwork you,
so you crack under pressure.

145
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,468
- Mm-mmm.
- Middle school's a jungle.

146
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,669
I don't know. I think she's kind of sad.

147
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,373
I mean, she's been divorced,
like, three times.

148
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,884
She's way ahead of us.
I mean, where are our divorces?

149
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,886
I gotta get married first.

150
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,515
<i>God, I hate Daniel!</i>

151
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,556
No, Kevin. I'm dealing with a crisis.

152
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,562
What's your crisis?

153
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,996
Uh, that's code for
"I don't want to talk to you."

154
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,034
<i>Oh, I see. Well, then thank you
for putting me through.</i>

155
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,032
<i>- See? I told you those jeans would
look great on you. - They aren't too tight?</i>

156
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,368
<i>No, no. Not at all. But this...</i>

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,772
I mean, Emma, yellow...
Not your color.

158
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,777
Okay? Seriously.
Oh, but you know what? Try this.

159
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,779
Because...You know what? Keep it.

160
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,781
- Well...
- It never hung right on me anyway.

161
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,753
Of course it doesn't
hang right on you.

162
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,258
It's... My size, and it's new.

163
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,919
This is the Dolce blouse
I told you about last week.

164
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,395
- Liv, I can't.
- Hey, hey. It was on sale.

165
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,262
- I practically made money on it.
- Liv, it's too much.

166
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,164
Emma, Emma. Emma...
Just say thank you.Just...

167
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,734
<i>- Thank you. It's beautiful. I love it.
- Good.</i>

168
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,900
Now this... Emma's stuff. Emma's stuff.
Let's get rid of it at one point.

169
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,910
You moved out, like,
a hundred years ago. Okay.

170
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,004
- Daniel's sweater? Cardigan?
You wanna try that? - Yeah, love it.

171
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,920
Oh...

172
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,525
Tiffany box.

173
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,685
- You're getting engaged?
- I'm getting engaged.

174
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,753
- I'm getting engaged!
- You're getting engaged!

175
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,127
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

176
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,723
- Emma...
- No! Stop it. No. Liv!

177
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,634
- I have to look.
- Stop it! No! No!

178
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,433
No, no!

179
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,839
You can't stop me.

180
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,306
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,445
But he should see your face
when you first see the ring.

182
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,314
Good call.

183
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,319
You always think of others, Emma.

184
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,321
It never occurs to me like that.

185
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,323
I mean, sometimes it does.

186
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,458
I'm really happy for you.

187
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,192
Promise me you won't tell anyone
until after he proposes.

188
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,099
Oh, God. I would never.
I'd be out of my mind.

189
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,369
I'm engaged!

190
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,838
- Can we get four tequila shots?
- No. No.

191
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,314
No, no, no. None for me.

192
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,317
- Oh, right.
- I'm fine.

193
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,821
Acapulco, 2006...
Emma and Fletcher on a break.

194
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,879
"Never talk about that weekend again."

195
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,417
"I'm so lonely and confused,
and very thirsty. Please, Miguel"...

196
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,690
Okay, okay, okay.
Make it stop. Please.

197
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,755
<i>All right, a toast.</i>

198
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,597
To Liv...
Congratulations to an amazing friend.

199
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,399
And condolences to Emma,
Liv's maid of honor.

200
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,202
She will surely be
the most nightmarish bride ever.

201
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,208
It is my burden and mine alone.

202
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,109
- I'll be repaying the favor
very soon. Cheers. - Drink up.

203
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,013
- What did I rush down here for?
- Nate! I'm getting married.

204
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,744
- Get out.
- Yeah.

205
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,752
Oh, my God. Sister's gettin' married here.

206
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,551
<i>- Where's...Where's the groom?
- Oh. Oh. He's not here.</i>

207
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,252
Well, he hasn't actually
popped the question yet.

208
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,956
A toast...To Daniel...

209
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,590
<i>...who in his own world
is just working late...</i>

210
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,600
...but I guess in Liv's world
has just proposed.

211
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,602
So God bless him for wanting...

212
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,036
...to spend his life
with my sister in any world.

213
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,665
- To Liv.
- We love ya.

214
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,109
<i>- He's a lucky guy.
- Yep. The biggest day of a girl's life.</i>

215
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,413
I'm gonna be right back.

216
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,452
- Damn. Should I?
- I got it.

217
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,778
I mean, they didn't get
to see me graduate law school...

218
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,213
<i>...or read Nate's first story
in New York magazine.</i>

219
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,982
So I can't share this with 'em.

220
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,251
I wish your parents
could be here too.

221
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,094
Whatever. It's fine. I'm fine.

222
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,098
Liv, you're only human.

223
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,863
You don't have to have it together
every minute of every day.

224
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,600
Former chubby girls...
We're made of steel.

225
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,734
And Splenda. We survive.

226
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,835
Well, first of all, you weren't fat.

227
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,846
But, yes, you do survive.

228
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,950
- Thanks, Em.
- You're welcome, Liv.

229
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,350
You're gonna be
the best maid of honor.

230
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,480
- Yes, I am.
- What do we do first?

231
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,490
First... Oh! I was thinking.

232
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,890
It might be a good idea
to actually get the proposal.

233
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,895
See? It's that head for details.

234
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,863
Yeah, right? I know.

235
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,090
<i>...people watching
this performance at home...</i>

236
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,294
<i>...with a huge question mark.</i>

237
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,167
Hey, babe? I don't think
they sent us any fortune cookies.

238
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,969
<i>No, they sent 'em.
I got them right here.</i>

239
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,305
Oh, good.

240
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,141
Okay. Here we are.

241
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,315
- I'm just cuing it up.
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,613
- This guy's gotta go. I'm sorry.
I know you like him. - Mm-hmm.

243
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,153
- He's very pitchy. - You know,
Fletch, that is actually a real thing.

244
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,246
Pitchy. It's not just code
for someone you don't like.

245
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,257
Oh, okay. You're pitchy.

246
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,725
Oh, uh, that one's mine.

247
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,320
- Please. - You're really calling
dibs on fortune cookies now?

248
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,422
- Yeah. It's on the right side.
- Okay, it's fine.

249
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,865
- Yours is the left. - If your fortune's
better than mine, I'm claiming it.

250
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,698
- I don't think it will be.
- Okay. Are you ready?

251
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,601
- One...
- Two.

252
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,037
Three.

253
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,118
What's this?

254
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,417
I put a lot of thought
into where I was gonna do this...

255
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,548
...and, uh, I wanna do it here.

256
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,558
This is our home...

257
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:52,563
...and if I'm 99 years old and we're
doing exactly this in our home...

258
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,532
TV and gettin' Chinese food...

259
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,399
...that'll be good enough for me.

260
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,868
So, Emma Allan?

261
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,876
- Uh-huh?
- Will you marry me?

262
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,037
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

263
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:12,213
It didn't happen tonight.

264
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,253
- But I'm not worried, 'cause I'm sure
Daniel's... - I'm engaged.

265
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:20,315
Fletcher just proposed,
like, two minutes ago.

266
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,326
I'm engaged.

267
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,793
- Color?
- Colorless.

268
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,592
- Cut?
- Brilliant.

269
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,564
- Clarity?
- Slightly included.

270
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,794
- Carat?
- Almost, maybe just under.

271
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,167
More than he could afford, I'm sure.

272
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,105
Ohhh.

273
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,610
<i>Engaged? Wow!</i>

274
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,111
Liv's engaged. You're engaged.

275
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,240
That's...That's...

276
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,149
C- Can I call you back?

277
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,022
What do you mean
Emma's engaged?

278
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,686
No. Of course I'm happy.
Why wouldn't I be happy?

279
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,752
I think it's great. Yeah.

280
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,061
No, you don't have to come here.
I'm fine. I'm not gonna eat anything. Okay.

281
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,226
And I have the perfect
wedding present.

282
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,599
You are going to live
with Emma and Fletcher.

283
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,814
You're irritating me.

284
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,847
I can't believe it.

285
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,149
It's so weird having this on my finger.
I mean, hey, look.

286
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,190
- It even sparkles in the rain.
- Blinding. Ouch.

287
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,691
So I'm thinking about getting
DJ Humble to spin at my party.

288
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,194
- I don't know though. Is that weird?
- You should go for it.

289
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,196
- I'm not really a big band kind of girl.
- Whatever.

290
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,789
- It's your wedding.
- Oh. My mom can't fly up until the wedding.

291
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,495
She's too busy with work.
But who cares. I've got you, right?

292
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,562
- Yeah. I'm so psyched.
- So would you come with me to meet her?

293
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,902
- I'm sorry. What? Meet who?
- Marion St. Claire.

294
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,412
Haven't you been listening?
I've got an appointment with her on Friday.

295
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,414
- You already made an appointment?
- Yeah.

296
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,746
- You just got engaged last night.
- I know.

297
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,752
But technically, I'm already behind.

298
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,811
You gotta book early
if you want the Plaza.

299
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,881
The Plaza? I can't believe this.

300
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,189
What...What's the matter?
Why are you mad?

301
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,286
I'm not mad. No, not at you.

302
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,331
I just don't know
what's taking Daniel so long.

303
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,833
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have...

304
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,234
We don't have to talk about this.
Let's just drop it.

305
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,272
Don't worry about me.
Worry about Daniel.

306
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,274
- He's gonna be dead soon.
- Why? What...

307
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,276
- Call you later.
- What are you go...

308
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,370
Liv, you let him
do this his own way.

309
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,616
Excuse me. Excuse me.

310
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,675
Excuse me!

311
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,356
Honey!

312
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,358
Will you just marry me, already?

313
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,418
Yeah. Okay.

314
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,564
Isn't that what you want?
'Cause it's what I want...

315
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,600
...and I just wanna know
if you want to marry me.

316
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,603
- Don't you wanna get married?
- Honey, can we talk about this later?

317
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,697
Oh, you changed your mind?
I saw the Tiffany box in the closet.

318
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,107
Right?

319
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,838
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.

320
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,152
It's not a ring?

321
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,212
If it's a key chain
I'm gonna kill myself...

322
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,985
- And I'm taking you down with me.
- Oh.

323
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,289
Could you just tell me
right here and right now?

324
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,625
Is it something that you would want?

325
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,631
Would you want...
Would you want to get married?

326
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,633
You know what I will tell you?

327
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,137
I have never met a more obnoxious...

328
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,765
<i>...complicated, overbearing...</i>

329
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,436
...gorgeous, smart, sexy woman in my life.

330
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,878
And...

331
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,074
...if you had just waited until tonight...

332
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,279
- Then you wouldn't be the woman
I fell in love with...

333
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,289
...because she doesn't know
how to wait.

334
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,188
- Will you hold that for a second?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,990
Which is fine, as long as I get
to spend the rest of my life...

336
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,861
...trying to catch up with her.

337
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,423
- Liv?
- Hmm?

338
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,696
Will you marry me?

339
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,139
- Are you proposing?
- Mmm.

340
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,540
Really? Honey, it's so out of nowhere.

341
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,875
- Liv, shut up. Yes or no?
- Yes. Yes.

342
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,347
- Babe.
- Yes.

343
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,884
<i>- This is not how I planned it.
- Are you kidding?</i>

344
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,853
Oh!

345
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:14,120
- I love " Bring Your Hot
Girlfriend to Work" day.  - Totally.

346
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,295
<i>And that is the journey that brought...</i>

347
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,857
<i>...these two young brides to my townhouse
on that particular afternoon.</i>

348
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,166
- No, no, no. Don't do that.
Not now. Not now. Let's go.

349
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,172
Okay. I'm good.

350
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,174
<i>I'm Marion St. Claire...</i>

351
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,405
<i>...the most sought-after
wedding planner in Manhattan.</i>

352
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,522
- Hi. We're Marion's 1:00.
- Mm-hmm.

353
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,321
We're both getting married,
and we're both each other's maid of honor.

354
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,590
No way. That's incredible.

355
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,802
Ms. St. Claire will see you now.

356
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,330
- Hi. I'm Liv Lerner.
- Hi, Ms. St. Claire. Wow.

357
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,897
- This is Emma Allan.
- What an honor.

358
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,841
- We've been best friends for a long time.
- I can't believe this.

359
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,775
Sit.

360
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,836
- Okay.
- Got it.

361
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,018
A wedding marks the first day...

362
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,081
...of the rest of your life.

363
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,889
You have been dead until now.

364
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,521
<i>W- Were you aware of that?</i>

365
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,758
You're dead right now.

366
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,130
- I understand.
- Thank you.

367
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,864
Angela, for example, will die dead.

368
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,305
<i>Now I've read the brief
that she put together on you...</i>

369
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,641
June weddings at the Plaza.

370
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,909
So it's not even a remote possibility?

371
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,510
If you'd gone elsewhere, not a chance.

372
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,522
But you've come to me.

373
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,058
Call me dream catcher. I'll answer.

374
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,424
Ooh. Dream catcher.

375
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,263
I happen to have...

376
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,632
<i>...three openings at the Plaza in June.</i>

377
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,368
Two the first Saturday...

378
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,840
...and one the last Saturday.

379
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,070
That would be the 6th and the 27 th.

380
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,773
Oh! My parents' anniversary
is the 6th. That's so meant to be.

381
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,781
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.

382
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,147
- Well, then I'll take the 27 th.
- Great.

383
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,915
Um, you'll wanna discuss this
with your grooms.

384
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,013
- No.
- All right then.

385
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,320
Just sign and...

386
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,451
...date these.

387
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,655
- Okay.  - This feels pretty
good right now, I gotta say.

388
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,699
Now, uh, we should discuss themes.

389
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,757
- Uh, elegant minimalism...
- Classic traditionalism...

390
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,101
- with romantic textures.
- And trendy infusion.

391
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,471
- I'm impressed.
- Really?

392
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,773
- Well, we love you so much.
- She means... She means " Thank you."

393
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,279
Your 1:15 is here, Ms. St. Claire.

394
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,146
Thank you... So much.

395
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,675
<i>I have packets for you up front.</i>

396
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,222
Bride to bride, there's only
oneJune opening left at the Plaza.

397
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,623
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You are so sweet.

398
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,890
Ms. St. Claire, first off,
I'm obsessed with you.

399
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,897
- Uh, it's an honor and a privilege.
- Sit.

400
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,227
Sure.

401
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,434
June. At the Plaza.

402
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,342
<i>Look at them...So blissfully unaware...</i>

403
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,748
<i>...of the implications
of their wedding date.</i>

404
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:31,619
<i>You see, at this point, June was
a mere three and a half months away...</i>

405
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,158
<i>A blink of an eye, in wedding time.</i>

406
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,660
<i>Got my dreams, got my life, got my love...</i>

407
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,253
<i>Got my friends
Got the sunshine above...</i>

408
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,595
<i>Why am I making this
hard on myself...</i>

409
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,397
<i>When there's so many
beautiful reasons I have to be...</i>

410
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,438
<i>Happy...</i>

411
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,041
<i>Yeah...</i>

412
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:04,518
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

413
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,523
Miss Wang...

414
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,752
Ohh... Lace bodice.

415
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,263
Basque waist, 10-layer tulle...

416
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,356
You should try it on.

417
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,731
No. No, no. I'm wearing my mom's dress.

418
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,736
Emma, are you sure?

419
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,932
Your mom's dress is beautiful,
but is... is it your dream or hers?

420
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,407
It's mine. It's mine.
I wanna surprise her.

421
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,410
But it is your day.

422
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,276
Can't you just send her a big box
of chocolates on Mother's Day...

423
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,748
- And get the dress you want?
- It's really pretty.

424
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,877
- And I do love strapless.
- Me too.

425
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,820
I feel like I'm cheating
on my mom's dress.

426
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,551
I can't. I can't. I've very comfortable
with my decision.

427
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,389
- I'm just gonna put it back. Put it back.
- Okay.

428
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,329
<i>But I mean, if you like it...</i>

429
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,265
- You should try it on.
- No. You saw it first.

430
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,098
- Please. - That's a terrible reason.
We're gonna try this on, okay?

431
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,434
No, uh, I'm gonna... Try it on.

432
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,103
It's stunning. It's perfect.

433
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,171
- I know. Right?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,183
I should probably keep looking.

435
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,345
Do you think there is something
better than Vera Wang?

436
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,686
I'm sorry. Do they keep that next to
the something that is better than chocolate?

437
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,091
- Liv, get the dress.
- What if you change your mind?

438
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,356
Just be very careful about
any pre-wedding weight gain.

439
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,763
You don't alter a Vera to fit you;
you alter yourself to fit Vera.

440
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,826
Weight gain. Please.
Yeah. Right. Me lose control?

441
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,233
You see these eyes?
You know what that is?

442
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,605
Focus. That's right.

443
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,042
Well, it's contacts... And focus.

444
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,008
- You know, I'll take it.
- Perfect.

445
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,983
I'll get you more champagne.

446
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,117
Marion.

447
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,296
A terrible mistake has been made...

448
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,265
...one I assure you
has never happened before...

449
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,791
...in the House of St. Claire.

450
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,397
Your weddings have been
booked on the same day.

451
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,409
<i>Can you say that again?
I'm sorry. What?</i>

452
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,344
Your weddings
have been scheduled for the same date.

453
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,644
- Mother " F."
- Are you insane?

454
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,150
The Plaza is our lifelong dream.

455
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,188
Angela... Mixed up the dates.

456
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,349
You are now both set
to be married June 6...

457
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,359
...and the other bride on June 27.

458
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,828
<i>The next available date
at the Plaza is June 15...</i>

459
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,866
- Perfect. I'll take it.
- Three years from now.

460
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,367
- This is no...
- No, I can't...

461
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,600
It's no problem.
Hold on. It's no problem.

462
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,577
Because I'll negotiate it.
I negotiate for a living.

463
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,478
- I'll get the other bride to switch
her dates with you.  - Trust me.

464
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,846
You can't say no to that face.

465
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,284
<i>Yes, well, our confidentiality agreement...</i>

466
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,288
...means that I cannot
tell you who she is...

467
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:56,191
<i>...so which one of you
will choose a different venue?</i>

468
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,230
<i>I'm leaving right now, Ms. St. Claire.</i>

469
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,528
Word to the wise, dear...
and also to you...

470
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,626
...do not use me as a reference.

471
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,879
- Hello, Angela.
- Just...

472
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,746
...tell us where the other bride is...

473
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,082
...and nobody's gonna get hurt.

474
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,793
- Hi.
- Hello, Stacy.

475
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,028
- How are you?
- It's Emma and Liv.

476
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,900
- You look gorgeous.
- Did you lose weight?

477
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,905
You want me to change
the date of my wedding?

478
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,907
<i>- Yeah.
- That'd be great.</i>

479
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,570
- No.
- You take the 6th, give me the 27 th...

480
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,580
She can be your wedding buddy.

481
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,116
- I'm a ball. Really. I am.
- Don't touch me.

482
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,777
Let's talk numbers.

483
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,253
Every wedding has a price, hon.
What's yours?

484
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,018
You can't buy me. So again, no.

485
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,458
No, no, no. A thousand times, no.

486
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,462
Good luck, ladies.

487
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,968
There's something wrong with you.

488
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,630
You're not leaving
until you change your...

489
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,368
<i>She's crazyI</i>

490
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:21,572
- Just change your date.
- She's crazy! Somebody call Security.

491
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,275
- You won't even change your date!
- You're crazy!

492
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,183
- It's unnecessary for you to touch me so hard.
- Technically, she pushed me too.

493
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,519
- Come on. Have a nice day.
- Whatever.

494
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,424
We could sue. We could sue.
You're a lawyer. We could sue 'em all.

495
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,927
We could sue the Plaza. We could sue Marion.
We could sue Angela...

496
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,260
What's the point?
None of them are gonna make it right.

497
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,562
No. It's up to us.
I want you at my wedding.

498
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,932
And whichever way this works out...

499
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,437
...one of us will just have
to be married on a different day.

500
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,440
<i>Absolutely. I mean, you know,
I want you at my wedding.</i>

501
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,171
Obviously. If we can't
think of any other way out of this...

502
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,179
...one of us will simply
have to be flexible.

503
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,715
Yeah. One of us will just
have to change venues.

504
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,919
Right. One of us could.

505
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,319
<i>Probably, um, not...</i>

506
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,619
...the one of us who's been
saving up for a decade...

507
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,592
...because she makes a pittance
compared to the other one of us, but...

508
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,095
True. I mean, or it would be...

509
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:15,189
...if the other one of us wasn't
so desperate to get married at the Plaza...

510
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,895
...because the Plaza, practically, is the only
happy memory she has of her childhood.

511
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,997
- So, oops. That's...
- Right.

512
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,599
- One of us will have to move her date.
- Yep.

513
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,578
One of us will.

514
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,081
And until one of us decides, we shouldn't
make any concrete plans.

515
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,413
Agreed. There's some time
before we lock things in.

516
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,749
- Let's just not do anything...
- Right.

517
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,015
- Until one of us moves her date.
- Okay.

518
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,182
So, um...

519
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,559
Talk to you soon.
One of us should...

520
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,893
Call the other one.

521
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,763
<i>One of us hasn't called me yet,
but you know what?</i>

522
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,803
She's gonna move her date. She always was
the bendy one, even as a kid, remember?

523
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,805
Yeah, she didn't sound
too bendy to me.

524
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:58,639
Explosions, Beeps ]

525
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,044
I called Fletch, and she picked up.

526
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,048
<i>He's doin'my taxes tomorrow night.</i>

527
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,084
You can't get all buddy-buddy
with him. Not now.

528
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,915
Anyway, Daniel can do your taxes.
He's " financey."

529
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,889
It's a hedge fund, babe.
We don't do a lot of tax prep.

530
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,290
- Whatever. You do our taxes.  - Fletch has
been my accountant for six years. I'm going.

531
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,330
<i>You're being ridiculous.
Just have a double wedding.</i>

532
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,592
What are we, 41-year-old twin sisters?

533
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,430
Babe! Double wedding.

534
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,994
<i>A double wedding.
I think that's a great idea.</i>

535
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,565
- It would be a hell of a party.
- You know, uh, no.

536
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,635
I've shared everything
my whole life with Liv.

537
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,977
<i>I'd kinda like my own day just...just once.</i>

538
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,380
I know, bug. Is this everything?
This is all your gas receipts...

539
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,646
Threw it all in the shoe box.
I don't know.

540
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,086
<i>It's my dream too...
To get married at the Plaza.</i>

541
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,953
I have been saving since I was 16.

542
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,017
<i>I just need a few more days
to... Let it go.</i>

543
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,929
I'll find a new dream.
Liv's reasons are better than mine.

544
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,489
<i>It's like American Idol, all right?</i>

545
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,798
Liv is the Simon. Ugh. God.

546
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,304
I mean, no offense.
But you're the Paula.

547
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,432
<i>Even when they can't sing,
you compliment their outfit.</i>

548
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,603
<i>- It's nice.
- Well, but everyone listens to Simon.</i>

549
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,978
I wouldn't marry Simon.
I'd marry me some Paula.

550
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,348
Mmm.

551
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,083
- That's nice.
- Just pick one. I'm fine with any of'em.

552
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,591
See? That's why I need a maid of honor.
You don't care.

553
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,627
I... Hey, you wanna have her
back in the game?

554
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,925
You know what you're gonna have to do,
and the sooner the better.

555
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,931
- We need to give our guests some notice.
- Exactly.

556
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,162
<i>- Which is why save-the-dates
are so key, but you don't care.</i>

557
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,534
- It's not that I don't care.
- Well, get your phone then.

558
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,802
- Hello?
- Men.

559
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,743
Yo, Fletch. No, nothin' much.
Just lookin' at save-the-dates or invites.

560
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,803
- Are we still on for tomorrow?
- Yeah, totally.

561
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,408
Any sign of progress on your end?
Is Liv softening at all?

562
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,816
No way. And there's no way
she's gonna blink first.

563
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,821
<i>They haven't spoken for a week.</i>

564
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,880
That's a century in girl years.

565
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,892
What is it about weddings
that makes 'em so worked up?

566
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,087
I know. I have no idea.

567
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,996
It's, like, the wrong time to let
the guy know that you're crazy.

568
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,533
- You know what I mean?
It's not how I'd play it.  - Yeah.

569
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,592
<i>Oh, you know what? She's here now.</i>

570
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,604
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- All right.

571
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,606
<i>Hey.</i>

572
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,608
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

573
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,110
- How was pep squad?
- I hate pep squad.

574
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,977
I particularly hate
peppy teenage girls...

575
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,506
...who insist everyone be aggressive...
B.E. Aggressive.

576
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,713
It's, like, there are other pathways in life
besides aggression, you know?

577
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,686
I'm gonna call Liv.

578
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,425
Amie and Marissa are
throwing us that joint shower...

580
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,731
...and it'd be good to have all this
behind us by then. Right?

581
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,737
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

582
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,070
<i>Yeah. I agree. I was just talkin'
to Daniel. She's on her cell.</i>

583
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,134
You should call her. They're out
doin' their save-the-dates or whatever.

584
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,477
- What?
- You should hit her up.

585
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,309
You have to know your " date" date...

586
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,551
...to send out your save-the-dates.

587
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,651
Oh.

588
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,720
We were both gonna wait, and she... She...

589
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,823
I ca... I can't believe it.

590
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,562
You can't believe this?
Really? It's Liv.

591
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,127
<i>- She's always thinking about number one.
- No.</i>

592
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,765
Not this time. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

593
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,173
I am a bride too. Okay?

594
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,476
<i>I'm number one too.</i>

595
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,143
I...You are my number one.
I know. That's how I feel.

596
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,279
Bug, what are you doing?

597
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,257
<i>- Subject...
- Listen. Listen. No, no, no, no, no.</i>

598
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,590
Emergency. This is not spam.

599
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,496
<i>- I'm getting married, June 6...
- You don't have to slam on the keys.</i>

600
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:46,333
The Plaza Hotel. Be there.
X- O-X-O-X-O-X-O. Emma.

00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,430
Address book. B.C.C. Everyone.

602
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,441
<i>Oops. Not you, Liv.</i>

603
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,477
<i>And send.</i>

604
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,652
"Emergen-C-C-C.
'Thys' is 'nit' spam.

605
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:08,124
I'm get married.June 6th."

606
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,754
" K.J.A."? " Kuh-jaw"?

607
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,264
" Emma."

608
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,631
What is " kuh-jaw," Emma?

609
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,102
Great. Emma's wedding's
gonna be better than ours was.

610
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,472
Glen.

611
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,569
Maybe her marriage
will be better too.

612
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,605
<i>Not filled with loneliness and sadness.</i>

613
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,684
I hope you can appreciate
the positions Amie and I are in.

614
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,187
- We're not taking sides.
- Relax.

615
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:42,056
- We're not making any plans
until we figure this out.  - Wow.

616
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,026
- You're so cool about it.
- Yeah.

617
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,088
- How else am I gonna be?  - I mean...
Without taking sides though, I have to say...

618
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,657
Emma's save-the-date e-mail
was a smidge tacky.

619
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,203
I mean, "June 6 at the Plaza," smiley face?

620
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,933
What's next, hearts over her i's?

621
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,441
<i>- Come on, really... What was she thinking?
- Oh, hey.</i>

622
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,637
- I know, right?
- That was so tacky.

623
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,874
<i>- It's shocking.
- Hi. Hi, Heidi.</i>

624
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:13,552
<i>- Oh, Elizabeth, I love my ring.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

625
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,558
<i>Emma?</i>

626
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,757
You sent out your save-the-dates?

627
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,859
Yeah, I did, actually.

628
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,394
Uh...

629
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,100
Surprised?

630
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,843
So one of us...

631
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,277
...is not moving her date?

632
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:43,879
Well, you amaze me, Liv. You really do.

633
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:48,449
You-You never ask me what I want.
You just figure you know best, end of story.

634
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,460
"Emma, wear this.
Emma, say that."

635
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,462
Well, Emma's pretty
frickin' tired of it.

636
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,498
- Oh, whoa.  - Don't think I didn't
notice how totally freaked out...

637
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,159
<i>- You were because I had the nerve
to get engaged before you did.  - Okay, wait.</i>

638
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,294
First of all, Daniel
bought that ring in December.

639
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,897
Okay? So officially, I was first.

640
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:07,308
<i>- Oh, pathetic. Pathetic! - Second, people
always make you do things you don't wanna do.</i>

641
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,939
Emma, it's like you don't have a spine.
Oh, wait. That's right.

642
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,279
<i>You don't have a spine.</i>

643
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,842
<i>Wow.</i>

644
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,945
No one could accuse you
of being soft, Liv.

645
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,014
<i>You grabbed the first date
in June Marion offered...</i>

646
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,583
...without even asking me first.

647
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,925
At least I'm not so terrified
of being alone...

648
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,363
...that I people-please
my way through life.

649
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,968
Emma, you settle.

650
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,937
Are you saying that
I'm settling with Fletcher?

651
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,974
I wasn't thinking about Fletcher.

652
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,339
You came up with that one on your own.

653
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,536
Ooh.

654
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,140
Move your date, Liv.

655
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,947
You move your date, Emma.

656
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,354
It's done. You lose.

657
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,521
Your wedding better watch it.

658
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,198
What did you just say?

659
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,729
I said your wedding
should be very scared right now.

660
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,743
If I were your wedding,
I'd sleep with one eye open.

661
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,407
Why don't you just
save your threats for Daniel?

662
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,418
After all, isn't that how
you got a proposal out of him?

663
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,886
- That's how I did it.
- Your wedding can suck it.

664
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,083
What did you just say?
My wedding can suck it?

665
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,388
- I said your wedding can suck it.
- Your wedding can s... Be...

666
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,725
I mean, yours can be, um...

667
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,095
Can-Can be, uh...

668
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,430
...not that...

669
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,436
Please.

670
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,870
- Bye, ladies.
- Hey, Liv.

671
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,568
Yes.

672
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,736
Your wedding will be huge.

673
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,373
Just like your ass at prom.

674
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,414
We're done.

675
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,325
5:00, Saturday, June 6. Done.

676
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,532
- Done. -
Hmm. - Good.

677
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,867
Now we just have to find you
another maid of honor, uh, and fast.

678
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,203
You'll be spending more time
with her than with the groom.

679
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,244
- My friends won't take sides.
- Who says it has to be a friend?

680
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,609
<i>- No! No! Not just a bridesmaid.
- This spot okay?</i>

681
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,411
Yeah. Maid of honor. Maid of honor.

682
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,611
Yeah. We were so close in law school.

683
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,620
That study group was nuts.

684
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,680
Oh, sweetie, you are
my second cousin's best friend.

685
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,591
Of course you were at the very top
of my maid of honor list.

686
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:40,153
Honestly, Carla. Caitlin?

687
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,496
Erin, no. I did not sleep with him.

688
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,337
All right, okay. I did, actually.

689
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,636
Once. Twice.

690
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,644
What difference does it make?
He was a loser, and he was lousy in...

691
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,447
You did? Really?
I didn't hear that...

692
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,512
Two kids? Wow. You guys
must have had really cute kids.

693
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,581
Uh, yeah. Tell him I say hi, and...

694
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,889
Actually, I'm hopping into a cab,
so I'm gonna give you a call a little later.

695
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,501
- Kevin?
- Yeah?

696
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,840
<i>I'd like to promote you...</i>

697
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,968
...to mister of honor.

698
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,481
Do I get... Is...
Is it, like, a pay thing?

699
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,712
No.Just... It's just an honor.

700
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,721
<i>Uh, have a classmate read your draft.
I think that's a great idea.</i>

701
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,451
<i>Because by letting a classmate
read your draft...</i>

702
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,790
Oh, thank God. All right.
You guys finish the rest of this.

703
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,796
Just read it yourselves.

704
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,166
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah.

705
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,169
Can you take my late bus patrol today?

706
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,501
Sure.

707
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,269
- Deb?
- Yeah?

708
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,368
Yeah?

709
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,414
- I know we're not exactly friends...
- We're not?

710
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,451
- Then why am I always doing you favors?
- You never do me...

711
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,918
Never mind.

712
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,348
How'd you like to be my maid of honor?

713
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,358
Do I get to pick out my own dress?

714
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,485
I tend to draw the eye,
so it's gotta be good.

715
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,495
Absolutely.

716
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,997
I mean, you know, I might
make some suggestions, but...

717
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,661
Oh, you know, I'm really swamped though.
I'd need a lot of help.

718
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,670
What do you think the bride is for?

719
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,763
To make the maid of honor's
life easier, right?

720
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,365
I mean, come on. Please.

721
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,901
Aw. All right. Since you begged...

722
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,210
- Okay.
- I'll be your maid of honor.

723
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,614
It's gonna be great.

724
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,880
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

725
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,288
Whew.

726
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,022
<i>Hey, can I make a suggestion?</i>

727
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,759
Have you ever heard
of" pee-not gree-gio"?

728
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,892
<i>It's this really nice white wine.</i>

729
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,528
It's very elegant.

730
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,538
Mmm.

731
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,540
- Now, your music is...
- Yes.

732
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,705
...still pending, and, sadly, D.J. Humble
is no longer available on that date.

733
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,978
Oh? But he and I had a deal... in principle.

734
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,985
Yes, well, one of
my other brides outbid you.

735
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,715
<i>I can't give you
her name, of course.</i>

736
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,257
That bitch!

737
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,725
Not you. No, a different one.

738
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,319
A person.

739
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,428
God, she's scary.

740
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,403
- You don't think that Liv...
- Yeah, I do.

741
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,497
No. No. She knew
how much that meant to me.

742
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,771
- It's too cruel. It's too mean-spirited.
- Too in character?

743
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,279
Hang on. Wait.

744
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,180
Didn't you tell me
she's wearing a Vera Wang?

745
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,651
- Yes.
- I read those run really tight...

746
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,280
...and she's kind of an ex-heifer.

747
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,586
No. No, she's...

748
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,785
She's... Little bit.

749
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,927
Mmm. Oh!

750
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,368
That is good. Excellent.

751
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,804
<i>Is that like cream cheese?
It is cream cheese.</i>

752
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,808
Like a hint.

753
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,277
- Has Emma chosen her cake yet?
- Let's keep to our own work, shall we?

754
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,315
Now, as for the flowers,
Eufloria has put in a bid.

755
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,783
We just can't have the same cake, that's all.
And I have to have the seven-tiered...

756
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:27,813
...white chocolate-curl torte, enrobed
in marzipan with edible pearls and flourishes.

757
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,826
Well, you're safe.

758
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,522
Emma has chosen
a less extravagant cake.

759
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,928
And she's always saying
that she doesn't need...

760
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,160
...to impress people
with how much she can spend.

761
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:41,466
- I'm just going to check
my ice sculptor Rolodex.  - Right.

762
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,735
Oh, my God.

763
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,868
That was a dig at me.

764
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,042
Emma thinks I'm showing off?

765
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,948
I never thought she resented how much
money I made, but I guess I was wrong.

766
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,012
Really? I didn't get that
from what she...

767
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,284
Marion's eating it up.

768
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,588
She likes Emma best.

769
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:07,028
Emma always gets the sympathy vote.
I never get the sympathy vote, do I?

770
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,327
Well, maybe it's asking
a little bit too much of people...

771
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,530
I was worried about her cake. It could be
two Ding-Dongs and a Yodel for all I care.

772
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,110
What's that? What's that?

773
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,443
Don't...

774
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,857
<i>Dance lessons?</i>

775
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:37,724
Damn, she's competitive. Their dance
is totally gonna be better than ours.

776
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,629
Let me see Canary Song again.
Dandelion. Canary.

777
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,862
- Isn't there something in between?
- Sort of like a burnt Canary.

778
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,927
Video montage of their lives? Really?

779
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,597
<i>- It's gotta be Fletcher's idea.
- That's just...</i>

780
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,971
It's gonna be, like,
pictures of them as babies.

781
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,976
You know, Emma with one tooth...

782
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,638
...and Fletcher in his little
superhero outfits. It's tacky.

783
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,773
<i>Can I help you?</i>

784
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,579
- Yeah. Delivery for Liv Lerner.
- That's chocolate.

785
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,620
I'll take that.

786
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,679
Mmm. Looks good.

787
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,419
"Liv, you deserve this and more."

788
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,427
Isn't Daniel the sweetest?

789
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,156
- I'll just have one.
- Thanks.

790
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,289
Just one.

791
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,360
<i>- W-Was she up there?
- Yeah.</i>

792
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,804
- Oh. And it's impossible to go get
them back?  - No, no, no, no.

793
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,502
She ate half the box already, lady.
Forty-five dollars.

794
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,568
Yes. Okay.

795
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,274
That is the agreed upon...

796
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,282
But just so you know...

797
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,286
...if you heard what was actually
going on, you would totally side with me.

798
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,084
- You gonna tip me?
- I thought that was including tip...

799
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,593
...but anyway, I'll give it to you
because I'm the Paula.

800
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,529
You know, I've been thinking.

801
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,464
- If you really want to mess with
Emma's first dance... - Mm-hmm?

802
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,831
- There are ways.
- Tell me more.

803
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,130
I don't know, baby. Dance class?

804
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,800
Come on. We know how to dance.

805
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,140
It's a slow dance.
It's like we did in college.

806
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:05,079
It's a waltz. It's a little more precise
than just holding each other up.

807
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,481
And besides, Marion says
that our first dance...

808
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,918
- introduces our couple style to the world.
- Oh, well, naturally...

809
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,889
<i>I'm incredibly
concerned with our couple style.</i>

810
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,483
<i>SpaceI</i>

811
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,023
I am Ricky Coo...

812
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,897
...the Doctor of Dance.

813
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,733
I bring you motion.
I bring you rhythm.

814
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,672
<i>I bring you sex.</i>

815
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,835
<i>Please, get on your feet,
and let's danceI</i>

816
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,573
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

817
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:48,348
<i>Dance...</i>

818
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:59,064
Maybe Marion shouldn't be recommending
Ricky Coo, Doctor of Dance so much.

819
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,070
Yeah. I don't know about Ricky.

820
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,369
<i>Good for you. Doing warm-ups.</i>

821
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:09,071
Yeah, I got your voice mail saying you wanted
to push the lesson from 1:00 to 4:00.

822
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,841
How long have you been here?

823
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,409
Oh, my God.

824
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,784
- What?
- Liv.

825
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,690
<i>- Uh, just give us a second.
- I mean, who does that?</i>

826
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:28,198
She's finally gone completely crazy.
Not that I'm surprised at all.

827
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:32,133
- I mean, she's always been nuts.
- I know. And messing with our couple style?

828
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,035
- There is no way I'm letting
her get away with that.  - Good.

829
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,506
You know who I feel sorry for is Daniel.

830
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:42,477
He's not even gonna
be able to control his own wife.

831
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,709
What?

832
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,911
- No, I'm just saying... It's Liv.
Because she never thinks about...  - And?

833
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,181
- I'm going inside.
- What?

834
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,055
<i>The final month before the
big day is a litmus test for couples...</i>

835
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:59,562
<i>...ofhow they work together,
solve problems, communicate.</i>

836
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,330
<i>The early, happy glow is over,
and the nerves begin to set in.</i>

837
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:10,465
<i>With some couples, it brings out the
fundamental conflicts in their relationship.</i>

838
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,806
<i>With other couples, the lucky ones...</i>

839
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,711
<i>...it highlights the essential harmony
of their partnership.</i>

840
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:21,808
<i>Of course, even the luckiest bride
needs something to take the edge off.</i>

841
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,919
Ooh, for me! AJolly Walrus cookie bouquet.
Is Daniel a keeper or what?

842
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,719
I'd just be careful.
Miss Wang is a stern mistress.

843
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:32,023
Video montage... If there's gonna be
live pictures and, like, video footage...

844
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,121
I know. It's, like, verging on
being a digital short.

845
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:38,032
I don't know how they're gonna cut
me out of the footage. I'm in everything.

846
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,468
Oh, this came for you via messenger.

847
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,630
I can't wait to get into this one.

848
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:46,540
Mr. Simmons called again asking
for the update on the agreement.

849
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,512
<i>- Rutherford Press? That's my hometown.
- I'm just gonna take this.</i>

850
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,708
Suppose I should just tell them
you're dealing with a crisis?

851
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,308
Oh, my God.

852
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,616
They still print
engagement announcements.

853
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,680
I'm sort of like a celebrity
back there, probably.

854
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:05,388
You know, it's like, local girl
makes good. Such sweet people.

855
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,657
- Oh, wow!
- What the?

856
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,495
<i>That's not you. Is it?</i>

857
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,127
Emma looks gorgeous.

858
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,569
- But not on the inside, which is...
- Kevin.

859
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,707
It's the best she can do, huh?

860
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,406
<i>- So lame. She wants to
play dirty? I can play dirty.</i>

861
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,141
<i>You can play dirty.
I've seen you do it.</i>

862
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,183
I went to law school, people.

863
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,185
I'm starting to think
that 30 is the cutoff.

864
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,519
- Mmm.  - Because it's the last time
men want to date women their age.

865
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,922
A 30-year-old guy will
date a 30-year-old girl.

866
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,927
But a 35-year-old guy
wants someone 30.

867
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,658
A 40-year-old guy
wants someone 30, too, or 28.

868
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,666
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a terrible planet.

869
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,931
I know. You know
what I was wondering?

870
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,472
What are the real reasons behind
Emma and Fletcher having to tie the knot?

871
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,203
Why can't they change their date?
Think about it.

872
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,714
She's pregnant! Emma's pregnant!

873
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,276
Oh, no.

874
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,915
- Oh, no!
- Liv?

875
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,017
<i>Are you all right?
What the hell is goin' on?</i>

876
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,028
<i>Look, let me inI</i>

877
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,894
I gained five pounds.
Five pounds. It might as well be 50!

878
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,900
The dress doesn't fit!
And if the dress doesn't fit...

879
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:22,996
...my wedding's gonna be a big
black hole in the history of the Plaza!

880
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,633
<i>Well, "A "it's our wedding, hon.</i>

881
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,870
And " B"... So what? Let it out.

882
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:31,574
You don't alter Vera Wang to fit you.

883
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,708
You alter yourself to fit Vera.

884
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,447
<i>- What do boys learn in school?
- Sorry.</i>

885
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,751
<i>It's not the end of the world.</i>

886
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:43,725
Really. What-What-What can I do
to make you feel better?

887
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,491
It's what you can stop doing.
This is all your fault.

888
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:51,933
- It's sweet of you to send me those
treats, but I...  - What treats?

889
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,765
You know, the treats.
The Truffle-opolis.

890
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,638
The truffle tray.

891
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,975
TheJolly Walrus cookie bouquet?

892
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,148
International Butter Club?

893
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,982
The... Honey...
I didn't send you any of that.

894
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,783
Oh, my God, Emma!

895
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,347
She's trying to make me fat
so I can't fit into my dress!

896
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,620
What is that? What is that?

897
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,101
The International Butter Club?

898
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,637
You mean, you've actually
been sitting around...

899
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,367
...eating sticks of butter
from different lands?

900
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:40,410
<i>The final week before
the wedding is do-or-die.</i>

901
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:44,079
<i>I expect my brides to be flawless.</i>

902
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,454
<i>Perfect hair, skin, nails, everything.</i>

903
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,926
Hello there.
I need to get to the back really fast.

904
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,395
Really, really fast, because
I left something there yesterday.

905
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,625
- It's very important that I...
- I so don't care.

906
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,192
Go on back.

907
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,941
<i>- Miss Allan.
- Oh, hi.</i>

908
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,035
Hi. Bit of Honey today?
That's the one I loaded.

909
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,570
Yes, but, uh, just a pre-wedding glow.

910
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,583
- Sure thing.
- Okay, thanks.

911
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,484
<i>I wish you well...</i>

912
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:21,718
<i>I hope you survive...</i>

913
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,727
<i>I hope you live on, baby...</i>

914
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,990
<i>So I can watch you cry...</i>

915
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,998
<i>'Cause I know
in time you'll see...</i>

916
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,694
<i>What you did to me...</i>

917
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,430
<i>And you'll come runnin'back...</i>

918
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:38,463
<i>I'm gonna rain
on your parade...</i>

919
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,841
<i>Oh, I won't take it again...</i>

920
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,609
<i>And I'll keep raining, raining, raining...</i>

921
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,480
<i>Over you...</i>

922
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,611
Wow!

923
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,783
<i>What happened to you?
You look like a traffic cone.</i>

924
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,258
<i>Will it fade?</i>

925
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,660
<i>Sort of.
This is three loofahs.</i>

926
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,690
Is it that bad? Fletch said
he didn't think it was that bad.

927
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,430
Oh, well, honey,
"Filch" is your fianc.

928
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,438
He probably told you
you had nice hair too.

929
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,676
<i>This wedding stuff
is not a walk in the park.</i>

930
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,678
<i>- For sure.
- I'm surprised. I don't know.</i>

931
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,977
I'm surprised I haven't been, you know,
sent into my therapist's office.

932
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,880
That's what I've heard. T-U-F-F.

933
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,885
You should have heard me
on the phone the other day...

934
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,114
- Talking to the guy who messed
up my centerpieces.  - Oh, gosh.

935
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,918
It was unbelievable. It's like one thing
after another, every single time.

936
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,585
- It snowballs.  - Listen, can I
get a little bit more lowlight?

937
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,527
Yeah, especially right here. Hold that
thought, sweetie. I'm gonna get your color.

938
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:37,226
Just make sure it's not so...
Like, more gold base.

939
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,292
<i>I'm gonna rain
on your parade...</i>

940
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,965
<i>No, I won't take it again...</i>

941
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:49,172
<i>And I'll keep raining, raining, raining
over you...</i>

942
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,915
<i>Maybe I should take up chanting.</i>

943
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,077
I think it's kind of... Might be
necessary at this time of my life.

944
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,759
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Is it good?

945
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,023
Great!

946
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,531
I get to do noth...

947
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,304
Okay. I-I don't know
what happened. Um...

948
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,170
I gotta let it sit for a day or two.

949
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,004
Maybe I'll try to strip it down to white.

950
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,511
My hair's blue!

951
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,743
It's blue! I have blue hair!

952
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,445
- I'm getting married in a week.
- Congratulations.

953
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,646
In a week! A week!

954
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,057
Come on. I know you're in here.

955
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,059
Ah, here's your video montage.

956
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,621
Oh, yeah.

957
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,598
Absolutely.

958
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,630
<i>Fletch?</i>

959
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,839
Bug? Do you have something
you need to tell me?

960
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,471
- Um...
- Are we about to have a little orange baby?

961
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,313
<i>Apparently we're registered
at Babies "R" Us.</i>

962
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:04,410
<i>Isn't that nice?</i>

963
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,946
Marissa. Where are you?
I can barely hear you.

964
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,052
I can't believe you told Emma.

965
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,187
Whatever.

966
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,164
You guys, don't get too
attached to the dancers.

967
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,360
They're paid to be nice to you.

968
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,598
<i>- Yeah!
- New York and Japan...</i>

969
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,764
Hello, bride!

970
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,072
<i>All right, all right.
Now a little birdie has just told me...</i>

971
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,238
...that we have a bride-to-be
in the house tonight.

972
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,750
<i>- Over here!
- But she has been a very bad bride.</i>

973
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,219
<i>Officer Not-Your-Husband
is here to arrest youI</i>

974
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,519
<i>I'm a model, You know what I mean...</i>

975
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:45,527
<i>- And I do my little turn on the catwalk
- You're under arrest...</i>

976
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:49,087
...for being too sexy.

977
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,396
Time to be frisked.

978
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,897
Oh, my goodness!

979
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,735
Great!

980
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:06,577
We got two brides
in the house tonight!

981
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,642
<i>Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Hold upI</i>

982
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,119
We have two brides
in the house tonight.

983
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,657
Emma, this party is invitation only.

984
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,989
I'm getting married too, baby!

985
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,120
<i>Well, I'll invite you right up there.</i>

986
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,655
<i>- DJ Jazzles invites bride number
two up on stage.  - Why not?</i>

987
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:27,169

<i>That's what I'm talking aboutI
Work it out, girlI</i>

989
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,804
You can't even let me
have my own bachelorette party?

990
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:37,438
Much the way you couldn't let me
have DJ Humble. That was low, Liv.

991
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:42,315
By the way, did you hear?
I'm not pregnant, okay?

992
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,910
I say it's time for a dance-off. Dance-off!

993
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:48,856
Dance-off! Dance-off!
Dance-off! Dance-off!

994
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,159
<i>You say I'm so crazy...</i>

995
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,264
<i>- Coming home intoxicated
- Oh! Oh!</i>

996
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,271
<i>- I say I just want to love you

00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,969
<i>- Aw, come on, Liv.

00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:10,501
<i>- I know y'all can do better than that.
- Give it to me, baby...</i>

1000
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,912
Sprockets!

00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:23,515
<i>Break it downI Now the sexiest bride

<i>They ain't used to this sound

1008
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,314
<i>All my ladies put your hands in the air

1014
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,733
<i>Why would you try...</i>

00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,167
<i>We got 'em shakin'everything

1016
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:12,504
<i>Bride number two, you are
the sexiest bride of the night, baby.</i>

<i>Give it up for bride number two, y'allI</i>

1018
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,207
<i>Sorry, bride number one.
Can't win 'em all, girl.</i>

1019
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:34,222
It's weird, losing.
I gotta say I'm not loving it.

1020
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,231
No, but you were both so good.

1021
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,893
Yeah, you really got
up there, and you tried.

1022
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:42,870
- Forget it. It's my bachelorette
party, right?  - Yes.

1023
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,705
Good girl. Here you go.

1024
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,971
It's like you read my mind.

1025
00:55:56,086 --> 00:56:00,888
Oh, my God!

1026
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,852
Taxi! Taxi.

1027
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,793
Kevin. Kevin. I need coffee.

1028
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,099
Excuse me. I need coffee.
I need three Advil.

00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,105
Yeah. Four waters.

1030
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,233
Get a splash of that Kahla
next to wherever that paralegal is.

1031
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,244
- Hey, Elana.
- Good morning.

1032
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,303
- You work too hard. I'm gonna
treat you to lunch.  - Okay.

1033
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,906
- Where are you, Kev? Are you in the office?
- I hear you coming. Liv?

1034
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,848
- Liv, blue! Hair!
- Hey, Advil.

1035
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,079
You have blue hair!

1036
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,857
Oh, my God. I totally forgot.

1037
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,758
I was supposed to get it
dyed back at 7:00.

1038
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,854
I think it's very... It's gonna be...
They're gonna love it.

1039
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,956
I got it. I'm gonna figure it out.

1040
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:48,197
<i>If we could all refer to the briefs I've
drawn up. I've highlighted a few main points.</i>

1041
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,263
<i>Our discovery process in depositions
and document requests...</i>

1042
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,174
...maybe you guys could share that one...
has yielded significant results.

1043
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,772
W- W-Wait. Okay. I am looking
at the brief dated two weeks ago.

1044
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,214
<i>- Where is the latest version?
- I could have sworn that I updated these.</i>

1045
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:05,012
Just a second.

1046
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,022
Goddamn it!

1047
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,785
Your hair.

1048
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,794
Yes, my hair. My hair... is blue!

1049
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,228
My hair is blue. My wedding's in a week,
and I'm paying my maid of honor.

1050
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,232
Okay? Or rather Mr. Colson is.

1051
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,825
<i>And, yes, maybe
I misplaced the briefl.</i>

1052
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:24,306
And, yes, maybe my best friend
in the world forever hates me!

1053
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,308
Hates me!

1054
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,375
Oh, my God.

1055
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,787
I'm gonna be a bald bride.

1056
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,056
It's so not ideal.

1057
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,153
This is who's representing us?

1058
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,599
Not anymore. Miss Lerner's off the case.
I'm taking over.

1059
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,536
No, now look, calm down.
I'm gonna get it dyed back.

1060
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,039
Miss Lerner.

1061
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,201
You are excused.

1062
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,110
I'm not this girl.

1063
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,947
<i>I just don't screw up.
I just don't get demoted.</i>

1064
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:17,118
It's like I don't have anybody.
I feel so alone.

1065
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,353
Hey.

1066
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,422
Babe, I'm right here.

1067
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,775
You miss your friend,
especially now.

1068
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,107
She'd know just what to say.

1069
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,477
I'm mad at her too.

1070
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:44,248
She went for the hair.
Girlfriends don't do that.

1071
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,983
You'll fix it. And if you can't, I love it.

1072
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:52,824
I do. You're like this very tall,
very hot Smurf.

1073
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,301
Oh, honey.

1074
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,271
It's not just about the hair.

1075
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,502
I'm mad because maybe she's right.

1076
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:13,844
And it's exhausting having to
try to be perfect all the time.

1077
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:18,149
That's how I held it together
ever since I was a kid.

1078
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,419
Ifigured nothing... Nothing bad
would happen again if I was just...

1079
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:26,826
...one step ahead of everything
and everybody, all the time.

1080
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,224
Life isn't perfect, hon.

1081
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,002
It's messy.

1082
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,875
You're right.

1083
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,878
I mean, I was gonna be
perfect for you...

1084
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,244
...but now that you say
it's impossible... Hey.

1085
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:50,048
No, you don't. No, you
don't have to be perfect.

1086
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,418
I've always wanted a human wife.

1087
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:57,482
Yeah, the other ones are just...
too hard to inflate.

1088
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,165
- Hey.
- Hey.

1089
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,599
- Almost back to normal, huh?
- I know, right?

1090
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:10,400
I have, like, one layer of skin left,
but that should be okay for our wedding.

1091
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,407
So, oops, sorry, Liv.

1092
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,205
<i>I wish I had pictures. You know?</i>

1093
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,874
It's like I was up there, and there's
this spotlight, and when I hit that rope...

1094
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,850
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Enough, enough, enough!

1095
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:26,719
<i>I've heard this story
10,000 times, Emma.</i>

1096
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,053
You've been acting
a little wild lately. Okay?

1097
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,559
And I'm tired of it.
So knock it off.

1098
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,688
Lately you've been very mad
and tense and excited.

1099
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,698
<i>You know what? I just don't know
how to deal with this.</i>

1100
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:40,167
- Uh-huh. - And quite frankly, you
have me questioning whether or not...

1101
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:43,262
...this is something about... To do with
the wedding or if this is permanent.

1102
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,433
Um, well, Fletcher, it is kind
of permanent. You know?

1103
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:50,445
It is possible that I might be mad or tense or
excited more than once in the next 40 years.

1104
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,572
Is it? Really? You know what?
You're doing it right now.

1105
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,949
- What?  - You're being,
not, I mean, not bitchy, but...

1106
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,420
I said " not bitchy." But you're
right there in that neighborhood.

1107
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,724
You should have the cab,
like, take a U-turn...

1108
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,124
...drop you off at Pleasant and Nice,
where we met.

1109
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,685
Are you upset because of this thing
with Liv, or because I'm having feelings?

1110
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,732
<i>- Totally.
- Because it's kind of hard to read you.</i>

1111
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,701
My God! That's totally it. I'm upset
because you have feelings. You nailed it.

1112
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,230
Okay. So in other words, then don't have
so many feelings, but if I do, don't show 'em.

1113
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,708
<i>- I shouldn't have so many...
- Oh, God! I can't even talk to you right now!</i>

1114
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:25,236
You haven't tried yet. Do you realize...
Do you know how hard this is for me?

1115
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:29,978
<i>- I don't even know who you are.  - You have
not even tried to ask me about how I'm feeling.</i>

1116
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,284
<i>- I'm so confused.
- I don't even know who you are.</i>

1117
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,784
<i>All right? I don't want to talk.</i>

1118
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,668
<i>It's a tense time. We're fine.
Whatever. I was gonna go to the gym.</i>

1119
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,403
Bye.

1120
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:22,696
<i>The blank pages of my diary...</i>

1121
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:27,732
<i>That I haven't touched
since you left me...</i>

1122
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:33,146
<i>- Emma?
- The closed blinds in my home...</i>

1123
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:38,210
<i>- Emma! Emma!
- See no light of day...</i>

1124
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:43,520
<i>Dust gathers on my stereo...</i>

1125
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:49,327
<i>'Cause I can't bear
to hear the radio...</i>

1126
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:54,529
<i>The piano sits in a shady space...</i>

1127
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:59,507
<i>With a picture of your face...</i>

1128
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:04,478
<i>Coffee stains on your favorite book...</i>

1129
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,038
<i>Liv Lerner's office.</i>

1130
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:11,246
Hey, Kevin. It's Emma. Is Liv there?

1131
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,686
I'm sorry, can you hold on?
Just a minute, I... Sorry.

1132
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,815
It's my worst nightmare.
I'm " cubicle-ized."

1133
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,622
I'm sorry, Liv's dealing with a crisis
right now. Can we return?

1134
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,597
Fine. That's...

1135
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,190
Yeah. Okay, I get it. Bye.

1136
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,965
<i>- Hey! I'm sorry. Who is this?
- I'm scared to face another day...</i>

1137
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:34,476
<i>- Hello? - 'Cause the
fear in me just won't go away...</i>

1138
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:38,742
<i>In an instant, you were gone...</i>

1139
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:43,684
<i>And I'm scared...</i>

1140
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,860
Hey!

1141
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,866
Hi!

1142
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,868
- How are you?
- Long time, huh?

1143
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:04,430
- I know. It's my fault. I've been really busy.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Busy.

1144
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:08,773
Nothing to do with the fact that I'm the
brother of your archenemy. I mean, best friend.

1145
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,370
Hey! I have to rent a tux.

1146
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,506
You're coming with me. Come on.

1147
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,517
- Um, okay.
- Come on.

1148
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:20,386
I'm a little surprised. I would have thought
a big magazine writer would have his own tux.

1149
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,496
How you doing, Em? Hmm?
How you feeling?

1150
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:41,771
Um, feel fine.

1151
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,979
Fine's not really a feeling though.

1152
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,743
Fine's a feeling.

1153
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,842
"I feel fine." You could say that.
People say that.

1154
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,217
Yeah, sure. You can say that.

1155
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,222
Okay. It's, like...

1156
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,453
Things are crazy with the wedding.

1157
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:02,861
And there are all these details
and... I don't know.

1158
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:06,527
I had this idea of how
it was gonna be in my head, and...

1159
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,831
- And it's not as much fun as that.
- Mm-hmm.

1160
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,638
And I don't know why.

1161
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,537
But mostly, I am fine.

1162
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,850
Let's fix your tie. 
I can't look at a tie like this.

1163
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,084
- Yeah. Change the subject.
- This doesn't look right without a tie.

1164
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,455
I'm gonna go with a clip-on
'cause I can't figure this out.

1165
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,154
- You have no patience.
- Really?

1166
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,163
Mm-mmm.

1167
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,527
Kind of think I wait
around too long.

1168
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,534
Hey, let me buy you a cup of coffee.

1169
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,067
Oh, um, I-I can't.
I'm late for, um...

1170
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,478
But I'll call you.

1171
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,917
Um, when I'm not...You...That...
You look, um, you look really...

1172
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:01,320
You're gonna make a very
handsome bride " giver-awayer."

1173
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,223
Thank you.

1174
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,352
And, Em, you're gonna make
a beautiful bride. Really.

1175
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,993
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah. I always thought so.</i>

1176
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,534
Thanks. Bye.

1177
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:43,094
<i>Despite it all,
when morning broke on that sixth ofJune...</i>

1178
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,566
<i>...it was the perfect day for a wedding.</i>

1179
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,569
<i>Well, two weddings.</i>

1180
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,105
T- Minus three hours, people.

1181
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,574
Guard your camps, execute your duties,
and we may make it out of here alive.

1182
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,770
Incoming, people.

1183
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,585
Roses for Lerner.
Peonies for Allan.

1184
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,052
- Has the Allan officiant reported
for duty yet?  - Yes, he has.

1185
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,282
<i>- Linens for Lerner?
- Yes.</i>

1186
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,755
Excellent.

1187
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,817
Let's move, people.
This is not a dress rehearsal.

1188
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:15,591
Amazing. You can't even
see the blue anymore.

1189
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:24,138
Oh, Liv.

1190
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,903
My God, you're the most
beautiful bride I have ever seen.

1191
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,774
Thank you.

1192
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:32,939
<i>Oh, uh, excuse me a sec.</i>

1193
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,018
She's so weird.

1194
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,520
God, I'm so nervous.
I don't know why.

1195
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,821
- Is the veil supposed to go like that?
- Yes. Why?

1196
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,658
Oh, no. You look fine.

1197
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:53,396
You know, honestly, the pressure
we put on brides these days to look perfect.

1198
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,767
It's just ridiculous.

1199
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:00,741
You don't have to look your most beautiful
on your wedding day. Okay, everybody?

1200
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,278
Mom!

1201
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,279
<i>You know, if you want my opinion...</i>

1202
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:08,646
You know what, Deb? I don't.
I don't want your opinion.

1203
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,550
Wh-What?

1204
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,147
Deb, I have been dealing
with versions of you my whole life...

1205
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,158
...and I'm gonna tell you something...

1206
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,194
...that I should've told myself
a long time ago.

1207
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,922
Sometimes it's about me, okay?

1208
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:24,056
Not all the time, but every once
in a while it's my time. Like today.

1209
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,226
If you're not okay with that,
feel free to go.

1210
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,862
<i>But if you stay,
you have to do your job.</i>

1211
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,533
And that means smiling and talking
about my bridal beauty...

1212
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,576
...and, most importantly,
not making it about you.

1213
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,577
Okay? Can you do that?

1214
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,079
Yes, I'd like to.

1215
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,412
Then we're good.

1216
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,078
Harpist is Allan. Quartet is Lerner.

1217
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,179
How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

1218
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:53,292
- Check on the grooms' status and
man your battle stations.  - Okay.

1219
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,489
If you're about to jump ship
from one wedding...

1220
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,794
...let someone else know
so we can create a diversion.

1221
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:01,303
- Okay. - I'm going to Liv's ceremony
and Emma's reception. More booze.

1222
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,305
I'm gonna do a quick head count of
the hot drunk single guys and then choose.

1223
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,308
- Good call.
- Allan. Lerner.

1224
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,679
Hey, Mr. Allan. How are you?

1225
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:14,079
- I'm good, bud. How're you?
- Big day, huh?

1226
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,708
Yes. Yes, it is.

1227
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,844
I caught a glimpse of Emma when
I was scouting out the enemy camp.

1228
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,549
She is beautiful, sir.

1229
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,558
Thank you, Nathan.

1230
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,560
Listen, you think I could have
a word with your sister?

1231
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,859
- Not about the-the fight, about
something else.  - Oh, yeah. Sure.

1232
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,569
Liv.

1233
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:38,095
Hi! Mr. Allan!

1234
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,802
Oh, Liv.

1235
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,442
Wow. Your mom and dad
would be so proud.

1236
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,710
- Thank you.
- Of both of you.

1237
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,876
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1238
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:53,115
I just want to pass on a blessing
from our generation.

1239
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,488
Not just from myself but from...

1240
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:03,463
...f-from my dear friends who would've
given anything to be here today.

1241
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,161
- Good luck, sweetheart.
- Oh.

1242
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,363
- Nate.
- Mr. Allan, thank you.

1243
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,837
- Good to see you.
- All right.

1244
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,397
You too.

1245
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:17,639
Such a good man.
Emma's so much like him.

1246
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:22,673
So, according to Ms. St. Claire,
you are allowed one weak nip...

1247
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,685
...before the wedding,
to sort of steady the nerves.

1248
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,280
- So we have scotch...
- Okay. Scotch is good.

1249
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,325
We have vodka and tequila.

1250
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,622
Tequila, tequila?
Tequila! Tequila!

1251
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,323
- Kevin! Tequila.
- Tequila's so trashy.

1252
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,833
- No, no, no. Kevin. Kevin, listen to me.
- You don't even like tequila.

1253
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,335
You take this to Marion.
You tell her I switched the DVD's.

1254
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,337
She needs to play this
when Emma walks down the aisle.

1255
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,532
I thought we were rising
above this sort of thing.

1256
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,406
We are, which is why I need you
to do this for me right now. Hurry!

1257
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,717
You'll thank me one day.

1258
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,015
<i>I'll go get that.</i>

1259
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,612
<i>- That's very helpful.
- Okay.</i>

1260
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:01,678
Thank you.

1261
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,385
Oh, my God. It's your parents.

1262
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,657
<i>Come on in. Look,
isn't she a bridal beauty?</i>

1263
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:11,131
<i>She sure is. Oh, my gosh.</i>

1264
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,897
- Oh, wow, Mom.
- Oh, my God! Is that my dress?

1265
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,666
Are you happy?

1266
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,674
I'm happy if you're happy.

1267
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,939
Sweetheart, you could get married
in a brown paper bag, I wouldn't care.

1268
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,879
This is your day.

1269
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,976
Oh, boy, I need a tissue.

1270
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,386
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.
- You're gonna screw up your makeup, honey.

1271
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:37,892
I found this when we moved
to Boca, and I saved it.

1272
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,225
- Dad. What is it?  - I knew there'd
come a day to give it to you.

1273
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,034
<i>Go ahead. Open it.</i>

1274
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,707
In case you need
something old or blue.

1275
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,016
It's really Liv's.

1276
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,917
Well, something borrowed then.

1277
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,630
Daddy, I need to see her.

1278
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,758
<i>I think she feels the same way.</i>

1279
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,132
I'll get that.

1280
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,808
Oh, it's Marion.

1281
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,436
Uh, places, people.
We're on in two.

1282
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,970
Marion, could I just run
down the hallway for a second?

1283
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:39,214
Emma, you are the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen. Ready.

1284
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,257
- Bride one, walking. Bride one, walking.
- Oh.

1285
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,426
<i>I was a little girl...</i>

1286
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,901
<i>Alone in my little world...</i>

1287
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:59,339
<i>- Who dreamed of a little home for me
- It's time.</i>

1288
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,741
<i>I played pretend
between the trees...</i>

1289
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:08,010
<i>And fed my houseguests
bark and leaves...</i>

1290
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:12,543
<i>And laughed in
my pretty bed of green...</i>

1291
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,953
<i>I had a dream...</i>

1292
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,585
<i>That I could fly...</i>

1293
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:23,654
<i>From the highest swing...</i>

1294
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,064
<i>I had a dream...</i>

1295
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:38,544
<i>Ooh...</i>

1296
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:58,825
<i>Ma'am.</i>

1297
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:14,907
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Okay.

1298
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,679
- I'm getting married.
- Yeah. Are you happy?

1299
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,744
Uh...

1300
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,791
<i>When I get
visual confirmation on bride one walking...</i>

1301
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,826
...give video a five count and roll.

1302
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,987
<i>And ready.</i>

1303
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,565
<i>Walk.</i>

1304
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:52,683
<i>I'm in Acapulco, babyI Spring breakI</i>

1305
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:57,282
I'm here with Miguel.

1306
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,127
<i>I love spring breakI
I want to danceI</i>

1307
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,963
<i>Go, EmmaI Go, EmmaI</i>

1308
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,465
<i>- I love being EmmaI
- I...</i>

1309
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,322
We've been hit.
Repeat, we've been hit.

1310
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:47,240
<i>EmmaI</i>

1311
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,436
<i>Let me tell you something about that tapeI</i>

1312
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:55,472
God, you swore! You swore
you'd never show that to anyone.

1313
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,687
Just... Let them go.

1314
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:00,847
Emma!

1315
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,289
Bring it on!

1316
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,759
<i>EmmaI I don't want to fightI</i>

1317
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,958
- Let me just tell you something!
- I don't want to fight!

1318
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,036
It's over. I can't do this anymore.

1319
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:19,640
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

1320
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:32,710
Thank God.

1321
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,194
I'm fine.

1322
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,035
Emma, what the hell
are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

1323
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,201
You just ruined our wedding.
You happy now?

1324
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:31,575
Your friend? History. 'Cause she's a bad
influence on you, and she always has been.

1325
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,241
Judging by that DVD, you're
a lot more like her than I thought.

1326
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,444
- Good. I hope so.
- What?

1327
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,613
Fletcher, you've been
my friend for 10 years.

1328
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:44,022
I need you to be my friend now
and tell me the truth.

1329
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,361
You're in love with a girl
that you met 10 years ago.

1330
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,797
Hey, what's the matter with that? Huh?

1331
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:55,200
She's not here anymore.

1332
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,902
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life fighting, Fletch.

1333
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,910
Or caving.

1334
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,080
Neither do you.

1335
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:14,253
We're different.
We want different things.

1336
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,423
You know that's true, don't you?

1337
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,568
I knew.

1338
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,125
Good-bye.

1339
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:57,294
Oh, my God. Emma.

1340
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,599
I'm fine.

1341
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,440
This is all my fault.
That video was never supposed to happen.

1342
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:14,107
<i>I mean, it was supposed to
happen, but I canceled it. I thought I did.</i>

1343
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:17,310
'Cause I could never do that to you.
Emma, you're my best friend.

1344
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:20,149
<i>Oh, this fighting is so dumb.</i>

1345
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,185
I'm so sorry about everything.

1346
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,794
I'm sorry... Too.

1347
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:35,496
I'm so sorry.

1348
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,000
If I ruined it for you,
I don't want it anymore.

1349
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:46,036
If Fletcher and I were perfect
for each other, then...

1350
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:50,983
...we'd be getting married, and we're not.

1351
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,315
Are you crying?

1352
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,484
Yeah. It's like a whole new me.

1353
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,155
And I just... I cry all the time.

1354
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,826
- I'm kind of a basket case.
- No, Liv, I didn't want that. I'm sorry.

1355
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,564
No. No, you were right.

1356
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,937
I don't have to have it
constantly together all the time.

1357
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:18,446
It's like... This huge wake-up call.

1358
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:21,641
And I'm kind of stumbling around
a little bit, but...

1359
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,910
I'm awake.

1360
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,883
Will you stand up there with me?

1361
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:33,356
Where else would I be?

1362
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,900
Reset, people. Reset.

1363
01:20:56,952 --> 01:21:00,581
Oh, I almost forgot something.

1364
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:05,388
Oh, my God. Em?
Where did you find that?

1365
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,394
Two little girls saved it for us.

1366
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,424
Come on.

1367
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,552
Hi.

1368
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:44,861
- Hey. Are you single?
- Uh, yeah.

1369
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,595
- Are you straight?
- I don't like labels.

1370
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,234
So sorry to hear about your divorce.

1371
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,970
Why? It was only my first.

1372
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,945
And next time, I'm definitely
getting married at the Plaza.

1373
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:04,543
<i>You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind...</i>

1374
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:08,316
<i>- You made me so
- Very happy...</i>

1375
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,653
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes.

1376
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,387
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1377
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,269
Um...

1378
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:27,274
No, baby. Baby,
let it happen on its own.

1379
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:32,507
Uh-oh. Did I make a horrible mistake and
marry someone who's smarter than I am?

1380
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,918
<i>It was quite a wedding.</i>

1381
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,955
<i>And as I stood there watching...</i>

1382
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:45,015
<i>I realized something
I'd forgotten a long time ago.</i>

1383
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:50,861
You made me so very happy...

1384
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:56,393
<i>Sometimes in life there really are
bonds formed that can never be broken.</i>

1385
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:02,041
<i>Sometimes, you really can
find that one person...</i>

1386
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,546
<i>...who will stand by you
no matter what.</i>

1387
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:10,676
<i>Maybe you'll find it in a spouse
and celebrate it with your dream wedding.</i>

1388
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,055
<i>But there's also the chance...</i>

1389
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:18,786
<i>...that the one person
you can count on for a lifetime...</i>

1390
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,385
<i>...the one person who knows you...</i>

1391
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,432
<i>...sometimes better
than you know yourself...</i>

1392
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:29,698
<i>...is the same person who's been
standing beside you all along.</i>

1393
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:44,080
- Wow! You look great.
- Hello. Oh, my God. You look great.

1394
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,480
Well, how was it?
How was the vacation?

1395
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,990
- It was amazing.
- I want to know everything about it.

1396
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,822
Actually, I don't.
You married my brother. That's weird.

1397
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,657
So I don't want
to know anything, ever.

1398
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,793
Should we toast? To marriage?

1399
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,427
Um, actually, I'm not drinking.

1400
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:07,798
Neither am I.

1401
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,274
Are you pregnant?

1402
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,677
- When are...
- Me too. March third.

1403
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,614
When're you due? March third.

1404
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,819
<i>Do you believe in love...</i>

1405
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,289
<i>Yes, I believe in love...</i>

1406
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:26,885
<i>- I believe it's because I've tried
- Do, do, do...</i>

1407
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:31,022
<i>And if you know anything
'Bout loving anyone...</i>

1408
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:34,796
<i>Somehow you got to be satisfied...</i>

1409
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,962
<i>Oh, but don't go changin'</i>

1410
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,063
<i>At least not for me, baby...</i>

1411
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,837
<i>I'm doin'what I gotta do, ooh...</i>

1412
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,845
<i>I'll be fine...</i>

1413
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,881
<i>Find a way to pass the time...</i>

1414
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,883
<i>While I sit here
waiting on you...</i>

1415
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,885
<i>Oh, listen...</i>

1416
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:57,357
<i>But as soon
as you get the chance, baby...</i>

1417
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,359
<i>You've got to...</i>

1418
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:03,056
<i>- Love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1419
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,328
<i>- Please
- Do, do, do...</i>

1420
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,804
<i>- Say you love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1421
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:14,137
<i>- Pretty please
- Just once...</i>

1422
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:19,306
<i>Know it's hard out there...</i>

1423
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,349
<i>- I can imagine how
- Do, do, do...</i>

1424
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:27,047
<i>Who you are in here...</i>

1425
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,455
<i>- See I can imagine now
- Do, do, do...</i>

1426
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,516
<i>Why can't reality...</i>

1427
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,154
<i>You don't ever have to be...</i>

1428
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:38,722
<i>Able to read my mind, ooh...</i>

1429
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,861
<i>I can hardly walk
without burning up...</i>

1430
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,633
<i>So I might as well start alive...</i>

1431
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:53,272
<i>Just as soon as you get a chance...</i>

1432
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,282
<i>Darlin'</i>

1433
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,808
<i>- Love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1434
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:02,254
<i>- Please
- Do, do, do...</i>

1435
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:06,453
<i>- Say you love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1436
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:10,055
<i>- Pretty please
- Do, do...</i>

1437
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:14,966
<i>Why, tell me why
you wanna treat me so bad...</i>

1438
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:16,970
<i>When you know I love you...</i>

1439
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,972
<i>Darlin; don't you know...</i>

1440
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:23,101
<i>I'm giving you the best lovin'
you've ever had...</i>

1441
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,305
<i>No one else for you...</i>

1442
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:33,680
<i>- Just as soon
- Just as soon...</i>

1443
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,619
<i>- Love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1444
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,094
<i>- Please
- Do, do, do...</i>

1445
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:46,429
<i>- Say you love me
- Love me, baby...</i>

1446
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:50,631
<i>- Pretty please
- Do, do...</i>

1447
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:56,666
<i>Say, won't you come love me
Pretty, pretty please...</i>

1448
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,712
<i>Do, do, do...</i>

1449
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,113
<i>Said if you got the time, baby...</i>

1450
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,845
<i>Come and spend it with me...</i>
