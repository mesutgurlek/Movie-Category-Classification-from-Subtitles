The cabin's a mile from that.

1086
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:41,918
BUDDY:
They're searching for us.

1087
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:45,794
- How do they know we're here?
- I told Susan.

1088
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,733
Do you love her?

1089
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,473
Does it matter?

1090
01:14:58,343 --> 01:15:00,208
And Jesse?

1091
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:05,846
She's just a kid.

1092
01:15:06,018 --> 01:15:08,213
What does that mean, Buddy?

1093
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,485
I hardly know her.

1094
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,664
What now?

1095
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,300
I just, I thought if I did everything...

1096
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:31,271
...for the now,
that I could forget the past...

1097
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,207
...and the past is who I am.

1098
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,507
And I just, I don't-- I--

1099
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,944
How am I supposed to go back to Susan
if I don't know how to forgive her?

1100
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:48,321
Look. Uh, ahem.

1101
01:15:51,363 --> 01:15:55,197
I'm gonna disappear. Just, look,
tell them that you lost me, okay?

1102
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:58,161
No, Frank. No, I won't.

1103
01:15:58,337 --> 01:16:00,464
- Yeah. You owe me that!
- No.

1104
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,665
Owe you? I don't owe you anything!

1105
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:08,405
And you know what?
You're a freaking idiot!

1106
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:14,046
I wish Susan had picked me.

1107
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:16,315
I wish Susan loved me.

1108
01:16:16,688 --> 01:16:19,657
I wish Jesse thought
of me as her father.

1109
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:22,659
But all they do is love you.

1110
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:27,958
God, I even love you.

1111
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:31,958
I'm cold, I'm wet, and
I'm past feeling sad...

1112
01:16:32,058 --> 01:16:33,270
for anyone but myself.

1113
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:38,102
So you know, stay out here if you want.
Become one with nature, go hump Bigfoot.

1114
01:16:38,277 --> 01:16:41,405
But I'm going back into the cabin
and getting warm.

1115
01:16:43,548 --> 01:16:45,072
God.

1116
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,455
I think we got one over here.

1117
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:33,154
Somebody get a blanket!

1118
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:55,216
Where's Mr. Allen?

1119
01:17:58,824 --> 01:18:00,189
It's complicated.

1120
01:19:36,121 --> 01:19:37,611
JESSE:
Daddy!

1121
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,122
Daddy!

1122
01:20:16,161 --> 01:20:18,994
FRANK:
<i>You ever hear of chaos theory, Ed?</i>

1123
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:20,461
<i>It's a science.</i>

1124
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,225
It tries to determine
underlying patterns...

1125
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:24,325
in chaotic systems:

1126
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:28,337
Weather, ocean currents, blood flow,
that sort of thing.

1127
01:20:28,507 --> 01:20:31,601
Well, it turns out
that there are few things...

1128
01:20:31,776 --> 01:20:35,177
...more chaotic than the beat
of a human heart.

1129
01:20:35,347 --> 01:20:40,284
Speeding up, slowing down.
A pretty face, a flight of stairs.

1130
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:43,751
It's always changing depending
on what's happening to us out there.

1131
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,482
It's an erratic son of a bitch.

1132
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:49,687
But underneath all of
that bump-a-ta-bump...

1133
01:20:49,787 --> 01:20:51,788
mess, there is, in fact, a pattern.

1134
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,760
A truth.

1135
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,593
And it's love.

1136
01:20:56,134 --> 01:21:00,036
The most important thing about love
is that we choose to give it...

1137
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:02,730
...and we choose to receive it.

1138
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,870
Making it the least random act
in the entire universe.

1139
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:09,946
It transcends blood,
it transcends betrayal...

1140
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,141
...and all the dirt that makes us human.

1141
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,880
And if you can figure that out...

1142
01:21:17,055 --> 01:21:19,888
...the Jake Lees of the world
got nothing on you.

1143
01:21:20,058 --> 01:21:21,616
Now, what's all this about?

1144
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:22,953
Uh-oh.

1145
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,188
Poor Ed, has Frank been torturing you
with tales of love and war?

1146
01:21:26,364 --> 01:21:28,958
- Well, yes, ma'am.
- You're gonna be late.

1147
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,293
I'll see you in there.

1148
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,632
Thanks.

1149
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:43,971
- Have you been bad?
- No.

1150
01:21:48,787 --> 01:21:50,254
A little bit.

1151
01:21:51,456 --> 01:21:54,550
Come on, let's go.
Monster, we're gonna be late.

1152
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:56,951
[SUSAN LAUGHS]

1153
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:12,836
- You're beautiful.
- I'm nervous, Daddy.

1154
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,376
Jake loves you very much.

1155
01:22:14,546 --> 01:22:17,447
- Ed.
- He loves you too, honey.

1156
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:52,042
Friends,
we have been invited here today...

1157
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:56,620
...to share in a most important moment
in the lives for Edward and Jessica.

1158
01:22:56,788 --> 01:22:59,086
In the time they've been together....
