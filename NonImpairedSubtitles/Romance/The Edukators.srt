1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,091
- Fluffy, why are you there?
- Put your cat away.

2
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,734
The alarm is off.

3
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,088
Heat the sauna, dear.

4
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:35,588
Right away.

5
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,740
I'm incredibly thirsty.

6
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,497
Mom, look!

7
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,277
What's that?

8
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:00,848
The stereo is gone.

9
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,888
My porcelain soldiers!

10
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:09,726
Mom, your soldiers!

11
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,074
Don't touch anything!

12
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,097
- Call the police.
- At once.

13
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,831
Laura, don't touch!

14
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,380
There is a letter.

15
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,674
The stereo is in the fridge.

16
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,648
Readme!

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,725
Your Days of Plenty are Numbered.

18
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:04,685
They work 14-hours days for peanuts!

19
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,460
7 days a week!

20
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,956
We buy the shoes for 100 Euros.

21
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,499
But they only cost 5 Euros to make!

22
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,654
Do you know who really makes those shoes?

23
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,014
No

24
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:22,514
Children in Indonesia, the Philippines...

25
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,434
Please leave the store.

26
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:26,551
In Indonesia, Philippines...

27
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,363
This isn't allowed.

28
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,878
That's enough. Get out!

29
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,297
I'm just handing out flyers.
Don't touch me!

30
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:40,346
They’re made by children
between the ages of 12 and 16!

31
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,330
Capitalist pigs!

32
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,128
Pigs!

33
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,204
The state supports capitalism!

34
00:04:58,426 --> 00:04:59,926
Let go of him!

35
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,236
The demonstration is legal!
,

36
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,415
There's Miss Lindner!

37
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,501
Eviction papers for you.

38
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,739
Two weeks to vacate.

39
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,715
Leave it in tip-top shape
or loose deposit.

40
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,208
But I paid the rent back.

41
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,009
Yes, but 6 months too late.

42
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,567
Have a nice day!

43
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,507
Ticket control!
Tickets please.

44
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,722
Young man, did you hear me?

45
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,074
You, there. Ticket please!

46
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,965
What a stench!

47
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,949
He stinks up the entire car

48
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,833
Let's see you ticket.

49
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,335
- Stop drinking.
- ¡Leave me alone!

50
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,095
Take it easy or else!

51
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:02,720
Show me your ticket.

52
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,090
Ticket, please.

53
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,141
Do you have a ticket?

54
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:09,166
Take your hands off!

55
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,392
No drinking in here!

56
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,247
That's enough!

57
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,329
What's going on?

58
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:18,868
Mind your own business.

59
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,678
He is a total wreck.
Leave him alone.

60
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,794
What's it to you?

61
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,895
End of the line for you.

62
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,982
Here, you dropped this.

63
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,573
Hold on.

64
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:56,677
Jule, what's wrong?

65
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,955
Everything, nothing...

66
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,268
Move in with us for now.

67
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,813
A cosy little commune.

68
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,391
Sure.

69
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,536
Taste this. It's raspberry.

70
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,485
Choose the bright colors,
not always the depressing ones.

71
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,334
Shit!

72
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,334
Jan!

73
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,916
What a pain!

74
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,400
Bastard!

75
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,543
Do you think it was a good
idea to move in with Jan?

76
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,783
Jan is totally alright.

77
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,987
You just have to know him better.

78
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,390
I dunno.

79
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,697
Sometimes he gives me
this really aggressive look.

80
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,953
Really scary.

81
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:33,556
Jule, I've known Jan for 15 years.

82
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,004
He's a little unpredictable.

83
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,008
But he's a loyal soul.

84
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,626
And he's got a backbone.
Not many people do.

85
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,669
I dunno. He's kind of weird.

86
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,327
What's that?

87
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:55,353
Oxygen concentrator...
He bought it "used" the other day.

88
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,149
Really?

89
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:03,385
Are you excited
about going to Barcelona?

90
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,249
Sure!

91
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,347
Are you excited?

92
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,149
It's just that my debts
are out of control.

93
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:17,620
Baby, it's my treat. Completely.

94
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,767
We'll have a great time.

95
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,313
You just don't get it.

96
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,335
I have to straighten this out.

97
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,143
Beating yourself up
wont make things better.

98
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,093
Try to relax!

99
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:35,643
Just forget it.

100
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,202
Hello.

101
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,704
Man, we have to find
a new approach.

102
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:29,947
Take it to another level.

103
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:31,697
Everything is fine.

104
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,806
Bullshit!

105
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,840
We need to see things...

106
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,647
in a larger context.

107
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,364
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,901
Forget it!

109
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,323
- Got a light?
- Check in my bag.

110
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,754
No.

111
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,868
Look in the small one.
Open your eyes!

112
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,387
What is this?

113
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:06,813
Looks like a watch to me.

114
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:10,820
Won it at poker?

115
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,643
I think so, yeah.

116
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,835
- Peter, are you nuts?
- No, I won it.

117
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,225
Put it back where you found it.

118
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:21,836
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- OK. Thanks.

119
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,567
- Man, are you crazy?
- What?

120
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:30,659
You just threw 5000 Euros
out of the window!

121
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,354
So what?

122
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,816
Yeah, so what?

123
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,318
It's a principle!

124
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,516
You and your damn morals!

125
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,227
What morals?

126
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:42,200
What's it worth if we
are seen as common burglars?

127
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:46,985
If we can't agree,
then let's just drop it.

128
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,052
OK, man. I got it.

129
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,492
But in Kreuzberg,
I know this Turk...

130
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:56,454
He would have given me 2500 for it.
We could have split 50/50.

131
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,800
You don't get it
and you don't want to!

132
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,453
But it was just sitting there...

133
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,599
So shiny, calling out to me.

134
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,411
It's green.

135
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,456
Change the station.

136
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:30,285
So far, so far away from home...

137
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:34,366
Shit it won't get any louder.

138
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,217
No hellos, no hearts, no kisses

139
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:40,951
No sorrow.

140
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:45,247
Everything so far, so far away.

141
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:47,698
The best of times

142
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,418
You asshole!

143
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,900
...where flowers bloom,

144
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,763
where my sweetheart lives...

145
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,296
One more time!

146
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:58,797
Fucking awesome!

147
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,305
Miss!

148
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,683
We ordered Williams pear brandy.

149
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,392
That's William pear brandy.

150
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,684
But never in these glasses!

151
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,633
These are liqueur glasses.

152
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,681
So?

153
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,729
Can't beverages be served
in their proper glasses?

154
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,672
I simply cannot drink
from this glass.

155
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,515
Thank you.

156
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,676
- Just a moment, please.
- By the way...

157
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:42,720
Don't use the same brandy.
It's lost its flavor, understand?

158
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,111
Yes, by all means.

159
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,161
Table 47 prefers brandy glasses.

160
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,192
You have more customers.
At table 22.

161
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:57,869
Dream on your own time!

162
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:22,552
Be careful getting home!

163
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,609
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.

164
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,562
Can't you do something else?

165
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,904
Putting up those posters
doesn't pay much.

166
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,400
Plus, you're out all night.

167
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,401
Yeah, I'm sick of it too.
But there's nothing else

168
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:48,618
Good night.

169
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:35,656
What?

170
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,771
You can't go?

171
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,397
I have to turn over the apartment.

172
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,849
That asshole! I can't believe it.

173
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,325
It's only 3 days.
I don't get it.

174
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,162
Shit!

175
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,034
Then I'm staying too.

176
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,329
No, this is your big break.

177
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,646
You have to go alone.

178
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,342
I'll find someone to help you, OK?

179
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,539
Sorry, I overslept.

180
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,560
You can use this one.

181
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,392
- Here?
- Maybe over there.

182
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:37,768
How about some music?

183
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,639
Is that Jeff Cole?

184
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,266
I saw him in concert.

185
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,339
At the Columbia?

186
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,280
I was there.

187
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:20,425
Funny, I didn't see you!

188
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:29,030
This is a great place.
Why move?

189
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,440
I can't afford it.

190
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,131
Your debts?

191
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:36,632
Peter told you?

192
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,221
He mentioned it.

193
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,186
That idiot.

194
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,752
It's not a big deal.

195
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,642
We all have debts.

196
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,752
But not like me.

197
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,402
I probably can't compeed but...

198
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:51,842
How much?

199
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,494
1000 Euros? 10000 Euros?

200
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,539
More? 20000?

201
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:01,245
- 30000?
- Jan, please...

202
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,169
Don't ruin my day.

203
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,050
94500.

204
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:27,966
Euros?

205
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,567
What did you do? Burn down a factory?

206
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,343
If only.

207
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,561
A year ago, on the highway...

208
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:41,816
I was in my old Golf.

209
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:45,461
Ahead of me, this executive
driving his Mercedes S-Class.

210
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,328
He brakes. I don't.

211
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:50,179
His car is totaled.

212
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:53,453
My registration had expired.
I hadn't paid my insurance.

213
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,950
That fucking Mercedes
cost 100000 Euros.

214
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:00,869
But I'm now down to 94500.

215
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,731
You work your butt off

216
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:08,792
so that some big shot
can drive a Mercedes?

217
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:14,986
For executives like him...
That car is petty cash.

218
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,281
But it was my fault.
He was in the right

219
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:20,655
In the right? Is that justice?

220
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:25,372
You are paying for
some jerk's lifestyle.

221
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,673
A 100000-Euro car?

222
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:30,585
Why not gold-plated pipes?

223
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:32,312
It makes me sick too!

224
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,164
I should never have reached
for the glove compartment.

225
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:39,420
I screwed up.
Now I pay the price.

226
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,227
Who says that?

227
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:43,717
The cops?

228
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,395
The prosecutors, the news rags?

229
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:47,892
Fucking petty bourgeois ethic!

230
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,168
Decency, honesty, family values...

231
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:55,064
Get to work on time,
pay your taxes...

232
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,031
All hammered into us.

233
00:22:57,316 --> 00:22:59,837
First in school, then on TV.
For what?

234
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,385
So guys like that can
buy expensive cars?

235
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,375
To hell with those morals!

236
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:06,518
Ruining a young woman's
life is immoral.

237
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:10,054
Think that guy ever thought
he was wrong?

238
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:14,237
You are right.

239
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,356
But I missed a payment once...

240
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,513
They were knocking on my door.

241
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:23,888
Step 1: Recognizing injustice.
Step 2: Action.

242
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,215
But how?

243
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,771
Take the first step alone.
Find allies for the second.

244
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:32,235
From where?

245
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,200
Take the first step, then call me.

246
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,959
I calculated how much of my life...

247
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:48,338
I'm giving to that asshole...
Just for fun.

248
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,038
And?

249
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,512
About 8 years.
But only once I'm a teacher.

250
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,635
That's what you want to do?

251
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,537
Better than waitressing.

252
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:08,520
And before the accident?

253
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:13,914
Concretely...

254
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,377
I guess I wanted...

255
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,028
This might sound stupid.

256
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,114
I guess I just wanted

257
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:34,733
to live wild an free.

258
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,340
That's not stupid.

259
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,501
It's OK.

260
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,872
That's what half of us want.

261
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:45,646
Then come the compromises.

262
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,234
That's how it goes.

263
00:24:48,157 --> 00:24:49,657
Not necessarily.

264
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,700
Sometimes not.
Some people make it.

265
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,554
Anyhow...

266
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,445
If you keep working
for that asshole,

267
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,817
you'll loose faith
in everything.

268
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,098
I go this way.

269
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,499
I go that way.

270
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,640
Thanks again.

271
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,141
If you still need help,

272
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,314
I can come again.

273
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,907
Great!

274
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:29,408
Sure.

275
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:33,701
- So where are you headed?
- Sleeping at a girlfriend's.

276
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:37,415
How about you?

277
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,769
I think I'll cook something.

278
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,158
Want to join me?

279
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:51,701
Gladly.

280
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:24,050
DAYS OF PLENTY.

281
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:32,676
All washed up?

282
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,462
Shall we cook?

283
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:43,288
Jan, it was great.

284
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,050
Guys who can cook
must get all the girls.

285
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,400
Not really.

286
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,862
Other things count more.

287
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,064
You join me for a smoke?

288
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,578
I don't know.

289
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,940
It's dessert.

290
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:07,932
Dope chokes young people's
revolutionary energy.

291
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:13,793
Grass too?

292
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,448
No, grass is OK.

293
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:22,637
The drugs the body produces
aren't bad either.

294
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,381
Actually, they're greats.

295
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,432
Like adrenalin?

296
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:27,907
For example.

297
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:29,712
There are thousands. Endorphins...

298
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:33,738
Happiness hormones
when you are in love...

299
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:37,572
Now you're talking hard drugs.
Watch out for those.

300
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,185
Don't fall into a life of crime!

301
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,744
Fear is an awesome drug.

302
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,298
Don't let fear take control.

303
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,271
Use it as a motor.

304
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:56,870
It takes practice.

305
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,343
Put yourself into a situation
where you're scared stiff.

306
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,282
First there's panic.

307
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,059
But after a while,

308
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:08,150
the body's self-protection
system kicks in.

309
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:10,980
You do things you never dared.

310
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:16,675
You overcome you limitations.
You believe you can do anything.

311
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,366
Really!

312
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,082
Do you know it or think it?

313
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,497
I know it.
Done it a thousand times.

314
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,578
¨A thousand times gone bad...¨

315
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,125
Run a check on-that plate.

316
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,565
It's OK.

317
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:13,506
It works if you smear it.

318
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:16,327
It's not good wallpaper.

319
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,773
- How come?
- The glue isn't right.

320
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:22,781
But i followed the instructions.

321
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:26,207
Shit!

322
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000
You know what?

323
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,510
Fuck the deposit!

324
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:06,659
We should have done this before.
It works.

325
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:09,518
Hope they'll like it.

326
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,990
Look.

327
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:25,231
Every heart is a revolutionary cell.

328
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,500
Smile!

329
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:41,041
Excuse me...

330
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:49,807
Your hair!

331
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,308
Yes, I'll fix it.

332
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,506
Roast beef with potatoes
and summer vegetables.

333
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:42,627
We should smoke downstairs
in the storeroom.

334
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,228
Why not tell him too?

335
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:48,329
That way he can say
all we do is smoke.

336
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,496
You're right.

337
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,278
There you are!
The place is packed.

338
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,003
Just fixing my hair.

339
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:58,504
I can tell.

340
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:03,724
Are you crazy?
In the kitchen?

341
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:06,196
- I'm truly sorry, .
- What were you thinking?

342
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,441
Know what?

343
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:11,953
I've had it with you.
That's enough. You're fired.

344
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:13,857
No, boss. I need this job.

345
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,635
It's my fault. I smoked first.

346
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:18,392
I said it was OK.

347
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,160
Then you are fired too.

348
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,646
- What?
- Pack it up!

349
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,330
Wait, Jule. Let me.

350
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,881
Boss, wait!

351
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:30,456
Why can't I shut up?

352
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,902
What for?

353
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,663
It's great that you defended him.

354
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,614
Yeah sure.

355
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:43,332
But I need that job, you see.

356
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:46,009
No, I don't see.

357
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,097
You go to all those protests...

358
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:52,796
against exploitation and oppression...

359
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:56,740
but you're still
some bastard's slave.

360
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,774
Those protests are totally useless.

361
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:10,986
The rebellion is difficult now.

362
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:15,277
Before, all it took was
dope and long hair.

363
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,903
And the establishment
was automatically against you.

364
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:22,872
What was considered subversive then

365
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,599
you can buy in shops today.

366
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:28,804
Che Guevara t-shirts
or anarchy stickers.

367
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,952
That's why there aren't any more
youth movements.

368
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,312
Everyone has the feeling
it's all be done before.

369
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:43,115
Others tried and failed.
Why should it work for us?

370
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,643
For all revolutions,
one thing is clear...

371
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:58,996
Even if some didn’t work,
the most important thing is...

372
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:01,686
that the best ideas survived.

373
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,632
The same goes for personal revolts.

374
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,276
What turns out good...

375
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,306
what survives in you...

376
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,121
that makes you stronger.

377
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,232
What do you think?

378
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:31,245
How many people down there
are thinking about revolution?

379
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,222
In this moment, not many.

380
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,958
At 10:45, they are watching TV.

381
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,146
Probably.

382
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:45,430
Europeans spend 4 hours a day
in front of the boob tube.

383
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:47,414
4 hours!

384
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:49,322
Terrible!

385
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:52,195
Doesn't leave much time
for revolutionary thoughts.

386
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,280
You know...

387
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,497
Not being part of all that...

388
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:01,968
that's not the problem.

389
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,676
The problem is...

390
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,138
I can't find anything
I really want to believe in.

391
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:16,207
Got any ideas for me?

392
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:23,356
Follow me.

393
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,917
Now what?

394
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:48,927
Who lives here?

395
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:52,502
You never wondered why

396
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:55,192
Peter and I stay out all night?

397
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:58,160
To put up posters. What else?

398
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,414
Then...

399
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,435
What do you do?

400
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,421
We are driving around looking for villas.

401
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,492
When we find one we like...

402
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:13,852
we take a closer look.

403
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:17,964
Then what? You take pretty photos
and put them in an album?

404
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:22,077
Is this a joke?

405
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:24,762
We break into them.

406
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,210
Just one catch.

407
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:32,493
We don't steal anything.

408
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:35,506
We re-arrange the furniture.

409
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:38,408
And we leave a message.

410
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,735
"Your Days of Plenty are Numbered"

411
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,201
or "You Have Too Much Money"...

412
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:46,081
signed "The Edukators"

413
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:49,191
You and Peter are the Edukators?

414
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:55,854
Why?

415
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,227
So they feel less safe...

416
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:01,428
in their high security neighborhoods.

417
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,476
It's a creepy feeling...
Someone has been in your home.

418
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:08,232
They have been watching you.

419
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:10,969
And they will keep watching you.

420
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:16,578
Why not empty the villas
and give everything to the poor?

421
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,305
They expect burglars.

422
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,797
We want to really scare them.

423
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:25,121
Standing in the bank,

424
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:27,102
they'll hear faint whispers:

425
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,514
"You have too much money..."

426
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,768
"You have too much money..."

427
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:35,639
They'll feel completely alone.

428
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,410
Nothing can help them.

429
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:41,516
Not money, not a spouse,
not any damn cop.

430
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:46,807
Are you serious?

431
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,378
I'll show you.

432
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,504
Guess where the camera is?

433
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:07,966
Behind the grill.

434
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:19,530
Skeleton key...

435
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:22,789
Look at this.

436
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,504
Peter found this list.

437
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:29,680
The x's mark our hits.

438
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:33,944
This is real.

439
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:40,252
No way... This is insane.

440
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:42,395
How did it start?

441
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,646
Not a clue.

442
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:47,951
Peter installed alarm systems.

443
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,029
I once asked him...

444
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:54,738
if he knew how
to disable an alarm system.

445
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,958
He said no problem.

446
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:01,345
So we did it

447
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:04,742
You two...

448
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:09,976
Isn't this Zehelendorf?

449
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:14,675
Which street?

450
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:16,929
Finkenbachstrasse.

451
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,770
No way! Wait...

452
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:24,660
Shit!

453
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:26,274
Jan, shit!

454
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,152
Take a left down there, OK?
Now I'll show you!

455
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,512
That must be it, there!

456
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,191
Stop, pull over there.
I think that asshole...

457
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,253
I owe money to lives there.

458
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,303
What are you doing?

459
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,062
He really lives here.

460
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:08,003
The mailbox is full.
They must be away.

461
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:10,899
Let's take a look.

462
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,740
Down at the lake we can get in.

463
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:27,834
Don't be a drag!
Let's just take a peek.

464
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:34,549
Wait up!

465
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:37,399
See?

466
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,205
Check out this place!

467
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,547
With boat and private dock...

468
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,469
The blinds are down.
They must be on vacation.

469
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:15,275
Don't be so sure.

470
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,572
How would you break in?

471
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:22,865
Maybe through a cellar window.

472
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:25,557
Let's go closer!

473
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,079
Doesn't that look like
the ideal point of entry?

474
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:39,145
Totally hidden.

475
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,767
It could work.

476
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,961
Let's break.

477
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:48,090
You're insane. No way!

478
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,238
I have to see how
that asshole lives. Please!

479
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,445
This is too spontaneous.
It's too risky

480
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:58,989
But you're a pro.
I just want a peek!

481
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,539
Jule, I'm not a pro.

482
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:05,448
We have to monitor the house first.

483
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,790
You can see no one's home.

484
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,182
Please!

485
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,280
We can come back a few times.
Then do it with Peter.

486
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,258
They'll be back then.

487
00:43:22,112 --> 00:43:25,237
But only if the house
is on file, which I really doubt.

488
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,649
Agreed.

489
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,637
Shit!

490
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,139
What?

491
00:43:39,435 --> 00:43:41,163
- Bingo!
- What?

492
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,758
- We've got his alarm system.
- We are going in?

493
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,141
I'll only have 30 seconds
to find the main console.

494
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,296
- We do it Edukators style.
- Agreed.

495
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:02,597
Once I open the window,
I'll have only 30 seconds.

496
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:04,806
When the alarm is off,
I'll come for you.

497
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:07,231
- So I wait here?
- Yes.

498
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,764
Jan, check out the pool.

499
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:14,571
Come on!

500
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,072
Let's make sure no one's home.

501
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:34,435
It's OK.

502
00:46:47,354 --> 00:46:48,855
I told you...

503
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,751
petty cash.

504
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,174
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic.

505
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,210
Less conspicuous than a flashlight.

506
00:47:05,663 --> 00:47:07,163
You can take off you mask.

507
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:09,567
No one's home.

508
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,126
This is him.

509
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,579
He needs cooling off.

510
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,980
And vertically?

511
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,383
Got it?

512
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:12,054
Awesome!

513
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,555
Looks much better now!

514
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,025
You have too much money.
The Edukators.

515
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,311
OK, let's go.

516
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:34,577
Come on, Jan.
Let's do something extreme.

517
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:38,971
I need to work off some aggression.
Please!

518
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,245
You're crazy.
We have been here to long.

519
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,059
Let's throw the couch in the pool.

520
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:49,164
It's a great idea. Come on!

521
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:51,959
Let's do it!

522
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:56,326
Then we'll go.

523
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,344
- Will it pass?
- It's hot here.

524
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:10,468
First things first!

525
00:49:14,727 --> 00:49:15,870
One...

526
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,371
two...

527
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:18,915
Three!

528
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:25,804
Come on

529
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:32,191
Help me.

530
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:40,805
¡Idiot!

531
00:49:42,872 --> 00:49:44,372
¿What's that?

532
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,343
It's me!
Where from?

533
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:49,976
Jule, give it back.

534
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:52,871
Come and get it..

535
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,879
Wait here. I'll be right back.

536
00:51:38,986 --> 00:51:40,488
Don't do this, man.

537
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:27,159
Jan, let's go now!

538
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,061
Pack our things.

539
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:30,883
I'll be right back.

540
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,786
Got everything?

541
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:50,956
- Shit!
- What's wrong?

542
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:36,516
Cops!

543
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:10,792
That was so awesome!

544
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,284
I'd love to see Hardenberg's face!

545
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:18,700
when he comes home
and finds his couch in the pool.

546
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,414
It was the best, I tell you.
38 degrees...

547
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:55,119
the whole city is one big party.

548
00:54:55,578 --> 00:54:57,389
But what was really the best...

549
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,330
I found this in Barcelona.

550
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,000
Look.

551
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:04,519
"Strange Edukators...

552
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,900
Nasty surprise for Berlin family,

553
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:08,830
upon return from vacation,

554
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,845
Perpetrators
had broken into their villa.

555
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,901
But nothing was stolen.

556
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:16,533
Only furniture
and valuables were moved.

557
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:20,286
Responsibility claimed
in a note signed: The Edukators.

558
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:25,136
Police still have no solid leads
to their identities".

559
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:27,703
Which paper?

560
00:55:27,966 --> 00:55:29,466
The Tagesanzeiger.

561
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:30,434
Super.

562
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,856
I got this for Jule.
Think she'll like it?

563
00:55:35,176 --> 00:55:36,675
It's perfect for her.

564
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,086
Wake up, man.

565
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:42,524
You seem out of it.

566
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:45,209
That must be Jule.

567
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:57,383
How are you?

568
00:55:57,384 --> 00:55:58,884
And you? Everything OK?

569
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:00,959
I have to tell you something.

570
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:04,539
Wait... I brought you something.

571
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:09,696
We have to talk.

572
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,591
I left my phone at the villa.

573
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:15,651
What? Really?

574
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,845
I'm pretty sure.
I know I had it in the car before.

575
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:22,324
- It's not in my bag anymore.
- Don't tell Peter.

576
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:25,018
Why not?

577
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:27,332
Just don't tell him anything.

578
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:29,898
Look.

579
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:31,504
Isn't it nice?

580
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:33,006
Try it on.

581
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,192
He really needs a chick.

582
00:57:11,924 --> 00:57:13,424
I'm sure that would help.

583
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:18,074
Really.

584
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:22,807
Jan, see her?
She's been checking you out.

585
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,108
Isn't she sweet?

586
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:27,822
Is she sweet or what?

587
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,799
So ask her to dance.

588
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:32,798
Leave him alone.

589
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,702
Want me to ask for you?

590
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:37,329
I'll ask her.

591
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,690
Sleep well.

592
00:57:51,274 --> 00:57:52,774
- You, too.
- Bye.

593
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:07,402
I'm going for a walk.
I need some air.

594
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,796
Come in, man. Let's have a drink.

595
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,735
Put your oxygen on.

596
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,560
Not today.

597
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,467
I'll stay out for a while.

598
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,628
I'm off to bed.

599
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,061
Let's get out here.

600
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,286
I have a bad feeling.

601
00:58:45,497 --> 00:58:46,997
We need to find your phone.

602
00:58:48,516 --> 00:58:51,780
But maybe they already saw
the hole in the window.

603
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,652
What would you tell the cops?

604
00:58:54,612 --> 00:58:56,111
Hardenberg know you.

605
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,446
Jan, please.

606
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:59,032
No. We have to go back in.

607
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:01,701
Want to go to jail?

608
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:18,292
It’s not here.

609
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:20,685
Where was the jacket?

610
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:24,728
- And?
- No.

611
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,940
Let's try calling it.

612
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,558
It's on voice mail.
I should've known.

613
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,466
I'll go upstairs.
I have to get rid of fingerprints.

614
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:08,504
- Hurry!
- I'll be right back.

615
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:33,151
I just arrived.

616
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:37,080
Where? Home, of course!

617
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:44,598
Rita, I didn't drive 700 km
at night to...

618
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,856
I already told you.

619
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:53,657
Gerling says he needs me.
What could I do?

620
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,329
Like I told you,
in 3 days if all goes well.

621
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:01,210
Shit!

622
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,507
Theresa left the bathroom light
on again.

623
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:14,543
Me too.

624
01:01:15,377 --> 01:01:16,877
Say hi to the kids.

625
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:19,159
Take care, bye.

626
01:01:35,185 --> 01:01:36,685
Found it!

627
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:39,701
What are you doing here?

628
01:01:48,377 --> 01:01:49,877
I know you...

629
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:53,177
Hold on!

630
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,610
Fucking shit!

631
01:02:30,016 --> 01:02:31,518
Is he alive?

632
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:43,012
Should we call the medics?

633
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:45,474
- No.
- Let's just go.

634
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:50,574
Did he see you?

635
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:53,225
Yes.

636
01:02:54,246 --> 01:02:55,566
Did he recognize you?

637
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:57,069
Of course.

638
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,320
Then we can't go.

639
01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:03,289
- Come on.
- We can't just go!

640
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:06,453
Think hard!

641
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,370
- What are we going to do?
- Fucking shit!

642
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:21,822
Not a clue!

643
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,261
Not a clue, man!

644
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,135
I don't know what to do!

645
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:38,878
I don't either!

646
01:03:42,649 --> 01:03:44,149
Call Peter.

647
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,630
No.

648
01:03:47,876 --> 01:03:49,376
Why not?

649
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:52,843
Because, no.

650
01:03:53,555 --> 01:03:55,055
But why not?

651
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:05,671
You call him. I can't.

652
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:08,494
- What?
- Just call him!

653
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:14,245
It can't be...

654
01:04:22,837 --> 01:04:24,337
This is Jule.

655
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:26,769
Jan and I are in big shit.

656
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,114
We need your help.

657
01:04:29,593 --> 01:04:31,093
Please come right away.

658
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:48,823
Is this necessary?

659
01:04:48,824 --> 01:04:51,805
Just run away.
The police don't have to know.

660
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:54,809
I won't say anything.

661
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,763
Maybe he won't talk.
Let's just go.

662
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,618
Are you crazy?

663
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,363
That guy lies all day long!

664
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:15,647
Shit! He dialed the cops.

665
01:05:16,018 --> 01:05:17,518
Did the call go through?

666
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,480
We have to go.

667
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:22,139
- But we...
- We're out of time, OK?

668
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,775
He is coming with us.

669
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:27,298
Can't we come to a solution?

670
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,081
Shut up!

671
01:05:29,923 --> 01:05:31,851
I won't be a kidnapper!

672
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,625
You can't pull out now!

673
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:37,466
The cops are coming.
We'll take him and decide later.

674
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:39,185
End of discussion.

675
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,397
This is crazy!
