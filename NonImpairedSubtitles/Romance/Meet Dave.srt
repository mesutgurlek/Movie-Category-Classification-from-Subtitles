1
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,480
Dude, dude, no, I was, like,
"Yes, we do have nuclear missiles."

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,240
And he was all, like, "No, you don't."

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,080
And I was all, like,
"Yes, we do. Whatever."

4
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,320
And then I was, like,
"Well, what part of 'whatever'

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
"do you not get?"

6
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,120
Josh? Josh?

7
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,640
Hey! How many times have I told
you kids not to play ball in this alley?

8
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
- Mom!
- Are you all right?

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm fine. It wasn't a baseball.
There was this thing!

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,760
It came from space! It almost hit me!

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,240
- A thing came from space?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,520
You have the biggest imagination, mister.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
- But...
- Come here.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,400
- I'm glad you're all right.
- But...

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
No buts.
It's time to get ready for bed, please.

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Here. And don't walk over there
until I pick up that glass, okay?

17
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
Awesome.

18
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Knox. Dooley.

19
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,640
Got a report on some kind of fireball
or something like that

20
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,400
over on Liberty Island. Check it out.

21
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,240
No way. A fireball. Cool.
We'll get right on it.

22
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
Sarge, can't you get
somebody else to handle it?

23
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,000
- Come on, we just pulled an all-nighter.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox. Tell you what.

24
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
Lay down in my office,
and then I'll come by with your blankie,

25
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,080
and you can get yourself a nice nap.

26
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,200
Come on, it's gonna be great. A fireball?
How often do we get a call like that?

27
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Do me a favor, okay?
Act like a cop and stop caring.

28
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, my God.

29
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,760
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you all right?

30
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
Hello? Please don't be dead!

31
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, did you see that?
He came out of nowhere!

32
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,360
It kind of looked
like you sped up to hit him.

33
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,080
I was going for the parking spot!
Oh, my God.

34
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,600
Oh, Jesus!

35
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Are you all right?

36
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,280
Are you okay? Hello?
Please say something.

37
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Oh, my God, his foot!
I'll call an ambulance!

38
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Oh, God.
Please stay alive, please stay alive,

39
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,440
please stay alive, please stay alive.
This is such bad karma from...

40
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

41
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
Mr. Guy?

42
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,560
- This will take some time.
- Copy that.

43
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
<i>All clear.</i>

44
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Repairs underway, sir.

45
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
Damage report.

46
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Right Arm, all well.

47
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
Left Arm, ready.

48
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,480
<i>- Casualties, Doctor?</i>
- Abrasions, contusions.

49
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,640
Nothing significant, Captain.

50
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
<i>Engineering?</i>

51
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,960
Running diagnostics, sir.

52
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,120
<i>Lieutenant Buttocks, what is your status?</i>

53
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,280
Captain, we had a small gas leak.
It was silent, but not deadly.

54
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Well, crew, it seems
our ship has survived the impact.

55
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
<i>Actually, diagnostics</i>
<i>are not encouraging, Captain.</i>

56
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,760
This collision was unexpected,
so our impact shields weren't activated.

57
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,440
<i>How long can we operate at full capacity?</i>

58
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,720
Forty-eight Earth hours at most.
After that, system functions will fail.

59
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,640
- And our tracking computer?
<i>- Down, sir.</i>

60
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,320
That means we only have
the last known coordinates of the orb.

61
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,600
It can be anywhere within 10,000
square meters of our current location.

62
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,920
No. 2, Options?

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
We could continue on the mission, sir,
but it's extremely risky.

64
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,440
The prudent course would be
to return to our home planet, Nil,

65
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
and repair the ship.

66
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,040
Assemble the crew.

67
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,000
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for
an address by your esteemed captain!

68
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,120
This is it.

69
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
This is the moment
that we've all been training for.

70
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
We all know what's at stake.

71
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,200
Our planet is on the verge
of a catastrophic energy crisis.

72
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,080
The device we sent to this world
to drain its oceans

73
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,400
has been knocked off course
and is lost somewhere in this city.

74
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,280
Once it is found and deployed,
the salt from this world

75
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,200
shall power our home world
for ages to come.

76
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,440
<i>Without it, our people</i>
<i>will perish in less than one generation.</i>

77
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
I will not permit that to happen.

78
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
We must succeed.

79
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,360
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

80
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
- For Nil.
- For Nil.

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
Back to your posts.

82
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,000
No. 3.

83
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,680
Do we have sufficient
linguistic information

84
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,040
to help communicate with these natives?

85
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Yes. I tapped into their central
planetary databank, named "Google."

86
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
What a frivolous name
for such a vital function.

87
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,840
Well, if you prefer,
there's another called "Yahoo!"

88
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,640
Baffling.

89
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
- What about...
- Cultural and historical references?

90
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
- Already on it, Captain.
- Good.

91
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,840
- No. 4, is security prepared?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,080
My team can handle any threat
posed by these gargantuan savages.

93
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
- Good.
- Initial reports confirm

94
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,320
that draining this planet's oceans

95
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,520
would have
a catastrophic effect on existing life.

96
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,960
We have orders, No. 3.
Our entire home world is depending on us.

97
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,680
Agreed.

98
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
We should not lament
the fates of these inferior creatures.

99
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,880
If the orb has fallen into their hands,

100
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,480
who knows for what nefarious purpose
they could be using it

101
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
at this very moment?

102
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Mom, there's a drunk guy
in the alley again!

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
- That's him.
- Who?

104
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,040
- The guy I just hit with my car.
- You're kidding. Again?

105
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,440
Oh, I barely clipped that other guy.

106
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
Sir, coronal gas readings just spiked.

107
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,680
- The orb must be nearby.
<i>- Hello?</i>

108
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,120
<i>Hello, sir, hi. Hello? Hi, there.</i>

109
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,600
<i>- Hello, sir? Hi, are you all right?</i>
- Contact, everyone!

110
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
<i>- Because you just ran off.</i>
- No. 17.

111
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,840
<i>- Return to the ship.</i>
- Copy.

112
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm worried. I really feel terrible
about what just happened.

113
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
Can I call you an ambulance or something?

114
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Any medical attention for... For your foot?

115
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
Your foot.

116
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
Our first verbal encounter.

117
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
Thank you for your concern.

118
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,480
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

119
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,840
It's way too high. More bass!

120
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,200
<i>Thank you for your concern.</i>

121
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
Level the frequency.

122
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm all better now.

123
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,520
How hard did you hit this guy?

124
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,960
It's time for you to go
to school before you're late, okay?

125
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
Mom...

126
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,360
See how she squeezes the smaller
one's skull despite his protests.

127
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,160
<i>- Stop! Stop!</i>
- Such brutality!

128
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,080
- Go on. Goodbye.
- Stop!

129
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,320
Hey, safety first. And if those boys
are after you, you tell me!

130
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,360
- I'm calling their parents.
- Okay.

131
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Would you like to come upstairs for
a glass of water, maybe? Anything?

132
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,400
I can help clean you up.

133
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
No, thank you. I am fine.

134
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,880
<i>I am in position.</i>

135
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Are you sure?

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,640
Okay, but, see, that's not fine.

137
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,480
So, maybe you should come upstairs,
or I can call an ambulance.

138
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,080
Sir, we cannot let her
contact the authorities.

139
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,800
Agreed. We will go in long enough
to put her mind at ease.

140
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, I will accompany you.
Thank you for your hospitality.

141
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
<i>Good.</i>

142
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,520
The thing about my car is,
you gotta pump the brakes.

143
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,840
I mean, I just got it back from the shop,

144
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
and I'm seriously considering
suing my mechanic,

145
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,520
because that was just crazy
about what happened.

146
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Oh, sorry, right here! Oh, sorry, right here.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
- Hey.
- Hey!

148
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
- How you doing?
- How are you?

149
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,800
Good. Good timing.
I got something for you.

150
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
Three tubes of cerulean blue.

151
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,440
- I just ran out.
<i>- Hi. Mark Rhodes.</i>

152
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,320
Why does he thrust his arm towards us?

153
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,520
Probably best to imitate him.

154
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,920
Hi. Mark Rhodes.

155
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
Lefty, huh? Hey.

156
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,080
<i>- All right.</i>
- All right.

157
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Okay.

158
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,320
- All right.
- All right.

159
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Okay.

160
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

161
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,040
- We're going right inside.
- All right, yeah.

162
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Okay, here you go.

163
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
Sorry about the mess.

164
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,520
You know, this is sort of
a workspace/home combo thingy, thing.

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,440
Right Arm. This is unacceptable.

166
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Sorry! The liquid shifts the equilibrium!

167
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,360
- I still seem to be a bit shaken up.
- Oh, crap.

168
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,240
- There, I feel much better now.
- Oh, good! That is great.

169
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,240
Great news. Good.

170
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,000
So then, you don't need to call
your lawyer, or anything crazy like that,

171
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,160
because that would be just pointless,
wouldn't it?

172
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Good. Oh, I'm Gina, by the way.

173
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,240
Gina Morrison.

174
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
And you are?

175
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Three?

176
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,000
This is a list of the most common
names on this planet.

177
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,640
My name is...

178
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
- Ming Chang.
- Ming Chang?

179
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,360
Sorry. Sorry, you just struck me
more like a Dave, or something.

180
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
Which happens to be my other name.

181
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Dave Ming Chang?

182
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Dave Ming Chang.

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,040
Dave Ming Chang. All right, well, Dave,

184
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,000
I feel just terrible about this whole thing,
and I was gonna have some breakfast.

185
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
Would you like to join me?

186
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
- No, I really have to be going now.
- Are you sure?

187
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,520
I mean, I sort of have a rule that,
when I hit somebody with my car,

188
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,840
I need to make them breakfast.

189
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
That was a joke.

190
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,680
So where are you from?
Do you live around here?

191
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes, of course. I am just a regular
person from right here on Earth,

192
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,320
just like you.

193
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
I just don't get out that much.

194
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,560
Yeah, judging from your suit,
I'd say since about 1978.

195
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,200
Note, all-white apparel is not
as standardized as we thought.

196
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,440
You late for a Bee Gees concert
or something?

197
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,720
The Bee Gees. Barry, Robin and Maurice,
the Brothers Gibb.

198
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,000
Winning ten Grammy awards
and selling over 100,000,000 records.

199
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
<i>Oh, you can tell by the way I use my walk</i>

200
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,280
<i>I'm a woman's man No time to talk</i>

201
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,560
<i>Stayin' alive</i>

202
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Wow. That's impressive
love for the Bee Gees, man.

203
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
You know? Foot in the mouth.

204
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,080
<i>Listen, do you mind</i>
<i>whipping these up for me?</i>

205
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,760
<i>That would be so great. Just a little help.</i>

206
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,160
I'm so used to making breakfast for Josh,
and all he wants is waffles.

207
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,960
Anyway, he's off to school now.

208
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah, I don't know,
he's got these bullies after him right now.

209
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
You don't have any kids, do you?

210
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,560
I mean, you don't really seem
like a kid person, but...

211
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,040
Anyway, I just, I try to be there for him,

212
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
but I don't really know
how to deal with it, you know.

213
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,960
I'm just doing the single mom thing,
and I'm so permissive of everything.

214
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,680
Oh, my God, I am talking your ear off.

215
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
- All is well.
- Okay, why don't you just take a seat?

216
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
And I can finish this.

217
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,840
Here, you like ketchup?

218
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,160
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,520
Refreshing. I feel much better now.

220
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,680
That's a new one.

221
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,520
Oh, that's our cat, Boris.
I hope you're not allergic.

222
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,280
Are you?

223
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,200
Cats. Here we go, sir.

224
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,120
Boris, what are you up to?

225
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
- Captain.
- Yes?

226
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes, my husband was
a captain with the Navy.

227
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,200
- I am a captain.
- Really? A captain of what?

228
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I am a captain of crunch.

229
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,920
- Where is your captain now?
- Frank died four years ago,

230
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,160
so it's just me and Josh now.

231
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,840
It's been rough sometimes,
but we're okay.

232
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,160
There is a strength to this one.

233
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,680
Captain, the orb!

234
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Where was this image captured?

235
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,680
<i>That's Josh at school, the science fair.</i>
<i>He always walks around with this thing.</i>

236
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,640
See, he thinks it fell from outer space.

237
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,640
- We must locate the boy.
- We're on it, sir.

238
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,480
729 East 44th Street.

239
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,200
I really have to be going now.
Thank you for the ketchup.

240
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Okay. You know,
the eggs are just another...

241
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,320
That's the closet.

242
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,960
Sorry about hitting you with my car.

243
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,680
A couple of frat punks get drunk,
miss the last ferry,

244
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,840
stick a rag in their bottle of Stoli,
and then, kaboom!

245
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,040
Suddenly, my morning roll in the hay
with Tracy gets canceled.

246
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,520
I think this is explosive residue.

247
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,760
Don't. Don't do this, Dooley.
I see you getting interested in this.

248
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,680
I see that wacko <i>X Files</i> gleam in your eye.

249
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,160
That might be the boy, there!
In that group of Earth children.

250
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
What structure is this?

251
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,400
It appears to be
some sort of shrine to technology.

252
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,840
This is the best they have to offer?
Their mini-computers are gigantic!

253
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,680
And a slamming home page
means more online buddies.

254
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,440
Dude, while you're waiting,
check these out.

255
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Awesome surround-sound headphones.
Seven ounces, left and right quad.

256
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,680
The sound will blow you away.

257
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,200
Is that insane?

258
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,040
It's like the subwoofers
are actually inside your head.

259
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,040
Damage reports coming in
from all parts of the ship, Captain!

260
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,600
Sir! Structural integrity weakening!

261
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,640
We have got to get out of here!

262
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
The sign clearly indicates, "Do not walk."

263
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,880
And yet, they keep walking
and walking and walking!

264
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,120
Apparently, chaos
is the order of the day here.

265
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Doctor,

266
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,800
is Two all right?

267
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,120
This is a big planet.

268
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,200
There might be contaminants
we've never encountered before.

269
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
I'll keep an eye on it.

270
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,680
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.

271
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
It's the ice cream man!

272
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,920
Ice cream man, over here!

273
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,120
- Ice cream!
- Hey, look, it's the Good Humor man!

274
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,120
It's this suit again!

275
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,160
How in Nil did we wind up
with this wardrobe debacle?

276
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
- We must have missed something.
- I can't see how, sir.

277
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,440
We carefully studied the only signal
ever intercepted from Earth.

278
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,240
<i>The plane! The plane!</i>

279
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,840
When we enter the boy's school,

280
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,680
we must not draw any
undue attention to ourselves.

281
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,040
Yes, we must rid ourselves
of this inappropriate attire

282
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
and replace it with clothing that is
the epitome of both hip and now.

283
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,400
Welcome to Old Navy!

284
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,880
- Any ideas?
- Likely a ritual greeting, sir.

285
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
Welcome to Old Navy!

286
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,840
- Welcome to Old Navy!
- Welcome to Old Navy!

287
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,640
Welcome to Old Navy!

288
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,240
Welcome to Old Navy!

289
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,960
Welcome to Old Navy.

290
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,000
Welcome to Old Navy!

291
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Welcome to Old Navy.

292
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,120
Can I help you find your size?

293
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,120
I am obviously
the same size as everyone else.

294
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,680
I just meant are you a small, or...

295
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,320
I believe he simply wants to know
the dimensions of your clothing.

296
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,480
Yes, you can help me find my size.

297
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,320
Welcome to Old Navy.

298
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,320
Crew, prepare for
an unrehearsed maneuver.

299
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
Come on!

300
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,600
- What the...
<i>- Sorry, sir! It won't happen again!</i>

301
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,160
I can help you if you'd...
How about I help you take that.

302
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Very...

303
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Yes, this is my size. Welcome to Old Navy!

304
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,960
Excuse me. Do you have a private chamber
where I can try on these garments?

305
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,560
Changing room back there behind hoodies.

306
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
Welcome to Old Navy.

307
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,600
Sir, we have arrived at the school.

308
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,640
This can't be right.

309
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,200
<i>One singular sensation</i>
<i>Every little step she takes</i>

310
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,720
Apologies, sir.

311
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,080
Apparently we are on West 44th Street.

312
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,840
<i>One smile</i>
<i>and suddenly nobody else will do</i>

313
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,920
Let's get out of here. Double-time.

314
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,800
- Hey!
- What do you got here, little freak?

315
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,080
- That's mine!
- What do you use it for, playing nerd-ball?

316
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,000
- Whatever it is, it's mine now.
- Give it back!

317
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,440
Or what?
You gonna tell your mommy again?

318
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
Can I help you?

319
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,840
I am here for the fifth-grade classroom.

320
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Okay, all right, you're very late,
but you're here, at least.

321
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,640
It's been a madhouse.
Half the teachers are out with the flu.

322
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to
throw you to the wolves.

323
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,880
Don't say a word. I will mess you up.

324
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,360
Josh Morrison.

325
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,800
What are you doing here?
Are you the sub?

326
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,120
You would know the sub, loser!

327
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,280
I don't know him!
My mom hit him with her van!

328
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,080
I am Dave Ming Chang, the sub.

329
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,480
What is your name?

330
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
- Smellmy.
- Smellmy what?

331
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,120
Smellmy Buttcrack.

332
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I am sure the other Buttcracks
would disapprove of your behavior.

333
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
You don't look like a teacher.

334
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,600
<i>I'm going to report you.</i>

335
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,560
- Vaporize the child at once!
- Delay that order.

336
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,880
I am indeed your temporary instructor,
which I shall prove to you now. Observe.

337
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
Let's teach them something simple,
shall we?

338
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
What the...

339
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,320
The unified field theory. The ultimate
pearl of wisdom in all of the universe.

340
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Now you are educated.

341
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,480
- What is your destination?
- I'm gonna sharpen my pencil.

342
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,400
Here, let me assist you.

343
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,080
- There.
- Thanks, I think.

344
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,080
Josh Morrison. Come with me.

345
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,640
What are you doing here?
You're not really the sub, are you?

346
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,160
You have something that is mine.

347
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960
It is a small spherical device,
2.7 inches in diameter.

348
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,600
How'd you hear about that?

349
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,120
And how can it be yours
if it came from outer space?

350
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,360
Are you an alien?

351
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
We've been compromised!

352
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm just messing with you.

353
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,120
That's very funny.
It's very important that I find it.

354
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,160
Do you know where it is?

355
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,360
Let me guess.
It's, like, top secret or something.

356
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,280
Yes. It is top secret or something.

357
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,360
Will you help us, I mean me, find it?

358
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,640
Look, I don't have it anymore.
This jerk took it.

359
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
Well, we have to get it back.

360
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,920
- Where is this jerk?
- His name is Rich.

361
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,400
Him and his buddies are
probably headed for the deli.

362
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,160
- Lead and I will follow.
- Okay, come on.

363
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,760
Such disturbing images.

364
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,080
- Rich isn't here.
- Do you know where Rich lives?

365
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,920
No, but sometimes
I run into him in the neighborhood.

366
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Everybody on the floor, now!

367
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,800
Empty the register and no one gets hurt.

368
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,640
This planet continues
to reveal its ugly nature.

369
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,360
It deserves its fate.

370
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,360
- I said, on the floor, now!
- I am already on the floor.

371
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
Gravity prevents me from floating off of it.

372
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,640
Get down now!

373
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
Big mistake, man.

374
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,680
Hey, you have forgotten your weapon!

375
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
Dave, wait!

376
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,800
<i>That was awesome! I mean, you</i>
<i>totally threw that guy across the room.</i>

377
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,520
I was very fortunate not to be injured.

378
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,320
And the gun.
No normal person could have done that.

379
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
Do you have, like,
superpowers or something?

380
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,200
Do you know
what would be very pleasant?

381
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,000
If we were to change
the subject of our conversation.

382
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,400
Did you see
last night's sports competition?

383
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,160
You see? There's another thing.
You talk so weird.

384
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,920
- Come on, tell me, what's your secret?
- I have no secret.

385
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,880
- Oh, yeah? Quick, where are you from?
- I am from right here in this city.

386
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,440
Where exactly? Give me an address.

387
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
The Statue of Liberty.

388
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
You live at the Statue of Liberty?

389
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,120
Yes, the Ming Changs have lived at the
Statue of Liberty for many generations.

390
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,920
Now, let us locate the orb.

391
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,800
Look, I don't know where Rich is now,
but tomorrow's my mom's birthday.

392
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,840
We're going to our neighborhood
street fair. Everybody goes.

393
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm sure he's gonna be there.

394
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,880
You know, if you want,
you could come with me and my mom.

395
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Sir, we can't wait until tomorrow.
Our power supply is dwindling.

396
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,240
This child is useless.
We must find the orb on our own.

397
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,800
I disagree. Without guidance,
we might not find it in time.

398
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,160
Contrary to expectations,
Josh has been quite helpful to us.

399
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
We will stick with him.

400
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
Man, you are awesome at this!

401
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,040
It's like you've got
super video-game powers, too.

402
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,120
- Are you sure you're not a superhero?
- Absolutely.

403
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,440
Fine, I give up. I'm just happy to be
able to play with somebody besides Mom.

404
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,400
Interacting with your mother
makes you unhappy?

405
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
Nah, I don't mean to complain. She tries.

406
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,800
It's just that Dad was a lot better.

407
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
You know, my dad was a hero in real life.

408
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,840
- He saved, like, a million people one time.
- That is impressive.

409
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,160
Yeah, we miss him. Especially Mom.

410
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,000
Now she spends all her time
smothering me.

411
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,320
- She cuts off your air supply?
- Josh, I'm home!

412
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,760
Oh, hey! What are you doing back here?

413
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
Some guys with a gun
tried to rob the store,

414
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,320
and Dave stopped them
and saved everyone!

415
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,440
- It was awesome!
- What? What gun?

416
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,640
- Mom, Mom.
- Are you all right?

417
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
Mom, I'm fine! It was so cool!
Dave just took them out.

418
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,160
Man, I wish I could do that.
But look at me.

419
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,080
I'm the smallest fifth-grader
in New York City.

420
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,120
- You are not small. You are a giant.
- Yeah, right.

421
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,880
Josh, the most powerful force
in all the universe

422
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
often comes from the smallest star.

423
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,360
Dave? Would you like to stay for supper?

424
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,880
Sir, the longer we're in their presence,
the greater the danger of exposure.

425
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,080
Yes, I will stay.

426
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,040
Good.

427
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,160
Although, if you thought
my driving was dangerous,

428
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,880
wait till you try my meatloaf.

429
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,920
Meat Loaf?

430
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,880
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

431
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,480
I'll tell you when I find it.

432
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,160
You know something, Dooley?
We gotta find you a new hobby.

433
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,720
Stevie, please just hold the insult.

434
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,800
Please.

435
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,840
Oh, I forgot today
was Arts and Crafts Day.

436
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,040
Dave, would you mind
helping me clear the table?

437
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,360
You know, don't worry about it.
I got it. I'm...

438
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,760
This is something I do all the time.

439
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm constantly dropping stuff.
Don't even worry about it.

440
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,680
<i>"Men Are from Mars,</i>
<i>Women Are from Venus. "

441
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah, that's my...

442
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,240
I would... My sister got that for me.
I would never...

443
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
She just thinks I need
to get back in the game, and...

444
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,400
Tell your sister there is no life on Mars!
Believe me.

445
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay.

446
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,880
This rendering. What is it?

447
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,640
That's just something I felt.

448
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,480
- You felt this.
- Yeah, I did.

449
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,920
I did. I don't really paint like that anymore.

450
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
And why not?

451
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,400
Well, things have changed.

452
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,720
And what is the feeling
demonstrated here?

453
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,280
Well, how does it make you feel?

454
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,400
Feel?

455
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,040
It makes me feel off-balance.

456
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,880
Off-balance, yeah.

457
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,320
That's... That's close.

458
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,240
I remember when I painted this,
I just felt love.

459
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,680
Huge and exciting and crazy,

460
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,640
just love.

461
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,720
How do you know when you feel love?

462
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,960
<i>Oh, I think when you feel love,</i>

463
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,760
you don't need to ask that question.

464
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,800
I see.

465
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,840
Time for me to exit into the night.

466
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,440
Okay.

467
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Well, thank you again
for being there for Josh today and...

468
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,120
And, yeah, I think tomorrow will be fun.
I'm glad you're coming with us.

469
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,120
So am I, Gina Morrison.

470
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay.

471
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,720
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night, Gina.

472
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,120
Do you mind if I rest here?

473
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
Sure.

474
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,400
This appears to be a safe port.
We'll join this urban camper.

475
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
You ain't crazy, are you?

476
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,960
The last guy was here,
he said he was from outer space.

477
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,080
What planet?

478
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,280
And the party continues.

479
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,800
Here. Here you go.
Gets a little chilly at night.

480
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,320
Did you see that?

481
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
This man has nothing,

482
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,680
yet he offers to share
his sole source of warmth.

483
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,880
Why?

484
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,400
It seems they are a more complex species
than we imagined.

485
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,280
- Yes?
- My findings are incomplete,

486
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,160
but I have noted more atypical behavior
spreading throughout the ship.

487
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
Is that so?

488
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,320
Well, I think we all just need
a good night's rest, Doctor.

489
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,640
- Dang!
- Excuse me?

490
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,000
Working rather late, No. 3.

491
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,760
I was just doing
some additional cultural research.

492
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,760
And what have you found?

493
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,080
I stumbled onto an interesting file
in the alien database, sir.

494
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,920
Every man, woman and child
is forced to view it once a year.

495
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,520
It could be helpful in understanding them.

496
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
Show me.

497
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,240
You have not changed
since our days at the Academy.

498
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,920
I remember the late nights
studying together.

499
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
And the nutritious protein squares
you prepared for us.

500
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,920
I would not have been able to graduate
without your help.

501
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,200
And, yet, here you've become
our generation's most renowned captain.

502
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,120
Yes.

503
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,120
Here it is.

504
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,440
<i>What is it you want, Mary?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

505
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,000
<i>You want the moon? Just say the word</i>

506
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,640
<i>and I'll throw a lasso around it</i>
<i>and pull it down.</i>

507
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,040
<i>Hey, that's a pretty good idea.</i>
<i>I'll give you the moon, Mary.</i>

508
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,080
<i>I'll take it.</i>

509
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,400
Lasso the moon?

510
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,160
- Physically impossible!
- Absurd.

511
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,640
- Good night, Captain.
- Yes, Three, good night.

512
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,200
I must say, sir,
these Earth creatures keep surprising me.

513
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,520
A most confusing place.
It makes my head spin.

514
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,920
I guess I'd better hold on, then.

515
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,960
I want to send this out
to every precinct, every security company

516
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,880
and every hospital in the city
until we ID this guy right here.

517
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,200
This is incredible. Just amazing.

518
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,400
Amazing that two idiots like you
could've passed the police exam.

519
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,520
- See? I tried to tell him, Sarge.
- Hold on.

520
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,840
It is a fact, a fact, that something
or someone has landed here.

521
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,880
Now, we could be making the biggest
scientific discovery of all time.

522
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,480
I don't want to hear another word
about E.T., Bigfoot or the Tooth Fairy,

523
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,640
unless they're jacking some old lady's car.

524
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,200
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

525
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,320
- That's good aim, Sarge.
- Shut up!

526
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,560
- Dooley. What are you doing?
- I'm sending it anyway, Knox.

527
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,920
No, it's just a guy
who shoved his face in the dirt.

528
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,680
No, wrong. It is an alien,

529
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,680
an alien who shoved his face in the dirt,
and I am gonna find him.

530
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,800
Power reserves at <i>20%,</i> sir.
That only gives us about 12 hours.

531
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,480
Then every minute counts.
Remember our mission, crew.

532
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,720
We must find the boy with the orb.
No distractions.

533
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,120
This is not acceptable!

534
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

535
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,000
<i>Chuck starts off fast out of the gate,</i>
<i>eating down those dogs,</i>

536
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,120
<i>but Earl and Homer are right behind him.</i>
<i>Look at them go! Look at them go!</i>

537
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,920
- Come on, Dave, eat!
- Dave, just put it in your mouth!

538
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
- What are you doing? Eat it!
- Just put one in your mouth, Dave!

539
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,440
- Put it in, come on, now!
- Dave! Dave, eat!

540
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,040
You never should have
signed him up for this.

541
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,440
- What are you doing, Dave? Eat!
- Eat it, Dave! Put it in your mouth!

542
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
Yeah, all right! Yeah! Yeah!

543
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,880
A little heads-up might be nice!

544
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,280
Hey! Can a brother
get some hot sauce with that?

545
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,520
Look at him go!

546
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,360
<i>Our champion!</i>
<i>Eighty-five delicious all-beef hot dogs!</i>

547
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,520
Yeah!

548
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,080
Yeah, boy! Yeah!

549
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,400
Well executed, Captain.

550
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,280
Dave, that was amazing!
You are a wiener-eating champ!

551
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
<i>And here's the grand prize.</i>

552
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,240
We're under attack!

553
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,920
It's the creature from Thanos 7!
Battle stations!

554
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,440
You have menaced us
for the last time, you beast!

555
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,800
It seems that this is
an inanimate creature.

556
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,920
At ease!

557
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,440
The question is, what are we expected
to do with this plush amphibian?

558
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,800
Give it to her, Captain.

559
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,760
The female. Give it to her.

560
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,320
Silly goose.

561
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,640
You are such a goofball.

562
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,480
For me? Thanks, Dave. That was...

563
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
That's very sweet.

564
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,480
<i>Red alert, Captain! Red alert!</i>

565
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,640
We need to dispose of the large quantity
of processed meat tubes!

566
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,560
Excuse me.

567
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,600
My colon is impacted.

568
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,320
Okay.

569
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,760
Show-off!

570
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,800
Excuse me! Excuse me, we met yesterday.

571
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,240
- Mark Rhodes.
- Mark Rhodes?

572
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,320
- Right. The left again.
- Yeah.

573
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,000
- So, you here by yourself?
- No, I am not.

574
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,040
I am accompanying Josh and Gina.

575
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,960
All evening we have been
screaming with fear and delight.

576
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,960
Look, you and I
should get something straight,

577
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,160
and I'm not trying to
step on your toes, here.

578
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,320
If you're serious about Gina,
then that's great,

579
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,120
because she deserves
a decent guy in her life,

580
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,760
but if I find out that you're just
trying to take advantage of her,

581
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,080
and you're using Josh to do it,

582
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,960
you and I
are gonna have a serious problem.

583
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,760
You understand what I'm saying?

584
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,240
Yes, I understand completely,
Mark Rhodes.

585
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,680
Does anyone here understand
what this man is talking about?

586
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,560
He's trying to discern if you intend
on becoming Gina's mate.

587
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,080
What an absurd notion!

588
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,880
I intend on becoming Gina's mate?
She's the size of our science pavilion.

589
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,320
These primitive creatures
and their silly speculations!

590
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,760
Wait! What's that?

591
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,080
- What do you want, midget?
- Rich, you gotta give me my rock back.

592
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Oh, really? Why?

593
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,440
Because it's really important
to me and my friend, Dave.

594
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,880
It's the jerk we seek!

595
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
Rich, you've gotta give me my rock back!

596
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,640
Boy, it's like
you're asking me to punch you!

597
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,280
So, Smellmy, we meet again.

598
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,560
Dave.

599
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,560
Stop! You're giving me a wedgie!

600
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,880
Stop! Please put me down, already!

601
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,920
Smellmy, are you crying
because you are sad

602
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,840
or because your undergarments are
lodged so cuttingly deep in your rectum?

603
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
I'm telling my mom.

604
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,200
Mom! Mom!

605
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,040
Dave, that was unbelievable! High-five!

606
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,840
They don't high-five where you're from?

607
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,440
- No, but they should.
- There you two are!

608
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
What kind of trouble you getting into?

609
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,640
Nothing. Dave was just about
to try out his pitching arm!

610
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,080
- Come on, Dave.
- Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

611
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,520
- You just gotta hit three. Here we go.
- Come on! Come on, come on!

612
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,280
Go, Dave! Go, Dave!

613
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,880
Sir, the orb is ours.
This charade is no longer necessary.

614
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,360
It's time to throw it in the ocean
and head home.

615
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,120
You're absolutely right, Two,

616
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,120
but I really think I can do this.

617
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,400
He looks very serious.

618
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,000
Looking good, looking good.
Come on, you can do it!

619
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,760
Here we go. He's gonna do it!

620
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,440
Wind up!

621
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,320
All right, well...

622
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,520
Spectacularly unsuccessful!
Why was my wrist so limp?

623
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,240
I was in the bathroom.

624
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,280
On my command.

625
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,640
- Come on, you can hit it.
- Two more. Come on.

626
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,280
Come on. Come on.

627
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,120
Fire!

628
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,280
Incoming!

629
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,240
Engineer, report!

630
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,280
All sensors are down and the sun shields
deployed upon impact.

631
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,200
Sir, we're blacked out.

632
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,600
The sun is exploding in my face!

633
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,320
I still haven't got a pulse.
Give me the paddles, stat.

634
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,520
- Oh, God. Don't watch.
- Clear!

635
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,160
Come on. Give me more juice.

636
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,400
Clear!

637
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,760
Power has been restored.

638
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,160
Oh, thank God!
Oh, God, is he gonna be okay?

639
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,400
We'll do an MRI just to be safe.

640
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,240
He's okay. He's okay.

641
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,280
How we doing? I have to warm it up first,

642
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,920
but just to double-check,
they took your keys, watch, coins?

643
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,800
- Yes.
- Good.

644
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,800
'Cause people always forget
the "M" in MRI stands for "magnetic."

645
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,200
This'll just take a second.

646
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,480
I guess I still have a few pennies.

647
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,920
I'm so sorry to have ruined your birthday.

648
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,400
Thanks for letting the cat out of the bag.

649
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,320
- Cat? Where's the cat?
- You know, it's okay,

650
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,480
because I'm not really
one for celebrating anyway.

651
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,200
Well, perhaps you will reconsider
and let us take you out for dinner.

652
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,680
Yeah.

653
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,960
Sir, with all due respect,
have you lost your mind?

654
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,640
They've helped us.
The least we can do is try to help them.

655
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,200
You have become a fool!

656
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,720
Treating these lumbering giants
as if they're our equals.

657
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,600
You've made a mockery
of our entire mission!

658
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,960
You get out of my face. Now!

659
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,000
<i>Dave?</i>

660
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,680
<i>Dave? Hello?</i>

661
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,240
- Right here.
<i>- Hey, where'd you go?</i>

662
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,840
I am here.

663
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,680
I'm so curious sometimes,
what's going on in that head of yours.

664
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,920
I was just pondering which would be
the best place to take you

665
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,280
to commemorate your birthday.

666
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,640
Josh, do you have any suggestions?
Perhaps a nice Cuban place?

667
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,680
I know a great salsa restaurant.

668
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,400
All right, well, <i>s, amigos,</i> let's go party.

669
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Everyone! We're going to go and party!

670
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,080
Okay, three mojitos, one virgin.

671
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,440
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

672
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

673
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,440
- Thank you.
- There you go. You enjoy.

674
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,720
- Cheers.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

675
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,360
Thank you.

676
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,040
Now, careful.
These go straight to your head.

677
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,280
This is not acceptable!

678
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,720
Slow down, cowboy.

679
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,960
This is the best!

680
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,440
Cougar46 just added me as a friend.

681
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,960
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

682
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,560
He walked out about an hour ago
with a nice-looking lady and a kid.

683
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,600
- Oh, really? Nice-looking? She pretty hot?
- Please! Please.

684
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,880
- You sure it's him?
- Absolutely.

685
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,120
Said they were going
to a Cuban salsa place.

686
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,240
You gotta try this.

687
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,080
It's like space travel, only in your head.

688
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:07,640
I've been having strange feelings
since we've arrived on this planet.

689
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,040
- It seems you are, too?
- Absolutely not.

690
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,000
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm recalibrating our weapon systems.

691
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,200
Just a second.

692
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,040
Exactly what weapon
are you recalibrating?

693
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,080
Okay, let's talk.

694
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,960
I'm feeling a little busted.

695
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,960
You know, pretty soon
you're gonna be too old

696
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,240
to dance with your mom.

697
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,920
Excuse me while I run to the restroom.

698
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,920
Josh.

699
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,920
I will be going home soon.

700
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,880
What is the matter with you?

701
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,160
When you're gone, everything's just
gonna go back to the way it was.

702
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,200
I'm not like other kids.

703
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,480
I can't even fight for myself.

704
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,160
My dad was a hero.

705
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,840
But me?

706
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm just different.

707
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,560
Josh, listen to me.

708
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,600
We would never have been able
to find the orb without you.

709
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,800
Not everyone would have helped us,
but you did.

710
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,200
Because you are different.

711
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,880
I am very lucky to have a friend like you.

712
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,480
- You're just saying that.
- No, I am not.

713
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,200
You have helped us greatly.
We are all in great debt to you.

714
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,560
I did?

715
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,800
Yes. We are saved, Josh.

716
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,040
She thinks she's so hot. She's not hot.
Have you seen her butt?

717
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,440
- It's like the size of our moon.
- You are so bad.

718
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,280
Bad and gorgeous!

719
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,040
Okay, another one. I took the liberty.

720
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,640
I love this song.

721
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,880
Need anything, Captain?

722
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,000
Yes, I may need
some music references for...

723
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,440
<i>Dave, will you do me the honor?</i>

724
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,880
<i>Come on!</i>

725
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,560
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

726
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,840
Yes, yes, I would,
I'd love to dance with you.

727
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,800
<i>You're gonna love it!</i>

728
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,760
Here, it's really easy.
Just let the music take you.

729
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,680
All hands, stay alert,
and obey my commands to the letter.

730
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,440
- Captain, might I have a word?
- Make it brief.

731
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,520
There are emotional dangers
on this planet we did not foresee.

732
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,680
We are on the brink of anarchy.

733
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,680
Not now.
I'm trying to let the music take me!

734
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,960
All right, crew, everyone,
let's get it together, now!

735
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,480
All together!

736
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,240
Precision!

737
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
Right foot! Left foot!

738
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,360
Okay. Here, just follow my lead.

739
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,240
We should be fulfilling our mission,
trying to save our planet,

740
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:26,080
not leaping around like some sort of idiot,
attempting to woo a gigantic strumpet!

741
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,000
This captain has become a joke.

742
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,440
This is over the line, sir.
The Captain still deserves our respect.

743
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,360
<i>Shake my hips like this! More hips! Hips!</i>

744
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,680
<i>Yes, that's it! More hips!</i>
<i>Look, I'm dancing!</i>

745
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,400
All right, I'm in.

746
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,280
The dancing stops now.

747
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,280
Here, here. Hand here. Okay?

748
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,160
I need more wiggle in the posterior region!

749
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,040
Captain, if I may?

750
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,520
You think that you can do better?

751
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,680
Nothing personal, sir,
but that won't be hard.

752
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,240
Take charge.

753
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,240
Okay, boys and girls, everybody listen up!

754
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,240
You're gonna give me a basic,

755
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,480
stepping forward with the left
and back with the right.

756
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,480
Don't bounce, and do not over think it.

757
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,320
We're gonna put your accoutrements
right up against her.

758
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,720
Drop down.

759
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,360
This is salsa, people. Let's make it spicy!

760
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,640
Follow me!

761
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,280
I knew you were holding out on me.

762
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,760
Come on, come on, girl.

763
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,040
I'm about to show you
how to do the forbidden dance.

764
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,720
It's my birthday!

765
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,600
And dip her, like a cookie in milk.

766
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,440
I feel good. I feel loose.

767
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,800
I feel good. I feel loose. I feel good.

768
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
Hey!

769
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,360
Freeze!

770
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,320
- Everybody, stay calm.
- Hands up. Hands up!

771
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,720
Should we power up blasters?

772
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,400
No.

773
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,080
Too many innocent civilians.

774
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,280
Easy, folks, easy.

775
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,200
- Step back, please.
- Dave?

776
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,320
Hey, welcome to Earth.

777
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,040
Greetings.

778
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,760
We don't want to hurt you.

779
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,280
We don't want to hurt you.

780
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,200
We're you're friends.

781
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,880
All we want to know
is why you've come down to our planet.

782
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,320
Oh, for God sake.

783
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,960
Stay calm. They can't prove anything.

784
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,080
<i>What is your purpose here?</i>

785
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,560
What is your purpose here?

786
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,520
- The mystery is what your purpose here is.
- Okay, you know what?

787
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,960
I'm trying to do a thing, and you're not
helping me out, so please stop.

788
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,560
Greetings!

789
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,080
No. 2, what are you doing?

790
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,760
- You can't do this, Two.
- Excuse me?

791
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,200
We're playing
by my rules now, Ex-Captain!

792
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,680
Seize him!

793
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,400
- You cannot do this, No. 2!
- Can, and will.

794
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,880
- You brought this on yourself.
- What are we supposed to do?

795
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,640
You do what you took an oath to do
and protect me, your captain, Four.

796
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,000
Stay back, Four.
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

797
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,080
You'll never get away with this, Two.
The rest of the crew will not support you!

798
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,280
Oh, yes, they will.
Because they have a mission to complete.

799
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,680
Three, you're supporting this?

800
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,360
Yes, I see no other way.

801
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,560
That's because there is no other way.

802
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,680
Whoa, who left the speaker on?

803
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,160
Shut that off!

804
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,520
Officer Dooley, can I speak to you outside?
Just for a minute.

805
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,360
You will regret this.
Something has been awakened in all of us.

806
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,360
Something you will never be able to stop.

807
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,280
Looks like I just did.
Confine him to his quarters!

808
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,040
Attention, crew! As of this moment,

809
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,880
un-Nilian behavior
will no longer be permitted.

810
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,680
In fact, it will be punished.

811
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,120
Severely.

812
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,200
A new era has begun,
with me as your leader.

813
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,560
You know,
we just met him a couple days ago,

814
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,360
- like I've said five times.
- Hey.

815
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,840
- Hey!
- You guys all right?

816
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,480
Yes. It's been a long night.

817
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,720
- What do they want with him?
- I don't know.

818
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,960
He didn't do anything wrong!

819
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,960
Stand and engage blasters!

820
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,280
Sir?

821
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,000
I gave you an order.

822
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,680
Yes, sir.

823
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,800
- Did you not just hear those voices?
- Yes, I heard the voices.

824
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,400
Wow, we got a nutjob living
in New York City. What are the odds?

825
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,960
So what are you saying?
We should just let him go?

826
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,120
Yes, I think we should let him go!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

827
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,000
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my entire life!

828
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,680
Hey!

829
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,680
Activate heat shields.

830
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,440
- Freeze!
- Look out!

831
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,960
This guy's crazy!
Somebody about to get killed!

832
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,560
I'm out! Son of a...

833
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,280
Take cover!

834
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,440
You, woman and child,

835
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,000
you have wasted enough time
with your pathetic emotional distractions.

836
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,440
Dave?

837
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,400
<i>Your undisciplined human frailty</i>
<i>causes nothing but chaos!</i>

838
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,680
And one other thing,
your so-called artwork

839
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,120
is both pretentious and sophomoric.

840
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,880
I could do this all day.

841
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,320
Freeze!

842
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,880
Three, find me the fastest route
to the landing site.

843
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,400
Three, I...

844
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,000
Guards!

845
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,200
No. 12! Have you been working out?

846
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,840
You can tell?

847
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,080
No.

848
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,640
Yes.

849
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,920
- Thank you, Three.
- I didn't do this to help you.

850
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,800
I did this to stop that lunatic!

851
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,920
- What have I done to hurt you so?
- You really can't be that oblivious!

852
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,280
Listen to me. Whatever I have
done to hurt you, I apologize,

853
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,720
but right now we have to
get to the engine room

854
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,960
- and shut down the ship!
- Fine! Let's just go.

855
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,160
What in Nil is your problem?

856
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,760
Are you all right, Josh?

857
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,240
Mom, I'm fine, but something's wrong.
That can't be Dave!

858
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,520
You have to trust me.
We need to go after him.

859
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,120
No, Josh, we're not doing that.

860
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,200
- I know you want to protect me.
- Of course.

861
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,280
But Dave is my friend,
and I need to protect him right now.

862
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,240
- Josh.
- If we don't help him,

863
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,640
something terrible's gonna happen.
I know it!

864
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,960
I was just making conversation to ease
the apparent tension between us.

865
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,120
- Don't. You're making it worse.
- You know what...

866
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,520
No. 3, didn't take you long to betray me.

867
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,240
This is not the answer, Two!

868
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,000
You weren't Nilian enough
to do your duty,

869
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,960
- so you left me no choice.
- Listen to reason.

870
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,440
We thought that Earth was not
worth preserving. We were wrong.

871
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,960
There's much we've learned
from this place.

872
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,120
- We must not hurt these people!
- Yes, we must!

873
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:44,000
And since you two seem to love
these gargantuan beasts so much,

874
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,120
have fun living among them.

875
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,880
I have a little tickle in my nose.

876
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,080
- Follow me!
- No, follow me!

877
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,400
Three, I'm so sorry
that you're out here with me.

878
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,120
Not half as sorry as I am!

879
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,600
Please, we'll have the entire
journey back home to argue.

880
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,840
- This may not be the best spot, sir.
- And why not?

881
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,480
Mother of Nil!

882
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,080
Three!

883
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,000
- I'm coming, Three. Don't move.
- Great advice, Captain.

884
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,880
Because I can't!

885
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,880
- Are you all right, Three?
- Please! You have no concern for me.

886
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,160
All you care about is Gina,
your big, fat girlfriend!

887
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,160
You think that she's fat?

888
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,960
If she wears a size infinity,

889
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,440
then she's fat!

890
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,880
It takes me almost getting run over
for you to even notice me!

891
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,320
I'm practically invisible to you!

892
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,680
Invisible? Quite the opposite.
When I look at you, what I see is

893
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,000
the ship!

894
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,880
I love New York. Let's go!

895
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,440
Trust me, Three. Jump!

896
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,120
It's working!

897
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,040
You see? Just as I planned!

898
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,080
Look, if we let go
at precisely the right moment,

899
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,600
we'll be propelled to the ship.

900
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,680
On three.

901
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,840
One, two, three!

902
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,160
Three.

903
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,000
I asked for you
to be assigned to this mission

904
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,320
because you are kind,
intelligent and beautiful,

905
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,400
more so than anyone
I've ever known in my life.

906
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,640
And without you,

907
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,960
I would be nothing.

908
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,000
Why have you never
spoken to me of this before?

909
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,320
Because I was too Nilian to express it.

910
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,640
I should have lassoed the moon
for you long ago.

911
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,840
But now let's turn the ship around.

912
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,800
We'll never get there at this rate.
Give me full power to the legs!

913
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,880
<i>I told you. Our power is nearly depleted.</i>

914
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,280
Crew, prepare to hail a cab!

915
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,760
Taxi!

916
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,280
What? An alien cannot
get a cab in this town?

917
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,280
Hey, buddy! This is my cab!
What are you doing?

918
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,760
Liberty Island Ferry. Make haste or die.

919
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,440
Yes, every available cop in the city,
and the Feds.

920
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,720
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it!
I knew we were not alone in this universe.

921
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,240
- Look, I'm not convinced he's an alien.
- Oh, you're not?

922
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,800
- So what?
- So what? So, who you calling?

923
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,480
- Homeland Security.
- Don't do that.

924
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,680
They're gonna overreact!
We don't even know why he's visiting yet.

925
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,320
Well, it's obviously not a peace mission!

926
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,760
Get those big slobbery lips away from me!

927
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,760
And while you suckers
are sitting here talking,

928
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,680
he about to go suck your planet dry!

929
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,000
I need somebody
from Homeland Security, please.

930
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,840
I don't have the extension.

931
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,280
- Are you with Dave?
- No.

932
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,960
No, no. I come free with a venti latte.

933
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,560
Of course I'm with Dave, stupid!

934
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,480
- I need... Hey, you got a comment?
- No.

935
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,040
I need the extension from you guys
because I don't have it.

936
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,440
- Do you know where he went?
- Yes, I do.

937
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,320
I need a ride, though.

938
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,480
- Okay.
- Well, what you waiting for?

939
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,960
Okay.

940
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,680
Wait, wait, wait.

941
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,560
Don't be shaking me.

942
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,360
Sorry. I apologize.

943
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,080
Don't be blowing on me!
I don't know you that well!

944
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,800
Slow down. Slow. Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, I said slow down now!

945
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,280
Wait, it's dark in here. I'm in.

946
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,680
Please, hurry. Dooley, where you going?

947
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,400
Hey, Sarge, you got
a little schmutz right here.

948
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,720
Shut up!

949
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,800
- How many tickets you got?
- I've never been caught speeding.

950
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,480
In New York.

951
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,880
This year.

952
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,640
Long live Nil.

953
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,200
Sorry, Earth. Sometimes No. 2 happens!

954
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,720
Captain! Thank goodness you're back.

955
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,320
No. 2's become a raging lunatic.

956
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,800
Not to worry, kind friend.
I'm back, and I'm taking over.

957
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,240
<i>Welcome, Captain.</i>

958
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,680
<i>Right Arm!</i>

959
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,160
- What the devil is this?
<i>- Someone's overriding the system!</i>

960
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,960
Only the Captain has the code to...

961
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,680
The Captain!

962
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,760
You are in my chair!

963
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,640
Guards!

964
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,720
- Put down your weapons.
- Seize him!

965
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,240
Guards, I said seize him!
You've seen what a fool he's been!

966
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:07,880
We all know I am the only one
qualified to get us home.

967
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,960
Is this what you want? This chaos?

968
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,440
We choose our Captain.

969
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,560
This planet rocks. Deal with it.

970
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,080
Get out of my chair.

971
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,760
Captain, the orb is in the water.

972
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,280
The siphoning process
is getting stronger by the minute.

973
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,280
Right Arm, summon the orb.

974
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,280
Captain, the fight
drained our power below 1 <i>%.</i>

975
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,960
I can re-route booster energy,
but there won't be enough for take-off.

976
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,520
Well, Captain, it seems you have a choice.

977
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,440
Save this planet or save yourself.

978
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,680
I choose this planet.

979
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,200
And what of your beloved crew?

980
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,440
Are you willing
to condemn them to the same fate?

981
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,840
Stranded here in a world of behemoths?

982
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,960
I believe it is the right thing to do,

983
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,040
but I cannot
make this decision for all of you.

984
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,880
I say we save Earth.

985
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,400
And its moon.

986
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,120
My life began on this planet.

987
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,280
I no longer feel like No. 3.

988
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,240
I am Dave Ming Chang.

989
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,720
<i>I have 443 new friends on MySpace</i>

990
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,000
and a JDate next week
with a woman named Sheila Moskowitz.

991
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,960
I am Dave Ming Chang.

992
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,600
I am Dave Ming Chang.

993
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,600
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

994
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,200
- I am Dave Ming Chang.
- I am Dave Ming Chang.

995
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,320
I am Johnny Dazzles, and I am fabulous!

996
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,240
What? Not everybody
has to be Dave Ming Chang.

997
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,600
You've all gone completely mad!

998
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,160
Take him and put him

999
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,800
in my butt.

1000
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,160
Engineer, divert all remaining power
to Right Arm.

1001
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,800
- Way to go, Right Arm!
<i>- Yes!</i>

1002
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,680
Dave! Are you okay?

1003
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,680
Dave! What is happening?
How can we help you?

1004
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,480
Thank you, but it is too late.

1005
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,360
We are out of power.

1006
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,040
We'll never get back now. It is over.

1007
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,760
Hands behind your head! Understand?
Step away from that thing!

1008
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,040
- No!
- Hey! Let us handle this, folks, okay?

1009
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,000
You don't need your guns, all right?
Don't hurt him!

1010
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,560
We're not gonna hurt anybody.

1011
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,520
- We're just gonna talk.
- Dooley, enough!

1012
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,280
You've seen what that thing can do.
Hands behind your head!

1013
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,000
<i>Captain, with no shield and no power,</i>

1014
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,200
<i>the projectile from his weapon</i>
<i>will breach the hull.</i>

1015
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,880
We'll take casualties.

1016
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,480
He can't move!
He doesn't have any power left!

1017
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,880
- Hands behind your head!
- He can't move!

1018
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,000
- Josh!
- Kid!

1019
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,400
Josh!

1020
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,840
We have power. We have been saved.

1021
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,560
All hail Josh the hero!

1022
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,960
Stay right where you are!

1023
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,200
Yeah, if you're trying to freak me out,
it's not gonna work.

1024
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,600
All right, that's gonna freak me out a little.
Do you see that?

1025
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,880
- I do.
- Is that a guy?

1026
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,400
- Looks like it.
- Like a really little guy?

1027
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,240
- Like a really little guy.
- On his tongue?

1028
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,320
What'd I just say?

1029
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,640
- Hello.
- You, you see that, right?

1030
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,400
- There's a little guy in there?
- He's talking.

1031
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,840
- Yeah.
- Dave.

1032
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,360
I apologize to all of you.

1033
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,920
It was my second-in-command
who took control of my ship by force,

1034
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,760
and it was he, not I, who performed
these unspeakable acts of cruelty.

1035
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,360
Will you put that thing down?
Would you please?

1036
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,520
I mean, the guy's an inch tall.
You look like a wuss. Right?

1037
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,480
Josh, my friend.
You helped save two worlds today.

1038
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,120
And you taught me the true meaning
of friendship and courage.

1039
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,680
Your father would have been proud
of his young captain.

1040
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,680
Promise me you'll always take pride
in being different.

1041
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,440
- I promise.
- High-five.

1042
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,120
Perhaps that's not such a great idea.

1043
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,280
- Gina.
- Yeah. Yeah, hi.

1044
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,520
You're, you're really tiny.

1045
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,000
And I should have known
you were an alien,

1046
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,000
because no straight man
is that good a dancer.

1047
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,680
I think I'm finally able to understand
how your painting makes me feel.

1048
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,680
I feel love.

1049
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,480
- Okay, I guess she's not that fat.
- Told you.

1050
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,640
Hey! Hey, man!
Hey, don't forget about me!

1051
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,920
Yeah! I'm not trying to stay in here!

1052
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,560
You squeezing my brain!

1053
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,800
- You're gonna make it pop! Stop!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1054
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Hey, slow down.
I don't want you messing up my sexy.

1055
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,200
Okay. Easy.
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

1056
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,880
Okay.

1057
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,680
Hey! Yeah. Yeah, that, that look good.

1058
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,120
Time for us to go home.

1059
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,120
- I'll miss you, Dave.
- And I you.

1060
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,240
Remember, I'll never be that far away,

1061
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,360
good friend.

1062
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,480
A little room, please.

1063
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,240
What? No!

1064
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,040
Dave!

1065
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,080
- FBI!
- Out of the way!

1066
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,640
Move, move, move!

1067
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,840
- No!
- Hey, what is going on?

1068
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,880
Mom, look!

1069
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,760
He's okay.

1070
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,480
I didn't think we'd make it out of there.

1071
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,280
Good thing you have
such big feet, Captain.

1072
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,760
We'll have much to explain
when we return home.

1073
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,280
We'll find another way to save Nil.

1074
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,280
There are plenty of worlds out there
for us to explore.

1075
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,960
Yes, No. 3.

1076
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,240
But what we learned on Earth

1077
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,160
is more valuable
than all the salt in the galaxy.

1078
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,440
And when we do return,
it looks like I'll be needing a new No. 2.

1079
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,240
I think you'll be needing more than that.

1080
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,960
Yeah, Captain!
Get in there, Captain!

1081
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,640
Cue the new anthem.

1082
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,200
