00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:13,776
<i>(Jack): Previously on
The Pillars of the Earth:</i>

2
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,883
<i>Stephen's army
has us surrounded.</i>

3
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,081
We've been besieged for weeks.

4
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,799
I'm Tom Builder.
We'd like to repair your church.

5
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,339
We'll quarry this stone
to build our new cathedral.

6
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,209
<i>When my chisel
hits the rock,</i>

7
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,357
it's a song of what will be.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,392
<i>Kingsbridge gets
the rents, the tolls.</i>

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,679
It gets the taxes,
the business.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,383
As of next month,
the market moves to Shiring.

11
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:37,702
Pray with me.

12
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,068
<i>That boy with red hair,</i>

13
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:40,514
I want him dead by morning.

14
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:42,330
(Grunting)

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,892
He can't be dead.

16
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:49,120
(Roaring, horse neighing)

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,644
They've captured the king.

18
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:53,175
I claim you as my prisoner.

19
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,097
- Your brother's been taken.
- Oh God!

20
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:58,306
Your king lies in a dungeon
to be hanged tomorrow.

21
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,011
Why shouldn't you hang
with him?

22
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,278
All you have to say is
that you betrayed Bartholomew.

23
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:04,055
(Screaming)

24
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,200
Yes! Yes!

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,874
See that he's hanged.

26

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,556
That's it.

28
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,291
Forgive me God,
for I have sinned.

29
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,759
I am king.

30
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:27,962
I am king.
You have made me king.

31
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:30,832
You have made me king.

32
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,179
(Man groaning in distance)

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,281
...forgiveness
for your sins?

34
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,851
(Muttering in Latin)

35
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:57,025
Do you ask God's forgiveness
for all your sins?

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,595
(Muttering in Latin)

37
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,567
Do you ask God's forgiveness
for all your sins?

38
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,803
Dear God!

39
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,475
Philip.

40
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,246
(Bell tolling)

41
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,850
(Woman crying)

42
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,086
If you wish Maud to make
your son Earl of Shiring,

43
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,755
I need to successfully trade
Stephen with Gloucester.

44
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,892
I'll contribute to the ransom
fee, if that's your concern.

45
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,560
No, my concern is Stephen.

46
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,130
If he is redeemed,
will the war continue?

47
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,831
Undoubtedly.

48
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,702
Therefore Queen Maud
may not rule for long,

49
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,871
and then, whose side are we on?

50
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,006
We need to play both sides.

51
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,509
Oh, I intend to
do that as negotiator,

52
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,279
but your position
is not as flexible.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,414
Are you with Maud
or are you against her?

54
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,683
That's what Stephen will think.

55
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:59,420
And as of this moment,
you are most decidedly with.

56
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,822
Well then, if he wins,

57
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,758
you will have to
intercede for us.

58
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,464
You presume our position
is that of equals,

59
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,000
I need you to serve me,
not command me.

60
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,443
Dear Lady, you mistake
my meaning entirely.

61
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:25,146
Well, then, what would
Your Eminence have me do?

62
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,282
Whatever your wish,
I am happy to obey.

63
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,191
I wish to be made
Archbishop of Canterbury

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,026
once Stephen
regains his throne.

65
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,995
The current one will have
to be removed, of course.

66
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:48,002
(Man coughing)

67
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,139
Drink this, brother.

68
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:56,411
How did I come here?

69
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,713
I told the executioner that,

70
00:04:58,714 --> 00:04:59,914
as the Queen's secretary,

71
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,616
I would answer for
your innocence.

72
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:04,052
But I thought
you supported Stephen?

73
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,720
Shhh!

74
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,622
He's as self-serving
as his predecessor.

75
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,592
I've become a
politician, Philip.

76
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,894
I serve who best serves me.

77
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,596
(Chuckles)

78
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,898
And I hear you
have a cathedral?

79
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,100
Not yet. I need a
few miracles first.

80
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,202
Then let us
give thanks, brother.

81
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:23,571
This is a day for miracles.

82
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,207
I found you,
Maud is now in power.

83
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,445
And the dead have
returned to life.

84
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:35,250
They found him crawling
from a mass grave.

85
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,527
You're a new man, Jack.

86
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,062
A Lazarus.

87
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:51,599
I'm sure I stink like Lazarus.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,668
(Chuckling)

89
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,271
You must have died too,
from the look of you.

90
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,006
Nearly.

91
00:05:58,007 --> 00:06:00,508
God has further plans for me.
For you too, I suspect.

92
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,243
What plans?

93
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,782
What do you remember
of the last 3 days?

94
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,250
Did you pray?

95
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:11,386
I was laying with the dead.

96
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:12,854
(Chuckling)

97
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:15,256
I suppose I don't remember.

98
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,661
I dreamt, though.
I remember that.

99
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,162
What of?

100
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,597
(Man shouting in distance)

101
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,198
Of Aliena.

102
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,670
(Frog croaking)

103
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,229
(Gasps)

104
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,364
Lovely evening.

105
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,832
What are you doing here?

106
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,601
I just came out
to look at the moon.

107
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:02,970
No. No, wait!

108
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,973
Aliena, don't go.
I can't swim very well!

109
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:07,041
Help!

110
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,876
Aliena! Help!

111
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,919
Alfred?

112
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:23,391
(Gasps)

113
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,127
(Gasps)

114
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,464
(Gasping)

115
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,466
(Gasping)

116
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,376
Don't come near me again.

117
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,711
What?

118
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,851
But I love you!

119
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,688
I love you!

120
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,659
(Crickets chirping)

121
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:05,299
- The Empress's terms
are non-negotiable.

122
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,236
Stephen must sign a document
acknowledging her sovereignty

123
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,204
and leave the country forever.

124
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,074
In addition, you will pay Maud
1,000 pounds in gold

125
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,910
and hand over Robert of
Gloucester in good health.

126
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,080
Interesting.

127
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,749
We were gonna ask
1,000 pounds from you.

128
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,987
Why not cancel the ransom fees
and proceed from there?

129
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,289
Your Eminence,
may I have a word?

130
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,791
(Grunts)

131
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,359
(Quietly):
We need the fee

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
in order to bankrupt them.

133
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,396
Otherwise, what guarantee
do we have

134
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:38,533
that Stephen won't ignore
anything that he signs

135
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,535
and begin a war again?

136
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,371
We need a guarantee.

137
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,008
If we ignore the ransom fees,

138
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,245
we need to hold
Stephen's son, Eustace,

139
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,114
until his father
has left the country

140
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,016
and peace has been kept
for 5 years.

141
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,584
King Stephen will never agree.

142
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,085
It's not his decision.

143
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:04,759
Think about it overnight...

144
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,994
dear Richard.

145
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,434
No one at Maud's court

146
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:15,369
knows what Eustace
looks like, do they?

147
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,447
(People murmuring)

148
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,358
And what's your name?

149
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,559
Elizabeth.

150
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,128
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Elizabeth?

151
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,230
I'm 12.

152
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,999
You're a very pretty girl...

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,335
with very pretty lips.

154
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,970
Has anyone ever told you that?

155
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,004
(Chuckles)

156
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,418
Good day, Bishop.

157
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:11,058
I thought you were for Stephen.

158
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,481
Do you see these people
before us, Henry?

159
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:34,849
Yes, Mama.

160
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,818
They've come to ask us favors.
Do you know why?

161
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:38,920
You're the Queen.

162
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,588
I'm the Empress.

163
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,090
I rechristened myself
this morning.

164
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:46,027
And one day,
you will be Emperor,

165
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,462
and people will come
to ask you favors.

166
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,598
So I want you to listen.

167
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,834
Francis, you may speak first.

168
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:57,271
And who is this handsome man?

169
00:10:57,272 --> 00:11:00,241
This is my brother,
Philip, Empress,

170
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,176
the Prior of Kingsbridge.

171
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,378
Handsome, I pray,
before God, Empress,

172
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,014
but, uh, very plain to others.

173
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:10,851
Humility and humor,
a rare combination.

174
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:14,488
You ask us to grant you
a license to hold a market?

175
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,490
The income from which
will be used

176
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,292
to finish building a cathedral.

177
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,094
Finish? How did you pay
to start it?

178
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,563
We had a license, Empress,
but it was lost.

179
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:25,232
King Steph...
Uh, the usurper Stephen refused

180
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,534
to grant us an other.

181
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,602
Why is that?

182
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,071
He kept his reasons to himself.

183
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,506
May I speak, My Empress?

184
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:35,343
The market at Kingsbridge
was closed,

185
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,812
because it took money
from the one at Shiring.

186
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,282
The rule is that markets must
be at least 14 miles apart.

187
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,451
Kingsbridge and Shiring are 20.

188
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,853
Stephen nevertheless decided...

189
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:48,756
What Stephen decided
is of no interest to us.

190
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:51,726
You also ask the right to take
stone from the Shiring quarry.

191
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,662
We have had those rights
for years until William...

192
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,099
I closed the quarry
in retaliation

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,667
for his illegal market.

194
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,402
Who owns the quarry?

195
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,436
We do, My Empress,

196
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,838
It was the usurper Stephen

197
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,140
that allowed Kingsbridge
to take the stones.

198
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:09,443
A foolish bequest, giving
quarry rights to one party,

199
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:11,178
yet letting another mine it.

200
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,414
We quite agree.

201
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,584
The quarry and all its mining
rights shall belong to Shiring.

202
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,119
Thank you, My Empress.

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,688
On the condition that you
successfully negotiate

204
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,457
the release of
our brother Gloucester

205
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,826
from the enemy.

206
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,729
Kingsbridge, however,
shall have similar market rights

207
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,531
to Shiring.

208
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,166
The same condition applies.

209
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,934
(Francis):
Thank you, Empress.

210
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:45,346
In addition, Henry here would
like a toy from each of you.

211
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,481
(People chuckling)

212
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,783
And I'd like a toy, too.

213
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:52,987
100 pounds or your requests
will be denied.

214
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,855
Next.

215
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,292
Can you borrow it?

216
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,261
Money lenders charge
exorbitant interest.

217
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,462
I could never pay it back.

218
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:02,730
No one else?

219
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,465
A merchant who benefits
from the market?

220
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,100
He might find it
to his advantage.

221
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,134
- She.
- What?

222
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:08,502
She.

223
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,405
I did her a favor once.

224
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,643
We've just received the word!

225
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,044
What? Martha,
what is it?

226
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,646
Jack's alive!

227
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,056
- What? Martha,
- Jack, Jack, Jack! is it?

228
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,626
Hey, Jack!

229
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:34,662

I'd lend it to you gladly,

next's year's wool.

240
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:28,649
When would you
need it returned?

241
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,351
Early spring.
Can you manage it?

242
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:31,685
No.

243
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:32,887
No, not unless...

244
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,889
Why can't I sell you
next year's wool?

245
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,758
- You haven't got it yet.
- I will in the spring.

246
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,260
You'd sell it in advance?

247
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,495
Pay me now and I give you
the first shearing.

248
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,330
I never heard of
it done like that.

249
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,398
Why shouldn't it be?

250
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,733
I'd have to offer you

251
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:46,867
a lower price for it

252
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,369
than you'd get by waiting.

253
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,371
The price for wool
goes up in the spring.

254
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,039
I could keep building in winter

255
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,741
and everybody
would be employed.

256
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:56,210
So I give you 100 pounds,
you give it to Maud

257
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,378
and you get a license?

258
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,579
The same as Shiring.

259
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,080
In addition to
the Sunday market,

260
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,916
Shiring has the
annual fleece fair.

261
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,051
That's where I make
most of my money.

262

I... I don't follow.

263

Why don't we have one here?

264
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,224
If the license is
the same as Shiring's,

265
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,360
why can't you host a fair next
year to compete with Shiring?

266
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,995
It would save me
transportation.

267
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:16,931
I could lure
the Flemish buyers here.

268
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,033
You would make
more money in a week

269
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,202
than you would in
a year of Sunday markets

270
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,470
and it would break
the Hamleighs' back.

271
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,072
Ha! Brilliant!

272
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,708
William would be
as mad as a bull!

273
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,010
Yes, and there's nothing
he can do about it.

is not his.

322

00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:41,248
<i>I might never regain Shiring
and Father's title.</i>

331
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,152
<i>William and is mother have
taken Maud's side,</i>

332
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,486
<i>for the time being,</i>

333
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,156
<i>but their loyalty is
as dependable as snow</i>

334
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:51,758
<i>and goes wherever
the winds of power blow it.</i>

335
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,362
Their ally, Bishop Waleran,
has already laid the groundwork

336
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:58,532
<i>for siding again with Stephen
if he were to win.</i>

337
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,534
You must forgive my despair.

338
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:03,837
Winter slows the war and gives
me too much time to brood.

cathedral work too, I imagine.</i>

<i>But come spring,</i>

<i>Hope may blossom,
the war may end,</i>

343
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,415
<i>the church walls
may rise ever higher,</i>

344
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,986
<i>and I will once again
return to your dear self.</i>

345
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,321
<i>Until then,</i>

346
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:25,025
<i>I remain your

350
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,073
Late?

351
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:43,043
Well, there's not much we can do
without a stock of stones.

352
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,912
Nevertheless, I thought it
would be further along by now.

353
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:47,948
We can't work
in the winter, Prior.

354
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,983
And when we get more stones...

355
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,685
And if we don't?

356
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:54,488
You should've conserved
their use, Tom.

357
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:57,324
Jack's been using too many,
carving gargoyles.

358
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,028
Well, we can purchase
some more soon.

359
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,729
You paid your debt to Maud,

360
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,564
She's given you
a license for a market.

361
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,933
Maud is losing battle
after battle.

362
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:09,703
What happens to my fee
if she's deposed?

363
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:12,873
They'll be no more stones
and the coffers will be empty.

364
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,741

Get off there. Get off!

Keep it level.

00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:20,614
Da, look!

367
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:22,816
If I can do this,
I can build a stone vault.

368
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,618
How many times
do I have to tell you?

369
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,754
A stone vault is too heavy.
It can't be supported.

370
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:28,889
Why don't you listen?

371

have you made?

372

and was so filled
with longing for her...

478
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:49,175
He flew back to his master

479

00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,489
(Man): Come on, boys!
Help me!

495
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,025
There's fighting.

496
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:17,063
(Grunting)

497
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:38,985
(Man): The scaffolding is
not made for that violence!

498
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,326
(Screaming)

499
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,407
(Man shouting, indistinct)

500
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,718
It's not the first time, Tom.

501
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:12,986
But Philip, what bro...

502
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,220
No! No excuses.

503
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,356
If 2 of your workers
continually fight,

504
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:17,824
destroy property,

505
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:20,660
tear down work that you
spent months building up,

506
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,095
what do you do?

507
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,429
(Sighing)

508
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:28,201
I will not have Jack and
Alfred working together.

509
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:29,836
Look...

510
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,237
One of them must go.

511
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:33,740
He's an apprentice!

512
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,308
I'm a master stonemason,

513
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,210
Send him away, Da, not me.

514
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,412
I'm your real son!

515
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:42,749
If Ma was alive, this wouldn't
even be a choice!

516
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,552
We were a team once, remember?

517
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,021
I was supposed to
be your successor.

518
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:51,457
Alfred, you'll have to pay
a fine for the damage caused.

519
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,892
One month's wages.
A month?

520
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:55,061
Doubt the prior
would accept any less.

521
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:57,197
Leave us for a moment.

522
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:58,198
Da!

523
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,066
Go... before
I double it.

524
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,173
(Sighing)

525
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,708
(Man):
That one over here?

526
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,011
I'm sorry, Jack.

527
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,047
Why me?

528
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,282
I pleaded with Philip,
but he wouldn't soften.

529
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,251
This is my life.

530
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,954
He's my son.

531
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:22,555
I'm your son too.
You said it.

532
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:29,529
You're the one
that Philip will miss.

533
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,964
You know, Alfred...

534
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,667
he's competent.

535
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,505
But you're brilliant.

536
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,209
Now, in a week or a month,

537
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,411
the Prior will see his mistake.

538
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:46,846
And if he doesn't?

539
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:52,318
You wouldn't even have a job
if it weren't for me.

540
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,620
That's enough.

541
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,222
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I burned it down.

542
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:59,926
I burned the old cathedral
so that you would have work.

543
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:13,706
God forgive you then.

544
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:17,644
Get out.

545
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:22,015
Get out!

546
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,106
Can I climb it?

547
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,146
(Donkey braying)

548
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:57,083
What do you wanna climb all
the way up there for, Jonathan?

549
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:58,184
Brother Jonathan.

550
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,953
Brother Jonathan.

551
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,354
So I can see Jack.

552
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:03,489
He's gone away and
he hasn't said good-bye.

553
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,325
(Men talking in distance)

554
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,261
Sit down.

555
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:18,771
(Cow mooing)

556
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,943
Jack went away because
he'd done something bad.

557
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,514
He hurt Alfred.

558
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:30,116
Like Cain hurt Abel?

559
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:32,452
No, not as bad as that,

560
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:35,722
but anyway. Jack and Alfred
are not really brothers.

561
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,423
Isn't Jack your son?

562
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:40,693
Well, I'm raising...
was raising... Jack

563
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:41,995
as a favor to Ellen,

564
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,864
like Johnny Eightpence
raises you.

565
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:47,967
He isn't my mother,
but he likes to think he is.

566
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:49,268
I know.

567
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:51,170
My mother's dead.

568
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,641
I know that.

569
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:58,011
(Man): That's all of them.
Take them away now.

570
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,246
Do you know who my father is?

571
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:04,550
Who?

572
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:06,719
God.
He's everybody's father.

573
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,490
Of course he is.

574
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:20,066
Where will you go?

575
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,135
Wherever they're
building cathedrals,

576
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,037
I'll go to Jerusalem
if I have to.

577
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,171
Philip is wrong.

578
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,140
He will understand that
he made a mistake.

579
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:30,009
Philip's stubborn, you push
against him and he pushes back.

580
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,145
It would take witchcraft
to change his mind.

581
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:43,856
(Bird hooting)

582
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:44,991
(Knocking)

583
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,793
Come in, Tom.

584
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,528
(Door opening)

585
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:53,066
What are you doing here?

586
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,034
You saved my life, once.

587
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,469
I know you're a man of mercy.

588
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,504
How did you get inside?

589
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:01,140
Not all of the brothers
fear me as you do.

590
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,009
- Ma.
- Let me speak, Jack.

591
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:11,617
I don't fear you.

592
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:13,419
I oppose what you stand for,

593
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,622
which is hatred of God,
and church and morality.

594
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,393
I love God.

595
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:23,830
Although I don't worship Her
quite the same way as you do.

596
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:26,599
My church hasn't
as many rules as yours

597
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,568
and is a lot more forgiving.

598
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,170
And as for morality,
I use love as my compass,

599
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:34,207
which Christ seemed
to approve of,

600
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,808
even if you don't.

601
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:37,310
Ma, you promised to be civil.

602
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:45,318
Come in.
Close the door.

603
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,696
I spend too much time making
decisions on the building.

604
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,397
I need an assistant

605
00:36:58,398 --> 00:37:00,333
who can answer queries
on construction,

606
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,869
who can keep track of
the money and raw materials,

607
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,705
who can handle payments to
suppliers, who can pay wages.

608
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,206
You wouldn't be carving stone,

609
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:10,476
but you would be supervising
the entire design on my behalf.

610
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,744
Really?

611
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,984
Prior, that's fantastic.

612
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,686
In your spare time,
if you had any,

613
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:22,622
you'd learn speak
and read Latin.

614
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,056
You'd serve me during Mass...

615
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:26,192
Why would he need to do that?

616
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:28,060
Because my assistant
must be a monk.

617
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:29,795
Your church is not
having my son.

618
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,198
That's Jack's
decision, not yours.

619
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,466
It burned his father.

620
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:35,501
It tried to burn me.
Ma!

621
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,839
If I found the time,

622
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,675
could I do some carving?

623
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:46,078
Yes, of course.

624
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,881
And I'll have free reign
to walk the grounds,

625
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,249
speak with whomever I wish?

626
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,485
You may speak to men,
on business, yes.

627
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:57,657
God wants you, Jack.

628
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,992
Of that I'm certain.

629
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,229
He saved your life.

630
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,599
He speaks to you
through your art

631
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,502
as clearly as he spoke
to Augustine, Gregory,

632
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:10,836
all His artist-saints.

633
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:14,106
The question is this:
Do you want God?

634
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,679
It's a simple choice...

635
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:22,081
not an easy one.

636
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,559
(Bell tolling)

637
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,783
Rise.

638
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:02,888
(Speaking Latin)

639
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,009
Put your hood on.

640
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,290
(Bird squawking)

641
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,625
Kingsbridge is planning
a fleece fair

642
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:42,161
and Shiring shall become
a village of ghosts!

643
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,763
Who told you this?

644
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:47,033
Two of the Flemish traders who
normally do business with us.

645
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:49,735
It's planned for
the last Sunday in June.

646
00:39:49,736 --> 00:39:51,504
That's 2 weeks from now.

647
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:52,905
How can we stop it?

648
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,411
That is a lovely stone.

649
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,382
No.

650
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:04,817
This belonged to my father.

651
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,153
It's all I've got left of him.

652
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,388
Queen Maud, as you well know,

653
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,223
is fleeing back to France.

654
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:13,959
Stephen thinks you are
both traitors.

655
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,429
How else will I
convince him you're not?

656
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,430
He loves a gift.

657
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,536
Get him to stop the fair.

658
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,639
Dear Lady, the fair
will begin, as planned,

659
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,342
but it will not end as planned,

660
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,377
will it, William?

661
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,819
Don't be nervous, My Lord.

662
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,022
Take your lesson
from their cathedral:

663
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,991
Some take it as a work of art,

664
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,760
a reason for living.

665
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:52,231
Well, I say destruction
is a work of art...

666
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:54,033
(Both grunting)

667
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,602
...and requires
significant talent.

668
00:40:58,972 --> 00:41:01,307
You have a gift, Lord William.

669
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,578
Let's make your mother proud.

670
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:12,651

672
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:22,328
You couldn't ask for
a better crowd,

673
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:23,396
could you, Father?

674
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,630
Or better weather.

675
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:27,233
God's been good to us, today.

00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,879
Hello, brother dear.

680
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,781
Kate!
Ah, Kate!

681
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:44,450
Have you...

682
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:46,152
Have you come to be shriven?

683
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,921
Oh sweet Jesus!
I've prayed for this every day.

684
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:52,191
I came to sell
my wares, Cuthbert.

685
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:54,427
Any of your monks
interested in buying?

686
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,928
(Laughing)

687
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:58,197
(Woman 1): Oh, that place.
In the shade.

688
00:41:58,198 --> 00:41:59,698
(Woman 2): OK.
In the tree.

689
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:02,935
Did I, uh...

690
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:04,904
did I see Ellen here?

691
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:08,207
Yes, she came to see her son.

692
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:10,476
Not me.

693
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:12,211
She's still angry with me

694
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:14,447
for going along with your idea.

695
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,450
She's a good woman, Prior.
You should accept her as she is.

696
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,652
You're not gonna be able
to convert everyone.

697
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:21,320
But I can bring her son to God.

698
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,522
He's doing wonderful work.

699
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:24,924
You should tell her that.

700
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:28,427
If the Good Lord Himself came
down from heaven to praise him,

701
00:42:28,428 --> 00:42:30,696
I don't think that would
make her happy.

702
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:34,300
40,000 sheep sold me
their winter coats.

703
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,302
Would you believe it?

704
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,770
It's cost me 200 pounds,

705
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:39,305
but I'll make 3.

706
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,041
Even I lose my breath
when I think about it.

707
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,476
If you need help,

708
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,545
I will gladly stick around
after I see Jack.

709
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:49,114
Ellen, I know how hard
it must've been for you.

710
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:52,451
I'm perfectly fine. It's Jack
you should worry about.

711
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:54,420
He seems happy.

712
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:57,623
Good. That's all
a mother asks for.

713
00:42:57,624 --> 00:42:59,325
What is?

714
00:43:00,627 --> 00:43:02,895
Oh I don't look that bad, do I?

715
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:04,964
You've lost weight.
They're starving you.

716
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:07,299
They feed me too well, Ma.

717
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,467
You look exhausted.

718
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,336
How many minutes of sleep

719
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,904
do they allow you
between prayers?

720
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,073
Oh I skip most of
the services, so...

721
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:16,008
Do the monks try
to sleep with you?

722
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:17,743
Ma...

723
00:43:17,744 --> 00:43:20,246
No, I have no interest
along those lines

724
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,481
and even if I did,
it's forbidden.

725
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:24,650
Do you have interest
along other lines?

726
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:27,286
- What?
- Do you pleasure yourself?

727
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:28,988
Ma!

728
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,524
I... No!
I don't, no.

729
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:35,528
That's unnatural.

730
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:43,702
I want to make
a confession, Father.

731
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:45,638
Mmm...

732
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,973
(Women laughing)

733
00:43:47,974 --> 00:43:49,708
(Laughing)

734
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:53,145
You're Kate, aren't you?

735
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:55,347
Brother Cuthbert's
little sister.

736
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:56,515
I remember you well.

737
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:57,716
What's it to you?

738
00:43:57,717 --> 00:43:59,318
You're everything to him.

739
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:01,086
He prays for you daily.

740
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,188
You are a knife in his heart.

741
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:04,723
(Scoffs)

742
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:08,027
See the dogs spite the bear!

743
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,962
(Growling)

744
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:12,031
I got... I got 6
on the brown dog.

745
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,632
Who wants a piece of it?

746
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,305
(Growling)

747
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:20,406
(Barking)

748
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,508
(Man):
Winner takes the pot!

749
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:25,711
(Men shouting)

750
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:30,115
(Bear growling)

751
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:35,521
What are they gonna
do with him?

752
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,123
They're gonna fight him.

753
00:44:38,124 --> 00:44:40,359
Do they kill him?

754
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,860
In the end, yeah.

755
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,729
That's sad.

756
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,897
(Growling)

757
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:46,465
Oh, not so much, not for him.

758
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:49,435
He gets to die bravely,
fighting for what he longs for.

759
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,669
What's that?

760
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,037
Honor, really.

761
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,739
And he gets to go
to bear heaven,

762
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,342
wander around, eat as
much fish as he likes.

763
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:57,843
(Dogs barking)

764
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:01,680
Come with me.
I got a surprise for you.

765
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,126
Up you climb, then.

766
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:15,260
You really mean it?

767
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:17,863
Go on, I'm right with you.

768
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,007
That way.

769
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:32,478
There you are.

770
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,580
Don't get too close.

771
00:45:35,515 --> 00:45:37,116
I can see everywhere!

772
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,351
I can see London.
And the ocean.

773
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:40,586
(Wind whistling)

774
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:42,588
I can see heaven!

775
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,691
Hey, Jonathan...

776
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:47,860
I mean, Brother Jonathan,
I'm sorry.

777
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:54,600
There's something
I wanna tell you.

778
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,902
I think I can see an angel.

779
00:45:56,903 --> 00:46:00,873
Listen to me. You know how
you and I are friends, yes?

780
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:03,242
Well suppose I was to tell you

781
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,110
we were something
closer than friends?

782
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:10,315
And when Jack went away,

783
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:15,254
for me that was sort of
like losing a son.

784
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,492
But...

785
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:22,194
What's that?

786
00:46:30,804 --> 00:46:32,071
(Neighing)

787
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:33,338
Yah!

788
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:40,512
Ellen, get inside the priory!
William Hamleigh's attacking!

789
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:45,084
Get inside the priory!
William Hamleigh's attacking!

790
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:47,052
(Children screaming)

791
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:49,955
(All roaring)

792
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:52,558
We've got to get
away from here.

793
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,059
I've got 6 pence on the...

794
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,762
Never mind that now!
Get inside everyone!

795
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,263
(Attackers roaring)

796
00:46:58,264 --> 00:46:59,832
(Screaming)

797
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:07,406
Run away!

798
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:16,115
(Roaring)

799
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:22,087
(Groaning)

800
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,525
(Screaming)

801
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:27,926
(Man): Everybody!

802
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:44,676
No!

803
00:47:44,677 --> 00:47:45,778
Come, Aliena!

804
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,246
We need to go.
I can't!

805
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:48,213
No, it's all I have!

806
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,181
Leave it, Aliena!

807
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:50,616
(Crying)

808
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,552
(Woman screaming)

809
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,322
Stay here.
Stay here, Aliena.

810
00:47:57,323 --> 00:47:59,391
Shut these doors.
These doors need shutting.

811
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:00,459
You stay here!

812
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,327
Stay!

813
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:03,428
(All shouting)

814
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:06,365
(Screaming)

815
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:16,875
It's locked!

816
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,010
Go to the cathedral.

817
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:19,011
Follow me.

818
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:20,479
(Man 1):
Open the door!

819
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:26,185
(Man 2): For the love
of God, let us in!

820
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,557
(Man 3): Tell him
to get the keys!

821
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,461
(Shouting and pounding)

822
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:38,764
Remigius, what is it?
What's happening?

823
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:41,834
Prior Philip,
there's a riot or something!

824
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,502
Someone's attacking the fair!

Dear God, why? Why?

831
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,858
Let me through!
I can open it.

832
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,859
It's locked!

Tom!

861
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:38,576
Don't meddle, monk!

862
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:44,916
It was all for nothing,
Tom Builder.

00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:16,715
Yah! Yah!
