00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:50,473
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor
on the 7th of December 1941

3
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:54,973
The imperial Japanese navy steamed south.
unleashing their fire on Darwin.

4
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:59,573
A city in the northern
territory of Australia.

5
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,273
The territory' was a land of crocodiles,
cattle barons and warrior chiefs where

6
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,372
Adventure and romance was a way of life.

7
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:08,773
It was also a place where
Aboriginal children of mixed-race

8
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:13,373
Were taken by force from their families
and trained for service in white society.

9
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,073
These children became known as
the stolen generations.

10
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:22,673
These children became known as
the stolen generations.

11
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:28,673
September 1939

12
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,473
My grandfather King George.

00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:36,173
He take me walkabout.

00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:41,072
Grandfather teach me.

16
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,949
most important lesson of all.

17
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,372
Telling story.

18
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:52,272
That day I down to Billabong.

19
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,972
King George he teach me
how to catch some fish...

20
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,047
using magic song.

21
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,272
See I'm not black fellow.

22
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,272
I'm not white fellow either.

23
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:07,272
Them white fellows called me mixed blood.

24
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,472
Half cast.

25
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,172
Creamy.

26
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,072
I belong now one.

27
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:22,772
That day I see them white fellows, they were
pushing them cheeky bulls cross the river...

28
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,172
Onto Carney Land.

29
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:32,772
King George angry
at them white fellows.

30
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,672
King George says them
white fellow bad spirit.

31
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:41,872
Must be taken from this land.

32
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,335
Them coppers come take me away.

33
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,670
They wanna put me on
that mission island.

34
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,170
Make me into white fellow.

35
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,270
But they not coppers.

36
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,570
And the first time, I saw her.

37
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,170
That Mrs. Boss.

38
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,170
The strangest woman I've ever seen.

39
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,870
She's not from this land.

40
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,070
This land...my people
got many names for it.

41
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,970
But white fellows called it...

42
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,370
Australia.

43
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,070
But this story not begin that day.

44
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,670
This story begin a little while ago.

45
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,670
In a land far far away.

46
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,670
That land called England.

47
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,969
My husband must
sell Faraway downs.

48
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,769
But the offer from this
cattle king of Mr. Carney -

49
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:18,969
Is only 1/6 what
it once worth.

50
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,034
We need
the money, Ramsden.

51
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,669
Maitland is just about
to muster the pets.

52
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:24,669
What?

53
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,869
they be getting big cows
ready for market.

54
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,869
Ramsden. You and I both know
there is only one reason...

55
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,869
My husband spend so
much time Down under.

56
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,069
And did has absolutely
nothing to do with cows.

57
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,669
At least not
the animal variety.

58
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,469
Lady Ashley i, i do
Think that bit harsh.

59
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,369
Oh Ramsden
drink your tea.

60
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,869
Lady Ashley.

61
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,669
What do you
intend to do?

62
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,569
I intend to travel
to this cattle station.

63
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:50,969
Sell it.

64
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,969
And bring Maitland
home to myself.

65
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:55,069
But Lady Ashley...

66
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:57,349
It`s Australia.

67
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:01,469
Darling Sarah employ
you do not travel.

68
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,069
Outbreak of war
imminent. Stop.

69
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,069
Maitland, your concern
regarding war truly noted. Stop.

70
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,469
Have plan concerning cattle, sale
to King Carney not necessary...

71
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,869
Need more time. Stop.

72
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,169
Nonsense. Stop.

73
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,269
Expect contract for sale of station
to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.

74
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,068
Cannot meet you. Stop.

75
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:22,968
I must survey. Stop.

76
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,068
Have sent trusted man. Stop.

77
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,868
The Drover. Stop.

78
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,068
Drover?

79
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,268
Drover, You boom lover.

80
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,468

00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:58,268

84
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,268
No booms in here.

In a pub, Ivan.

86

00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,368
You work with them.

89
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,468
And you sleep with them.

90
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,168
Oh crikey.

91
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,267
And when you see
her wave your hat.

92
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,450
walkaway

93
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,328
walkaway.

94
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,967
What are you waiting
for an invitation?

95
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,267
No, I hate
coming to town.

96
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,667
Lady Sarah Ashley..

97
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,667
Genuine aristocrat..

98
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,767
Living right here in Darwin.

99
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,367
Administrator.
we are at war.

100
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,667
As the officer in charge of livestock
Purchases for the armed forces.

101
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,867
She's Quite a looker.

102
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,867
I failed to see.

103
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,267
What Lady Sarah Ashley-

104
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:16,267
Has to do with Carneys Strangle
hold of the beast industry.

105
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,467
Her husband Lord Ashley
Claims his mustering fats.

106
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,967
At faraway downs.

107
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,167
Faraway downs?

108
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,367
Faraway downs.
The only cattle station.

109
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,467
In the whole of the north,

110
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:30,234
not owned by Leslie King Carney.

111
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:33,967
Lord Maitland Ashley is
mustering on Faraway downs.

112
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,867
Isn't quite what we
had in mind isn't Neil?

113
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,132
No,i hear you.

114
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:41,166
Now his missus has
arrived on a flying boat.

115
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,966
Does not Look like they're gonna
sell Faraway downs to me, Neil.

116
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:46,632
No she won't last.

117
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,366
Delicate English rose
withers in the outback.

118
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,066
Are You with me?

119
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,166
If you must know
im be to met.

120
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,566
By my husband's
trusted man Mr. Drover.

121
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,366
The bloody Drover.

122
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,152
Bring it , yes.

123
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:06,652
Move this.

124
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:11,866
Look at my wife and daughter.
Down there given the royal welcome.

125
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,666
My fiance' Neil Fletcher
manages Faraway downs.

126
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:18,666
Good day.

127
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,666
Bit pale.

128
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,966
Not Bad looking Sheila but
whats the story on the luggage.

129
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,366
Wants to settle down in
the outback does she?

130
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:33,366
If she stays and Lord actually manage
to get his cattle down on that wharf there,

131
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:36,866
Then we've got a competitor
for the army contract Neil.

132
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:41,066
Carney's control of every
cattle station in the north.

133
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,866
Jeopardizes the supplie
of beef to our troops.

134
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:48,666
But it's a poor war that doesn't
make a decent patriot get rich.

135
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,565
So... I don't want
a single beast.

136
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:54,065
From Faraway downs
to set a hoof.

137
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:56,065
On that wharf.

138
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,665
You with me, Neil?

139
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,165
Yeah. nature wiill take its course.

140
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:08,565
What about the misses?

141
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,965
Now I've have arranged someone
special to give the old scenic route.

142
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,965
Give her a taste of the outback.

143
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:21,665
Who's taking her?

144
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:23,165
The Drover.

145
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,265
The Drover?

146
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,465
Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.

147
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,065
I'm Sarah Ashley.

148
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:49,965
My husband Lord Ashley has
sent a trusted man to collect me.

149
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:51,964
Mr. Drover.

150
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:55,765
It seems if he
been way late.

151
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,265
No women.

152
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,864
Ladies lounge is next door.

153
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:05,164
The hen parlor is that away, my dear.

154
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,664
No wonder your
Establishment is empty.

155
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:12,364
Good day.

156
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:16,464
No!

157
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:51,164
No. no, no... My packs...

158
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:55,064
o my god.

159
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,764
Welcome to Australia.

160
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,163
Drover take Mrs. Boss to faraway
downs in a great big fancy truck.

161
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:19,263
He even let her sit in his special seat.

162
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:23,163
She even drinks drovers own water bottle.

163
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,263
They get along like a Burning house.

164
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,263
Now Magarri, he's sitting up top.

165
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:34,563
And Magarri's cousin Goolaj bollalong,
he come along for the ride.

166
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,663
They make em friends right away.

167
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:39,663
Water.

168
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,563
That's it.

169
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,263
Stay. Stay.

170
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,263
Trusted man
Typical man.

171
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,263
I see your husband is
a pretty good bloke.

172
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,863
Yes. He certainly knows
how to choose employees.

173
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,312
employee?
- No wonder the place is bankrupt.

174
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,663
Hey lady I'm
not an employee.

175
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:02,263
Great. So you're just driving me
all the way out to faraway downs...

176
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:04,863
As personal favor to my
husband are you? mmm. -No.

177
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,763
Him being such
a good bloke all?

178
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:08,163
I'm driving out because
he promised me a drove...

179
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:09,963
Of 1500 head cattle.

180
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,463
What? To buy?

181
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,213
No you goose, to drove.

182
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,863
I'm a drover, right?

183
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,763
I move the cattle from a to b.
alright,, I work on commission.

184
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,162
No man hires me
no man fires me.

185
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:24,062
Everything I own, I can fit in
my saddle bag. Which is why-like it.

186
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:25,962
Yes, yes, all...

187
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,566
All very outback
adventures isn't.

188
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,162
Not saying its
for everyone.

189
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,462
no, no... Definitely
not for everyone.

190
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,162
most people own.

191
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,062
You know, land,
luggage and other people.

192
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:38,062
Makes them
feel secure.

193
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,362
But all can
taken away.

194
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,962
In the end, only
thing you really own.

195
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:45,262
is a... is a story.

196
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:47,962
Just try to
live a good one.

197
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,327
Yes, yes adventure story.

198
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,362
You sound just
like my husband.

199
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:59,362
Oh... They are kangaroos.

200
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:01,262
Lovely.

201
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:02,662
Beautiful.

202
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:04,962
I've never seen a kangaroo.

203
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,262
Look. They're jumping.
- They're jumping.

204
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,662
Oh it's beautiful.

205
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,662
Oh, Look at them jumping.

206
00:14:58,261 --> 00:14:59,561
Mr. Drover.

207
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:02,561
Hey,Mrs boss.

208
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:03,961
Tucker,Mrs Boss.

209
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,961
Mr. Drover.
- Yeah.

210
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,461
There's only one tent.

211
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:08,761
That's right.

212
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:10,161
For the four of us?

213
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:12,461
Well you know, it gets pretty
chilly here at night. We-

214
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,661
We like to bunk up
together ay magarri?

215
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:15,961
Goolaj huh?

216
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,061
Nice and close, you know.

217
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,761
O' come on, Lady Ashley.

218
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,361
We're just
having a laugh.

219
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,361
Never really slept
in a tent on our life.

220
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,261
We just bunk
around the fire, See.

221
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,061
See we're not
really used to a..

222
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
a woman?

223
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,661
I suppose you think I
should be back in Darwin.

224
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,160
At the church page or the
Ladies whatever you call it.

225
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,260
I will have you know that
I am as capable as any man.

226
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,660
Guest.

227
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.

228
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,160
But now that you mention
it I have quite a like to.

229
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:53,960
Women of the outback.

230
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,760
But they're mostly native women.

231
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,060
Aboriginal women.

232
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,660
They're very easy to...

233
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:02,141
To get along with.

234
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,860
If you try.

235
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,060
Get out of here.

236
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,360
What's that?

237
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,760
Your accountant.

238
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Hey Drover. He's your
bloody problem now.

239
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,060
See you, Drover.

240
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm sorry. What was
your name again?

241
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,960
Blipling Klimp...

242
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,360
Kipling Flynn.

243
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,359
Thanks.

244
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,359
How long until we
reach faraway downs?

245
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,259
We've been on it
for the last two days.

246
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,759
Drover! Hey Drover!

have a rest for a while?

248
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,424
Nah, I got to
make a delivery.

249
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,159
Put the kettle on I'll be there
in a couple of days, alright?

250
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,859
kiss kiss.
- Okay.

251
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,359

253
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:20,859
Bye.

254
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,759
You and my husband
share an interest.

255
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,459
Interest? Really?

256
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,625
Come on.

257
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:29,393
We all know real reason
what my husband is out here.

258
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,259
Right, you mean
the breeding game.

259
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,224
Breeding?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,659
Now, we have dead
can on breeding.

261
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,924
I have this idea which a...

262
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,959
Sheila you might be quite
exited about it too actually.

263
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,859
Now, I'm bromby man, but he
is fancy English for Capricornia.

264
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,059

265
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,759
She is gorgeous. Real gorgeous.

266
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,769
Gorgeous creature.

267
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,658
I've always wanted to mate an
English thorough-bred with bush bronco.

268
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:03,658
I mean, be magic, Wouldn't magic.

269
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:05,758
Imagine that combination.
- Don't you say another word.

270
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,988

about too, haven't you.

271
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:10,258

272
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,958

00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:25,157

What? What was that?

278
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:37,158
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

279
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,758
Just like you have it on the
poor girl that you are exploiting.

280
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:41,558
and,and God knows
how many others.

281
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:43,458
What are you
talking about?

282
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,858

283
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,158
I haven't on with you.

284
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:52,258
If you were only
tart left in Australia.

285
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,658
Do you hear me.
You are... - I wouldn't.

286
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,857
ah,What was that?

287
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,257
Stay in the car.

288
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,157
No. no.
- Get your hands off.

289
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,057
For once in your life do
as your bloody told.

290
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:35,457
There she is...

291
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,757
Faraway Downs.

292
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,457
And the first time, I saw her.

293
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:55,757
That Mrs. Boss.

294
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,057
Lady Ashley, Wait!
Don't go in there!

295
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:52,056
I'm so sorry.

296
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:16,056
My family has the honor of serving
the owners of Faraway downs...

297
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:17,856
For a three generations.

298
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,348
We know how hard
this land can be.

299
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:21,923
But Lord.

300
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:24,966
Maitland Ashley he...
He never gave up.

301
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:29,655
The only thing that could stop this
descent gorgeous man was a spear.

302
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,855
From the murders black.

303
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,755
So called King George.

304
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,155
And he will be
brought to justice.

305
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:39,155
Let us now prey
for Maitland Ashley.

306
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,655
That his soul may enter
peacefully through gates of heaven.

307
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:56,355
Lady Ashley, we can leave for
Darwin first thing in a morning.

308
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,055
Yes, certainly Mr Fletcher.
- watch the ground.

309
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,355
I can't understand what my
husband Would seen out here?

310
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,555
Yeeh,this land has
a strange power.

311
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:53,854
That first night when
the sun go to sleep.

312
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,454
King George tell me
this land be healed.

313
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,154
He tell me that woman.

314
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,491
That far far away woman.

315
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:05,954
She be like the rain.

316
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,754
I been thinking
I'm gonna sing her to me.

317
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:15,454
Make the land sing.

318
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,453
I let you see me now.

319
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:04,353
Who are you?

320
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:05,753
I'm Nullah.

321
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,053
How did you get in here?

322
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:10,353
I make myself invisible.

323
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:13,453
Whit Galapa magic!

324
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:23,853
What do you want?

325
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:27,753
That Fletcher been
cursed this place.

326
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:31,853
But you like
rainbow serpent.

327
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:35,053
You manimak.

328
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,653
You heal this land.

329
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:39,353
So I sing you to me.

330
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:43,553
Like I sing fish to me.

331
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,794
I sing too,

332
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,375
when mama and Fletcher.

333
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:03,919
Make wrong side business.

334
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,652
Wrong sided of business?

335
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,652
You know.

336
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:10,552
Laying down and tickling.

337
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:14,252
Oh my goodness.
- Me and you secret.

338
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:16,652
Oh my goodness, Mr. Fletcher!

339
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:19,911
I got to sing to
mama,to warn her

340
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:22,503
that Lord bush Ashley
is coming down.

341
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,088
Maitland.

342
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,852
I mean... Lord Ashley?

343
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,252
Yeah. He plenty funny.

344
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:32,152
So that's why i took him
down to Billabong.

345
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:34,452
Show him where
big fat cheeky bulls.

346
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:35,952
Come here. Look them.

347
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:36,952
Look!

348
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,152
They pushed cross that river.

349
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,352
Over to Carney Land.

350
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,752
The bulls, Billabong.

351
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,752
That's where Maitland was killed.

352
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:51,252
But Mrs. Boss that spears was...
- Please don't!

353
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:54,252
Don't make that policeman
take away my boy.

354
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:57,352
Them coppers.
That bad Fletcher.

355
00:25:57,452 --> 00:26:00,752
He say you see me. You send
me to the Mission island.

356
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:03,452
To the LockLock
throw away bloody key.

357
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,451
Please,  Mrs quick.

358
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:08,451
I'll make us invisible.

359
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,350
Mrs. Boss.

360
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,850
It's you.
- Last night I show you.

361
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,650
well.

362
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,250
She is a beautiful
today, isn't she?

363
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,550
How was your sleep? Restful?

364
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,650
I wouldn't say so. No.

365
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:52,950
Heey, Now the boys are...

366
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,550
boys are just finishing up.

367
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,550
Got tell you they're
pretty sorry mob of cattle.

368
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,350
Seems like it hardly
worth the effort.

369
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,050
Like to go, Lady Ashley?

370
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,199
Billabolong.

371
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,350
Mr. Fletcher.

372
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,550
Tell me about the big fat cows that
cross the river down at the Bilabalong.

373
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,750
Or what ever is you call it.

374
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,115
Yeah, the Billabong.

375
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,550
No,that's Carney
property over there.

376
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:13,350
Our cattle don't
cross the river.

377
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,250
Apparently they do.
- Yeeh.

378
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,050
Who..who says they do?

379
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,150
That little boy there.

380
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,349
You mean the little half cast fellow.

381
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:33,249
Hey, hey little fellow, come here.

382
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:36,349
Come and tell Mr. Fletcher
what you told me last night.

383
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:42,749
aint they funny ones?

384
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:47,349
Do what your mother says.

385
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:52,378
Now...

386
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,649
Did you see big fat cattle
crossing marmant river?

387
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:00,549
Well, they are just Carney cattle on
the other side of the river, having a drink.

388
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:07,849
Them just Carney's cattle Mr. Fletcher
I been look them about myself.

389
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:09,427

390
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:17,549
Oh you, tell great big
tall story don't you. ay?

391
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,649
It's alright, Mr. Fletcher I'm sure
the boy just made a mistake.

392
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,449
we best get going lady Ashley.

393
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,449

395
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:39,748
Hey, that old windmill
hasen't turn in years.

396
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:42,248
He's Sweet little boy, I don't
think he meant no harm.

397
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,748
they are Funny little krawling.
little bit soft in the head.

398
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:48,448
That's why, the government
sent him to the mission.

399
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:51,448
Yeah. The next one quick.

400
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:53,248
Come on, We don't got all day.

401
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:55,247
I'm not bloody liar!

402
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:57,948
He liar.

403
00:29:58,147 --> 00:30:00,147
He say this not work.

404
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,148
Fletcher! Liar!

405
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,448
Run, Nullah  run!

406
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:37,048
Mr. Fletcher.!

407
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:44,847
Get out of my property!
You no longer work for me.

408
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:48,547
If I go my men
go with me.

409
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,447
There a single bloody beast in this
stockyard to start the drive in the morning.

410
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:55,947
You heard what I said.

411
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,947
Yeah?
- Go. Now!

412
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:04,647
You're the boss.

413
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:10,247
Hey Flynn, get in the car, I'll give
your new job to somewhere else.

414
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,547
punchem up, grab
the gear,pack it up

415
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,856
I'll see you in desperation-
creek in in few days.

416
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,447
Bloody hell, Phil.

417
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,447
Carney gonna
get this property.

418
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,047
Been pleasure
working for you.

419
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:37,747
Real pleasure.

420
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:09,646
That strange woman,
she's fired that Fletcher.

421
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:17,146
He can't hurt mama no more.

422
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:23,546
From that day on.

423
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:27,146
We call her Mrs. Boss

424
00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:34,646
Why would Fletcher
block the water pump?

425
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:39,446
I don't know,all crasy.
Why fair,all crasy.

426
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:53,246
Mr. Flynn?

427
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,046
My lady.
- Don't get up.

428
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,445
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

429
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:09,245
This ledger...

430
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:12,243
which Fletcher had me

431
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:14,444
keep for the Benefit of your husband..

432
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:17,645
Is a tale of decline and ruin..

433
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:20,138
recelent of great gibbon.

434
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,945
There is however another.

435
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:28,845
kept for benefit of mr Carney..

436
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:33,011
in which is recorded all the unbranded...

437
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,245
Fat cattle,siphoned
off cross the river.

438
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:40,044
and into his herd.

439
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:41,945
And the boy.

440
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:44,273
he is Fletcher son.

441
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:46,046
Isn't he?

442
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:49,845
as with all the things Fletcher
It's impossible to prove anything.

443
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:53,085
Still, if Carneys
good Christian wife.

444
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:56,056
Ever come same
conclusion as youself.

445
00:33:56,345 --> 00:34:00,645
Fletcher chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

446
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:02,845
im going to authorities
and I will been telling them.

447
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,145
Carney is the authority here.

448
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,943
Are you suggesting I
let him steel my cattle.

449
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,645
and buy my property for
fraction what it is worth.

450
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,544
I'm suggesting..

451
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,940
that you continue do
what your husband set out to do.

452
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,544
Drove...

453
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,244
Drove to the Cattle to Darwin.

454
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,044
Would you mind?

455
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,944
I need a drink.
- My lady.

456
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,944
Drove, drove the cattle to Darwin...

457
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,844
Sell them to the army,
you break Carney's monopoly...

458
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,644
Use, profits to put
faraway downsback on its feet's.

459
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,044
You go back to London.

460
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,044
You are sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

461
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:46,544
That was Maitland
said he was doing.

462
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:49,429
And there no reason
why you can't do the same.

463
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:00,944
There is just one small problem.

464
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:05,911
Having dismissed Fletcher
there is no one muscle the cattle.

465
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:39,543
Drover!

466
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:41,543
Drover!

467
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:58,043
Yeah, Drover!

468
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,885
Mr. Drover!
- just get bloody brumbys in there..

469
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,943
Hey Drover, you got to
teach me break them horses.

470
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:14,508
Mr. Drover, I need to speak to you.

471
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:16,743
Where the hell all the
bloody stockmen, eyh?

472
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,543
That what I need to
speak with you about.

473
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,643
Where's Fletcher!

474
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:22,143
We disagreed and I
just dismissed him.

475
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:24,843
Dismissed?
- Yes.

476
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,643
What about the cattle`?

477
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,343
it beckys believe, that as he was leaving
you deliberately let the cows out of the...

478
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:33,142
I don't know what every
you call it and they run off!

479
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,142
Damn!

480
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:36,608
Do you realize woman
what you have done.

481
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,742
Mr. Drover do not take that tone
with me, thank you very much!

482
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:40,842
Not take that tone with you, huh?
- No

483
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:42,742
I'm asking woman do you
know what you have done.

484
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:46,642
I won't get another drove this late into
the season, right. you cost my living.

485
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:49,942
Can you just round them up.

487
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:56,042
Scattered over million acres,
with just me and two men.

488
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:58,342
That's a great idea,stupid cow.

489
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:02,342
Mr. Drover, I was right to dismiss,

492
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:14,342
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you.

493
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:19,342
Mr. Fletcher is
working for Mr. Carney

494
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:22,185
They were pushing the best
of unbranded cattle-

495
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:26,342
Across the river on to
Mr. Carneys property.

496
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,642
They were stealing!.

497
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:34,042
There a no surprised there.

498
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,242

499
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:36,642
Alright, alright.

500
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:39,542
Look, you can't prove it,  Alright...
- Well...

501
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:42,341
you can't. and you can't
win against Carney.

502
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,564
So just...

503
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:44,954
take my
advice lady.

504
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:46,652
Grab king Carney's offering.

505
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:47,654
And go to hell
back to England

506
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:51,541
As quickly as possible that way
you make everybody happy.

507
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:52,641
Especially me.

508

So you just going
to walk away?

509
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:00,786
I learned long time ago not
to fight Other people's wars.

510
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:01,941
Wait! wait! wait!

511
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,741

Bandy was drovers boy long time ago.

521
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:51,041
Some white stockmen like to have a aboriginal
woman on the drove to keep them company at night.

522
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,140
They shave their heads make them look like boys
workem like any other stockmen doing a day.

523
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,040
That's a what you call it?

00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,140
Exploiting them.

Mr. Drover, I could show you

548
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,239
Pretty sure when it comes to horses
there is nothing you can show me.

549
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,139

01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:56,318
I was a coward.

808
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:43,917
We lost us about everything
except few swags and tins of beef.

809
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:45,856
and this.

810
01:05:49,817 --> 01:05:53,417
I can't believe I was so
insisted on upon bringing these.

811
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,617
Silly things.

812
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:00,217
It was Fletcher who
did this, wasn't it?

813
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,317
The last thing Flint told
me before he died was..

814
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:07,417
That your husband
was killed by...

815
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:10,317
by glass tipped spear.

816
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:13,117
Like the ornamentals
in the homestead.

817
01:06:13,617 --> 01:06:15,517
Glass tip is Kimberly spear.

818
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:18,317
Now, King George's from Arnheim.

819
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:20,817
Fletcher was trying to make it
look like King Georges.

820
01:06:21,517 --> 01:06:24,817
Fletcher.
- It can't be proofed.

821
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:27,259
Sorry.

822
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,869
Maitland.

823
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,916
We can't let
them win.

824
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,616
We won't.

825
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,716
They pushed through on the night.

826
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:46,016
Maybe that little creamy
has really black fellow magic.

827
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:47,416
Shut up, Bull.

828
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,915
They need more than magic
to get them to Darwin.

829
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:08,015
now,after you done there mate
I need hovel these horses alright?

830
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:09,315
Yes boss.

831
01:08:12,115 --> 01:08:14,315
Never thought I'd see this day.

832
01:08:14,915 --> 01:08:16,415
We gonna break the Drover's law.

833
01:08:16,915 --> 01:08:18,115
I'm plenty old enough too.

834
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:20,015
Yes you are mate and
That's why you-

835
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:23,315

of the rest of us,right.

836
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:28,915
Good girl yedda. Here.
- lets us be uppstanding.

837
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,115
To the memory of the gentleman.

838
01:08:32,815 --> 01:08:35,215
To the gentleman.
- To Flynn.

839
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:52,615
I'd say one more before dinner.

840
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:10,014
Let's dance.

841
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:11,814
No.
- Come on.

842
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,714
No.
- Come on. Please.

843
01:09:15,914 --> 01:09:17,214
No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.

844
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:20,014
You put your hands
on my shoulders.

845
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:30,114
And you step back.back no no...

846
01:09:31,494 --> 01:09:32,794
I'm a bad teacher.

847
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:34,214
Stop.

848
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:38,414
I give it a go.

849
01:09:38,914 --> 01:09:41,514
I can do it,i can do it, alright.

850
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:26,732
Now,you do wrong sided business.

851
01:10:29,913 --> 01:10:32,013
No, we having
just a dance here.

852
01:10:33,513 --> 01:10:35,313
ceremonial dance?

853
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:38,113
Yes. It's called the Foxtrot.

854
01:10:38,713 --> 01:10:39,413
Fox dance?

855
01:10:40,313 --> 01:10:41,613
You gonna teach
me that dance?

856
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,513
You're a little too
young for that, mate.

857
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:45,013
Nullah! Get down
from that tree now.

858
01:10:45,513 --> 01:10:47,213
You got bad spirits up there.

859
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:50,413
You're in big trouble.

860
01:10:59,513 --> 01:11:01,913
Have ever falling in to
wrong side business?

861
01:11:07,313 --> 01:11:08,713
Yeah.

862
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:11,813
Yeah. I was married once.

863
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:12,913
Really?

864
01:11:14,013 --> 01:11:15,313
To a lovely girl.

865
01:11:18,212 --> 01:11:21,512
That was before
I went off to war.

866
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:29,912
And what happened?

867
01:11:33,112 --> 01:11:34,812
I marched off for mother England.

868
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:37,403
and by the time I came
back,she was sick.

869
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:41,285
With Tbc.

870
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:45,512
But back thenv the hospitals
wouldn't treat...

871
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:48,251
Blacks.

872
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:56,012
Oh, right I see.

873
01:12:02,112 --> 01:12:03,812
Do you have children?

874
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,401
No.

875
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:09,312
Well, that's a shame.

876
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,512
I think you'd made
a great father.

877
01:12:15,512 --> 01:12:17,212
Do You?

878
01:12:18,263 --> 01:12:19,463
No.

879
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,012
I can't.

880
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:31,411
That's too bad.

881
01:12:35,411 --> 01:12:37,111
You'd made a great mother.

882
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,411
Well, good night.

883
01:12:50,211 --> 01:12:51,911
Good night.
- Yeah.

884
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:26,511
Water no good, boss.

885
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:29,711
Might be the Carney boys
had already been here ay?

886
01:13:30,311 --> 01:13:32,411
There has to be water
somewhere in these lakes.

887
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:34,511
Next bore is five days.
- There's have to be water.

888
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,511
you can be sure Fletcher
has been there as well.

889
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:40,610
Hey boss.
- what?

890
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:42,410
There's water.

891
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:45,263
Three days ride away.

892
01:13:45,885 --> 01:13:47,585
We have to across the kuraman.

893
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:49,143
Kuraman.

894
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,825
That's Nevernever land.

895
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:52,685
No.
- We got to try.

896
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,810
We can't.

897
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:55,910
We got to try.

898
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,710
no one has drove nevernever.

899
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,910
there is nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.

900
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,910
if you get caught out there,you're
gonna lose more than your cattle.

901
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,210
I'm sorry.

902
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:15,310
Boss. Look!

903
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,709
He a wizard.
He gonna sing for us.

904
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:52,109
Sing?

905
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:54,409
He can find his
way anywhere.

906
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,609
The ancestors created songs for everything.

907
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:04,009
For every rock, and tree
and their all linked so...

908
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:06,975
Galapa, a magic man.

909
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:10,072
sings them in order
to sing us to water.

910
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:12,909
even cross the nevernever.

911
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:25,509
And we went for three days.

912
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:30,109
Everyday drier... Hotter.

913
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:32,709
On that dead land.

914
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:35,909
Then come the big dust.

915
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:51,309
The cattle stopped moving,
My girl, Coolaj stop moving.

916
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:53,909
We all stop moving.

917
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,808
Dead? All of them.
That's what it said.

918
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,975
The pilot swooped down
to get a closer look.

919
01:16:24,265 --> 01:16:26,265
Dead as door post they were.

920
01:16:27,193 --> 01:16:28,493
It's a real tragedy.

921
01:16:28,808 --> 01:16:30,808
How terrible.

922
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:33,108
And on the eve of the ball too.

923
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,208
But what were they
doing in the Kuraman?

924
01:16:37,308 --> 01:16:39,608
Nothing personal, captain.

925
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:41,308
But I got a
business to run.

926
01:16:41,408 --> 01:16:43,408
And you got
an army to feed.

927
01:16:43,409 --> 01:16:44,909
So let's not
mock about.

928
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:52,510
I suppose its not a real war
unless someones making a profit.

929
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:57,971
You got them are Ready to load Neil.
- Yeah,we are right to go.

930
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,997
because I got the feeling that
captain is gonna put Penn to paper.

931
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:03,959
All hail to king.

932
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:25,334
Hello,little sweety.

933
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:08,634

935
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:13,219

936
01:18:13,535 --> 01:18:16,183
We will require
a holding yard.

937
01:18:16,816 --> 01:18:17,916

938
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:18,917
Says who?

939
01:18:19,018 --> 01:18:20,541
The Owner.

940
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:22,341
You must be Mr. Carney.

941
01:18:22,342 --> 01:18:23,842
Too right, love.

942
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,544

944
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:33,045
We will accept twenty
Percent less than.

945
01:18:33,346 --> 01:18:35,346
What the Carney
cattle co is asking.

946
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,640

948

But this contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.

949
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:48,342
Load the bloody cattle now!.

950
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,830
We got to load the cattle
on ship before Carney.

951
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:52,231
Get of your backsides!.

952

You drive them straight to wharf.
