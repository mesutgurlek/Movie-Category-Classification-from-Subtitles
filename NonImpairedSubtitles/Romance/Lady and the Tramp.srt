- Hold it.

927
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,191
- [Popping Sound]
- [Jim Coughing]

928
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,195
[ Coughing ] I guess I used
a little too much.

929
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,999
Uh-oh. Darling.

930
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,111
- Visitors.
- Visitors?

931
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,829
[Darling] Why, it's Jock.

932
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,520
[Jim]And goodold Trusty.

933
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,672
Careful now, man.
Careful.

934
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,190
- It's a wee bit slippery.
- Yes, yes.

935
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,073
- [ Barking ]
- [Jim]All right, boy.

936
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,794
- [Jim] We'll let 'em in.
- [ Growling ]

937
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,912
No, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.

938
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,874
Well, merry Christmas!
Come in! Come in!

939
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,077
If you'll just step into the parlour,
I'll see about refreshments.

940
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,232
Oh, darling,
where did you put the dog biscuits?

941
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,956
- You know, the box
Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.
- In the kitchen,Jim Dear.

942
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,278
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.

943
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,432
- Aye.
- [Growling]

944
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:14,390
[ Chuckles ] But there's a bit of
their father in 'em too.

945
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,315
Well, and I see you
finally acquired a collar.

946
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,791
Oh, yes, complete with licence.

947
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,872
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

948
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,719
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

949
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,950
- [ Growling ]
- "Trusty, "I says--

950
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,909
"Trusty, somebody's
wearin' a new collar. "

951
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,074
Of course, now, my sense of smell
is very highly developed.

952
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,310
Runs in the family, you know?

953
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,433
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

954
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,478
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say--

955
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,870
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

956
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,520
[ Together ]
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

957
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,428
Huh? I haven't?

958
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,799
Well, uh, as Old Reliable
used to say--

959
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:11,436
He'd say, uh, uh--
He'd say, uh--

960
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,838
Uh-- Hmm?

961
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,394
Doggone. [ Chuckles ]

962
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:24,072
You know, I clean forgot
what it was he used to say.

963
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,714
[ Laughs ]

964
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,191
[Chorus]
# Peace, my children #

965
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,233
# Of good will #

966
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,630
# Peace, my children #

967
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:48,392
# Peace, be still #

967
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
