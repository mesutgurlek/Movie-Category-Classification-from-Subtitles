1
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,238
No, I can't concentrate!

2
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,399
Maestro, I'm sorry,
but I can't carry on like this.

3
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,196
Let's take itfrom number37.

4
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,325
Oh, my God! No! No!

5
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,400
Maestro, Iet's take it
from ''Qui e aItrove''.

6
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:31,000
Stop! Stop!

7
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,485
I can't stand it anymore!

8
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,596
- It's ridicuIous.
- Poorthing, are you hurt?

9
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,925
It's ridiculous!
This is ''Macbeth'' by Giuseppe Verdi.

10
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,481
l've neverseen such
Iousy direction!

11
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,598
-We have a probIem?
-Yes, you!

12
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:51,243
This isn't one of your crud movies!
Birds on stage, bad projection!

13
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,676
ls this an opera or
an amusement park?

14
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,720
How can l sing with a raven on stage
that hates me?

15
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,919
- I can't imagine why it hates you.
- Neither can l.

16
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:04,005
But it nevertakes
its beady eyes off me!

17
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,925
lt shrieks, whistIes,
flaps its wings.

18
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,403
- lt destroys my performance.
- It's just a bird.

19
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:13,564
It shouId be with the other birds and
not in the Opera singing ''Macbeth''!

20
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,996
Where is the manager Baddini?

21
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,482
- I'm here, Mara.
- l'm going back to the hoteI.

22
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,723
Come on, Mara! Don't be like that.

23
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,566
l shaIl be ready to sing at 8:00.

24
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,157
Ready to sing without ravens
and other nonsense, a real opera!

25
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:30,957
-What we do now?
-Carry on with the rehearsaI!

26
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,879
If something like this happens again,
I'Il take my ravens and leave.

27
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:39,636
Maestro, we'lI take it
from where we stopped.

28
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:52,516
Thanks to you and your so caIIed
brilliant and original direction!

29
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:57,842
The great Mara Cecova
has been knocked down by a car!

30
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,957
QuickIy, call an ambulance!

31
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,363
Where is Betty?

32
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,682
Whata disaster!

33
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,246
- Hello?
- Is that you, Betty?

34
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,206
Tonight you make yourdebut
as Lady Macbeth.

35
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,318
-What?
-Are you happy?

36
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,086
Who is speaking?

37
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,043
ls this a joke?

38
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:57,676
HeIlo?

39
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,678
Come on, Betty! Get ready.

40
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,765
ln exactIy one hour
you've got to be on stage.

41
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:57,082
Mara Cecova has had an accident.

42
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,760
Someone aIready caIled.
I thought it was a joke!

43
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,765
Are you scared
of making your debut?

44
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,681
No, but Lady Macbeth! l'm too young,
my voice isn't right.

45
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,560
You'Il be a smash hit!
A baby Lady!

46
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,917
l won't reach some of the notes.

47
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,641
l'm not onIy youragent,
l'm yourfriend.

48
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:20,282
l know what you're going through,
just opening-night nerves.

49
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,797
Don't Iet them show.
Now they're alI coming to see you.

50
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,395
Don't show them
how unconfident you are.

51
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,676
Stop!

52
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,882
My dear Betty, are we ready?

53
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:34,006
Mara's unfortunate little accident

54
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,324
is going to speed you towards your
destiny. You'lI be Lady Macbeth.

55
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,445
Do l see tears?
Tears ofhappiness, l hope.

56
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,446
Don't telI me you're afraid.
Afraid you'Il fail?

57
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,643
I'm too young forthe role.

58
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,918
Verdi's first Lady Macbeth
was only seventeen!

59
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,676
You know the opera by heart.

60
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:57,046
I watched you atall rehearsals
working so hard preparing yourseIf.

61
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,920
As though you were the star
and not the understudy.

62
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:06,326
Don't worry about the orchestra. They
only need half an hour's rehearsal.

63
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,447
Stop it, this is your big chance.

64
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,685
- l know.
- Think of your mother.

65
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:16,800
She wouId be proud to see you in
a great opera folIowing her career.

66
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:20,237
If peopIe Iike you, you'lI be
singing in New York and SaIzburg.

67
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,799
What happened to Mara?

68
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,647
She got hit by a car
orso l heard.

69
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:30,676
You're Iistening to Pokrovskij's
recording of''Macbeth''!

70
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:34,516
Did you know
it was a production of ours? 1975!

71
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,120
''Macbeth'' brings bad Iuck!

72
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,080
-Whatare you talking about?
- Everyone says it.

73
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,198
''Macbeth'' brings bad Iuck!

74
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:47,206
l would much rather make my debut
in something else.

75
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:49,158
Don't let Baddini
hearyou say that!

76
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:50,322
Shut up!

77
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,039
You think the opera brings bad luck.

78
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,762
- It's whatever everyone says.
- I don't say it.

79
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,877
You have a wonderfuI voice,
you are very beautifuI

80
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,279
and you're making your debut
in a great theatre.

81
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:06,395
You must make the most
of this opportunity.

82
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,403
lt usuaIly only happens
in the movies.

83
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:13,837
Don't throw it away!

84
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

85
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,276
Now!

86
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,245
Let herthrough!

87
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:12,999
There is too much smoke.

88
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:15,601
There is too much smoke.

89
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,242
Dino, cut the smoke!

90
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,597
The scar must be on the otherside!

91
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,118
- Betty goes on in another 2 minutes.
- Ok, 2 minutes for Betty.

92
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,923
- Be careful, she could hurt herseIf.
- Two minutes!

93
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:33,716
-What are you doing?
- Leave it!

94
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:38,845
- No! Stop it!
- Good Iuck!

95
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,164
-Gota light?
-Yes.

96
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,086
The chorus.

97
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,561
The spotIight!

98
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,000
I wanted three of them.

99
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,363
Be careful with the costume!

100
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,475
You finalIy returned!

101
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:24,719
What are you doing here?
You are not allowed in here.

102
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,237
This box is for stage personnel only!
Come on, Iet's go!

103
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:43,197
What the helI do you...

104
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,680
Keep going! It was an accident!

105
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,959
Nothing more!

106
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,724
Okay, Maestro.

107
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,637
WeIl done, Betty!
You're so beautifuI!

108
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,997
That's enough, Mara!
Don't be childish.

109
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:33,278
-You're a star!
-You realIy think so?

110
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:36,399
- Didn't you hear the appIause?
-You were wonderful!

111
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:40,923
My sincerestcompIiments!
You were sensational!

112
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,036
Thank you.

113
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,920
There'Il be a first night party
Iateron.

114
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:50,484
-Thank you.
-You were magnificent.

115
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,719
- Thank you, Maestro.
-WilI you be at the reception?

116
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:57,242
- The press wiIl Iove it.
-The press are here.

117
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:01,361
What about the accident with
the Iights? The screaming?

118
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,240
-What screaming?
-You didn't hear it?

119
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,558
lt came from one of the boxes!

120
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,236
Mark!

121
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,284
Wasn't she great?

122
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:18,475
l know we had some trouble, but it
has nothing to do with ''Macbeth''!

123
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:22,199
The onIy bad Iuck with ''Macbeth''
is about the use of fame.

124
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,000
l know, my mother was a singer.

125
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,920
Run along.
PeopIe wiIl be waiting foryou.

126
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,398
Fantastic!

127
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:49,040
l mean it! You were just fantastic!
You were great!

128
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,920
I just love Verdi's music!

129
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,766
Oh, God! You were just wonderful!

130
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:59,278
That damned director!
I can't take him anymore.

131
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,358
Do you work here
in the theatre?

132
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,846
You are a fan of mine!

133
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,158
-The first!
- First what?

134
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,278
- Fan!
- Congratulations.

135
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,762
Thank you. You want an autograph?

136
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:30,361
Yes! I'd like that.
Thank you.

137
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,202
-What name shaIl I...
-Alan!

138
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:46,797
-Thank you.
-Are you a foreigner?

139
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,806
They're aIl waiting for you,
lnspector.

140
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,642
-You're a poIiceman, not a fan.
- Can'ta policeman be a fan?

141
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:01,555
l'm notan expert on opera,
but yourvoice...

142
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,598
Thank you forthat autograph.

143
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,881
-What'd the cop want?
-My autograph.

144
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,766
Why is he here?

145
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,243
Maybe because of the accident
with the lights.

146
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,478
One of the stagehands died.
Pretty weird!

147
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,118
Leave your costume there.
Mark says it needs a few aIterations.

148
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:33,917
l don't want to go to the party
alone. WouId you like to take me?

149
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,835
Sure, l'd Iove to.
You were great tonight.

150
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,797
Seems l'm the last one
to congratuIate you.

151
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,837
Think I might have a kiss?

152
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:47,079
Even if I'm only the stage manager?

153
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,284
Did you reaIly like me?

154
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,205
l Ioved you!

155
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,638
From the great Mara Cecova.

156
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,436
-With her bestwishes.
-Thank you.

157
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:15,358
The great Mara Cecova can say she was
struck by the curse of''Macbeth''!

158
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:21,198
''Good Iuck, IittIe snake.''

159
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,958
You can certainly feel
her sting there.

160
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,356
Looks expensive.

161
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,681
-What do you think it is?
-Who knows?

162
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,685
Frog's lime? Acid?

163
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:46,036
Poison?

164
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,798
What's wrong?

165
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,964
Idiot!

166
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:11,196
Cecova would bathe in that stuff!

167
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:46,203
Damned birds!

168
00:27:17,967 --> 00:27:20,845
l'm sorry, I can't.
lt's not yourfauIt.

169
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:24,484
l'm a disaster in bed.
l don't know why. l'm sorry.

170
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:29,082
According to the legend,
opera singers are incredibIy horny!

171
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:33,116
They say they make Iove
before they go out on stage.

172
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:37,877
That sortof relaxes their voices.

173
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,879
Either l'm a Iousy
opera singer or...

174
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,719
Have I offended you?

175
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:51,447
Now that you're famous, things
are a bit different between us.

176
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,717
Don't say that, it's not true.

177
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:02,800
What a pIace! Looks like a museum.

178
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:06,687
It sort of is.
I've got a rich uncle.

179
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:11,240
lt's his place. He Iets me use it
whenever I need it.

180
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,038
- Do you want some tea?
-Yes, please.

181
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:19,798
I've got rose,

182
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:21,999
jasmine or mint.

183
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,477
-Jasmine.
- OK.

184
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,199
No! Mint!

185
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:51,277
Take a good look!
If you try to close youreyes

186
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:53,279
you'lI tear them apart!

187
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,639
You'Il have to watch
everything.

188
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,158
Why'd you Iock it?

189
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:05,998
Are you feeIing okay?

190
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,198
What the heIl is going on?

191
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,123
It's not true you're frigid.

192
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,958
You're a bitch on heat.

193
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:38,924
- Hello?
- There's been a murder

194
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,637
at 6666 ViaIe Pegaso.

195
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,518
Who's speaking?

196
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,564
My God! Look what success
has done to you!

197
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:21,925
Come on! l wantto get the papers.
I want to read the reviews.

198
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:32,956
Something's wrong with your eyes?
Stage Iights?

199
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:35,078
Yes, the lights.

200
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:38,404
-What Iights?
- It wasn't the Iights.

201
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,759
How do you turn on the heating?

202
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:53,761
- That bad, was it?
- I can't teIl you.

203
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:58,999
lt was so... l can't teIl you!

204
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:02,515
-Trouble in love?
- Love?

205
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:07,036
What love?
Whenever a woman has a problem,

206
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:09,482
men always presume it's Iove!

207
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,167
You sopranos are famous for...

208
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,922
- ...whoring around?
- Now wait a minute.

209
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:19,477
Look, I've aIready heard
that story tonight.

210
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:25,158
Some peopIe think we make love before
going on stage to improve the voice.

211
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:30,764
As faras I am concerned
they are totaIly wrong.

212
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:32,878
You've never made love?

213
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,084
Of course l have.

214
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,604
It's just...

215
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:41,005
lt's neverworked.

216
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:45,996
Anyway, you aIso work in movies.

217
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:49,400
And you movie people are Iegendary
when itcomes to...

218
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:54,124
That's true. I aIways jerk off
before I shoot a scene.

219
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:01,079
You'II have to taIk about it
soon or later.

220
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,479
And then I ran away and l found you.

221
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,804
The strangest thing about
what happened tonight,

222
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:32,158
alI the terrible things l saw,

223
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,923
are from a nightmare
l used to have as a child.

224
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:42,996
l used to dream of a man
wearing a black hood.

225
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:48,002
- Tonight l saw that same hood.
-You said you caIled the police.

226
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,796
- Did you give your name?
- No.

227
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:56,324
ToId Mira then?

228
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,438
About what happened tonight? Yes.

229
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:00,998
Why, there's more, right?

230
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,446
I'Il check the other rooms.

231
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,486
Have you got a boyfriend?

232
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:35,242
-Someone who might get jeaIous?
- Not that I know of. Why?

233
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,200
Someone is watching the windows
with binoculars.

234
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,284
-Where?
-Come and see.

235
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:48,638
He's gone.
He was there underthe street lamp.

236
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,598
l could stay if you want me to.

237
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,202
Don't you have someone
waiting for you?

238
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:22,363
She's probably having a fit
because you're not home yet.

239
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,282
I'Il lock myseIfin. Don't worry.

240
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:29,198
Make sure you lock alI the windows.

241
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:32,285
l'lI look around in the street.
lf I see anything suspicious

242
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:36,958
l'lI phone you.
If not, see you tomorrow.

243
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:39,916
What is it?

244
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,683
There is someone out there!

245
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,202
Awoman.

246
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,922
Who is there?
Who are you?

247
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:55,763
I live here.

248
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:59,243
- I'm one of your neighbours.
-Was that man Iooking for me?

249
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,802
No. It's nothing.

250
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,238
l've told you, nothing!

251
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:10,806
-Who do you think she is?
-A neighbour, like she said.

252
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,355
Put the chain on.

253
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,842
I don'twant to lose anotherstar.

254
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,639
Who is it?

255
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,566
Who's there?

256
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:07,686
Who's there?

257
00:40:11,487 --> 00:40:12,476
HeIlo?

258
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,238
ls that you, Mark?

259
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,362
Mark, is that you?

260
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,317
Oh, my God!
Why did l sing that roIe?

261
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,558
I shouldn't have!

262
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,358
lt was myfauIt.

263
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:46,437
Why did l do it?

264
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,401
Don'tcry, Betty. Don't cry!

265
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:05,116
Stormy reception from ''Macbeth''.

266
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:07,798
''BriIIiant debut by young singer

267
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:10,680
who at the Iast moment
substituted Mara Cecova.''

268
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:15,125
''RevoIutionary, butcrazy set.
Doubts regarding the direction.''

269
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:18,364
''Advice to the director:
go back to horrorfilms.''

270
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:19,920
''Forget opera!''

271
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,798
They're pulIing you to pieces.

272
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:26,636
-At least it's onIy on paper.
-And she, a totaIly unknown,

273
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:29,919
gets nothing but praise.
- She was very good.

274
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:34,040
When they Iauded CeciIia Gasdia and
blasted your direction of''RigoIetto''

275
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,965
you were very pissed off,
but not this time.

276
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:39,006
How come?

277
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:43,279
You want to take the girl to bed,
don't you?

278
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:48,556
To be here with you this evening,
l took two flights

279
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:51,155
and turned down a fashion show.

280
00:41:58,087 --> 00:42:02,080
Fragments of the same feathers
mixed with traces ofblood

281
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:05,756
were found on a carpet
in Stefano Brini's apartment.

282
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:09,479
-What was he? Your...
-Stage manager.

283
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:13,917
Ah, yes, stage manager.

284
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:17,919
Killed, or rather, butchered,

285
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,239
last night
between 1:00 and 2:00 o'cIock.

286
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,045
Who saw him Iast?

287
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:28,843
There was a first-night party.

288
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,799
- Did he leave alone?
- l don't know. l wasn't there.

289
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,517
I see. Who did go to this party?

290
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:39,197
- Did you?
-Yes, I did.

291
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,999
What time did he leave?

292
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:44,839
I think he left with Betty,
our singer.

293
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,766
- ls Betty here?
- No, butshe wiII be soon.

294
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:50,606
-We have to rehearse.
- I'm not finished yet.

295
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:55,198
You are Maurizio, right?
The one responsibIe forthe ravens.

296
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:58,084
- How many were kilIed?
- Three.

297
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:01,006
lnspector,
l know who kiIled the ravens.

298
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,920
-Who?
- Mara Cecova hated them.

299
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,560
What are you taIking about?
Don't be ridicuIous.

300
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,359
Ravens are very vindictive.
They don't forget.

301
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:15,162
They rememberforyears
and at the right moment...Zap!

302
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:18,883
This ''Macbeth'' has been hit
by so much bad luck

303
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:21,043
and so many coincidences.

304
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:24,523
- It staggers the imagination.
- I don't want you to think...

305
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:28,316
I'm a superstition type, but it's
''Macbeth'' that brings bad Iuck.

306
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:30,199
Everyone knows that.

307
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,444
l couId teII you about dozens
of strange incidents.

308
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:37,117
A lot of peopIe believe
the opera to be cursed.

309
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:43,005
I've seen a Iot of your movies.
You are an expert in this field.

310
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,881
l'd be very interested to know
your opinion.

311
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:49,363
lt's unwise to use movies as guides
for reaIity, isn't it, lnspector?

312
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,718
It depends what you mean by reality.

313
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:55,044
l've gotto fix this dress
before the next performance

314
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,158
and l've got onIy two hands!

315
00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:00,324
With ten hands, the costumes
wouId stiIl be a pile of shit!

316
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:02,036
What?

317
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,718
AIright, Mister Genius Director!

318
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:10,199
l put most ofthe blame
on ourfancy pants director here

319
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:13,364
who thinks Verdi was a twit
and Shakespeare an asshole!

320
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:17,241
l'II fix the dress, but not foryou,
for Giuseppe Verdi!

321
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,559
Let's get out ofhere.

322
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,881
-AlI this turns you on, doesn't it?
-Whatare you talking about?

323
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:30,277
-You're a sadist!
- RealIy?

324
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:33,126
Everyone who knows you
says the same thing.

325
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,442
That must be boring forthem.

326
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,839
-Just the person l wanted to see!
-What's happened to my costume?

327
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:08,039
Look at this mess.
Someone tore it apart.

328
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:12,280
Someone who doesn't Iike the opera
orthatasshoIe Mark's version of it.

329
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:14,762
This time he O.D.ed on weird.

330
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:20,202
It's not like movies, where you're
congratulated on originaI ideas.

331
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:22,436
Oh, God!

332
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,038
Whata mess!

333
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:29,682
lt's got to be mended and without
a dressmaker, it's up to me.

334
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:33,040
You'lI have to try iton again
once I've finished.

335
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:40,200
We're Iucky though, most of
this junk jewellery'sintact.

336
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:42,557
I'Il be back in a minute.

337
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,965
- Mira, l must see you. l'm frantic.
- Me too.

338
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:09,681
My phone keeps ringing.
Everybody wants you.

339
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:12,196
Rome, Vienna, Paris!

340
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:17,527
l have to taIk to you about something
eIse. Something really serious.

341
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:21,198
A maniac is after me. l need
youradvice on what to do.

342
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:22,646
l'lI give itto you now.

343
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:24,923
- Go to the police.
- l can't.

344
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:28,119
I'm in terribIe trouble.

345
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:30,558
Mira, l must see you.

346
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:32,519
Alright, I'll come by this evening.

347
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:34,835
What have you done?

348
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,006
Is that you?

349
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:26,196
Who's there?

350
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,726
lt's you! Look!

351
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:05,836
Come!

352
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:09,759
- Look what l've found.
-What about it?

353
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,557
It's gold! I neversewed any reaI
goId on this. lt's yours.

354
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:15,918
l never saw it before.

355
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:20,525
- How did it get on my costume?
- Don't know.

356
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:23,680
Maybe whoever ripped up
the dress, dropped it.

357
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:26,162
Give me that!

358
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:31,324
lt Iooks like there's a date
and an inscription.

359
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,116
- Let me see.
- The letters are faded away.

360
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:38,123
I've got a magnifying gIass
somewhere.

361
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:40,164
l'm sure I have.

362
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,358
lt should be in...

363
00:48:42,927 --> 00:48:43,916
Damn!

364
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,037
It shouId be here.

365
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:51,801
Darn it!

366
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,964
-Any luck?
- No!

367
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,961
l'm positive I saw it!

368
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,558
Wait! It is in here.

369
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:11,846
Where is it?

370
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:19,082
-What happened? Betty?
- l'm alright. Don't worry.

371
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,164
It's gotto be here.
l saw it in a drawer.

372
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:33,557
You keep on Iooking here.
l'lI check the ironing room.

373
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:00,238
l found it!

374
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:08,796
l found it.
You enjoyed last night, whore!

375
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:11,438
You opera singers are
aIl whores!

376
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:27,358
There's a date!

377
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,398
lt's an anniversary, l guess.

378
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:44,084
Where have you gone?

379
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:48,196
Oh, my God!

380
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:14,956
ls this what you want?

381
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,198
ls this what you want?

382
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,043
Here!

383
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,156
Have it!

384
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,885
Bastard!

385
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:12,276
It's...

386
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:29,965
I'Il take you whenever

387
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:33,443
and wherever l want.

388
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:07,876
HeIlo!

389
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:19,242
Let go of me!

390
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,596
Leave me alone!

391
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,281
These marks. Who did this to you?

392
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,846
Is this another manifestation
of the curse of''Macbeth''?

393
00:56:29,607 --> 00:56:31,438
Or did it happen Iast night?

394
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,118
So it did happen last night.

395
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:38,522
Why didn't you telI me?

396
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:42,799
Because

397
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,800
it was worse than anything
I could ever have imagined.

398
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,119
ljust wanted to cancel it
from my mind.

399
00:56:53,407 --> 00:56:57,036
Not see anything,
not feel anything...

400
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:02,239
Not think anything,
just getaway!

401
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:04,244
l understand what you're saying.

402
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:08,606
I'm here to help you,
not to persecute you.

403
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,406
And I promise we'Il do our best
to catch this man.

404
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:14,522
But I need your colIaboration.

405
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,078
I don't know what he looks Iike.

406
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,598
He ties me up.

407
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:28,886
Touches me.

408
00:57:31,327 --> 00:57:35,081
Makes me watch,
but he never Iets me see his face.

409
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:42,925
This afternoon

410
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:46,560
at the theatre he killed Julia,
the wardrobe mistress.

411
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:49,839
-Christ! l'd betterget over there!
- No, please!

412
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:54,800
Don't worry. We'lI get to the bottom
of this. l'II be back.

413
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:58,724
Don't Ieave me alone!
l'm afraid.

414
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:02,118
AIright. Listen.

415
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:05,246
You go upstairs
and Iock yourself in.

416
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:08,640
l'lI send you my assistant,
Daniele Soave.

417
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:10,316
Alright.

418
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:16,883
Daniele Soave, he'lI know
whatto do in case of trouble.

419
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:39,558
-Who is it?
- DanieIe Soave.

420
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:41,678
Did the inspectortell you
I'd be coming?

421
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:42,796
Yes, he did.

422
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:07,798
Good evening. May I come in?

423
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:10,761
Yes, of course.

424
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:14,883
My eyes hurt,
so l put some drops in them.

425
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:16,635
May l take a look around?

426
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,556
Go ahead.

427
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:24,316
In a minute l'lI be right with you.

428
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:29,596
-Are you nervous?
-A IittIe. No, a lot!

429
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:32,879
- I'm here, so you can reIax.
- l wiIl, thank you.

430
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:35,601
I have a great system for reIaxing.

431
00:59:48,447 --> 00:59:50,756
''You are feeIing very calm.''

432
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:54,646
''CaIm and reIax.''

433
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:59,920
''Concentrate...''
Only on the music.

434
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:05,085
''Breathe deepIy.''

435
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:07,916
''One!''

436
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:09,956
''Two!''

437
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:11,956
''Three!''

438
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:13,876
''Four!''

439
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:18,446
- Did you calI, Miss?
- No, l'm listening to a tape.

440
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,166
lf you need me...

441
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:49,644
l'lI get it.

442
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:55,563
-Are you expecting someone?
-Yes, a friend.

443
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:59,516
-Check who it is before opening.
- I know it's her.

444
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:05,598
ls that you, Mira?

445
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,396
It's her!

446
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,276
I read the papers.
How terribIe!

447
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:20,360
- l'm getting worse.
- ls someone here?

448
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:22,318
Yes, Vienna and Paris!

449
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:28,603
The kiIler kilIed again.
Julia. l was there!

450
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:32,487
Now l understand why
the poIice are watching you.

451
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:36,123
Who told you that the police
are watching me?

452
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:38,642
The officerdownstairs
in the halI.

453
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:42,442
He asked me who I was and where
I was going. His name is Soave.

454
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,556
Yes, that's right.

455
01:01:49,887 --> 01:01:53,038
- But he's in the Iiving room.
-Who's in the living room?

456
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,641
-You're not making sense!
-Come!

457
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,962
-Who is he, Betty?
- I don't know.

458
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:21,200
- He could be the maniac.
- He's gone. He was in there.

459
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,598
Call the poIice!

460
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:27,239
The phone's overthere!
I'm too scared to go in.

461
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:30,760
He may be hiding, waiting.

462
01:02:34,607 --> 01:02:35,926
Let's get out ofhere.

463
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:41,035
Wait!

464
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:45,280
What if this one is real and
the one downstairs is the maniac?

465
01:02:45,487 --> 01:02:47,478
What if it's the otherway round?

466
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,880
l've no desire to find out
eitherway.

467
01:02:51,327 --> 01:02:54,842
You're right. l didn't even
get a good Iook at him.

468
01:02:56,687 --> 01:02:57,676
The kitchen!

469
01:02:58,727 --> 01:02:59,716
It's a heavy door!

470
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:08,285
Knives, we can defend ourseIves.

471
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:18,646
l'd Iike to see him
get in here now.

472
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:23,642
We can aIways scream.
You are a singer. You can scream.

473
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:27,881
This buiIding is ancient. The walIs
are 3 feet thick. No one would hear.

474
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:55,003
Yes.

475
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:00,636
Alright.

476
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:03,638
Right away.

477
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:44,678
- Open the door. lt's Daniele Soave.
- He's out there.

478
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:48,600
The maniac's in the apartment.

479
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:51,803
You could be the maniac.

480

- No! l can't.

482
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:01,522
Waita second.
Now you can see it.

483
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:03,206
Anyone can get one.

01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:06,763
No, come on.

You may as weIl open the door now!

490
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:04,525
One way or another,
I'm coming in.

491
01:06:05,967 --> 01:06:07,958
You bastard!

492
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:10,518
Son of a bitch!

493
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:13,640
You're not going to get me!

494

''CaIm and reIax.''

497
01:06:44,847 --> 01:06:47,680
''Concentrate only on the music.''

498
01:06:49,327 --> 01:06:51,283
''Breathe deepIy.''

499
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:53,756
''One!''

500
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:55,436
''Two!''

501
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:56,756
''Three!''

502
01:06:57,287 --> 01:06:58,276
''Four!''

503
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:35,718
So he was the poIiceman.

504
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:27,596
Betty!

505
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,086

-Where does this lead to?
-To my apartment.

509
01:10:52,607 --> 01:10:55,326
-What were you doing in here?
- l discovered it.

510
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:58,007
It's the oId
air conditioning system.

511
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:01,284
l can get to any apartment l want.
Are you hungry?

512
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:03,678
No, of course not.

513
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:09,316
This apartment is empty.
l watch you aIl the time.

514
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:12,844
- RealIy?
- I like it when you sing.

515
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,282
-You have a beautifuI voice.
-Thank you.

516
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:27,279
I watched that person
trying to kiIl you tonight.

517
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:29,076
Why do you come up here?

518
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:32,597
- To get away when my parents fight.
-So they hit each other.

519
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:42,726
Here we are.

520
01:13:06,807 --> 01:13:09,879
He's gone!
You were very clever!

521
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:14,920
You're the cIeverone!
You saved my life.

522
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,443
Alma!

523
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:26,644
lt's my mother.

524
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:34,242
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

525
01:13:34,447 --> 01:13:37,200
- lt's you!
- Mom, this is Betty.

526
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:39,636
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't.

527
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:44,760
Last night you were outside my
apartment. You didn't see me.

528
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,196
Something terrible has happened.

529
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,921
Yeah, you coming in here.
Did you Iet her in, AIma?

530
01:13:50,087 --> 01:13:52,043
-Yes, she did.
- She's my friend.

531
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:54,283
- l have to caIl the police!
- Get out ofhere.

532
01:13:56,087 --> 01:13:58,078
- She's my friend!
- Shut up!

533
01:13:58,207 --> 01:13:59,845
Where's the phone?

534
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:02,836
Get out!

535
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:06,126
Alright, I'm going,
but you calI the police.

536
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:09,602
You're so filthy! Disgusting!

537
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:12,241
You're disgusting!
You're aIways naked!

538
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:14,676
That's enough! Go to your room!

539
01:16:16,247 --> 01:16:18,158
What are you doing here?

540
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,642
Mark!
Did you hear what happened?

541
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:23,804
l phoned yourapartment
and spoke to a poIiceman.

542
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,882
- l didn't think you'd come here.
- ljust wanted to run.

543
01:16:28,647 --> 01:16:31,719
Hide! Everywhere scares me

544
01:16:32,847 --> 01:16:36,157
except here!
l feel safe here.

545
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,756
- l'lI sIeep in my dressing room.
- Betty?

546
01:16:43,127 --> 01:16:47,006
There'll be a Iot of noise.
The stagehands are working.

547
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:50,115
- l've made a change in the show.
-What change?

548
01:16:50,287 --> 01:16:53,962
Don't worry about it, but I thought
of a way to identify the killer.

549
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:56,317
l don't know
why I didn't think ofit before.

550
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:59,038
We have an eye witness.

551
01:16:59,727 --> 01:17:02,400
If the maniac
is in the audience tomorrow night,

552
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:05,843
I've got him!

553
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:11,442
-What ifhe doesn't come?
- He'Il come.

554
01:17:15,407 --> 01:17:19,161
l'm so tired, ljust wantto sleep.

555
01:17:19,327 --> 01:17:20,919
To sIeep?

556
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:24,677
Achance to dream, huh?

557
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:29,076
Ay, there's the rub,
for in that sleep of death

558
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:32,279
what dreams may come, when we have
shuffIed off this mortaI coil,

559
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:34,875
must give us pause.

560
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:19,046
ls thatyou, mommy?

561
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:36,801
I just had the same nightmare that
l used to have when I was a chiId.

562
01:19:37,447 --> 01:19:40,120
But I can't decide
whether it'sjust a dream

563
01:19:40,247 --> 01:19:43,045
orthe memory of something
that realIy happened.

564
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:43,400
What do you think ofit?

565
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,440
Relax! Everything is fine.

566
01:20:50,607 --> 01:20:52,040
We'll get him.

567
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:54,198
- But when?
-Any time now.

568
01:20:57,807 --> 01:20:59,365
Any time now.

569
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,436

570
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:00,402
Now!

571
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:39,878
Is this supposed to happen?

572
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:27,276
Betty!

573
01:24:27,607 --> 01:24:30,201
-ToId you we'd get him tonight!
-You're a genius!

574
01:25:31,767 --> 01:25:33,723
lt's the policeman!

575
01:25:34,887 --> 01:25:36,286
Extraordinary!

576
01:25:37,327 --> 01:25:39,363
Why on earth wouId he do it?

577
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:44,243
Not a sound!

578
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:46,886
Come!

579
01:25:59,407 --> 01:26:01,398
Just like your mother.

580
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:05,401
Your voice's the same as hers.

581
01:26:06,087 --> 01:26:07,076
Your body!

582
01:26:07,647 --> 01:26:10,844
Even yourskin.
Oh, God, how much l...

583

I don't want to kiIl you.

584
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:19,243
She taught me that little game,

585
01:26:20,127 --> 01:26:22,925
kilIing, torturing
and then I wouId have her.

586
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:25,926
l was her slave! Come...

587
01:27:00,447 --> 01:27:01,436
Sit down.

I saw you Iast night.

590
01:27:14,927 --> 01:27:16,918
l thought it was a miracle.

591
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:24,276
Be stilI!

592
01:27:34,887 --> 01:27:36,923
There is something inside.

593
01:27:40,647 --> 01:27:44,083
You aren't a star Iike she was.

594
01:27:49,487 --> 01:27:52,718
Betty? l wantyou to stay alive.

595
01:27:53,807 --> 01:27:56,367
The people don't understand.

596
01:27:58,247 --> 01:28:00,124
Now it's alI over.

597
01:28:08,727 --> 01:28:11,287
How can you love me Iike this,
a monster?

598
01:28:16,607 --> 01:28:18,677
l don't want
you to watch me anymore.

599
01:28:32,567 --> 01:28:34,558
lt's better I die.

600
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:48,919
I want to burn.
No one must ever find me.

601
01:28:56,447 --> 01:28:58,438
No one must ever find me.

602
01:28:59,687 --> 01:29:00,881
l want to disappear.

603
01:29:09,847 --> 01:29:11,439

01:33:11,607 --> 01:33:14,280
How do you want to pIay her?

631
01:33:15,407 --> 01:33:18,205
Tender? Timid? Sensual?

632
01:33:19,647 --> 01:33:21,046
Good morning.

633
01:33:22,007 --> 01:33:22,996
WeIl?

634
01:33:23,367 --> 01:33:25,961
I don't think the problem
exists any Ionger.

635
01:33:36,447 --> 01:33:38,403
I knew it!

636
01:34:39,127 --> 01:34:43,837
There is a surprising deveIopment in
the caseof the crime at the Opera.

637
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:49,596
You may remember the report that
the maniac inspector, Alan Santini,

638
01:34:49,807 --> 01:34:53,277
died in the fire that destroyed
one wing of the theatre.

639
01:34:53,447 --> 01:34:57,645
The police now inform us
that the remains of the body

640
01:34:57,767 --> 01:35:00,645
they had presumed was Santini's,
are not in fact human atall.

641
01:35:00,847 --> 01:35:03,156
-Oh, my God!
-But those of a theatricaI mannequin.

642
01:35:03,647 --> 01:35:05,638
The authorities realize

643
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:09,203
that Santini pIanned
this dramatic coup de theatre

644
01:35:09,367 --> 01:35:12,200
to give himseIf time to escape.

645
01:35:13,047 --> 01:35:15,481
A nationwide hunt is underway
for Santini

646
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:18,724
who is considered
to be extremeIy dangerous.

647
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:22,681
The police forces and InterpoI are
giving theirfulIest cooperation.

648
01:35:24,447 --> 01:35:28,122
Betty, he's not dead! He's aIive!

649
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:31,763
He's here! Run!
For God's sake, run!

650
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:33,316
Run!

651
01:36:42,407 --> 01:36:45,877
l am Iike my mother.
l realize it now.

652
01:36:51,407 --> 01:36:54,399
I wanted you to win,
to kiIl him.

653
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:00,519
l'm exactly like her!

654
01:37:04,807 --> 01:37:06,559
Come, we must get away.

655
01:37:07,487 --> 01:37:08,476
Come!

656
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:16,240
Before someone finds the body!

657
01:37:23,607 --> 01:37:25,279
Come, Iet us go!

658
01:37:52,407 --> 01:37:57,162
- There he is! HoId yourfire!
- Grab him!

659
01:38:15,287 --> 01:38:18,006
It's not true!
I'm not like my mother!

660
01:38:18,407 --> 01:38:21,558
Nothing Iike her!
Nothing ataIl!

661
01:38:21,727 --> 01:38:23,718
I didn't commit any crime!

662
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,158
I justwanted to set
theirsouIs free!

663
01:38:29,847 --> 01:38:31,485
Let me kilI him!

664
01:38:31,647 --> 01:38:34,559
l want to kiIl him!

665
01:38:44,527 --> 01:38:46,916
He wanted to kilI you, huh?

666
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:49,959
- Did you know we were coming?
-Yes, I did.

667
01:38:50,087 --> 01:38:52,157
I saw yourdogs
running through the trees.

668
01:38:55,047 --> 01:38:58,960
-We've been on his trail for2 days.
- l saw you taIking to him.

669
01:38:59,327 --> 01:39:01,761
What did you telI him to stop him
from kilIing you?

670
01:39:01,887 --> 01:39:05,721
Nothing.
A Iot of nonsense! Lies!

671
01:39:06,367 --> 01:39:09,359
He's a madman, totalIy crazy.

672
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:20,717
I no Iongerwanted
to see anybody.

673
01:39:22,287 --> 01:39:26,326
I wanted to escape altogether
because l'm different.

674
01:39:27,367 --> 01:39:30,484
I don't even vagueIy resemble others,
any of them.

675
01:39:31,767 --> 01:39:35,442
l Iike the wind. ButterfIies!

676
01:39:36,287 --> 01:39:38,755
Flowers! Leaves!

677
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,685
Insects! The rain!

678
01:39:43,447 --> 01:39:44,926
CIouds!

679
01:40:03,087 --> 01:40:05,043
There, my beauty.
