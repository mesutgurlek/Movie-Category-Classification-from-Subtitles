163
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,695
I'm sure you could.
I know I can.

164
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,322
That's what I said.
All right.
I think I will.

165
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,406
I'm listening.

166
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,910
Does your fiancée know
the lady of the yacht...

167
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,161
Gabriella?
Gabriella.

168
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,830
Why certainly.
She's her best friend.

169
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,750
(CHUCKLES)
Chummy little group.

170
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,878
(SIGHS)

171
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,590
(CLEARS THROAT)
You know, this ship
is going much too fast.

172
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,010
We ought
to take advantage
of every moment.

173
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,222
Don't you think
that life should be
gay and bright

174
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,557
and bubbly
like champagne?

175
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,892
I like pink champagne.

176
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,269
Yes, that's
the kind I mean,
pink champagne.

177
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,645
Is there any reason
why from now on

178
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,189
this trip shouldn't
be pink champagne?

179
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,525
Mmm-hmm.
What?

180
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,405
Oh, dear.

181
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,198
(CLEARS THROAT)

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,287
He wouldn't like it?

183
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,454
No.

184
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,373
Husband?
No.

185
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,375
He still
wouldn't like it?
No.

186
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,754
Why isn't he
traveling with you?

187
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,299
Because he had
to go to Texas
on a big merger.

188
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,466
Ah.

189
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,135
He thought it'd
be a good idea

190
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,971
if I took a little trip
while he consummated
this big deal

191
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,557
because I have no
head for business.

192
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,185
It's beyond me
how the more money
a corporation loses,

193
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,312
the more money
it makes,

194
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,564
because of
the carryovers
with the write-offs.

195
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,274
The big secret
seems to be

196
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,692
to merge
a sick corporation

197
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,152
with a big,
fat, healthy one

198
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,237
and then everybody
gets well.

199
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,488
Silly, isn't it?

200
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,656
He doesn't think
I'm dumb,

201
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,785
but he doesn't think
I'm very bright
about things like that.

202
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,079
Well, it isn't
necessary, is it?

203
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,165
Thank you.
That's all right.

204
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,044
Well, so he trusts you?

205
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,211
Implicitly.

206
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,423
No mistakes,
no errors,

207
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,633
no tiny
little slips?
Five faithful years.

208
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,718
Ah.

209
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,220
Sounds awful,
doesn't it,
but it's true.

210
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,264
Yes.
Well, there you are.

211
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,474
(CHUCKLING)

212
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,975
Cigarette?
No, thank you.

213
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,771
Oh, I don't...

214
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,899
You could light it
from that inscription,
couldn't you?

215
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,277
Oh. Oh, I like that.
I must stay tuned
into you.

216
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,530
Yes. He's a very
lucky fellow.

217
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,907
Must be
a remarkable man.

218
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,743
Well, you can imagine
how attractive he is

219
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,288
when I can resist
so charming a person
as...

220
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,958
Yes. Yes.
I understand.

221
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,418
Well, it was nice,
wasn't it?

222
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,045
(CLEARS THROAT)

223
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, well.

224
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,215
Well, there's still
deck tennis,
shuffleboard, bingo.

225
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,844
Well, don't tell me
you're embarrassed.

226
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,764
Yes. Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

227
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,516
Oh, I am sorry.

228
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,642
It's all right.
Don't apologize.

229
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,061
I do hope
it won't affect
your ego because...

230
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
No, please.
Please, don't think
anything of it.

231
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,273
I'll just take
my ego for a walk.

232
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,442
Unless, of course,
you'd care to...

233
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,568
Have dinner
with you?
Mmm.

234
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,070
I'd love to.

235
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,080
Here comes
my friend Ferrante now.

236
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,250
Oh, Mr. Ferrante,
I'd like to have you meet
my sister, Miss Hathaway

237
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,335
and my wife,
Mrs. Hathaway...

238
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,504
(LAUGHS)

239
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,512
And when
you were little,

240
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,473
what did your nurse
read to you at bedtime?

241
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,599
Let me see...

242
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,268
The Memoirs
of Casanova?

243
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,146
Every night,
and then we'd
turn out the light.

244
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,272
"We"?

245
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,731
I was only so big.

246
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,317
You must've had
a happy childhood.

247
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,610
Ah, yes.

248
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,904
And women?

249
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,072
Oh, women.

250
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,283
You've known
quite a few,
haven't you?

251
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,576
I don't know.

252
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,411
Or perhaps "few"
is the wrong word.

253
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,663
Let's say
it's not precise.

254
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,457
I beg your pardon,
Signor Ferrante.

255
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,460
Would you like me
to reserve this table
for you every night?

256
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,671
Why not?

257
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,755
Thank you.

258
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,049
Now, where were we?

259
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,510
And I suppose
they've all been madly
in love with you?

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,137
I doubt it.

261
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,097
But you haven't had
much respect for them.

262
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,432
On the contrary...

263
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,726
Still, you've always
been very fair
in your judgments.

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,146
Yes. I've been
more than fair.
I idealize them.

265
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,565
Every woman I meet,
I put up there.

266
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,733
Of course,
the longer I know her

267
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,234
and the better
I know her...

268
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,944
It's hard to
keep them up there,
isn't it?

269
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,070
Yes, isn't it?

270
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,239
Pretty soon,
the pedestal wobbles

271
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,283
and then topples.

272
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,411
C'est la vie,
et cetera.

273
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,165
Come on.
Let's talk about you.

274
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,084
(CHUCKLES)
No, not tonight.

275
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,420
We'll talk about me
some other time.

276
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,839
We've nothing planned
for tomorrow.

277
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,007
Oh, I have.

278
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,384
Oh, no.

279
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,762
We'll talk about me
tomorrow.

280
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,263
(CHUCKLES)

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,024
It turned out
beautifully, didn't it?

282
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,485
It's really warm.
Thank you.

283
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,072
Now, where were we?

284
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,366
You were going to tell me
where you were born.

285
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,493
That's right.
Well...
Mr. Ferrante?

286
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,619
Cablegram.

287
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,745
Thank you.

288
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,290
Excuse me,
Miss McKay.

289
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,251
Miss McKay?
Yes?

290
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,502
Oh, I have one
for you, too.

291
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,586
Oh.

292
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,547
Thank you.
You're welcome.

293
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,424
Excuse me,
Mr. Ferrante.

294
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,604
From him?

295
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,689
From her?

296
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

297
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,698
Well, where were we?

298
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,577
Well, I was about
to tell you
where I was born

299
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,246
and I was born
in Boston.

300
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,206
I can hardly wait
for you to grow up.

301
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,833
Yes. Well, be patient.

302
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,168
I grew up quickly.

303
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,004
(CHUCKLING)
Then I went
to New York

304
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,672
and got a job
singing in a nightclub

305
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,507
from 10:00 to 3:00
in the morning

306
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,925
and the manager
used to chase me

307
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,510
around the office
until about 4:00

308
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,387
and then... (WHISTLES)
I went home.

309
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,139
Did he ever...
Oh, no, no.

310
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,473
No, no.
No.

311
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,519
Well, then one evening,
he came along.

312
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,022
This is the fellow.
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,190
And he said,

314
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,569
"You don't belong in
a place like this."

315
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,279
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

316
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,865
And I said,
"I don't?"

317
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,908
(LAUGHS)

318
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,453
And well, then...
Mmm?

319
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,872
What?
What "what?"

320
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,332
I don't know,
I thought
you said something.

321
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,125
No, I didn't
say anything.

in a penthouse
on Park Avenue

of the East River.

328
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,979

and literature.

329
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,147

with that?

very nice.

it had better
be good-bye.

down there, why did...

You bring me up here?

That's an old joke,

Mmm-hmm.

You're quite sure
your grandmother
isn't an old joke?

would destroy.

The place he hasn't been,
the girl he hasn't met.

644
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,638
Perhaps I shouldn't
have met him.

645
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,143
No, my dear.
You are different.

646
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,188
I don't mind
confessing to you,

647
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,816
I have been worried
about him.

648
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,819
Sometimes I'm frightened.

649
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,987
Why?

650
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,742
That life will present
a bill to Nicolo one day

651
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,995
and he will find
it hard to pay.

652
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,171
But when
I see you with him,
I feel better.

653
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,049
Me? You do?

654
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,259
Yes. You.

(CHUCKLES)

656
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,848
Well, I wish I could
share your confidence.

657
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,726
You will have it
when you need it.

658
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,479
That is your character.

659
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,900
Oh, there is nothing
wrong with Nicolo

660
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,028
that a good woman
couldn't make right.

661
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,618

Well, I saw
Marius' entire family.
Seven daughters.

664
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,793
I congratulated him
and had a nice talk
with his wife.

665
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,505
You should have had
a nice talk with him.
And don't sit on my hat.

666
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,010
Tell me,
what have you two
been talking about?

667
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,179
Hmm.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

668
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,472
I'll bet I would.

669
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,349
And I'll bet
that Janou did
all the talking.

670
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,600
Mmm-hmm.

671
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,977
She's been telling me
that when you were
a little boy

672
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,145
and didn't get
your own way,

673
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,065
you'd lie on the floor
and kick and
get red in the face.

674
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,650
Really?

675
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,235
You should've
winked the other eye.

676
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,402
Oh.

677
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,738
And what did you say?

678
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,698
I said you didn't
do that anymore.

679
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,408
No!
No.

680
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,620
Now when you don't
get your own way,

681
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,163
you just
get embarrassed.

00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,418
Want some tea?

684
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,506
Remind me not
to explain that
to you later.

685
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,592
Yes, I want some tea.

686
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,427
Janou, I have
a gift for you.

687
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,637
JANOU: Oh!

688
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,556
Come and see it.

689
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,307
I am too old
for gifts.

690
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,268
No one's too old
for gifts.

691
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,687
You shouldn't
spend your money
so recklessly.

692
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,772
It didn't cost much.
Let me help you.

693
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,160
Oh, Nicolo.

694
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,457
How did you do it?

695
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,792
I did it from memory.

696
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,377

699
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,763
It's so real,
so like him.

700
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,683

701
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,728
Did you do that
from memory?

702
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,896
Yes.

703
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,522

704
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,150
Oh, it's wonderful.

I painted that
a long time ago,

706

but I hesitated
about giving it to you.

707
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,912
I told you
he has talent.

how to phrase it.

00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,702
Yes, yes, you did.
What?

966
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,498
You said I was very fond
of expensive things.

967
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,919
Furs and diamonds
and stuff like that.

968
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,713
Did I say that?
Mmm-hmm.

969
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,256
Pink champagne.

970
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:46,634
That's the kind of life
we've both been used to.

971
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,096
It might be
a little difficult to...

972
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,016
Do you like beer?

973
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,018
Mmm, mmm.
Different.

974
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,310
Mmm-hmm.

975
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:00,356
My father drank beer
in the morning.

976
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,358
He was a beer drinker?

977
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,860
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.

978
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,779
Later in the day,
he drank anything.

979
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,867
(SIGHS)

980
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,290
Oh, winter must be cold
for those with
no warm memories.

981
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,086
We've already
missed the spring.

982
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,715
Yes. Well,
this is probably
my last chance.

983
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,468
Mine, too.

984
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,805
It's now or never.

985
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,225
Hmm. "Never" is
a frightening word.

986
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,313
We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.

987
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,647
Mmm-hmm.

988
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,525
And just because
you haven't...

989
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,195
I haven't worked
doesn't mean to
say I couldn't, huh?

990
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,863
No, of course not.

991
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,240
Suppose, I...

992
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,744
It would take some time,
say, six months,
to find out if...

993
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,913
If? If what?
Well, just suppose.

994
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,206
Now, be realistic.

995
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,499
All right.

996
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,170
If I worked hard enough
and long enough,
say, for six months,

997
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,048
where would you be?

998
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,885
What are you trying
to say, Nickie?

999
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:16,432
Well, I just want to be
(VOICE CRACKING) worthy of
asking you to marry me.

1000
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,643
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh.

1001
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,105
Nickie, that's just
about the nicest...

1002
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,775
Your voice cracked.

1003
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,276
Oh, well,
that's because I...

1004
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,028
Yes, I know. I know.

1005
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,033
I'm going to
turn in now.

1006
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:38,162
Do some more
rolling and tossing

1007
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,164
and thinking about it.

1008
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,835
Let me tell you
in the morning, hmm?

1009
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,295
(SIGHS)

1010
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,589
It's going to
be a long night.

1011
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:49,924
Mmm-hmm.

1012
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,135
For me, too.

1013
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:02,311
Marriage is
a very serious step
for a girl like me.

1014
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,771
Yes, I know.

1015
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,656
Do you like children?

1016
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,449
Yes. Yes, I do.

1017
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,431
Nickie.

1018
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,849
Oh, I was so worried.

1019
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,976
I didn't even have
time to get dressed.

1020
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,020
I didn't get to
sleep until 5:00.

1021
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,771
I didn't sleep at all.
Oh.

1022
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,107
Now,
listen carefully.
Yes.

1023
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:52,403
If everything goes right,
and I mean for both
of us, in six months...

1024
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,447
Here. I started
to write it out.

1025
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,656
Should I read it now?
Mmm-hmm.

1026
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,158
All right.

1027
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,993
"Darling," that's me?
Mmm-hmm.

1028
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,163

my beloved,
July 1 at 5:00."

1029
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:03,748
But you don't
say where.

1030
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,625
You name the place
and I'll obey.

1031
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,460
I don't know.
I can't think.

1032
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,670
How about the top of
the Empire State Building?

1033
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,298
Oh, yes,
that's perfect.

1034
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,009
It's the nearest thing
to heaven we have
in New York.

1035
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,720
The 102nd floor,
and don't forget to
take the elevator.

(CHUCKLES)
No, I won't.

1037
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,393
Darling, if things
don't work out...

1038
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,770
Don't talk like that.
I'm not listening.

1039
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:26,896
But just in case
one of us is...

1040
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,773
We'll both be there.

1041
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,066
Hold the thought.

1042
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,150
Hold the thought.

1043
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,319
Take care.
Take care.

Well, I'm so glad
to see you.
How've you been?

1053
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,538
I'm so glad to see you.
Did you have a good trip?

1054
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,124
Not too bad.
A little rough in spots,
but very pleasant.

for a picture.

to see Pinky?

too, please?

Thank you.

No, I think he's on
his way to Tangier.

another one, please?

off someplace. Yes.

It's been so long.

Oh, it's wonderful
to have you back.

to be back, Ken.

Shall we?

there's something
I must discuss with you.

so let's go in here

alone and quiet...

is all this?

1079

Didn't I mention it?
What?

01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,484
Dear, the TV people
have been after me

1081

so I finally said yes

if they give
a big donation

1083
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,989
to my favorite charity,
and they did.

You don't mind,
do you, darling?
It's for a good cause.

1085
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,784
I wish you'd
let me know.

Oh, listen,
I know you.

1087

I'd never have got
you off the ship.

1088

Camera one,
take close-ups.

1089
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,876
Oh, Nickie, dear,
this is Mr. Lewis who's
going to interview us.

1090

Mr. Fulton Q. Lewis.

01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,838
Robert Fulton,
how do you do?

1093
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,174
No, Robert Q. Lewis,
but everybody does that.

1094
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,633
Please, look,
you're a little late,

1095
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,801
and we've got
to go on the air.

1096
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,470
Would you mind
coming over here,
Miss Clark, please?

1097
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,138
Just sit yourselves
right down here.

1098
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,224
I'm going to ask
a few questions,
then we're going to...

1099
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,061
What about his face?
Shiny. Look, Harry.

1100
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,105
Would you mind
a little makeup?
Harry, just blot it.

1101
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,483
I'm sorry, darling.
It'll be over with soon.

1102
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:41,567
I hope so.

1103
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,237
Oh, incidentally,
that white shirt,
how about that?

1104
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,489
Glares.

1105
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,990
You don't happen to
have a blue shirt?

1106
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,116
No, not with me.

1107
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,827
Well, yes.
Well, look, don't worry.
We'll manage.

1108
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,329
Let me explain
what I'm going to do.

1109
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,122
I'd like to ask
a few questions
about how you met...

1110
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,707
Just a few.
I will.

1111
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,293
Just how you met,
what your plans are
and things like that.

1112
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,337
You make yourselves
comfortable.
Thank you.

1113
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,505
MAN: Five seconds,
Mr. Lewis.

1114
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,547
Right.

1115
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,758
Now, then, one thing,
watch the camera.

1116
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,885
When the red light
is on, you're on.

1117
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,720
Yeah? Well, it's on.

1118
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,476
Oh, hello there,
and welcome to another
House to House program,

1119
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,522
brought to you
by the Benton
Baby Food Company.

1120
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,275
Remember, Benton's
builds better babies.

1121
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:27,029
Today, our cameras are
placed in the home
of Miss Lois Clark,

1122
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,865
heiress to one of
America's greatest fortunes.

1123
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,451
In just a moment,
we'll meet Miss Clark

1124
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,870
and her fiancé,
Mr. Nickie Ferrante

1125
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,707
and talk to them about
their wonderful
true-to-life romance

1126
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,253
which has gotten
headlines in papers
all over the country.

1127
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:46,423
A romance which has
captured the imagination
of the whole world.

1128
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,925
But first...

1129
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,677
Do you think
they're in love?

1130
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,013
I wouldn't know,
Gladys.

1131
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,391
I can't wait to see
that Nickie Ferrante.

1132
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,601
I don't know what
the $64 million
question was,

1133
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,770
but he's certainly
got the answer.

1134
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:01,313
(DOOR OPENS)

1135
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,401
Point killer.

1136
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,697
Terry, darling.

WOMAN SINGING ON TV:
So buy Baby Soft

1138

Buy Baby Soft

1139
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,330
Hmm.

1140
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,916
Remind me to
ask you later

1141
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,377
why your kisses don't
seem quite the same.

1142
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,463
Maybe you're just out
of practice, I hope.

1143
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,424
Yum, yum

1144
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,593
We don't need that
darn thing on, do we?

(TURNS OFF TV)

1148
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,268
I see you haven't
changed yet.

1149
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,519
I thought I gave
you plenty of time

1150
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,604
to get into
something more...

1151
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:45,190
Well, Ken, we have
so much to talk about

1152
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,527
and I can
just think better
in this outfit.

1153
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,698
You know, darling,
I hoped the trip
would be good for you,

1154
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,035
but I'm afraid you
don't look so well.

1155
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,246
What's the matter?
Was it a rough crossing?

1156
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,498
(STAMMERING)

1157
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,792
Yes, yes.
Yes, it was a little.

1158
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,336
Oh.

1159
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,297
You know, Ken,
that program might
have been amusing.

1160
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:12,635
Lois Clark and
Nickie Ferrante were
about to come on.

(CHUCKLES)

1162
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,305
I'm only interested
in you, dear, but if
it'll entertain you...

1163
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,473
Mmm-hmm.
Yes, it will.

1164
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,641
Okay.

(TURNS ON TV)

1166
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,813
Say, Mr. Ferrante,
you must have had

1167
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,982
some wonderful
experiences in Europe.

1168
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,233
Yes.

1169
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,612
Well, would you care
to expand that statement?

1170
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:32,821
No.

1171
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,490
(LAUGHS)
Oh.

1172
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,241
There are
so many questions...

1173
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:40,037
Oh, I forgot Ferrante
was on the same boat
with you, wasn't he?

1174
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,830
Yes, he was.

1175
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,082
Did you meet him?

1176
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,417
Mmm-hmm.

1177
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,711
Was he charming?

1178
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,921
Mmm-hmm.

1179
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,131
LOIS: Well, I'm sure
Nickie has all...

1180
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,466
Fascinating?

1181
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,635
LEWIS: Well, good...
Mmm-hmm.

1182

LEWIS: Well, you know,

Oh, I'm sorry.

1186
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,311
That wasn't like me.
I withdraw that remark.

1187
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,563
LOIS: That won't be one
of our difficulties.
(LEWIS LAUGHS)

1188
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:09,024
Well, tell me,
Mr. Ferrante,

1189
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,902
is this
your first experience
with connubial bliss?

1190
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,738
Would you mind
rephrasing the question?

1191
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,865
LOIS: (LAUGHING)
Darling! Darling!

1192
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,118
He means is this
your first experience
with marriage?

1193
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,537
Oh, that's what
he meant. Yes.

1194
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,458
Good. Do you intend
to support your wife
in the

1195
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,420
manner to which...

1196
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:30,587
Yes.

1197
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,881
(LAUGHING)
That's very funny.

1198
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,383
LOIS: Doing what?

1199
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,053
Well, I'm going to
begin to paint again.

1200
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,764
That's how I intend
to support my wife.

1201

LEWIS: Oh, well...

1202
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,729
That's certainly going to
take an awful lot of paint.

(LAUGHS)

1204
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,026
I mean, you already
have a house full
of masterpieces.

1205
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:56,029
Yes, we have
and I didn't realize
that you were going to...

1206
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,573
I'm still going
to paint.

Oh, really?

1208
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,493
Well, I mean,
I just thought you'd
given all that up.

1209
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,287
I know,
but I shouldn't have.

1210
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,874
Well, I'm sure Nickie
has all kinds of plans.

1211
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,250
Yes, I have.

1212

Well, good.
When are you going
to be married?

1213

We're going
to be married
as soon as we...

1214
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,132
Just a moment, dear.

gets him to the altar.

Well, good.

Miss Clark,

Mr. Ferrante.

that question again.

Did you find
Ferrante irresistible?

I know.
I know it doesn't.

You've got to
be realistic.

I think I'll...

I think I'll go back
to Boston

be able to support you.

have asked you
a long time ago.

who painted this,

01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,776
If you use
your own name...

1273
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,277
The old Ferrante
is dead

1274
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,279
and the new Rossi
is starving.

1275
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,075
What do you expect
in three months?

1276
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,995
Remember, the brush
obeys your hand.

1277
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,707
It doesn't know
you are accustomed to
getting your own way.

1278
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,920
You are spoiled,
but the brush
doesn't know this.

1279
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,547
He cannot humor you.

1280
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,509
I know, I know,
but I was hoping
you'd sell something.

1281
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,719
I want the thrill
of earning
that first dollar.

1282
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,554
Well, I'll have
to get a job.

1283
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,722
What?

1284
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,849
And give up painting?

1285
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:53,976
No, I'm not going
to give up painting.

1286
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,102
It's the only thing
I know.

1287
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,269
But I've got
to earn money.

1288
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,813
I've got to earn
a lot of it quickly.

1289
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,983
Of course,
in the meantime,
I'll buy you lunch.

1290
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,985
You can repay me
when you're famous.

1291
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,153
That's the first
encouraging thing
you've said.

1292
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,530
There you are.

1293
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,240
Isn't that extraordinary?

1294
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,326
Wouldn't you think
that's the one thing
I could remember?

1295
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,536
Yeah.
Hmm.

1296
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,248
Hmm. Oh, well...

1297
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,006
TERRY: (SINGING)
We'll be walking on clouds

1298
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,342
You'll forget every care

1299
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:31,430
And your troubles like bubbles

1300
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,683
Will vanish

1301
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:38,645
In air

1302
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:43,066
Ask me how do you get

1303
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:47,029
To Tomorrow Land

1304
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,948
Close your eyes

1305
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,159
Make a wish

1306
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:56,038
And you're there

1307
01:12:56,664 --> 01:13:00,459
Close your eyes

1308
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,962
Make a wish

1309
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:07,049
And you're

1310
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:11,011
There

1311
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,232
Nickie! Nickie!

1312
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:25,901
Hey!

1313
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,027
Hey!

1314
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,200
I have good news!
I sold one of your women.

1315
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,119
You know,
the one with
the uh-huh.

1316
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,581
I got $200 for her.

1317
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,626
Your first dollar!

1318
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,044
(LAUGHING)

1319
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,796
What's the matter
with you?

1320
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,591
My friend,
I'm a happy man.
I am a painter.

1321
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:53,386
So what? I've been
a painter for years,
but I ain't happy.

1322
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:54,805
Oh, well...

1323
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,937
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1324
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:04,773
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1325
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,983
As you know,
this is my last night

1326
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:09,528
so I would love to
sing a song for you

1327
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,446
that is very close
to my heart.

1328
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,533
(PIANO PLAYING
AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER)

1329
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:21,248
(SINGING) Our love affair

1330
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:25,919
Is a wondrous thing

1331
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:31,258
That we'll rejoice

1332
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:35,387
In remembering

1333
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,975
Our love was born

1334
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:44,855
With our first embrace

1335
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:49,860
And a page was torn

1336
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:55,740
Out of time and space

1337
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:01,079
Our love affair

1338
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:06,293
May it always be

1339
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:11,089
A flame to burn

1340
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:15,886
Through eternity

1341
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:20,432
So take my hand

1342
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:25,604
With a fervent prayer

1343
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,567
That we may live

1344
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,323
And we may share

1345
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:41,453
A love affair

1346
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:47,167
To remember

1347
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:55,383
A love affair

1348
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:02,724
To remember

1349
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,197
Did you fasten
your seat belt?

1350
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,823
Mmm-hmm.
It's fastened.

1351
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,409
There's the Empire
State Building.

1352
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,661
Thank you.

1353
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,423
Miss McKay, my dear.

1354
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,592
My favorite customer,
welcome back.

1355
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:38,760
Thank you.

1356
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,178
Miss Webb,
look who's back.

1357
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,388
Well, Miss McKay.

1358
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:44,099
We were just saying,
"Whatever happened
to Miss McKay?"

1359
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,226
And here you are.
(LAUGHS)

1360
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,560
How nice
you're looking.

1361
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,188
Mmm-hmm. Yes, I know,
I didn't get it here.

1362
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,148
Where have you been
these past months?

1363
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,275
In Boston.

1364
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:54,818
Oh. Well,
we've missed you.

1365
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,112
Oh, thank you.
I've missed you,
too, Miss...

1366
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:58,863
Lane.
Yes, Miss Lane.

1367
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,033
Now, Miss Lane,
I want something
very, very special for...

1368
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,535
Miss Webb will
be very happy

1369
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,453
to take care of you,
Miss McKay.

1370
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,539
Excuse me.
I have something
to do in the office.

1371
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,665
All right.

1372
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,752
Well, of course,
I'd be most happy
to take care of you.

1373
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,713
Now, what did you
have in mind?

1374
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:19,509
Well, I want something
irresistible,
inexpensive and pink.

1375
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,178
Oh, but, of course!
We have it.

1376
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:25,557
The most beautiful.
I've been hiding
it just for you.

1377
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,142
I tell you,
you give Miss McKay

1378
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,893
anything in the shop
she wants.

1379
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:31,271
But keep talking to her
until I get there,
will you?

1380
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,481
That's all we wanted
to know.

1381
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,735
Fine. Say, you weren't
worried about her credit,
were you?

1382
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,863
(LAUGHS)
I'm surprised at you.
Good-bye.

1383
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,327
This is adorable.

1384
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,037
Mmm. It's a little short,
isn't it?

1385
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,747
Oh. With these.
Oh, no.

1386
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,666
Oh, but look.
Look! Look!
This is a must.

1387
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:54,210
Yes, it's lovely,
but I just want

1388
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,879
the little item
I decided on.

1389
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,423
All right,
we'll send it.

1390
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,008
I'll have to let
you know where,

1391
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,885
because
I'm not quite sure.

1392
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,845
I believe that's right.

1393
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,430
No charge?

1394
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,390
No.
No?

1395
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:11,519
No. I know,
I know, but, no.

1396
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:14,689
Why, Ken!

1397
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,066
Terry.
How are you?

1398
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,818
What are you doing here?
How did you know I...

1399
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:23,281
Uh-huh, I see.
Nice doing business
with you.

1400
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,368
Oh, forgive me, Ken.
I'm terribly late.

1401
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:27,994
What time is it?

1402
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,038
It's five minutes
to 5:00.

1403
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,332
Oh! Oh, it's been good
seeing you, Ken.

1404
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,792
It's good seeing you,
too, Terry.

1405
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:34,918
There's so much to
talk to you about.

1406
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,920
I'm sorry,
but I'm in such a hurry.

1407
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,129
Can't we go someplace
and have a cocktail?

1408
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,339
No, I really am
in a hurry.

1409
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,548
But I have so much
to say to you.

1410
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:42,175
Why don't you
give me a call...

1411
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,969
You can't do that,
because I'm getting
marr...

1412
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,638
You're getting married?
Yes.

1413
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,848
Yes, I am, Ken,
and I'm very, very late.

1414
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,725
What time did
you say it was?
Four minutes to 5:00.

1415
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,060
Well, good-bye, Ken.

1416
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,353
Terry.

1417
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,939
I really hope
you've found happiness

1418
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,650
and if you're ever
in need of anything,

1419
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,528
like someone to love you,
don't hesitate to call me.

1420
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,406
No. No, I won't.
Good-bye, Ken.

1421
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,116
Good-bye.
Good luck.

1422
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,622
Shows what
a state I'm in.

1423
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,790
I thought the Empire
State Building

1424
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,500
was this way,
and, of course,
it's that way!

1425
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,594
I think I'll get out here,
because I'm in a hurry.

1426
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,304
Here you are.
Keep the change.

1427

Oh, well, we'll see.

1585
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,496
Oh, I see you've got
them all arranged.

1586
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:26,373
Come on.
Let me hear the worst.

1587
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:30,377
Six months' work.
You haven't wasted
your time, Nickie.

1588
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,504
Thank you.
Oh, you should have
seen the 50

1589
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:33,964
I dropped over
the cliff though.

1590
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,799
Maybe you should have
dropped this one, too.

1591
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,052
Yes, I'm inclined
to agree with you
about that one.

1592
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,678
You know, Nickie,
I can read

1593
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:41,222
your state of mind
when you painted this.

1594
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,765
Yeah?

1595
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:45,893
You were very sorry
for yourself when
you painted this one.

1596
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,436
That one was painted
in August.
Doesn't count.

1597
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,854
Mmm.

1598
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:53,108
You were angry here.
You were getting
over your broken heart.

1599
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:55,778
Broken heart?
Oh, that stuff's
not for me.

1600
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,029
I'm glad to hear that.

1601
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,572
Come on. Let's get
down to this end.
Come on.

1602
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,367
I'm coming to that.
I'm coming to that.

1603
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:08,249
Yeah, here, Nickie,
you became a painter.

1604
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,127
Thank you.
I'm not exactly ashamed
of that one myself.

1605
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:15,339
I had a great deal to say
and I painted it instead.

1606
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,008
Your being away,
alone, for a long time,

1607
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,010
has given you
that grasp of...

1608
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,262
(PHONE RINGING)

1609
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:22,805
I'll get it.
Remember where you were.

1610
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,598
I want to hear
more of that.

1611
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:27,518
Hello? Courbet's Paint
and Varnish Store.

1612
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:31,897
Nickie?
I read you arrived today.

1613
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:35,776
Lois, how nice.
How did you know
I was here?

1614
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:37,569
I called your hotel,
and they said

1615
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,280
you could be reached
at this number.

1616
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,950
Oh, Nickie, I've been
thinking about you
morning, noon and night

1617
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:44,868
and in-between times, too.

1618
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,871
I was wondering if
maybe you could...

1619
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,373
A-ha.

1620
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:53,419
Well, no, no,
I like the idea
all right.

1621
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:56,505
That's a nice offer,
but I don't think I can
make it this afternoon.

1622
01:33:56,631 --> 01:34:00,676
Well, if you
can't do that...
Oh, I wish you would.

1623
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:02,720
Mmm-mmm.

1624
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,724
Thanks anyway.
Nicest thing that's
happened today.

1625
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,267
Oh.

1626
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,894
But you could make
the show tonight.

1627
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,731
Well, I'll leave a ticket
at the box office anyway.

1628
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,483
Do try to make it.
And, Nickie...

1629
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:21,322
Whatever you do,
don't plan anything
for after the show, huh?

1630
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,615
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1631
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:51,685
I love our seats.

1632
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,978
What?

1633
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,689
I said
I love our seats.

(MUSIC STOPS)

1635
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,509
We enjoyed it
very much.

1636
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:24,676
Thank you
for asking us.

1637
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,929
Oh, it was a pleasure.
If you don't mind,

1638
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:28,472
Mr. Ferrante will
see me home.

1639
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,057
Very well.
Good night.
Good night.

1640
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,850
Good night.

1641
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:36,605
Now, where would
you like to go?

1642
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,315
Suppose you decide,
Nickie.

1643
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,566
After all,
this is your evening.

1644
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,778
I've been away so long
I have no idea where
people go nowadays.

(CHUCKLES)

1649

Terry, please
let me tell him.

1650
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:22,943
Oh, no. No.

1651
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:24,319
I'll go get him.

1652
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,655
No, please.
Please, Ken.

It's pretty rough.

The first time you're
able to get out

1656
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,206
and you have
to run into him.

1657
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,627
And all I could say
was "Hello."

(LAUGHS)

1659

Well, the show's over.

Boy got the girl.
Shall we go?

1661
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,685
I'll only be a minute.

1662
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:58,687
Yes.

1663
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:21,919
Good night, Lois,
and thank you.

1664
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,253
Taking you to
a show tonight

1665
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,547
wasn't a very
good idea, was it?

1666
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:27,799
Merry Christmas, Lois.

1667
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:32,137
Merry Christmas, Nickie,
and auf Wiedersehen.

1668
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:07,172
Oh, I think it's terrible
to have to take you home

1669
01:38:07,257 --> 01:38:09,466
just when
everyone else
is going out.

1670
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,389
C'est la vie,
et cetera.

1671
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,810
Terry, let me
ask you again.

1672
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,020
Why won't you
let me help you?

1673
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:25,399
All right then,
I will tell you again.

1674
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:27,901
Now, if you paid
for my getting well,
he wouldn't like it

1675
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,611
and if he didn't like it,
I wouldn't like it.

1676
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:30,862
Then if you did
get me well,

1677
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:32,781
and I went to him,
you wouldn't like it.

1678
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,700
But certainly
he ought to know.

1679
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:36,702
No, because
if he found out,

1680
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:38,870
he'd insist upon
doing it himself

1681
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:40,622
if he had the money,
which I doubt.

1682
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:44,042
And then if I
didn't get well...
Ooh! That'd be awful.

1683
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:47,087
No, unless I can
walk to him,

1684
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,257
and when I say walk,
I mean run,
he'll never know.

1685
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:54,052
Well, I'm fine.
I've got my job,
and I'm on a budget.

1686
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:58,265
If things come out right,
and then maybe if
I'm a very good girl,

1687
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,642
I'll get what I want
next Christmas.

1688
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:02,227
Follow?

1689
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:27,419

How are you feeling,
Miss McKay?

1692
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:34,217
Children, I have
bad news for you.

1693
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,887
Doctor won't let me
go with you.

1694
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,680
ALL: Oh!

1695
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,433
Doctor, I could be back
in a couple of hours.

1696
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,436
This is the Christmas
benefit.

1697
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,814
This is their first
public appearance.
This is my team.

1698
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,566
She's our coach, Doc.

1699
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,818
Norman, Doctor.

1700
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,946
She's our coach,
Doctor.

(CHUCKLES)

1702
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,575
If it wasn't good for her,
you wouldn't want
her to go, would you?

1703
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:00,535
CHILDREN: No!

1704
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,206
Well, look,
why don't you try it
without me, hmm?

1705
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,333
Mmm. Come on.

1706
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,335
The only thing
that would bother you
would be the start.

1707
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:10,003
Miss McKay?

1708
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:11,546
Yes, Tyrone?

1709
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,965
We'll be
thinking about you
while we're singing,

1710
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,009
hoping that you'll be
around okay real soon.

1711
01:40:16,386 --> 01:40:19,137
Oh, thank you, Tyrone.

1712
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,350
Wait a minute.
Where's Sally?

1713
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:24,893
Isn't she with us today?

1714
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:27,521
We took her off the team.
She sings too loud.

1715
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,398
She's a show-off.

1716
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:30,565
McGRATH: Sally thought
it was a joke,

1717
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,984
and she wanted so badly
to go on the stage.

1718
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,236
Oh.

1719
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,614
You come here,
darling.

1720
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,409
Now, you go
right up on the stage
with the rest of them.

1721
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,202
I'll put you back
on the team,

1722
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,038
but you must promise
not to drown out
the other children.

1723
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,873
All right, Miss McKay.

1724
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:49,292
Now, are we ready?
CHILDREN: Yes.

1725
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,128
All right.

1726
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:57,467
ALL: (SINGING)
There's a wonderful place

1727
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,971
Called Tomorrow Land

1728
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,723
Tomorrow Land

1729

And the moment you get

1732
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:17,279
To Tomorrow Land

1733

Today

1738
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:35,964
You'll forget every care

1739
01:41:36,048 --> 01:41:40,594
And your troubles like bubbles

1740
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:45,098
Will vanish in air

1741
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,270
Ask me how do you get

1742
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:53,398
To Tomorrow Land

1743
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,400
Tomorrow Land

1744
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:59,780
Close your eyes, make a wish

1745
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:04,367
And you're there

1746
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,370
Close your eyes

1747
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,873
Make a wish

1748
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:12,918
And you're

1749
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:15,545
There

1750
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,303
You're going to do
all right without me.

1751
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:26,139
All right, children.
We must go now.
Good-bye, Terry.

1752
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,767
Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, darling.
Run along.

1753
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,394
Merry Christmas!
Bless you.
(CHILDREN CLAMORING)

1754
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,438
Be good now.

1755
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,899
(LAUGHING)

1756
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:37,984
Oh.

1757
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,779
Merry Christmas!

1758
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:43,907
Oh! Merry Christmas,
darling!

1759
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,201
Merry Christmas!

1760
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:49,579
This isn't going to
be much of a Christmas
for you, is it?

1761
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,498
Oh, I'll be all right.

1762
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,833
There we are.

1763
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,709
Could you just
hand me my...
Yes, surely.

1764
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:56,336
Thank you so much.

1765
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,587
You're...

1766
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:01,383
You're welcome
to have turkey with
my husband and me.

1767
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:04,010
Oh, you save
a drumstick for me
for later, will you?

1768
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:05,846
All right, I will.
(CHUCKLES)

1769
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,765
And if there's
anything else you want,
just holler.

1770
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,767
Thank you so much.
I will.

1771
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,270
It was very sweet of you.
Merry Christmas.

1772
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:15,981
And a merry Christmas
to you, too.

1773
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:18,400
Does Miss McKay...

1774
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:27,826
Nickie?

1775
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,663
Hello, Terry.

1776
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,878
(STAMMERING) Oh,
it's good to see you.

1777
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:40,046
Oh, it's good
to see you, too.

1778
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,507
You feeling all right?

1779
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,467
(STAMMERING) Yes.
Yes. I'm fine.

1780
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:46,094
I'm just resting.

1781
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:48,013
Good, good. Good.

1782
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:51,099
Well, it's been
a long time.

1783
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:52,434
Yes, hasn't it?

1784
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,230
Well, it is good
to see you.

1785
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,481
You said that.

1786
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:00,567
May I...

1787
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,485
Oh, yes, please, do.
Sit down.

1788
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:07,073
I'll only be a minute.
I'm sure you don't mind.

1789
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:09,618
No, no, of course not.

1790
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:14,748
Oh, is this
the breathtaking view?

1791
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,501
Well, the altitude
bothered me.

1792
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,003
Yeah, yeah.

1793
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:29,721
Well, I'll bet
you're wondering
how I got here.

1794
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:33,099
Well, yes.
Yes, yes, I am.

1795
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:37,938
Well, I was looking
through a telephone book
for a man named McBride.

1796
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:41,483
And I came across
the name T. McKay.

1797
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,110
And I said to myself,

1798
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:47,364
"Now, could that
possibly be Terry McKay,
my old friend?"

1799
01:44:48,574 --> 01:44:49,908
And it was.

1800
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,284
Yes, yes.

1801
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:53,620
And then I said
to myself,

1802
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:57,457
"Well, now, I haven't been
very nice to Miss McKay.

1803
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,959
"After all,
I had an appointment

1804
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:02,379
"with her one day,
and I didn't keep it."

1805
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:06,967
You didn't keep...

1806
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,760
No.

1807
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:10,011
(LAUGHS)

1808
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:14,557
Well, so I said
to myself,

1809
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:17,018
I talk to myself
quite a lot these days,

1810
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:19,229
I said, "Well, that's
not a very nice way

1811
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,939
"to treat an old friend
like Miss McKay.

1812
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:23,108
"I must apologize
to Miss McKay."

1813
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,986
Don't you agree
when someone doesn't
keep an appointment

1814
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,612
they should apologize,
hmm?

1815
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:31,449
Yes. Oh, yes, I think
you're absolutely right.

1816
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:34,995
I... Well, I think
the least people could do

1817
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:39,416
is to say they're
sorry or something.

1818
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,419
So here I am.

1819
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,839
That's very sweet.

1820
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:47,924
I thought so.

1821
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:51,678
I've often wondered
about you.

1822
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,846
(LAUGHS)

1823
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,097
And how you were.

1824
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,265
Did you really?

1825
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,643
Yes, really.

1826
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:02,939
Well, I've often
thought about you, too.

1827
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:07,110
Then you weren't angry
because I wasn't there?

1828
01:46:07,445 --> 01:46:08,611
I mean, you must
have been at first.

1829
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:13,450
Well, yes.

1830
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:15,160
Yes, yes, I was.

1831
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,079
At first,
I was furious.

1832
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:21,750
I said,
"He can't do this to me.
Who does he think he is?"

1833
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:24,502
Hmm. How long
did you wait?

1834
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:26,337
I mean,
did you wait long?

1835
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,923
Well, let's...

1836
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:32,218
Well, yes. Yes,
I waited until about...

1837
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:33,511
Midnight.

1838
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:36,473
Oh.

1839
01:46:37,475 --> 01:46:38,975
And then what
did you do?

1840
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:43,313
Well, then I got
really mad. Mmm.

1841
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:46,483
Well, you can imagine,
standing up there
on the...

1842
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:48,568
Yes, in a thunderstorm.

1843
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,905
In a thunderstorm.

1844
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:56,493
Then what did you
say to yourself?

1845
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:01,289
Well, then I said,
"Go on home
and get tight."

1846
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,540
But you didn't
do that.

1847
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:03,708
Didn't I?

1848
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,336
No. Well...

1849
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:08,755
Maybe just
a little one

1850
01:47:09,215 --> 01:47:11,466
every hour
for about a month.

1851
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:13,426
Can you blame me?

1852
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:15,053
Oh, I should say not.

1853
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,598
The least I could have done
was to have sent you a note.

1854
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:21,184
Well, perhaps
by the time
you thought of it,

1855
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,311
you didn't know
where to reach me.

1856
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,689
But you swore if you ever
saw me again you'd ask.

1857
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,192
No. No.

1858
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,613
I remember we said
that if we could make it,
we'd be there.

1859
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,741
And if one of us
didn't show up,

1860
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,786
it would be for
a darn good reason.

1861
01:47:40,538 --> 01:47:41,871
Did we say that?

1862
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:44,249
Yes, that is exactly
what we said.

1863
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,042
Well, like what
for instance?

1864
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:50,088
So, there'll be no more
questions asked, I hope?

1865
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,341
(CHUCKLES)

1866
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:55,593
Would you like
a cigarette?

1867
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,554
(SIGHS) Thank you.

1868
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:00,598
Thank you, Nickie.

1869
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,813
Isn't that wonderful?

1870
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:09,899
I walked all
the way here just to...

1871
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,444
And now I'm not even
supposed to ask you
why you weren't there.

1872
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,782
Isn't it strange?

1873
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,618
We used to read
each other's thoughts.

1874
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,538
It's not the same,
is it?

1875
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,207
Not quite.
Hmm.

1876
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:29,252
It doesn't seem...
I know.

1877
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,591
I don't know
what happens to me.
Whenever I...

1878
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,887
No wedding ring, I see.

1879
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,681
No.

1880
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,016
Well, I thought
at the...

1881
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,059
Last night, the show?

1882
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,979
No, no.
He was just...

1883
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:50,106
No.

1884
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,944
I didn't mean
to offend you.

1885
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:59,073
How's everything
with you, Nickie?

1886
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,576
Oh, you can
ask questions?

1887
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,827
Mmm-hmm.

1888
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:04,287
(CHUCKLES)

1889
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:06,372
Well, I thought
everything was fine

1890
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:07,916
until I saw you
last night.

1891
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:11,169
Then I knew there must
be something between us,

1892
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,463
even if it's
only an ocean,

1893
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,131
so I bought myself
a ticket.

1894
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:20,136
Oh, you're sailing?

1895
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:22,138
Tonight.

1896
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:26,267
And you're happy,
aren't you?

1897
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,102
Yes, yes.

1898
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,230
And you?

1899
01:49:30,314 --> 01:49:31,439
I don't know.

1900
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:32,732
I'm worried
about the future.

1901
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,942
I don't know what
people will think.

1902
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:37,403
They'll say,
"There he goes,
the mad painter.

1903
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,989
"There's something
the matter with him.
He doesn't like women."

1904
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,200
Why would people
say that?
Why?

1905
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,910
Because he sails
the seven seas

1906
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,204
and to every woman
he meets he says,

1907
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:48,873
"Where will you be
in six months?"

1908
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,542
And they're there?
Everywhere.

1909
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,587
Tops of pyramids,
the domes of cathedrals,
the Eiffel Tower.

1910
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:56,673
He still tries to
keep them up high.

1911
01:49:56,966 --> 01:49:57,966
He keeps them waiting.

1912
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,009
Sure. Waiting,
waiting, waiting.

1913
01:50:00,094 --> 01:50:01,886
And where is he
all this time?

1914
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,474
Waiting.

1915
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,019
But you can't go on
like that.

1916
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:12,939
It isn't right for you.

1917
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,108
I wish I could say
you were wrong.

1918
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,318
I was once.

1919
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:21,739
How'd you like to
change the subject?

1920
01:50:21,824 --> 01:50:24,993
Yes, yes, I'd love to.
Merry Christmas.

1921
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:28,079
Oh, I almost forgot.

1922
01:50:29,415 --> 01:50:31,291
Now, six months ago,
who'd have thought

1923
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:32,792
we'd be spending
Christmas together

1924
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,419
in front of
a nice warm fire?

1925
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,212
I brought you a present.

1926
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:43,970
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry.
I don't have one for you.

1927
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:47,223
I didn't think
I'd be seeing you.

1928
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:49,100
That's all right.
I didn't expect one.

1929
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,893
That isn't really
a Christmas present.

1930
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,574
Oh, that's why
my letters came back.

1931
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:13,833
I would have
sent it to you,

1932
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:16,169
but I didn't know
your address until today.

1933
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:21,674
She wanted you to
have it, remember?

1934
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:28,473
So, well,
that's the reason I...

1935
01:51:40,652 --> 01:51:42,445
Good-bye, Terry.

1936
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:45,948
Good-bye, Nickie.

1937
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:58,628
(CLEARS THROAT)

1938
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:10,223
You know, I painted you
like that with the shawl.

1939
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:11,933
I wish you could
have seen it.

1940
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:14,060
Courbet said it was
one of my best.

1941
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,355
I didn't think I could
ever part with it.

1942
01:52:17,481 --> 01:52:21,025
But, well,
there was no reason to
keep it any longer, and...

1943
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:24,695
I couldn't take money for it,
because, well, you know...

1944
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,533
So, Courbet told me
a young woman

1945
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:31,619
came into the gallery,
and she liked it.

1946
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:33,746
She saw in it what
I'd hoped you'd see,

1947
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:36,874
so I told Courbet
to give it to her

1948
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:40,253
because he said
she didn't have
any money,

1949
01:52:40,337 --> 01:52:42,463
and not only that,
she was...

1950
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:46,968
She was...

1951
01:52:49,304 --> 01:52:51,681
Anyway, I told him
to give it to her.

1952
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:54,058
Courbet said
she wanted it
so badly

1953
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:55,893
and so I told him
to give it to her.

1954
01:52:55,978 --> 01:52:58,771
You know,
it's the Christmas season
and all that.

1955
01:52:58,856 --> 01:53:01,190
And you know me.
Holly in my heart.

1956
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:36,642
Darling, don't look
at me like that.

1957
01:53:41,607 --> 01:53:43,232
Why didn't you tell me?

1958
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,818
If it had to
happen to one of us,

1959
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,695
why did it have
to be you?

1960
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:50,907
Oh.

1961
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:55,745
It was nobody's fault,
but my own.

1962
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:57,455
(SNIFFLING)

1963
01:53:57,539 --> 01:53:59,582
I was looking up.

1964
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,002
It was the nearest thing
to heaven.

1965
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,756
You were there.

1966
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:10,843
Oh, darling, don't...

1967
01:54:10,928 --> 01:54:13,012
Don't worry, darling.

1968
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:16,057
If you can paint,
I can walk.

1969
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:19,519
Anything can happen.
Don't you think?

1970
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:22,939
Yes, darling, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

1971
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,074
CHORUS: (SINGING)
Our love affair

1972
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:37,453
