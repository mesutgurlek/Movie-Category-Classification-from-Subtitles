1
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,936
Anne.

2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,177
Mary.

3
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,347
Wait.

4
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,748
Wait for me.

5
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,758
<i>I received a request</i>
<i>for marriage today...</i>

6
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,227
<i>... for Anne from the Carey family.</i>

7
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,958
<i>William, their eldest son.</i>

8
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,692
Oh, that's wonderful.

9
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,135
I turned it down.
Offered them Mary instead.

10
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,001
Mary.

11
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,738
<i>Everyone improves the standing</i>
<i>of their family with their daughters.</i>

12
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,677
I think Anne can do a lot better
than a merchant's son.

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,844
And Mary can't?

14
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,947
- I think you underestimate her.
- No, no, that's not true.

15
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,724
I think she's the kinder of the two,
quite possibly the fairer.

16
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,164
To get ahead in this world,
you need more than fair looks...

17
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,629
...and a kind heart.

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,825
I'll beat you, I'll beat you.

19
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,560
Hey.

20
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,611
Well done, Anne.
Well done, children.

21
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,376
You look... You look adequate.

22
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,820
Not too adequate, I hope.
This is our sister's day.

23
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,586
One wouldn't want to outshine her.

24
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,301
Mary, may we come in?

25
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,507
Look at you.

26
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,639
Younger than me.
More beautiful than me.

27
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,778
Married before me. I'm eclipsed.
I'm the other Boleyn girl.

28
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,457
Hardly.

29
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,856
So is this it, Mrs. Carey?

30
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,156
Do we...?
Do we lose you now, forever?

31
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,664
No, never. I'll be married, that's all.

32
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,700
Apart from that,
it won't change a thing.

33
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:37,807
Come, George, let's leave our sister.
She needs to make herself pretty.

34
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,454
Was it a boy?

35
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,527
Stillborn, Your Majesty.

36
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,045
No brother for you
to make this country safe.

37
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,979
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,887
Tell His Majesty.

39
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,636
Your Majesty.

40
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,539
Your Majesty.

41
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,375
I'm so sorry.

42
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,190
Are you happy?

43
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,728
I am.

44
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,962
You don't wish you'd married
someone grander? With a title?

45
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,169
I want a husband who loves me.

46
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,276
Who thinks it first thing every morning
and last thing at night.

47
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,071
Then you have found the right man.

48
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,510
He continues to stare.

49
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,587
- Who?
- Henry Percy.

50
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,350
Well, why ever
would he interest you?

51
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,391
What could you want
with the sole heir...

52
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,358
...to the richest landowner
in England?

53
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,055
Oh, I had no knowledge of that.
I simply like his face.

54
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,256
Oh, really?

55
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,163
- Well, he's betrothed.
- Betrothed is not married.

56
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,672
It's a long journey
from bended knee to the altar.

57
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,810
- Sister.
- Hello, brother.

58
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,180
Thomas.

59
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,821
- A proud day for you.
- Yes.

60
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,758
How is His Majesty?

61
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,418
These are difficult times, Thomas.

62
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,999
The king and queen,
once happily married...

63
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,895
...now barely speak.

64
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,662
The failure to provide a male heir
has consumed them.

65
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:57,040
The queen has lost yet another child,
a boy.

66
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,971
I imagine it won't be long before
he seeks solace with a mistress.

67
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,850
I've given it some thought
and wondered...

68
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,418
...which Howard girl
I can place under his nose.

69
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,758
You imagine the riches and influence
that would give us?

70
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,861
If we could help the king
with this delicate matter?

71
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,188
What about Anne?

72
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:26,638
I realize, as a Boleyn,
she's not officially a Howard...

73
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,398
...but as your sister's daughter.

74
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,943
But, Thomas, she's your first born,
and your favorite.

75
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,077
Wouldn't you prefer her to have
a simple, uncomplicated marriage?

76
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,274
Like Mary?

77
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,886
If Anne were a simple,
uncomplicated girl like Mary...

78
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,182
...l'd say yes. But she's not.

79
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,050
She's anything but.

80
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,465
Are you afraid?

81
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,206
A little.

82
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,308
I should be able to tell you
how it will be tonight.

83
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,717
Give you advice on what to do.

84
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,923
I've failed you as an elder sister.

85
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,757
No one could wish
for a better sister.

86
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,512
And tell me everything
in the morning.

87
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,712
- I promise.
- No details spared.

88
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,149
Lie back.

89
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,017
- Anne.
- Father.

90
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,123
Uncle.

91
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,494
You asked to see me.

92
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,323
An opportunity has arisen.

93
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,624
An opportunity in which,
were you to succeed...

94
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,324
...you could secure for yourself
and for this family...

95
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,197
...incalculable wealth and position.

96
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,964
There is a strain
on the king's marriage.

97
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,838
In such circumstances, a man
sometimes seeks comfort elsewhere.

98
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,502
Because of your uncle's friendship
with His Majesty...

99
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,013
...we're alone in knowing this.
It won't be long...

100
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,674
...before the other families
discover the truth...

101
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,252
...and parade their daughters
under his nose.

102
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,186
Before watching somebody else profit,
we would sooner have...

103
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,757
What?

104
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,986
- Have me bed him instead?
- No, that... That's not...

105
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,596
Yes.

106
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,929
Exactly.

107
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,274
The favor he would bestow upon us...
I mean upon you, if he liked you.

108
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:54,470
To be mistress of the king of England
is by no means to diminish yourself.

109
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,274
And after he's finished with me?

110
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,417
My reputation and prospects
will be ruined.

111
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,608
On the contrary.

112
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,546
Under such circumstances,
when the time came...

113
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,249
...to find you a husband, it would
be a marquis or a duke at least.

114
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,894
Will you accept the challenge?

115
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,636
Don't resist this.

116
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,145
The king and his retinue
will spend two nights here next month.

117
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,181
Your brother has arranged it.
It's done.

118
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,286
Well, I don't like it.
It'll cost a fortune to get this house...

119
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,946
...ready for a royal visit.
It's money we can't afford.

120
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,592
And what if he doesn't like her?

121
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,161
And what if you were to look
on the bright side, just once?

122
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,890
Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
Anne understands that.

123
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,729
Anne understands nothing.
She's just a child.

124
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,862
Tell me, when was it that people
stopped thinking of ambition as a sin...

125
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,031
...and started thinking of it
as a virtue?

126
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,068
That's easy for you to say.

127
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,510
You've had position
and wealth all your life.

128
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:09,011
Until I married you, Thomas.
And I was happy to give it up for love.

129
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,520
So how was it, the wedding night?

130
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,122
It was very satisfactory.

131
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,066
Really? William Carey,
a good lover.

132
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,727
Yes.

133
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,102
Oh, God. He was in rather a hurry.

134
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,303
- And he snores.
- No.

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,176
He got up in the middle of the night
and used a pisspot...

136
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,910
...by the side of the bed.
It was awful.

137
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,314
No.

138
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,559
I also have something to tell you.

139
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,991
Last night,
our father put his trust in me...

140
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,723
...and gave me a commission.

141
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,923
Tell, tell.

142
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,799
To divert the king.

143
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,438
The king of England himself,
on his visit.

144
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,164
Divert him?

145
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,675
Divert him. Beguile him.
Enchant him.

146
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,009
He has a wife.

147
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,706
I know.
But who knows what could happen?

148
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,149
If he liked me,
I'd be married off to a duke.

149
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,953
I could be a happy duchess.

150
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,390
The king.

151
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,293
The king.

152
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,331
The king will be here betimes.

153
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,161
- The king.
- Look alive.

154
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,030
The king.

155
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,399
To your places.

156
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,304
Come on, set to, everyone.
The king.

157
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,606
Take the horses to the yard
and prepare.

158
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,041
Where's the spit boy?
Where is he?

159
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,653
Get over here.

160
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,154
Do you think he'll like me?

161
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,362
Course he will, sister.

162
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,357
How could he not?

163
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,502
Sir Thomas.

164
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,908
Your Majesty.
You're most welcome.

165
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,774
Lady Elizabeth.

166
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,814
May I present my daughter, Anne.

167
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,012
A daughter?
No one said anything of a daughter.

168
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,589
Had we known,
we might have come sooner.

169
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,955
Your Majesty.

170
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,759
Anne, Anne.
Go to bed, get a good night's rest.

171
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,628
Tomorrow there's the hunt.
You must excel at that.

172
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,327
Everything depends upon it.

173
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,689
Good morning, Anne.

174
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,126
Good morning, Your Grace.

175
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,594
- Who will you ride with?
- On my own, Your Grace.

176
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,032
On your own?

177
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,173
There's a new saddle now
which allows this.

178
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,678
But with no man to hold on to...

179
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,814
...how do you propose
to stay on the horse?

180
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,380
As you do, Your Grace.

181
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,510
With my thighs.

182
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,719
Away.

183
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,987
What's keeping them?

184
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,325
Where are they?

185
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,262
Is someone hurt?

186
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,866
My God, it's the king.

187
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,039
The king? What? What happened?

188
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,243
The stag went into the woods
and led us to the deep ravine.

189
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,977
Everyone was prepared to concede
defeat and let the animal go.

190
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,012
Except Anne.

191
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,488
Oh, no. What?
She knows that ravine.

192
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,150
She must have ridden it
a thousand times.

193
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,295
What, and the king followed,
and then he fell?

194
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,634
Oh, Lord.

195
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,446
- What happened?
- He fell.

196
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,378
He's in some pain.

197
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,417
Although I suspect
his pride is hurting rather more.

198
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,115
It was my fault.

199
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,280
- Anne.
- How could I?

200
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,289
Fetch Mary to me, would you?

201
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,105
And who are you?

202
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,173
Mary, Your Grace.

203
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,644
Anne's sister.

204
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,154
You've been here all the time?

205
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,730
How could I have overlooked you?

206
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,365
Next to Anne, it's easy to do.

207
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,974
And you're married.

208
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,584
Yes, Your Grace, to William Carey.

209
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,918
Then why haven't I seen you at court?

210
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,386
Because I've persuaded him
to spend a year or two here first.

211
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,087
We have a small manor.

212
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,288
Nothing much,
but enough to start a family.

213
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,392
Charmed life in the country,
away from it all.

214
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,661
Yes.

215
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,735
You don't think he'll miss court?
A young ambitious man.

216
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,072
He says not, Your Majesty.

217
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,873
But if he ever changed his mind...

218
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,676
...as his wife, of course,
I would do his bidding.

219
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,759
Lady Elizabeth, thank you.

220
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,334
Sir Thomas.

221
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,443
You will take care of that matter?

222
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,578
Yes, of course.
Of course, Your Majesty, thank you.

223
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,274
Mary, you've obviously made
a deep impression on the king.

224
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,246
He's requested that you come to court
with immediate effect.

225
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:44,583
The king has secured for you,
a position in the queen's household.

226
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,858
But I don't want to go to court.
Nor does my husband.

227
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,933
The king has also
offered me a position...

228
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,268
...as a gentleman
of the Privy Council.

229
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,170
Do you hear that, Mary?
Privy Council.

230
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,674
Attending upon His Majesty himself.

231
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,976
The inner sanctum.

232
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,978
What about our future
in the country?

233
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,549
Oh, you must put that
out of your mind.

234
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,447
From now on, your future is at court.

235
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,679
William, please.

236
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,915
Don't you understand
what this means? They'll separate us.

237
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,289
Put me in different accommodation,
where the king can always find me.

238
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:29,362
Happily, your husband understands
the value of such an opportunity.

239
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,229
For us all.

240
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,642
What about Anne?
Couldn't she go instead?

241
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,038
Anne?

242
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,181
The way Anne has behaved,
she's fortunate to be coming at all.

243
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,122
Mother, please, speak to Father.

244
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,124
Do something. I don't want to go.

245
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,528
This is not a request.
We have been summoned.

246
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,830
Please don't be angry with me.

247
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,338
You think I desire to go
for this purpose?

248
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,376
All I know is that a man
that didn't know who you were...

249
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,979
...was with you in that room
for half an hour...

250
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,341
...and came out besotted.

251
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,849
I don't know what you said or did.

252
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,383
Nothing, sister.

253
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,885
Except sing your praises
and talk about my husband.

254
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:27,616
Really? Well, you must show me
how you did that some time.

255
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,608
- Mary Carey, Your Majesty.
- Who?

256
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,838
Your new lady-in-waiting
and her sister Anne.

257
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,475
Really?
I wasn't aware I was expecting one.

258
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,712
Appointed by His Majesty the king.

259
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,589
By my husband? Really?

260
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,229
Well...

261
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,458
...then she must be some kind of
gift or surprise.

262
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,938
He must have seen in her some talent
he knew would please me.

263
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,808
Tell me.

264
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,444
What special talent is it
that you have...

265
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,104
...apart from your
obvious youth and beauty?

266
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,476
I<i>...</i>

267
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,956
- Poetry, perhaps?
- No.

268
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,720
- Or dressmaking?
- No.

269
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,331
- Singing then, surely?
- No, Your Majesty.

270
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:18,526
Come, you're too modest.
Sing for us.

271
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,033
- Really, I beg you.
- Sing.

272
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,074
Bravo.

273
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,786
A nightingale.

274
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,449
Welcome at court.

275
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,034
Mary? Stop.

276
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,127
Mary? Stop.

277
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,395
That can't have been easy for you.

278
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,633
But put yourself in the queen's shoes.
She knows the only reason...

279
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,973
...the king has asked you here
is because he desires you.

280
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,614
She's a good woman, trust me.

281
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,184
Jane Parker.

282
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,853
It's embarrassing.

283
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,483
Look, she has her eye on you.

284
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,217
Sweet Jane Parker would be a match
to please our father.

285
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,554
Oh, vile girl.

286
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,630
She's the most ambitious little serpent
at court.

287
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,190
She can't stop watching.

288
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,082
How are you, Stafford?

289
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,980
I'm well, thank you.

290
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,946
I'm not sure I'm one for court life.

291
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,883
I'm a little homesick.

292
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,553
Well, you and I both.

293
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,927
Now, in my view it...
It changes people.

294
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,830
And not necessarily for the better.

295
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,597
Your sister, though, is thriving.

296
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,537
She's truly caught the eye
of Henry Percy.

297
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:15,668
Why does she do this?
He's already taken.

298
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,229
Tonight.

299
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,958
My little sister.
My little golden sister.

300
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,899
My milk-and-honey sister.

301
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,433
It should be you in my place.

302
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,438
Don't concern yourself with me.

303
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,939
I'll make my own way.

304
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,476
Shall I walk with you?

305
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,174
No need.

306
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,948
Try to please him. If you can.

307
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,286
Your Grace.

308
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,185
Come in.

309
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,860
Can I bring you something?

310
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,529
No.

311
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,310
Anything to ease your comfort
or well-being?

312
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,713
Perhaps you might ask your servants
to bring me some water.

313
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,318
Please.

314
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,966
There. There are no servants.

315
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,538
So this is it?

316
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,275
Where the king of England sleeps.

317
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,969
And reads and writes.

318
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,378
Finds a few moments each day
for himself.

319
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,814
And yet you invite me here?

320
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,690
Because I like you and trust you.

321
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,757
You hardly know me.

322
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:22,229
I'm lied to a hundred times a day.
Petitioned, lobbied.

323
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,360
One learns how to decipher a face.
And yours is as the sun.

324
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,006
One shouldn't gaze too long.

325
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,844
My flattery,
it makes you uncomfortable.

326
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,683
Because compliments in your family
are usually for someone else.

327
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,477
The elder sister.

328
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,785
That's something I understand.
What it is to be the second child.

329
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,991
Forever in the shadows.

330
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,505
I'm making you uncomfortable
again.

331
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,255
- Morning.
- Stafford.

332
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,450
Morning.

333
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,528
I have orders
to bring you to your father.

334
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,496
Better not keep him waiting.

335
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,138
Well?

336
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,744
Did he have you?

337
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,520
Yes.

338
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,559
More than once?

339
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,265
You better get used
to talking about it.

340
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,368
When you sleep with the king,
it ceases to be a private matter.

341
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,939
Yes, more than once.

342
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,767
And was he satisfied?

343
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,074
- I believe so.
- Did he say so?

344
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,308
He did not need to, uncle.

345
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,450
Well, you may go.

346
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,723
Good.

347
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,494
Now our work begins.

348
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,696
It's one thing to catch a king,
quite another to keep him.

349
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,468
She must be well-read,
know her music, excel in company...

350
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,135
...and she must be clean.

351
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:32,180
- Anne will see to it.
- See to what?

352
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,511
Mary is already all of these things.

353
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,381
Thanks to the education
I have given her.

354
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,388
And for what?
That she may be traded like cattle...

355
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,026
...for the advancement
and amusement of men?

356
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,095
Sister, you may leave us also.

357
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,971
Katherine of Aragon
will never give Henry Tudor a son.

358
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:03,774
But if Mary could give him a child,
and that child could be a boy<i>...</i>

359
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,876
If I gave your husband an assignment
that took him away from court...

360
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,313
...would you object?

361
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,858
I would not presume
to interfere in affairs of state.

362
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,112
- Amen.
- Amen.

363
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,620
"My heart and I surrender themselves
into your hands."

364
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,127
It's Anne.

365
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,664
She's married Henry Percy.

366
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,102
Wedded and bedded
without telling anyone.

367
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,766
You... You don't look pleased.

368
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,033
Why would I be pleased?

369
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,610
Well, it will make her the future
Duchess of Northumberland.

370
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,180
- Our sister.
- George, they'll never allow it.

371
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,340
He's already precontracted
to Mary Talbot.

372
00:40:54,518 --> 00:41:00,013
If this gets out, it will damage her.
Her reputation will be ruined.

373
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:04,218
I have to tell Father.
For her own protection.

374
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,425
What were you thinking?

375
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,897
The marriage of a senior noble
is a matter of the state.

376
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,502
Something only the king can decide.

377
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,537
Who else knows about this?

378
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,073
- No one.
- Good.

379
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,540
Well, that's how it will remain.
Forever.

380
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,544
But you cannot undo
what has been done before God.

381
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:24,908
And consummated too.

382
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:31,047
There have been
improper intimacies?

383
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,384
I have lain with my husband.

384
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:38,525
- There's nothing improper about it.
- By God, if you were my daughter.

385
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,960
The boy will return
to Northumberland...

386
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:45,067
...where he will marry the Talbot girl,
as arranged.

387
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,807
You will be sent to France
and stay there...

388
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,748
...until you have learned your lesson.
- What?

389
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,285
No.

390
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,746
Father, please.

391
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,086
How can you have done this?
You knew full well...

392
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,457
...Mary's friendship with the king
is at an extremely delicate stage.

393
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,930
Any scandal, any mark upon her name
could be fatal.

394
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,228
You will join the court
of the French queen...

395
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,372
...and stay there
until your father has forgiven you.

396
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,037
You told them, didn't you?

397
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,149
It was for your own good.
You never would have got away with it.

398
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,308
It would have ruined your
prospects forever.

399
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,919
For my good?

400
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,079
Well, I'll try to remind myself of that
while I'm in exile.

401
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,157
And you're here in the king's bed...

402
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,760
...not challenged
for our father's affection...

403
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,193
...that is was for my good
and not yours.

404
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,991
Anne.

405
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,166
You would be wise
to regard this as an opportunity.

406
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,007
You are educated.
It's a chance I never had.

407
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,780
Now go to France.
The queen of France is sophisticated.

408
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,943
Be useful to her, amuse her.
She'll admire your spirit.

409
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,985
Learn from her.

410
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,716
Observe the ladies of the court.
See how they achieve...

411
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,293
...what they want from their men,
not by stamping their little feet...

412
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,829
...but by allowing the men to believe
that they, indeed, are in charge.

413
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,401
That is the art of being a woman.

414
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,807
Still shut, keep them shut.
Careful, careful.

415
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,374
All right, now open.

416
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,079
I am to become an earl,
your brother a viscount.

417
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,348
In addition, we have received
a number of new grants and estates.

418
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,991
So our debts are paid, and more.

419
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:34,062
George, the king will arrange a match
between you and Jane Parker.

420
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,068
I beg you, Father, no.

421
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,833
I thought you had ambitions
for this family?

422
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:45,500
The girl's well connected.
Her father is cousin to the king.

423
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,405
Must I actually marry her?

424
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,308
Of course you must marry her.
Have you no pride?

425
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,279
Or would you rather
leave everything to Mary?

426
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,846
No, sir.

427
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,469
It'll be a wedding
attended by the king of England...

428
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:17,300
...with all the greatest
lords of the land.

429
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,305
Would a smile be too much to ask?

430
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,001
What's there to smile about?

431
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,273
I'm a mother with one child
ordered to marry a girl he hates...

432
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,314
...another banished abroad
in disgrace...

433
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:32,285
...and a third,
whoring in public with an adulterer.

434
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,889
You say you're concerned
for her happiness.

435
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,391
Will Mary be happy
when he leaves her?

436
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,655
Because you know
that will happen in the end.

437
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,355
Only God knows
how anything will end.

438
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,162
God? He turned his back
on all this a long time ago.

439
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,897
And these rooms, our new position?
Does none of my work please you?

440
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:56,308
These gifts, this favor
will go as swiftly as it came.

441
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,971
These rooms once belonged
to the duke of Buckingham...

442
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,848
...the king's closest friend.
His head now rots on a spike.

443
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,147
He committed treason.

444
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,721
Treason? What is treason?

445
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,326
Anything the king or his lawyers
decide it to be.

446
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,291
On a whim.

447
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,140
The baby lives.

448
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,511
She's not miscarried.

449
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,945
But for the sake of the child...

450
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,083
...she must begin her lying-in,
immediately.

451
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,755
<i>Now that Mary is lying-in,</i>
<i>the king will no longer bed her.</i>

452
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,030
Out of compassion, he'll visit her
every day for, what, a week?

453
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,032
The queen
will have his head spinning...

454
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,966
...with pretty little Spanish things.

455
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,200
Not to mention the Seymours
and that milky-faced girl of theirs.

456
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,707
We must influence him in our favor
with whatever means we have.

457
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,444
Yes?

458
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,516
Well, l...

459
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,184
- I was going to suggest Anne.
- You couldn't control that girl last time.

460
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,124
What makes you think
a couple months...

461
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,696
...in France
have made any difference?

462
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:34,729
I receive regular reports
from the dowager queen.

463
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,034
It seems that she's quite changed.

464
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,050
<i>And so you must return</i>
<i>as your uncle bids.</i>

465
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,712
<i>You are to entertain the king...</i>

466
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:55,016
<i>... and keep his mind on Mary</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

467
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,719
<i>That is your task and no more.</i>

468
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,920
What's the noise?

469
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,559
It's Mistress Boleyn, Your Grace.
Her stories of life at the French court.

470
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,931
I'm aware of one Boleyn girl.

471
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,028
But she's lying-in
with a certain child in her belly.

472
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,442
Well, Boleyn girl...

473
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:48,572
...show your face.

474
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,318
What's so amusing?

475
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:03,186
I was merely offering my thoughts
on the new French king.

476
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,922
Who has such great power,
yet such meager authority as a man.

477
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,230
- Continue.
- His pettiness is astounding.

478
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,168
He will bear a mortal grudge
over the mildest of slights.

479
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,004
Spoiled cub with a spike in its paw.
Riven with resentment.

480
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,739
Unable to forgive or forget.

481
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,649
A great king...

482
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:32,344
...a great man,
rises above such things.

483
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,782
And what would you know
of great men?

484
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,489
I've read enough books
and heard enough talk...

485
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:44,066
...to believe I'd know one
if he were before me.

486
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:49,467
Then look about you.
I'm curious. Do you see one here?

487
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,809
Looking, my lord.

488
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,209
Still looking, my lord.

489
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,685
There. Found one.

490
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:13,289
So forgiveness, you say,
makes a man great. What else?

491
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,432
Generosity.

492
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,363
Humility.

493
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,831
The ability to recognize
his match in others...

494
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,563
...and not be threatened by it.

495
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,636
- His match in other men?
- Women too.

496
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,073
You believe that?

497
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,714
That women can be
the match of men?

498
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,976
It's a question women have asked
themselves for some time.

499
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,985
But we concede
men do have some value.

500
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,089
So we accept them as equal.

501
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,321
I find you much changed,
Mistress Anne.

502
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,492
Then my prayers
have been answered.

503
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,335
Welcome back at court.

504
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,436
My lord.

505
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,778
What?

506
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,211
I suppose he felt that
she'd been banished long enough.

507
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,642
But in whose interest
do they imagine she'll act?

508
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,184
Certainly not mine.

509
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,254
Why do they make this room
such a dungeon?

510
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,593
Does it have to be this dark?

511
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,705
- Where were you?
- Just visiting Mary.

512
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,574
As ever.

513
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,143
Well, now that Anne's back,
you can be doubly jealous.

514
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,815
I'm your wife.

515
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,017
You never lie with me.

516
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,469
Yes, it has.

517
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,001
I hope you know what you're doing.

518
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,447
These are vagabonds who'll stop
at nothing to take your money.

519
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,084
We're not gambling, Your Grace.

520
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,016
Mistress Boleyn
is reading our fortunes.

521
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,583
Read mine.

522
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,122
Another talent picked up in France?

523
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,826
The queen offers her ladies
a broad education.

524
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,266
Last I heard, she was entertaining
Lutherans and heretics.

525
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:41,007
Scholars and philosophers, my lord,
escaping persecution.

526
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,236
- I hope you kept your ears shut.
- I did.

527
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:48,441
And a cross close to my heart
at all times.
